Florida: West Nile virus identified in alligators for the first time
--------------------------------------------------------------------
GAINESVILLE: University of Florida researchers have identified West Nile
virus in 3 Florida alligators, the first time the disease has been observed
in the North American species. State public health veterinarian Lisa Conti
confirmed on Tue 12 Nov 2002 that the three farm-raised alligators tested
positive for the illness last month.
Officials at Clabrook Farm Inc. in Orange County said hundreds of
alligators being raised there have died suddenly in the last 4 years, and
now they suspect West Nile was at least partially to blame. "We thought
maybe somebody was poisoning them," farm co-owner Kobi Kagen said. "But it
was not affecting all of the pens. It's strange. It's strange and very sudden."
Kagen said he's aware of many other farms which have experienced similar
sudden-death problems with its alligators. It remains unclear what effect,
if any, the findings will have on the state's alligator farming industry.
Local, state, and federal epidemiologists are continuing their
investigation, Conti said.

[This is the first report of West Nile virus infection in a reptile in the
USA. The nature of the diagnostic tests are not stated. Presence of
antibody might indicate no more than exposure to the mosquito vector.
Isolation of virus from sick animals would be necessary to substantiate any
association between West Nile virus infection and disease. - Mod.CP]

Florida: West Nile virus found in farmed alligators
---------------------------------------------------
MIAMI: Epidemiologists found West Nile virus in 3 farm-raised Florida
alligators, marking the first time the potentially deadly virus has been
found in a US reptile species, health officials said on Wednesday. They
also said there was little chance of contracting West Nile disease by
eating the meat of an infected alligator because cooking destroys the
heat-sensitive virus.
But state officials were still trying to gauge the potential impact on
Florida's 21 commercial alligator farms, which produced 25 200 hides and
190 600 pounds (85 770 kg) of meat in 2001. Researchers from the University
of Florida confirmed that the virus was present in 3 alligators sent from a
commercial farm in central Florida's Orange County, said Lisa Conti, the
state's public health veterinarian. The tests were conducted after an
unusual spate of deaths at the farm. "We would encourage alligator farmers
that have animals that may act like they have neurological signs to have
them tested for West Nile virus infection," Conti said. "We don't know to
what extent this would cause large outbreaks of illness or death in these
animals."
The virus previously has been found in [humans], birds, horses, and
squirrels, but the central Florida case marks the first time it [has been]
found in alligators in the United States, state and federal health
officials said. "We have a lot to learn about the natural history of West
Nile virus in alligators at this point," Conti said. Epidemiologists
surmise that the tough-skinned reptiles got the virus the same way humans
and other animals do -- from the bite of infected mosquitoes. Asked if
humans could contract the virus from the bite of an infected alligator,
Conti said, "I think they'd probably be much worse off from the general
trauma."
