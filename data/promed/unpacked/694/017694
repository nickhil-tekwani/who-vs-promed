An outbreak of 50 cases of leptospirosis reported 8 days ago is of
concern to health authorities in the province of Manabi (Olmedo).
The authorities fear an increase in cases because heavy rains have
increased the existence of standing water pools. Cattle drivers wade
though standing waters during their activities. Children play and
bathe in urine-contaminated water pools and canals. A resident
indicated that the local population was not aware that the bacteria
could be transmitted through cattle. After the cases became known to
authorities (on 10 Feb 2003), a containment area was established and
patients are being treated. In 2002 in the province, 180 cases of
leptospirosis were reported.

[An upswing in leptospirosis cases in Ecuador from 1998 was
previously posted on ProMED (see below) and was first contributed by
Dr. Ottolenghi as well. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that infects
humans via contact with the animal reservoir (rodents, cattle,
canines) or via contact with a contaminated environment such as
water, soil, or sewage. - Mod.LL]
