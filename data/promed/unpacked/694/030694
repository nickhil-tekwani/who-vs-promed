Etiology of deaths in Maua remain unknown
Tests conducted at Adolfo Lutz Institute discard hantavirus infection
-----------------------
The 3 deaths from an unidentified disease in Maua in Grande Sao Paulo were
not due to hantavirus infection. Testing conducted by the Adolfo Lutz
Institute discarded this hypothesis. This information was reported by the
State Secretariat of Health.
The first 2 deaths occurred last Thursday. The 3rd death occurred on
Saturday. All of the cases, who lived in the same house, presented with
symptoms of headache and fever, which then evolved into body and abdominal
pains, diarrhea, vomiting, lightheadedness (giddiness), skin rash ["skin
spots"] and acute hemorrhage -- similar to those seen with hantavirus
infection.
3 examinations conducted on blood and viscera of the cases were negative
for hantavirus infection, according to the State Secretary of Health. The
Adolfo Lutz Institute will conduct new examinations to evaluate the
possibility that the deaths were due to leptospirosis, spotted fever, or
toxic exposure [poisoning]. The results of the new testing should be
available within 2 weeks.
The Secretary of Health clarified that there have not been additional cases
related to these deaths that have occurred in Maua, thereby reducing the
risk that there is an outbreak or epidemic. Some individuals were taken to
hospitals in the region with symptoms of fever and body pains, but all have
recovered without major problems. The 3 deaths occurred in the same
residence and are an isolated situation according to official
communications from the Sao Paulo government.

[As discussed in the prior posting, the diagnosis of hantavirus infection
was lower down on the differential diagnosis due to the absence of
pulmonary symptomatology. Brazilian spotted fever (Rocky Mountain Spotted
Fever - RMSF) has been reported from Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais (see Rocky
mountain spotted fever - Brazil (Sao Paulo) 20030725.1814). The reported
mortality in untreated cases of RMSF is 25 percent. In the absence of
additional cases, the observed case fatality rate in this cluster is 100
percent.
It is curious that a toxic exposure is also being speculated, but it is
consistent with the observation that the 3 deaths came from the same
household without additional deaths or cases elsewhere in the
community. The conclusion that the 3 deaths were an isolated event is
based on lack of identification of additional cases compatible with the
case definition provided in the newswires.
On one hand, there has been the not unusual wave of panic in the affected
zone, resulting in the presentation of febrile illnesses to the health care
providers with concerns that they had the same "mystery" disease. On the
other hand, it is less than one week since the cluster of cases was
identified, so it may be a bit premature to conclude there are no
additional cases. We await further information on results of additional
epidemiologic and laboratory investigations. - Mod.MPP]
