SARS-CoV-2 in animals (inf. with), Sweden
-----------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Started: [19 Aug 2021]
Confirmed: [19 Aug 2021]
Reported: 30 Aug 2021
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Event morbidity (%): 0.01
Event mortality (%): 0.01
Zoonotic potential: Yes
Zoonotic potential description: Matching sequences from sub-lineage B.1.1.464 have previously been described from at least 14 countries globally in samples originating from people. The source of the virus is currently unknown, although introduction through COVID-19-infected people is considered likely. See also further information under epidemiological comments.
Diagnostic details: Clinical, laboratory test
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Skara, Vastra Gotaland
Started: 19 Aug 2021
Ended: Ongoing
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Mustelidae / 11 000 / 1 / 1 / - / - / 0

Affected population description: This is a mink farm with breeding animals for fur production. Samples were taken for analysis within a surveillance program which covers all mink farms in the country and is in accordance with Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/788 for the monitoring and reporting of infections with SARS-CoV-2 in certain animal species. No increased morbidity or mortality had been observed on the farm.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were detected using qRT-PCR in one out of 6 tracheal swabs sampled from mink found dead on the farm. Whole genome sequencing of the virus has been carried out demonstrating that the virus belongs to sub-lineage B1.1.464 of SARS-CoV-2. None of the amino acid mutations described on the spike protein and considered associated with adaptation to mink was present in the sequence. Matching sequences from sub-lineage B.1.1.464 have previously been described from at least 14 countries globally in samples originating from people. Moreover, this sub-lineage has also been detected in mink in 2 other countries. B1.1.464 has not been detected previously in Sweden. Movement restrictions and strict biosecurity measures have been in place for all mink farms in Sweden since fall 2020, and all people associated with the farm in question have either had the infection (COVID-19 confirmed in farm workers in November 2020) or been vaccinated, or both. Moreover, a serological screening carried out in December 2020 demonstrated that also the mink on the farm had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 although virus could not be detected at the time. Further investigations related to the outbreak are ongoing. Whereas this is the 1st case detected in Sweden during 2021, SARS-CoV-2 (sub-lineage B1.1.39) was detected in 13 farms, all located in Solvesborg, the County of Blekinge, in November 2020. Moreover, a serological screening carried out in December 2020 and which covered the majority of mink fur farms active at the time (26 out of 28), suggested that most of them had been exposed to the virus. High prevalence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in mink from 23 farms, including in all farms that previously had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. In the remaining 3 farms, all samples tested negative. Moreover, an active surveillance program targeting mink farmworkers demonstrated a clear association between presence of SARS-CoV-2 among the mink and COVID-19 in people associated to mink, supported by the results of the whole genome sequencing. Given the extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 among Swedish mink experienced during the fall 2020, with spillover to people associated to the affected farms, a concern was raised regarding the potential public health risk of allowing breeding to occur during the following season (i.e., spring 2021). With this in mind, and based on a risk assessment, a decision was taken to ban mink breeding during 2021.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: traceability; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; official destruction of animal products; movement control inside the country
