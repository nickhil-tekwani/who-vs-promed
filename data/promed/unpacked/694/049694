Mystery disease kills 67 wild horses at holding site
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 67 wild horses, including ones removed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from an area south of Rangely last year [2021], have died at a holding facility in Ca単on City in recent days from an outbreak of an unknown disease which is highly contagious and sometimes fatal, the BLM says.

The incident has prompted some animal activist groups to call on the agency to suspend its wild horse and burro removal operations due to concerns over the level of care provided to animals removed from the range.

The BLM said in a news release Monday [25 Apr 2022] that it is working with local, state and federal officials to determine the exact cause of death of 57 horses that had died since the outbreak began Saturday [23 Apr 2022]. It said in a release late Tuesday afternoon [26 Apr 2022] that another 10 horses had died.

The facility, which is under a voluntary quarantine, currently is home to 2550 horses. Under an agreement with the state Department of Corrections, inmates care for and train the horses for adoption.

"We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible," Stephen Leonard, the BLM's Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program manager, said in a news release.

The BLM last year [2021] gathered 457 wild horses in the West Douglas area, which is west of Colorado Highway 139. It's an area the agency considers inappropriate for the animals due to terrain factors and lack of summer range, issues exacerbated by wildfire and drought.

The BLM last year [2021] also rounded up 684 wild horses in the Sand Wash Basin herd management area outside Craig, Colorado, citing drought and lack of forage and the need to reduce the population to a sustainable number. Horses from the Sand Wash Basin and the Red Desert area of Wyoming, home to a gather operation in 2020, are among those that have been taken to the Ca単on City facility, but the BLM says West Douglas horses there have been most impacted by the recent disease outbreak.

Animal Wellness Action, the Center for a Humane Economy, and the Animal Wellness Foundation said in a news release that the deaths in Ca単on City are just the latest reports of horses catching and transmitting infectious diseases in BLM holding corrals.

"Last summer [2021], for example, the BLM rounded up a substantial portion of horses from the Onaqui Herd Management Area in Utah, holding a number of horses at a private facility before turning them back onto the range a few weeks later. Many of the horses appeared to be suffering from a contagious disease called pigeon fever, which causes large abscesses on the animals' neck and chest. One mare was so sick she had to be euthanized by BLM officials just hours after she was released," the groups said in the release.

Scott Beckstead with the Center for a Humane Economy said in the release, "Given the prevalence of disease at BLM corrals, it would be unacceptably irresponsible to round up and bring in more animals and subject them to the risk of contagion, suffering, and death."

The BLM is proposing rounding up 1050 wild horses in Rio Blanco County later this year [2022], removing 750 of them from the range and administering fertility control to another 200. The gather would take place in the Piceance-East Douglas wild horse herd management area east of Colorado Highway 139 and southwest of Meeker.

Nationally, the BLM has proposed gathering nearly 22 800 horses and burros this federal fiscal year [2022], removing nearly 20 000 of them from the range and treating about 2300 with fertility controls and releasing them back on the range. It has cited the need to reduce the risk of starvation, thirst and habitat destruction related to climate change and drought impacts in the West.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian who inspected the Ca単on City facility last fall [2021] in response to concerns about the conditions of horses there found that the vast majority of animals he observed there were in good condition, and animals were being fed high-quality alfalfa hay and being kept in clean pens.

Disease outbreak kills dozens of wild horses at BLM facility
------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of an undetermined and highly contagious disease has killed dozens of wild horses at a federal holding facility in southern Colorado.

Bureau of Land Management officials say 67 horses have died since the outbreak began Saturday [23 Apr 2022] at the agency's holding pen in Canon City, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southwest of Denver.

"We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible," said Stephen Leonard, the manager of the BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program.

The facility, which is under voluntary quarantine, currently holds 2550 horses. BLM officials say the horses that have been most affected by the disease were gathered from the West Douglas area last fall [2021].

No other information has been released.

Mass equine deaths in Colorado camp spark outrage!
--------------------------------------------------
Today [26 Apr 2022], Animal Wellness Action, the Center for a Humane Economy, and the Animal Wellness Foundation called on the Bureau of Land Management to suspend its wild horse and burro gather operations in the wake of a BLM announcement of an unexplained outbreak of infectious disease that has claimed the lives of at least 57 horses over the past few days at the agency's holding corrals in Canon City, Colorado.

The facility is home to thousands of horses, including animals rounded up in Colorado and Wyoming over the past year as part of the BLM's campaign to remove tens of thousands of horses and burros from their designated public lands to accommodate commercial livestock.

Animal Wellness Action officials and other advocacy groups have decried the cramped, crowded, and stressful conditions the formerly wild animals are forced to live in at the facilities, conditions that are the perfect environment for infectious pathogens to propagate and spread. Photos of those facilities taken since the mass roundups of 2021 show thousands of horses packed together in small, barren, filthy pens, and covered in manure and mud.

"The BLM must immediately suspend any ongoing or future horse and burro gather operations until it can demonstrate the ability to provide basic care for these animals, starting with the ability to keep them safe from infectious disease," said Scott Beckstead, director of campaigns for the Center for a Humane Economy.

"It is unacceptable the agency charged by federal law to protect and care for these animals can't even keep them healthy, and it points to the larger problem of this agency's focus on mass roundups to accommodate more commercial livestock, rather than being responsible stewards of our wild herds and the lands they live on."

The deaths in Canon City are the latest in reports of horses catching and transmitting infectious diseases in BLM holding corrals. Last summer [2021], for example, the BLM rounded up a substantial portion of horses from the Onaqui Herd Management Area in Utah, holding a number of horses at a private facility before turning them back onto the range a few weeks later. Many of the horses appeared to be suffering from a contagious disease called pigeon fever, which causes large abscesses on the animals' neck and chest. One mare was so sick she had to be euthanized by BLM officials just hours after she was released.

"Given the prevalence of disease at BLM corrals, it would be unacceptably irresponsible to round up and bring in more animals and subject them to the risk of contagion, suffering, and death," said Beckstead. "If the BLM is unwilling to take this commonsense step, then Congress will need to step up and get involved until we have answers to how these outbreaks are occurring, and proof that this agency can hold the animals in conditions that are healthy and safe."

[This is concerning. Either 57 or 67 horses are dead and these articles do not mention if any treatment was pursued, or if any testing was done. It seems the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) should/would have a veterinarian on staff. Or would certainly get a veterinarian to come and check the animals. While one of the articles notes one veterinarian did check them, the article does not note if the veterinarian who checked the horses was at the same location(s) or time frames as these 57 or 67 ill horses. The articles do not give us any hint about how quickly these animals died or if this has occurred over a lengthy period of time such as a few years, vs several months. These articles seem to be saying these 57 or 67 animals died in a fairly short time frame, perhaps within a month or less, and seemingly at the same or very close facilities. I suspect these horses are dying quickly, as the articles are dated within 1 day or the same day. If 10 animals died over the course of 24 hours, I would wonder if they are being sprayed with something, perhaps fly control, and it may have organophosphates in it? There are no clinical signs of any ill horses provided so this may be only speculation. At which point, I remain very concerned for the animals' sake.

These articles mention Pigeon Fever, or _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ infection. However, it does not indicate this was in all the deceased animals.

It seems an investigation into the time frame of the deaths, the locations, and if there were any post mortem samples sent to a lab for identification of the problem, is warranted.

Hopefully, more information will be forthcoming soon.
