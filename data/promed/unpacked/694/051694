I wonder if the moderator might say a bit about the relative monetary
cost of the inaccurate blood test, the tuberculin skin test, the IGRA,
and the Xpert MTB/RIF.

[I don't know the costs for the inaccurate blood tests the WHO
statement refers to that are being used in attempts to diagnose TB
disease. One article quoted the WHO as saying that many patients pay
up to USD 30 per test
(http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/who-warns-against-the-use-of-inaccurate--blood-tests-for-active-tuberculosis).
However, these tests are being used on a massive scale without
benefit, and are often doing harm by exposing many patients to
unnecessary procedures and drug treatment. (See
http://www.tbevidence.org/documents/news/Specter_NewYorker_2010.pdf.)

The tuberculin skin test (TST) and Interferon-Gamma Release Assay
(IGRAs) both can be used for targeted screening for latent TB
infection (LTBI). Targeted tuberculin testing for LTBI is a strategic
component of tuberculosis (TB) control that identifies persons at high
risk for development of TB disease who would benefit by antimicrobial
treatment of LTBI, if detected
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4906a1.htm). Persons
with increased risk for developing TB include those who have an
increased likelihood of exposure to persons with infectious TB disease
and those with clinical conditions or other factors associated with an
increased the risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease, namely
persons with HIV infection, persons who are receiving
immunosuppressive therapy or other immunosuppressive agents such as
TNF-antagonists, or who have abnormal chest radiographs consistent
with prior TB, recent immigrants (i.e., within the last 5 years) from
high prevalence countries; injection drug users; residents and
employees of high-risk congregate settings (including health care
workers with exposure to TB); mycobacteriology laboratory personnel;
persons with clinical conditions such as silicosis, diabetes mellitus,
chronic renal failure, leukemias and lymphomas, carcinoma of the head
or neck and lung, weight loss of over 10 percent ideal body weight,
gastrectomy, and jejunoileal bypass; and infants, children, and
adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories.

The TST requires 2 visits with an expert at administering and reading
this test: the initial visit is for placement of the skin test and the
other visit 48 hours later is for reading the skin test reaction. In
addition, false-positive reactions to TST occur among those who had
received BCG vaccination, a common practice in developing countries.

Cost-effectiveness of screening for LTBI using an IGRA versus the TST
has been studied in healthcare workers (HCW)
(http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110627006209/en/Oxford-Immunotec-Study-Results-Show-Switching-Tuberculin
and http://www.igrasymposium.com/J14_mor.pdf). HCW, such as nurses
and physicians, with exposure to TB disease are screened usually once
a year for the development of LTBI. A complete switch from the TST to
an IGRA has been found to improve testing adherence at a lower cost.
An IGRA virtually ensures 100 percent adherence and eliminates the
costs of identifying and "chasing down" those healthcare workers who
do not return for the reading of the TST and repeat testing.
Additionally, more employees were found uninfected with TB when using
an IGRA compared to the TST, which results in a reduction of chest
x-rays and fewer healthcare workers being placed on unnecessary
therapy.

Similar, cost-effective analyses have been done for targeted testing
using TST or IGRAs for LTBI among other high-risk groups (see
http://myats2011.zerista.com/event/member?item_id=994378,
http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iuatld/ijtld/2007/00000011/00000001/art00004,
http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iuatld/ijtld/2008/00000012/00000012/art00014,
and http://thorax.bmj.com/content/65/2/178.abstract).

Sputum microscopy and culture and XpertTB/RIF both can be used for
the diagnosis of pulmonary TB disease, and for determination of
multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Reviewing by data from published
papers, WHO large multi-centre laboratory validation and demonstration
studies coordinated by FIND (the Foundation for Innovative New
Diagnostics), and unpublished data from investigator-driven,
single-centre studies
(http://www.who.int/tb/laboratory/roadmap_xpert_mtb-rif.pdf), found
the following:

"Cost-effectiveness modelling indicated that the use of Xpert MTB-RIF
significantly increased TB case-finding (by roughly 30 percent) when
used as a replacement or add-on test to microscopy. Use of Xpert
MTB/RIF as replacement for conventional culture and DST also
significantly increased MDR case-finding (roughly 3-fold).
Cost-comparisons show that the current running costs of Xpert MTB/RIF
(calculated at USD 18/test) are substantially greater than those of
microscopy, though similar to the cost for performing culture and drug
susceptibility testing (around USD 20/test using solid culture and
around USD 30/test using liquid culture). Initial capital cost for the
GeneXpert device (around USD 17 500 per 4-module instrument) is
significantly higher than for microscopy (around USD 1500 per
microscope) but much lower than for conventional culture and DST (up
to USD 1.4 million per new laboratory or up to USD 300 000 per
established laboratory, given the need for extensive biosafety
equipment).

WHO analyses on meeting the projected diagnostic targets in the
Global Plan to Stop TB, 2011-2015 show that:
- For MDR-TB: Implementing Xpert MTB/RIF to meet diagnostic targets
for MDR-TB will have a lower cost than conventional culture and DST
for diagnosis of MDR-TB, both globally and in varied country settings,
requiring less than one percent of current funding for TB control;
- For HIV-associated TB: Cost of testing all HIV-positive individuals
suspected of having TB will have a similar cost than conventional
culture for diagnosis of TB, requiring 1-2 percent of current funding
for TB control, and amounting to under one percent of current
expenditure on HIV care in several high TB-HIV burden countries;
- Testing all persons suspected of having TB will be strongly
dependent on screening and diagnostic algorithms at country level.
Selected country case studies show that Xpert MTB/RIF may be easily
affordable in middle-income countries but less affordable in
low-income countries, requiring pre-test screening strategies to
optimise Xpert MTB/RIF efficiency and cost." - Mod.ML]
