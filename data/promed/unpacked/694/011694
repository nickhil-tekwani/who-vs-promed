Source: Belize Government Press Release: Case of Rabies in a Horse [edited]

The Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) has confirmed that a horse in
the Cayo District was suffering from the fatal nervous disease called rabies.
BAHA veterinarians were called to attend the sick horse that presented with
multiple vampire bat bites, incoordination, inability to rise, and twisted
neck. The suffering was so intense that the owner decided to put the horse to
sleep to alleviate its pain and suffering. Upon its death, BAHA veterinary
staff extracted the brain and submitted it to the Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory in Panama that confirmed rabies.
Belize last reported rabies in horses in 1983.
BAHA has submitted a total of 23 samples for 2004 to Panama for the diagnosis
of rabies. All have been negative, except for this case in the horse. The
Cayo District is the district that reports the most cases of rabies. Since
the year 2000, Cayo District has reported rabies in a fox, a dog, cattle and
now this one horse.
The Ministries of Agriculture and Health are working closely with BAHA to
ensure control of this rabies outbreak. The Ministry of Health is providing
vaccination for all people considered exposed to the horse, and will be
vaccinating dogs in the affected village. The Ministry of Agriculture and
BAHA will be vaccinating farm animals and trapping vampire bats.
Horse owners are asked to report any horse showing nervous signs such as
circling, incoordination, weakness, twisted neck and may be unable to rise.
Horses with rabies can easily be confused with [those with] colic (intestinal
pain) so people handling colicky horses should always exercise caution.
Reports can be submitted to any office of BAHA or the Ministry of
Agriculture. All horse owners are also advised to vaccinate their horses for
rabies. Vaccines can be obtained from any registered veterinarian.
Further information can be obtained from BAHA offices in Orange Walk, Belize
City and Central Farm, or from the local registered veterinarian.
[Note by contributor: This report came as an e-mail Press release from the
government. I assume it will be published in the newspapers this Friday [29
Oct 2004] (most of our papers are weekly publications).]
