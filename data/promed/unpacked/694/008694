April 2, 1997 - From WHO's Influenza Page
Global influenza situation as of 2 April 1997:
The influenza season in the northern hemisphere is over. The first wave of
influena activity started in November-December and was associated with
influenza A(H3N2). It reached a peak in some countries in western Europe and
North America in early January but many countries reported a second wave
associated with influenza B in January. At that time other parts of Europe
began to experience increasing activity which was often associated with both
influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus circulation.
During outbreaks in Asia (China, Iran and Israel) influenza B was more
common than influenza A and sometimes the only influenza type, while the
epidemic in Japan was due to influenza A(H3N2). Israel reported a second
wave where influenza A(H3N2) predominated after the first influenza B wave.
Influenza B has also been detected during December and January in Australia
and Fiji.
Overall, however, this first half of the 1996-97 influenza year was
dominated by influenza A(H3N2). Only sporadic cases of influenza A(H1N1)
have been reported.
The isolates of influenza A(H3N2) virus further characterized in the
Collaborating Centres have in general been close to the strain recommended
for inclusion in the influenza vaccine in the 1996-1997 season.
