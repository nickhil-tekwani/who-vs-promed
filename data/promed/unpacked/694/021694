[The total number of cases reported in the full report is well over
the 60 000 barrier, now at 62 909, and the total fatality count is
3229. In the 5 days since ProMED-mail's last posting the cases, which
obscenely show no signs of abatement, have risen by 5207 and the
fatalities by 201. This is an average of about 1040 cases with 40
deaths each day. The outbreak continues to spread to new areas and
the overall case fatality rate, reflecting the overall poor
conditions in the country, remains very high at 5.1 percent.

[2] Cholera - South Africa (Mpumalanga, Limpopo)
Date: Mon 2 Feb 2009

11 more people have died of cholera in Mpumalanga and Limpopo, the
provinces' health departments said. Mpumalanga spokesman Mpho
Gabashane said 7 more people had died of cholera related illness in
the province, bringing the death toll to 26 in the region. Limpopo
health spokesman Phuti Seloba said 4 deaths had been confirmed. This
brought the province's cholera death toll to 20. Seloba added the 4
deaths were not recent, but that the department had received test
results only on Monday [2 Feb 2009] confirming the 4 victims had had cholera.

A total of 4165 people with cholera symptoms had been treated in
Mpumalanga alone by Monday afternoon [2 Feb 2009] since the outbreak,
blamed on the Zimbabwean collapse as well as government's lack of
delivery in SA [South Africa], began during November 2008. Limpopo
officials said 3600 people in the province were suffering from
cholera symptoms.

Dr Lucille Blumberg from the National Institute for Communicable
Diseases said that, even though the outbreak originated outside South
Africa, it was spreading to more SA communities. This was especially
so in Limpopo and Mpumalanga due to the unavailability of purified
water and proper sanitation in most of the rural areas in the provinces.

The Federal Ministry of Health has alerted the National Emergency

health professor Abdulsalam Nasidi, informed NEMA that the disease
may have broken out in parts of Ebonyi, Niger, Nassarawa, and Benue
states, following reports of the epidemics in the neighboring countries.

"The alert was issued based on information available to the ministry
about the outbreak of the disease in Zinder Region of Niger Republic
where reported cases of infection and death were reported," he said.

understand the epidemic situation and preventive measures.
