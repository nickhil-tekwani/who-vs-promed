Think atypical myopathy -- an often-deadly muscle disease of British and European horses caused by a toxin found in sycamore seeds -- only affects grazing horses eating the seeds by mistake? Think again. Researchers recently published a study describing what they believe to be the 1st reported case of a newborn foal in the Czech Republic dying due to atypical myopathy complications.

"It was surprising for the owner as well as for the veterinarian, but atypical myopathy was confirmed by elevated creatinine kinase (CK) activity," said Petr Jahn, PhD, of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of Veterinary Medicine's Equine Clinic, in Brno, Czech Republic.

The Haflinger foal was born in spring to a mare that had fallen ill the previous autumn after consuming sycamore tree (_Acer pseudoplatanus_) seeds containing the causative toxin, hypoglycin A. The mare was 6 months pregnant at the time and made a full recovery, Jahn said. Around 75% of affected horses die from the disease. However, in the spring, she apparently consumed more of the toxin, despite not showing any signs of disease.

The filly was born full-term and appeared normal at birth, he said, and she stood and suckled within 2 hours. However, by 6 hours postpartum, she was already showing signs of depression and weakness. Blood analyses revealed biochemical signs associated with atypical myopathy. Despite treatment, the foal continued to weaken and could no longer stand. She was euthanized at 16 hours of age.

"Of course, it was a shock for the owner," Jahn said. "As far as I know, it is the 1st described case of atypical myopathy in the neonatal foal."

It's still not clear how the filly contracted the disease, whether the toxin passed through the placenta in utero or through the mare's colostrum (the normally protective, antibody-rich 1st milk). But Jahn said he believes it probably happened when the filly suckled for the 1st time.

"The acute ingestion of the sycamore seedlings containing toxin and consecutive secretion into the colostrum is more probable," he said. "In the case of transplacentar transmission of the toxin during pregnancy, I would expect abortion." Unfortunately, he added, a colostrum sample wasn't available for analysis.

The case reveals the risk of the transmission of atypical myopathy to unborn foals, Jahn said. Until an effective treatment or resistance plan is developed, breeders should take care to keep their broodmares away from sycamore tree seeds.

"Move the horses into the stable, feed them hay, and clean the pasture," he said. Further recommendations are on the Royal Veterinary College website, he added.

The study, "Newborn foal with atypical myopathy," was published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine.

[While this situation is reported out of the Czech Republic, the syndrome, atypical myopathy, has been reported from the USA and Europe. However, this may be the 1st time the toxic agent has been recognized to cross the placental barrier and affect the fetus/foal.

There are other plants whose seeds contain the hypoglycin A.

Although the information provided here is from the USA, it is provided as background information about this toxin.

Horses may become poisoned by seeds from boxelder trees. Boxelder trees, also called box elder or ash-leaved maples [and possibly other maples] are a type of maple tree common throughout the Midwest, northeastern states, and eastern Canada and may be found south as far as central Florida and west through parts of Texas. The seeds, which generally fall between September and March, are winged in appearance and often found in clusters on the trees. The seeds of the boxelder tree contain hypoglycin A, a toxin linked to seasonal pasture myopathy (SPM) in horses. The disease occurs in the fall once seeds have fallen but does not normally occur after snow is present.

SPM is an equine muscle disease, which can be fatal in up to 75% of affected horses. Affected horses develop severe necrosis of the respiratory and postural muscles resulting in muscle weakness, stiffness, tremors, difficulty walking, and an inability to rise after lying down. Other signs include a rapid or irregular heart rate and rapid breathing. Urine is dark brown in color and indicates muscle damage. Hospital care is essential for survival.

It is important to understand that most horses will not willingly eat boxelder seeds. Several risk factors have been identified for those horses that may be exposed to boxelder seeds. Adequate feed and limiting exposure are the cornerstones of prevention. Pastures should not be overgrazed, and hay should be provided to horses on pastures that have been overgrazed. Horses should not be introduced to a new or different pasture containing boxelder trees in the fall when seeds are present, and turnout time for horses should be limited to 12 hours a day during the high-risk period. Trimming branches and raking up seeds is another means of limiting exposure. Permanently removing boxelder trees from pasture is a final option, especially if there are several boxelder trees on a sparse pasture (https://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/blog/boxelder-acer-negundo-seed-toxicosis-in-horses/). - Mod.TG

The original article is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6189353/ and notes the initial exposure occurred in 2013, with follow-up exposure and the birth/death of the foal in 2014. - Mod.JH
