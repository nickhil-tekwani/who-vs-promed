[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic disease affecting mainly domestic ruminants and humans in parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The causative agent is a _Phlebovirus_ (Phenuiviridae), and the vector are mosquitos of different genera, especially _Aedes_. Infection in humans causes influenza-like illness complicated by hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, ocular damage, and, in some cases, death. Wild ruminants, especially African buffalos, and some domestic ruminants may be involved in the maintenance of RVF virus. Natural and experimental infections by RVF virus have been documented in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, and others. Mosquitos are considered to be the maintenance hosts, and wild ruminants and other mammals may serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.PMB
