A horse in Nassau County, Florida, has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) announced [on Mon 26 Feb 2018]. According to Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services statistics, this is the 1st EEE case for the county and the 2nd for the state in 2018.

"The 7 year old quarter horse mare became clinical on [Wed 31 Jan 2018] and was euthanized due to a poor prognosis," the EDCC said. "The vaccination history is unknown." The positive EEE test result came in on [Mon 12 Feb 2018], the EDCC said.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 per cent among horses. Horses that survive may have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective EEE prevention tool. Horses having been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[This case is very very early in the year. This may indicate how the warmer weather and mosquito trends will be for the remainder of the year. This does not bode well for the mosquito season. Therefore we need to be especially vigilant to vaccine our animals.

"Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a member of the genus _Alphavirus_, family Togaviridae. Other medically important alphaviruses found in the Americas include western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). EEEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 60-65 nm. Of the 4 lineages of EEEV, group I is endemic in North America and the Caribbean and causes most human disease cases; the other 3 groups (IIA, IIB, and III) cause primarily equine illness in Central and South America." (http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/virus.html)

Vaccination is very effective in preventing the viral infection. The vaccine is usually a combination of EEE, WNV, WEE, and sometimes VEE and tetanus. Mosquito control is very important in reducing the mosquitoes, which is another form of helping to protect your horse.

Protection from EEE can wane in approximately 4 months. Areas with high prevalence would be wise to vaccinate every 4 months.

Remember the 5Ds of mosquito bite prevention can also help prevent mosquito bites and breeding:
- Dusk/Dawn - Avoid dusk and dawn activities during the summer when mosquitoes are most active.
- Dress - Wear loose-fitting, long sleeved shirts and pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin.
- DEET - Cover exposed skin with an insect repellent containing the DEET, which is the most effective repellent against mosquito bites.
- Drain - Empty any containers holding standing water - buckets, barrels, flower pots, tarps - because they are breeding grounds for virus-carrying mosquitoes.
- Doors - Make sure doors and windows are in good repair and fit tightly, and fix torn or damaged screens to keep mosquitoes out of the house.
