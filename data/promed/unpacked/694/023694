[Lumpy skin disease [LSD] was reported for the 1st time in China in August 2019, in Yili prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region (western China), close to the border with Almaty, Kazakhstan's easternmost province. The reported spread into 5 Chinese provinces on the other, southeastern side of the country, may be indicative of wider, yet unreported spread. Reportedly, China is conducting emergency vaccination. The dimensions, geography, and (attenuated) virus strain included in the vaccine are yet to be published.

OIE's global LSD map, covering the period August 2019 to present, is available at https://tinyurl.com/yyz2kqwd (click on China, zoom in).

Kazakhstan had reported its own 1st outbreak, on its western frontier with Russia's Astrakhan, in 2016 and subsequently has been applying countrywide mass vaccination of its cattle population. During 2019, 3 704 380 cattle out of a total population of 8 825 734 were vaccinated in Kazakhstan. Russia, which also shares borders with China, has been suffering LSD since 2014. Russia has similarly been practicing mass cattle vaccinations: during 2019, 11 135 159 out of a total of 18 018 809 head were vaccinated. The vaccine is Russian made; worldwide, only live vaccines are currently available to protect cattle.

In Asia, LSD has recently been officially reported also from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal; according to media and other reliable sources, Kyrgyzstan is affected as well. It may be assumed that the virus is circulating elsewhere as well in the region, requiring enhanced surveillance, coordinated control efforts, and improved transparency. - Mod.AS
