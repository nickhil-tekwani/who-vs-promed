A Tale of 2 Cultures
----------------------
LONDON: Where Britain has stuck steadfastly to its mass slaughter policy as
the best way to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease, the Dutch have taken a
quite different stance, which seems, so far, to be working. So far, the
Netherlands has had just 15 foot-and-mouth cases confirmed, in a country
with a densely packed livestock industry where agriculture still accounts
for around 10 per cent of gross domestic product. The Dutch have already
opted for vaccination as part of a strategy to stop the disease spreading.
They are now debating whether to bow to popular pressure not to slaughter
vaccinated animals, therefore losing prized disease-free status.
Coincidentally, just 8 days before the outbreak was discovered in Britain,
the Dutch dairy industry had met Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst, agriculture
minister, to discuss tactics if foot-and-mouth were to hit. Subsequently,
as the UK pursued mass slaughter, the Dutch authorities have reacted to
public revulsion at the policy, and are well into a program of inoculating
more than 115 000 animals. "The UK has no tradition of vaccination, whereas
we do," says Berend Pastoor, head of the Brussels office of LTO, the main
Dutch farm union. It was the UK, Ireland and Denmark that persuaded the
rest of the EU to abandon vaccination in favour of eradication when they
joined the then European Economic Community in 1973.
But the difference in approach runs deeper than that, according to Mr
Pastoor: "Emotions are running high in the Netherlands and there's a strong
call for vaccination of all animals there. I think the societal and moral
values are somewhat different to those in Britain." For weeks, the British
government resisted all pressure to vaccinate a "firebreak" around infected
regions, only considering it briefly when it seemed the mass cull might be
in danger of failing. By contrast, when the first case in the Netherlands
was confirmed 2 and one-half weeks ago, Mr Brinkhorst proclaimed there
would be no repeat in his country of the daily scenes in Britain of heaps
of carcasses burning in fields. Almost immediately they had the disease,
the Dutch called on their EU partners to allow vaccines to be used.
This policy has now been taken a step further. Where it is usually the
practice to kill all vaccinated animals in an effort to regain disease-free
status quickly, the Dutch are now debating sparing vaccinated cattle. Under
this so-called protective vaccination, the animals would be kept in the
same area for at least a year. Their meat and milk would not be exported,
but could be used in the domestic market after being treated. Mr Brinkhorst
said he would consult the sectors involved over a decision he agreed was
not easy. If the herds were killed, the region could reopen after 30 days
and exports could resume after 3 months. Dutch agricultural organizations
reacted cautiously to the initiative, saying they wanted first to study the
conditions that would attach to it. The minister is to decide next week.
Back in the UK, the indications are that the government's policy of
slaughtering all livestock on farms neighboring an outbreak is finally
having the desired effect. However, many are now asking whether there is
not an alternative to mass slaughter. The Dutch are calling for EU farm
ministers to look again at vaccination, at their 3-day meeting in Sweden
beginning on Sunday. Even Germany is now reconsidering its position.

[Considering the porosity of EU internal borders, it is difficult to see
how the Netherlands can effectively guarantee that milk & meat from
vaccinated stock will remain inside its borders and satisfy OIE and its EU
neighbors. - Mod.MHJ
