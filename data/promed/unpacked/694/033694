New York City health officials announced a recently recognized invasive tick species now found in parts of the United States was [identified] for the 1st time in New York City.

The tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, also known as the longhorned tick, was found in the southern section of Staten Island. The tick is primarily found on livestock and wild animals, and has not been shown to transmit disease in the United States.

"While it has been reported that the longhorned tick has transmitted disease to humans in other parts of the world such as China, it has not been shown to transmit diseases in the United States" said Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett. "As more research is done, the Department will continue to aggressively monitor and control ticks on Staten Island and throughout the City and urge all New Yorkers to take the necessary precautions against tick bites. Even simple measures, such as using repellent and wearing light colored clothing, can make a significant difference."

"This new discovery underscores the importance of our recent efforts to control the tick population and educate Staten Islanders about protecting themselves from Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses," said Staten Island Borough President James Oddo. "We will continue to work with the Administration on tick control methods, including our bait box initiative, as well as focus on educating local residents on how to prevent tick bites."

The longhorned tick, originally found in eastern Asia, especially China, Korea and Japan, is also typically found in Australia and New Zealand. In these areas the longhorned tick is most notable for its impact on farm animals as it transmits several diseases including bovine theileriosis and babesiosis. In Asia, the tick has been known to spread [acute fever with] thrombocytopenia syndrome virus to humans. This is a disease that causes fever, low blood platelet count and a decrease in white blood cells. Human pathogens such as Lyme disease have not been detected in these ticks in the U.S.

This year [2018], the Health Department has enhanced its tick surveillance on Staten Island. The agency will conduct tick surveillance in 31 sites: 28 in Staten Island, 2 in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn. A total of 15 pilot sites were surveyed during high tick activity season from May to July [2018]: 2 in Manhattan, 4 in the Bronx, 7 in Queens and 2 in Brooklyn. Surveillance data will be used to monitor tick densities and their geographic distribution. Ticks collected during surveillance are tested to determine the prevalence of tick-borne diseases.

[This is not the 1st report of _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the longhorned tick, being found in New York State when it was recently discovered in multiple locations in Westchester County. This is the 1st time it has been reported from New York City, adding a new location to its geographic distribution. As noted earlier, this discovery makes one wonder whether this tick has become established in the eastern USA. Either the tick is spreading rapidly or surveillance has been intensified, or both. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 7 months, one wonders if it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One wonders if this tick is capable of transmitting tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
