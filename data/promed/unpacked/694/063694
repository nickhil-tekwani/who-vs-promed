A 2-year-old baby from eastern Bangladesh has died of H5N1 [avian influenza] virus, the 1st bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) virus] death in this South Asian country, a senior health official said Monday [8 Apr 2013]. Mahmudur Rahman, head of the country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told Xinhua [News Agency] that "the 7th case of influenza A (H5N1) has been confirmed from one of our surveillance sites in Comilla." Comilla is 96 km [60 mi] east of the capital Dhaka. Mahmudur Rahman said the male child was from Chauddogram sub-district of Comilla.

The child was admitted to Comilla Medical College Hospital, later transferred to Dhaka Shishu Hospital and then to a private clinic, Rahman said. "The child died 18 Feb 2013," he said. "This is the 1st fatal case of H5N1 in Bangladesh. As this child had no typical features of influenza-like illness, his throat and nasal samples were sent for reconfirmation to CDC Atlanta, US and received confirmation Sat 6 Apr 2013," he added. According to the official, a detailed outbreak investigation was conducted. There was a strong epidemiological link with backyard poultry deaths. No other case was found among contacts during the investigation, he said.

Bangladeshi authorities in December last year [2012] destroyed 150 000 birds and 300 000 eggs as the season's major outbreak of bird flu was detected in a poultry farm in Gazipur, on the outskirts of capital Dhaka.
