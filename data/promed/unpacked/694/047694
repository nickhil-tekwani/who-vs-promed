In a follow-up on epizootic yellow fever situation in Parana state, Brazil, the State Department of Health reported 3 more deaths of infected monkeys (epizootics) that occurred in the municipality of Palmas, in the area of the 7th Regional Health, in Pato Branco, in the southwest part of the state.

The epidemiological monitoring period for yellow fever in Parana began in July 2020 and continues until June this year [2021]. The State has so far registered 104 reports of animal diseases in 23 municipalities. There were 14 monkey deaths confirmed due to the yellow fever virus; 7 are under investigation, 41 were discarded and 42 occurred for undetermined causes.

Regarding yellow fever in humans, the period has no confirmed cases. There were 15 notifications; 11 already discarded and 4 are still under investigation.

"Paraná is considered an area of viral circulation and that is why we monitor the presence of this virus daily, always remembering that the monkey does not transmit yellow fever [directly to people]. In the same way as humans, these animals also get sick and die when they are bitten by the mosquito (_Sabethes_ and _Haemagogus_) infected with the virus ", said the Secretary of Health, Beto Preto.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus continues to cause fatalities in monkeys in Parana state in different municipalities. The state Health Department on Wed 9 Dec 2020 confirmed the deaths of 8 monkeys from yellow fever virus infection. These cases occurred in Clevelandia (2 cases), Coronel Domingos Soares (3), Mangueirinha (1), and Cruz Machado (2) (see Yellow fever - Americas (13): Brazil (PR) monkey 20201211.8010059). On 27 Dec 2020, the Secretariat of Health of Parana released a biweekly yellow fever bulletin reporting 3 dead monkeys confirmed in the municipalities of Cruz Machado, Honorio Serpa, and Palmas (see Yellow fever - Americas (14): Brazil (PR) monkeys 20201227.8050746). The above report indicates that there are 3 more monkeys dead of YF but in the municipality of Palmas but it is not clear if one of these dead monkeys reported previously is among the 3 monkeys reported above. Fortunately, no confirmed human YF cases or fatalities have occurred in any of these areas currently. The proportion of the Parana state human population that has been vaccinated for YF is not mentioned.

Finding monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Since the December-May period has begun, it appears that a new period of transmission is underway. Efforts to reach 80-95% YF vaccination coverage in the state are prudent, given the evidence that active yellow fever virus transmission is occurring currently. - Mod.TY
