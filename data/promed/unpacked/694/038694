Oregon health officials said late [Fri 1 Dec 2017], they are investigating 2 cases of salmonellosis linked to a regional outbreak of the disease involving pre-cut melon sold at Oregon and Washington grocery stores. The Oregon cases, one each in Multnomah and Wasco counties, appear to be connected to an outbreak of infections of the Newport strain of _Salmonella_ infections that also involves 16 ill people in Washington. None of the Oregon cases were hospitalized.

Individuals who fell ill reported eating pre-cut cantaloupe or watermelon purchased at Kroger stores, including Fred Meyer and QFC, as well as Rosauers and Central Market stores in Washington and Oregon. Their symptoms occurred between [Sun 29 Oct 2017 and Wed 15 Nov 2017].

The 2 Oregon cases reported purchasing products from Fred Meyer stores in Oregon. Federal regulatory officials are investigating to determine the origin of the contamination. Meanwhile, public health officials in Oregon and Washington are advising people who purchased the products between [Wed 25 Oct 2017 and Fri 1 Dec 2017] to immediately throw them away. Persons who ate the melon do not need to seek medical attention unless they become ill.

Although most people with salmonellosis recover without treatment, severe infections can occur. Infants, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely than others to develop severe illness. When severe infection occurs, _Salmonella_ may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antimicrobials.

Each year, 400 to 500 cases of salmonellosis are reported in Oregon, including 15 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport annually between 2006 and 2015. Testing of patients' strains by Oregon and Washington State Public Health Laboratories indicated a common origin for the _S._ Newport strains in this outbreak.

[It is possible that precut melons can be contaminated after being prepared but since melons grow on the ground, their external rinds can be contaminated _in situ_ and when the melon is cut, the pathogen can be introduced into the edible part of the melon and has been reported here in the past. - Mod.LL
