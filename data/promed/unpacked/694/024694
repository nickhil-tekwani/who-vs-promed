--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals and reinfections among previously infected individuals are increasingly prevalent, especially during the omicron wave. Here, we analyze data from SARS-CoV-2 surveillance across 35 California prisons to understand the impact of vaccination and prior infection on infectiousness of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 omicron infections in prison settings. We estimate that vaccination, prior infection, and both vaccination and prior infection reduced an index case's risk of transmitting to close contacts by 24% (9-37%), 21% (4-36%), and 41% (23-54%), respectively. Booster vaccine doses and more recent vaccination further reduced infectiousness. These findings suggest that although vaccinated and/or previously infected individuals remain infectious upon SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection in this prison setting, their infectiousness is reduced compared to individuals without any history of vaccination or infection.

Results
-------
Transmission attributable to primary infections, breakthrough infections, and reinfections: We estimated that primary infections (15% of index cases), breakthrough infections (49% of index cases), reinfections (7% of index cases), and breakthrough infections in previously infected residents (29% of index cases) contributed to 20% (16-25%), 50% (45-56%), 7% (5-10%), and 22% (18-27%) of transmission to secondary cases in the study population, respectively, with similar results over the entire study period.

Discussion
----------
Using detailed epidemiologic data from SARS-CoV-2 surveillance within the California state prison system, we found that vaccination and prior infection reduced the infectiousness of omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infections. Vaccination and prior infection were each associated with comparable reductions in infectiousness during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and notably, additional doses of vaccination (e.g., booster doses) against SARS-CoV-2 and more recent vaccination led to greater reductions in infectiousness. Of note, reductions in transmission risk associated with prior vaccination and infection were found to be additive, indicating an incremental benefit of vaccination for reducing cases' infectiousness even after prior infection. Irrespective of vaccination and/or prior natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections and reinfections remained highly infectious and were responsible for 80% of transmission observed in the study population, which has high levels of both prior infection and vaccination. This observation underscores that vaccination and prevalent naturally acquired immunity alone may not eliminate risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in higher-risk settings such as prisons.

This study demonstrates that breakthrough COVID-19 infections with the omicron variant remain highly infectious, but that both vaccination and natural infection confer reductions in transmission, with benefit of additional vaccine doses. As SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections and reinfections become the predominant COVID-19 case, this study supports the importance of booster doses in reducing population level transmission, with particular relevance in vulnerable, high-density congregate settings.

One-sentence summary: Vaccine-derived and naturally acquired immunity independently reduce the infectiousness of persons with omicron SARS-CoV-2 infections.

[2] Moral distress among clinicians
Date: Mon 29 Aug 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/08/survey-most-clinicians-treating-low-income-covid-patients-morally


Constrained by a lack of sufficient resources and faced with difficult decisions amid COVID-19 surges in the 1st year of the pandemic, nearly 72% of US primary care, dental, and behavioral health clinicians working in safety-net clinics report experiencing mild to intense moral distress, finds a study published late last week in BMJ Open (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/8/e061369).

Led by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers, the study involved a 10-minute online survey of 2073 frontline clinicians serving low-income patients in safety-net clinics in 20 states and participating in state and national education loan-repayment programs. The survey, fielded from 24 Nov 2020 to 7 Feb 2021, included the single-question Moral Distress Thermometer and one open-ended question.

Safety-net clinics care for patients -- many of whom are racial minorities -- who face barriers to receiving care in mainstream clinics. They include Federally Qualified Health Centers, Indian Health Service clinics, county health departments, and community mental health facilities.

The authors defined moral distress as psychological unease resulting from conflict between the things one does or witnesses and deeply held moral and ethical beliefs and expectations. They also noted that such distress is known to lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, disengagement from patients, poor-quality patient care, and job turnover among hospital nurses.

Of all respondents, 54.9% were aged 35-49 years, 72.9% were women, 60.2% had children at home, 81.0% were White, 9.8% were Hispanic, 7.2% were Asian, 6.8% were Black, and 5.0% were multiracial.

A total of 71.6% of survey respondents said they experienced moral distress. In weighted results, 26.8% of those surveyed reported "distressing," "intense," or the "worst-possible" moral suffering, while 44.8% said they had "mild" or "uncomfortable" distress, and 28.4% reported no distress.

The most commonly reported types of distressing problems were having to limit care to only the sickest patients and not being able to provide optimal or needed care when protocols changed to minimize infection risk between patients and staff. In addition to rationing care, staff sometimes had to rely on virtual visits even when in-person visits would have been better for patients or when patients couldn't access telehealth.

Other issues described included abuse of clinic staff, patient and staff suffering, fears of viral transmission, politicization of the pandemic, shortages of personal protective equipment, the perceived indifference or selfishness of people who didn't follow public health guidance, and social and health disparities and injustices among patients and in the community. Specific examples included patients dying alone and COVID-19 outbreaks that spread through nursing homes.

Providers who reported patient and community inequities and abuse of staff were most likely to indicate high levels of moral distress. A nurse practitioner said she felt moral distress when witnessing how the pandemic "impacted families in our clinic and feeling powerless to make meaningful change," while a doctor cited "diagnosing patients experiencing homelessness with COVID and not being able to provide them with a safe place to isolate/recover."

Thirty-one percent of clinicians said they themselves were responsible for their moral distress, while others named their clinic or organization (15%); government, politics, or society (14%); patients (3%); and clinic staff or administrators (3%).

Some respondents said they felt distressed when colleagues were infected or lost their jobs or when their employers didn't seem to care about staff well-being. "All our manager and director seem to care about is making money and how many patients we see," a dentist commented. "I was having to balance being exposed to so many patients then going home to my family and potentially exposing them."

The researchers said they can't be sure whether the moral distress measured during the pandemic was greater than in 2019 or earlier because no studies had addressed this issue in safety-net clinics.

"But most issues these clinicians reported caused moral distress during the pandemic related directly or indirectly to the pandemic, thus their moral distress had likely increased during the pandemic," they wrote. "Their moral distress may have increased further since this late 2020/early 2021 survey, as vaccines have since become widely available but then shunned by many people, prolonging the pandemic and causing many needless deaths."

The team recommended that clinic managers understand the impact of moral distress, create supportive work environments, develop ways for clinicians and staff to discuss their unease, address ongoing sources of stress, give clinicians psychological support and time away from work, and include staff in operational decisions during crises.

The safety-net setting of this study is important because it was previously unexplored in terms of clinician psychological pain and discomfort, lead author Donald Pathman, MD, MPH, said in a University of North Carolina Health Care news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/962977).

"Moral distress is a concept developed to understand the consequences of disturbing situations nurses can experience in hospitals, but the concept of moral distress is likely just as useful in understanding a type of distress clinicians in all disciplines and work settings experience," he said.

"Given the type of individual who chooses to provide healthcare in low-income communities, it is not surprising that some would be morally distressed watching the pandemic worsen the health and lives of their patients because of their limited resources."

[Also from the press release: "Moral distress was defined in the survey as when one witnesses or does things that contradict deeply held moral and ethical beliefs and expectations. 'Moral distress is a concept developed to understand the consequences of disturbing situations nurses can experience in hospitals, but the concept of moral distress is likely just as useful in understanding a type of distress clinicians in all disciplines and work settings experience,' Pathman said."

"The consequences of moral distress are concerning. The article notes that moral distress is known to cause burnout, compassion fatigue, disengagement from patients, and job turnover for nurses in hospital settings and is likely to also do so for clinicians in safety net practices" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/962977).

It would be interesting to know the level of moral distress among clinicians before the pandemic, as well as 2 years into the pandemic after vaccination was instituted, to compare with the 1st year, which had the highest morbidity and mortality. I would guess the same distress would be equally experienced by all front-line medical responders. - Mod.LK]

[A] Children's self-collected COVID nasal swabs
Even young kids can accurately self-collect nasal swabs for COVID-19 tests
Children aged 4-14 years can accurately self-collect nasal swabs for COVID-19 testing after viewing simple instructions, suggests a study late last week in JAMA [see citation below].

Emory University researchers led the study of 197 symptomatic children aged 4-14 years who self-collected nasal swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing after being shown a 90-second video and given a handout with written and pictorial instructions. The swabs were tested along with those collected by a healthcare worker (HCW) to determine result agreement.

The children were recruited from the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta from July to August 2021. Median patient age was 9 years, 55.7% were boys, and 44% tested positive for COVID-19 by both methods of specimen collection.

Self-collected swabs with positive COVID-19 test results agreed with those from a health-care worker [HCW] 97.8% of the time (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.7%-100.0%), while negative results had 98.1% (95% CI, 95.6%-100.0%) agreement. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads didn't differ significantly.

Children aged 8 and younger more often required help, such as further instruction, to accurately swab their nose (21.8% vs 6.1% for older children), but viral detection didn't differ between the 2 groups.

The researchers said the results could inform school testing policies. "Pediatric self-swabbing will support expanded testing access and should make it even easier to test school-age populations with fewer resources," coauthor Tim Stenzel, MD, PhD, of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said in a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963060).

In a related editorial [see citation below], Ilan Youngster, MD, of Shamir Medical Center in Israel, cautioned that further research in broader populations (e.g., asymptomatic children, those infected with the newer SARS-CoV-2 variants) is required. "If the preliminary results of this study are replicated in other studies, this simple intervention could be applied in a variety of settings in the community for different respiratory pathogens, without specialized personnel," he wrote.

Editorial: Youngster I. Self-sampling for SARS-CoV-2 Detection in Children. JAMA. 2022; doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.15225.

From the editorial:
"Sampling is time consuming, expensive, and exposes the HCW to potential transmission from patients."

"The potential to conduct repeated population-based screening in pediatric educational settings, without the need for labor-intensive sampling that disrupts children's routines, is an important step in breaking the chain of transmission and might help keep schools operating in times of high SARS-CoV-2 activity."

While the tests need to be conducted, there is no reason asymptomatic children self-swabbing should not be able to achieve results equal to a HCW conducting the assay since the children have demonstrated they can follow the instructions. - Mod.LK]

[B] Omicron in children at day 7
Almost half of children infected with the original omicron COVID-19 strain still tested positive 7 days after they first had symptoms, calling into question guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how long to isolate, according to a small study [see citation below] late last week in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

University of Florida researchers screened 65 sequential nasal swab samples from 31 children who no longer had symptoms and were 0-16 years old. Swabs were collected starting at day 5 after symptoms first appeared, the point at which they would be clear to leave isolation, according to CDC guidelines updated in January [2022]. The children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.1, and the swabs were collected from 20 Dec 2020 through 21 Feb 2022.

Of the 31 children, 15 (48%) still tested positive by day 7 by rapid antigen test. The investigators also performed virus culture on the 1st 15 samples collected and found 100% agreement with the rapid antigen results, indicating the children were likely still infectious after their positive antigen tests.

The study authors conclude, "In this study, close to half of infected children remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 (and likely were infectious) for at least 2 days after they would have returned to school under the 14 Jan 2022 CDC guidelines."

They add, "Consideration should be given to lengthening the recommendation for 5 days of isolation before return to school, potentially in combination with requirements for a negative rapid test result."

[C] USA: COVID-19 trends
In the lead-up to the Labor Day holiday weekend, most US COVID-19 markers continued to decline last week, with cases falling 6% compared with the previous week and hospitalizations down 3%, according to the Washington Post tracker. However, deaths -- often a lagging indicator -- were up 3%. Currently, the 7-day average for new daily cases is 87 533, with the daily average of deaths at 490 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus_sn_coronavirus-us-cases-deaths_1&state=US).

In other US developments, the FDA last week provided clinicians with more guidance on evaluating potential drug interactions for prescribing Paxlovid (https://www.fda.gov/media/158165/download).

Also, the federal government said it is winding down its free mail-order distribution of rapid COVID-19 tests on 2 Sep [2022] due to a lack of funding by Congress to replenish the national stockpile. For a few more days, a 3rd round of tests is available by mail to those who haven't already received their quota (https://www.covid.gov/tests).

In international developments, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) posted 5 plausible scenarios on how the COVID-19 pandemic might play out over the next decade, a tool to help with pandemic planning (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-post-acute-phase-pandemic-scenarios-august-2022.pdf). It added that the scenarios are not mutually exclusive and that the situation could transition from one to the next. The scenarios range from a diminished threat to long, barely manageable winters to a new pandemic.

[The ECDC document posing plausible scenarios for the future of the COVID-19 pandemic is important reading.

"The scenarios and the associated public health response priorities outlined in this document provide a potential framework for defining overall strategic objectives and actions for managing COVID-19 according to a range of possible trajectories in the future."

"The public health activities outlined in this document that need to be considered in preparing for potential future scenarios include, but are but not limited to, surveillance, risk communication, pandemic preparedness, early warning, vaccination, medical countermeasures, NPI measures, and IPC measures." - Mod.LK]
