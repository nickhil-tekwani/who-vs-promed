A 6-year-old girl from Depok died from a suspected case of bird flu
at Persahabatan hospital, East Jakarta on Saturday [28 Feb 2009],
after having been admitted for [treatment] one day earlier. Her
mother said on Monday [2 Mar 2009] that her daughter had died after
suffering dizziness and fever, with body temperatures exceeding 40 C.
"My daughter had complained she was feeling dizzy last Wednesday, but
it wasn't until 2 days later that I took her to see a doctor," the
girl's mother said.

The doctor had diagnosed her daughter with typhoid fever and had
recommended taking her to Bhakti Yuda Hospital in Depok, West Java.
Subsequently, due to its limited facilities, Bhakti Yuda had then
recommended the girl go to Persahabatan hospital for treatment. "The
doctor at Persahabatan hospital said my daughter had only a slim
chance of surviving because the virus had already spread through her
body," she said.
