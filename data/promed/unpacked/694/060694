Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) is a disease that affects horses and
donkeys and can be lethal to people. It has been detected in Honduras in
the departments of Copan, Ocotepeque, El Paraiso, and Comayagua, according
to Lizardo Reyes Puerto, director of the National Agricultural and Health,
Services (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agropecuaria or SENASA). The disease
is transmitted by mosquito bites and can affect the central nervous system,
where it induces severe damage for which there is no treatment.
The Department of Agriculture (Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia or
SAG) says that it lacks the resources to establish a sanitary security
zone. SENASA has administered 16 000 vaccinations to susceptible animals in
the affected areas.

Four horses in La Libertad, Comayagua have died recently of Venezuelan
equine encephalitis (VEE). This viral disease re-emerges during the summer
in the county of San Lorenzo, Valle. Counties now affected are Ocotepeque,
El Paraiso, and La Libertad, El Rosario and La Trinidad in Comayagua; Santa
Rosa and Copan Ruinas in Copan. Lizardo Reyes Puerto, director of the
Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agropecuaria (SENASA) said they are looking
into whether the disease is spreading to other areas or not.
Instructions have been given to stop animal movements from the affected
areas. Mirna Moreno, from the Health Department, (Regulacion y Ambiente de
la Secretaria de Salud) has said there is an epidemiological alert to
detect any person affected by this disease.
At present 1800 vaccinations have been used to contain the disease in
horses, and another 14 000 are awaited from the Organizacion Internacional
de Sanidad Agropecuaria in Mexico.
