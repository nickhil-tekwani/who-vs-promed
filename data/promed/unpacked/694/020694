It is entirely plausible that a measles epidemic occurred. I have seen such
an outbreak near Kimalandjala, [in the Democratic Republic of Congo in
1991. While our health zone had difficulty in transporting vaccine over the
mountains into this region, it was thought our vaccination coverage levels
were sufficient. Field tests conducted following the epidemic found the
cold chain to be inadequate. A solar refrigerator was unable to keep
vaccine at the needed temperature. In addition, the vaccine was often too
warm for too long prior to injecting in children.
Measles is spread airborne with transmission via fomites. Multiple symptoms
not attributable to measles often manifest in such epidemics because the
virus is immunosuppressive, giving rise to attendant syndromes that are
difficult to characterize in advance.
Usually malaria, dysentery, or sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV or
hepatitis B are present subclinically in such populations. Measles causes
these other pathogens to surface.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if measles is indeed
responsible for the deaths in India, as we lack the tests to confirm the
disease definitively. Spun serum samples collected in heat-stable media
could be flown to an appropriate lab for testing.
