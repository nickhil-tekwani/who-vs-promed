Chikungunya Virus May Be Deadly, Indian Doctors Say
---------------------------------------------------
Chikungunya, the tropical disease that spread to Europe from Asia
last year [2007], may have turned deadly, according to scientists who
studied an outbreak that infected about 1.4 million people in India.

More than 3056 people may have died from the mosquito-borne virus in
Ahmedabad in 2006, based on a comparison of the actual and expected
death rate in the west Indian city of 3.8 million people, researchers
said in a study published in the March [2008] edition of Emerging
Infectious Diseases. [See; Mavalankar D, Shastri P, Bandyopadhyay T,
Parmar J, Ramani KV. Increased mortality rate associated with
chikungunya epidemic, Ahmedabad, India. Emerg Infect Dis (serial on
the Internet). 2008 Mar (date cited)
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/3/412.htm>. - Mod.CP] There is no
treatment for the disease, which causes fever, rash and debilitating
joint pain.

The finding adds to evidence that a strain of chikungunya 1st
observed on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean in 2005, and which
later spread to India and Italy, may be capable of causing more
severe and sometimes fatal symptoms, said the study's authors, led by
Dileep Mavalankar, associate professor at the Indian Institute of
Management in Ahmedabad.

"The virus infection led to multi-organ failure" and caused medical
complications in some elderly patients with pre-existing diseases,
Mavalankar said in an interview yesterday. A "lot of morbidity,
temporary and permanent, may have occurred due to the epidemic, which
is not studied or documented." A total of 15 Indian states and
territories, including Gujarat, the home of Ahmedabad, reported
either 1.39 million confirmed or suspected chikungunya cases in 2006,
according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in
New Delhi. No deaths were attributed to the epidemic, it said.

Mavalankar and colleagues calculated the average mortality rate in
Ahmedabad using official death and population records during the 4
years prior to the 2006 chikungunya outbreak, enabling them to
calculate the expected number of deaths during the epidemic year. The
actual number of deaths was 3056 higher than expected, they found.
"The excess number of deaths observed during the epidemic in
Ahmedabad suggests that estimates of deaths caused by chikungunya in
India need to be revised," the authors said. Officials at the
vector-borne disease agency didn't immediately respond to a request
for comment.

About 2944 additional deaths occurred between August and November
2006 around the time when chikungunya peaked, the researchers said.
Ahmedabad's medical officer reported 60 777 suspected chikungunya
cases in 2006. No major adverse event or other epidemic occurred in
the city between August and November. While chikungunya is "the most
plausible explanation" for the higher mortality rate, they said other
unidentified causes can't be ruled out.

The "very useful" study doesn't prove the lethality of chikungunya,
rather it provides impetus for further research, said Richard C.
Russell, professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney.
"It has provoked the thought that there may have been more undefined
deaths associated with chikungunya than was otherwise recognized,"
Russell said in a telephone interview from Sydney today [29 Feb 2008].

Chikungunya, which means bent down or to become contorted in the
Makonde language of southeastern Tanzania, was 1st described by
doctors in Africa in 1953 and regularly causes epidemics in 23
countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific.

Researchers considered the disease self-limiting and non-fatal until
the 2005-2006 outbreak on Reunion, when it was associated with at
least 260 deaths in mostly elderly patients. The epidemic on the
island, a French territory about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of
Madagascar, sickened about 235 000 of its 790 000 residents. Tourists
visiting from Europe and North America were also infected, drawing
international attention.

"Historically, chikungunya has never been associated with mortality
until this outbreak in Reunion," said Scott Ritchie, a medical
entomologist at the Tropical Public Health Unit in Cairns, Australia.
"People are still waiting for the smoking gun" and will be skeptical
about fatalities until doctors can prove the way in which it kills
those infected, he said.

The Reunion outbreak gave scientist the opportunity to study the
disease in more detail "and to observe some more severe cases and
excessive mortality," said Isabelle Schuffenecker, a biologist who
helped study the epidemic for France's national reference center for
arboviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers in Lyon. "It's possible that
fatal cases had "occurred in less developed countries where
chikungunya was not the major health problem," Schuffenecker said in
a telephone interview today [29 Feb 2008]. "We have no proof that the
virus was more virulent," she said.

Indian researcher Mavalankar says international health authorities
need to take the disease more seriously. "It seems to have mutated
and become more dangerous," he said. "Our estimate is that about 50
000 deaths may have happened in India due to this epidemic."

[The analysis of excess deaths in an Indian situation which suggests
that that chikungunya virus infection is more lethal than previously
supposed is persuasive but not conclusive for some of the reasons
expressed by others in the text of the report. Additional confounding
factors may be the uncertainty of the diagnosis (i.e., the ratio of
suspected to confirmed cases) and the the potential prevalence of
other agents with similar disease presentations, such as dengue virus.
