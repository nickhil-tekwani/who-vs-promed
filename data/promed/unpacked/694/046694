Bangladesh: jaundice epidemic affects Dhaka University
-----------------------------------------------
Jaundice has broken out in 3 dormitories of Dhaka University because of
contamination of drinking water sources due to the alleged negligence of
the hall authorities in taking timely steps. Around 400 residents of 3
student-dormitories, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, Kabi
Jasim Uddin Hall, and Muktijoddha Ziaur Rahman Hall, are at present
suffering from jaundice, residents of these halls have reported. A
masters-level student of the Political Science Department died of jaundice
in the early hours of Tue 9 Nov 2004 at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.
The student resided in the Bangabandhu Hall.
Students alleged that, although the attack of jaundice had been increasing
during the past 3 months, the hall authorities did not take any effective
steps to ascertain the cause, nor did they take any effective action. "It
is a water-borne disease, and supply of polluted water to these halls might
be the cause of this disease," they said. The 3 halls get drinking water
from the same source. Sources at the Pathology unit of Dhaka University
Medical Centre (DUMC) stated that a total of 36 students came in to test
their bilirubin blood levels in the last 2 days, and the test reports
showed 21 of them were suffering from jaundice. All the students were from
the 3 halls, sources said.
However, the university authorities finally formed an 8-member committee
yesterday [9 Nov 2004], headed by the chief medical officer of the DUMC,
Dr. Jahanara Begum, to look into the matter. The committee will have its
1st meeting today [10 Nov 2004]. Other members of the committee are Dr.
Abdur Rahman, Proctor AKA Firaj Ahmed, the provosts of the Bangabandhu and
Ziaur Rahman Halls, Assistant proctor Shafilullah, and 2 executive
engineers of the university.
Member Secretary of the committee Dr. Abdur Rahman said that a ward has
been opened, with 25 beds on the 2nd floor of the DUMC, for students
attacked by jaundice. "We made all kinds of arrangement[s] for treatment of
the patients," he said, adding that the students should avoid drinking
water without boiling it, and refrain from eating food in unhygienic
conditions. The committee might recommend the removal of wayside mobile
shops, where students sometimes take meals away from campus, as a part of
the prevention program, he added.

[Hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, or both, are candidates for
etiologic agents in this outbreak. Further information from the health
authorities in Dhaka would be appreciated. Hepatitis A virus infection
could be contained by vaccination, but only elimination of the source of
contamination of the water supply would ensure eradication of both virus
infections. - Mod.CP]
