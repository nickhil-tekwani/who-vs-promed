Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comment: samples collected from 3 bullfrog farms (farm A in Jiuru Township, farm B in Changzhi Township, and farm C in Chaozhou Township) were sent to the national laboratory (AHRI) and _Ranavirus_ was detected by PCR. The bullfrogs from farm A were co-infected with bacteria (_Aeromonas hydrophilia_) and viruses of the genus _Ranavirus_. The average morbidity and mortality of farm A are both 3.58 per cent. However, the owner of this farm observed very low mortality on some pools of this farm. As for farms B and C, viruses of the genus _Ranavirus_ were detected in routine health check samples. Their morbidity and mortality only ranged from 0.03 per cent to 0.05 per cent and 0.01 per cent to 0.02 per cent, respectively. There were no abnormal mortality or lesions observed in these 2 farms. Disinfection and biosecurity measures were conducted on these three affected farms. Monitoring and surveillance are still ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (national laboratory) / Bullfrog (_Rana catesbeiana_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 Apr 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Ranaviruses are a group of pathogens belonging to the genus _Ranavirus_ (Family _Iridoviridae_) that have been linked to catastrophic die-offs of larval amphibians in many parts of the world. This virus became an emerging infectious disease possibly due to a novel strain introduction or increased occurrence of anthropogenic stressors on the landscape. A few years ago, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed this pathogen as a notiÔ¨Åable disease.
