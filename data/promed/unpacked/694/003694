On 10 Apr 2008, a 2-person Medair Health Services Emergency Response
Team (ERT) began working actively in Yei and surrounding villages,
after receiving a request for assistance from another NGO
(non-governmental organization). Cholera had become an endemic
problem within Yei town, present throughout all of 2008, and now
rising primarily because of the onset of rains. A total of 118 cases
of cholera or acute watery diarrhea (AWD) were seen in the Yei Civil
Hospital from 12 Mar 2008 to 5 Apr 2008, prompting Norwegian People's
Aid (NPA) to request emergency assistance.

Across Southern Sudan, cases of cholera are on the rise in the last 2
years, stemming from sharp increases in the population, as people
return from being displaced and find few essential services such as
safe drinking water or proper sanitation.

At least 7 people have been confirmed dead from cases of acute watery
diarrhea in the central Somali town of Mahas, locals said. Medical
sources in Mahas, a district in the central Hiraan region, told
Garowe Online more than 135 additional people are ailing from the
disease and there are growing concerns of more deaths because the
district lacks sufficient medical facilities and supplies.

At least 116 female students in northern Nigeria have been
hospitalized with cholera after consuming contaminated beans, a
health official said Monday [21 Apr 2008].

The affected students, who attend a secondary boarding school in
Gombe state, started vomiting and passing stool hours after eating
lunch, said Garba Sa'ad, permanent secretary in the Gombe state
health ministry. "16 of the affected students have been discharged
while the remaining 100 are responding to treatment," Sa'ad told AFP
by telephone.

State authorities reacted by banning beans at all boarding schools,
pending the outcome of laboratory tests of the contaminated beans by
Nigeria's food and drug regulatory agency NAFDAC (National Agency for
Food, Drug Administration and Control), Sa'ad said. In 2006 over 200
male students of a secondary boarding school in Kafin Maiyaki village
in Kano state were hospitalized with potentially fatal cholera after
eating contaminated beans.

the incubation period seems short and it is not clear if a
microbiological confirmation of the diagnosis has been made.

Patients of diarrhea-related diseases have been on increase in Siraha
district following the onset of a scorching hot season in the region.
According to a district hospital source, the number of diarrhea and
other stomach-related diseases has been surging mainly due to the
prevailing poor sanitary conditions.

Dr Raj Kumar Chaudhari, chief at the district public health office,
said that the district hospital and other health posts in the
district are now packed with diarrhea patients.

Health worker, Amar Yadav, at the district hospital informed that the
patients were now compelled to sleep on the floor due to the scarcity
of beds. "More than 25 diarrhea patients daily visit the hospital for
treatment now," added Yadav.

Viet Nam: severe acute watery diarrhea with _V. cholerae_ positive cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 5 March 2008 and 22 April 2008 the Ministry of Health of Viet
Nam reported 2490 cases of severe acute watery diarrhea including 377
that were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_, the bacterium causing
cholera. The serotype has been identified as 01 Ogawa. No deaths have
been reported.

Until now, 20 provinces and municipalities have been affected. The
majority of people infected by the disease are Hanoi residents. The
predominant route of infection appears to be consumption of
contaminated food. Cholera bacteria have not been detected in
drinking water in Hanoi or in other affected areas but have been
found in some surface waters. Additional epidemiological,
environmental and food trace-back investigations are under way.

The Ministry of Health has been increasing health education and
launched a mass media campaign aimed at strengthening food safety and
personal hygiene knowledge and practices. Environmental disinfection
is conducted in the homes of cholera patients and a program of
intensified hygiene inspection of commercial food vendors is being
carried out.

WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health by providing technical
advice on aspects of the epidemiological and laboratory
investigations of the outbreak. In addition, WHO and other UN
agencies are exploring other possibilities of assistance.

In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any
special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.
Visitors coming to Viet Nam are encouraged to respect basic
precautions when consuming water and food.

[10] Diarrhea - Bangladesh (Dhaka)
Date: Fri 18 Apr 2008

The diarrhea situation in Bangladesh has worsened day by day with the
temperature increases. The International Center for Diarrhea Disease
Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B), a special research center and
hospital for diarrhea patients in the capital Dhaka, has received
hundreds of diarrhea patients over the last week.

An official of ICDDR, B, who did not give her name, told Xinhua on
Friday [18 Apr 2008] they received 418 diarrhea patients on Thursday
[17 Apr 2008]. "221 diarrhea patients have been admitted to our
hospital till 3 pm today," she said. She said that usually more
children are affected by diarrhea, but this year [2008] more adult
diarrhea patients were admitted to the hospital.

The official said the high temperature is the reason behind the
breakout of the diarrhea, as the weather has become hotter and hotter
since the beginning of April 2008. Most of the diarrhea patients are
from the lower-income group who work very hard in the high
temperature. They have no access to safe water and healthy food and
[easily become dehydrated] in the hot weather, [all of which can
lead] to diarrheal disease.
