The statement ("risk ... is approximately 1 in 20,000") is a prime
example of the Yule-Simpson fallacy commonly encountered in
epidemiology.

The statement suggests the risk is very low. But this is under the
assumption of averaging across sources. The risk of getting a
Salmonella-contaminated egg from the point sources involved is much
higher. That is why sample-and-test catches such sources and is the
basis of the new FDA Egg Rule.

[ProMED thanks Dr. LaBudde for his comment. The Yule-Simpson fallacy
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox>) is also referred to
as Simpson's paradox (or the Yule-Simpson effect) and represents an
apparent paradox in which a correlation (trend) present in different
groups is reversed when the groups are combined. This result is often
encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics, and it
occurs when frequency data are hastily given causal interpretations.
Simpson's Paradox disappears when any causal relations are derived
systematically -- i.e., through formal analysis. - Mod.LL]
