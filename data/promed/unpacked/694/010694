Key points
----------
Current week (18): 2-8 May 2022 / Cumulative weeks 1-18 2022 / Cumulative weeks 1-18 2021
- Suspected cases: 72 / 4527 / 1785
- Confirmed cases: 3 / 762 / 272
- Probable cases 0 / 36 / 3
- Deaths: 2 / 151 / 56
- Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 66.7 / 19.8 / 20.6
- Number of states affected: 3 / 23 / 14
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 3 / 95 / 57

Highlights
----------
- In week 18 [2-8 May 2022], the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 8 in week 17, 2022 to 3 cases. These were reported from the states of Edo, Ondo, and Benue (Table 3 -- tables and figures available at the source URL above).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 18, 2022, 151 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.8%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (20.6%).
- In total for 2022, 23 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 95 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 68% are from Ondo (28%), Edo (25%) and Bauchi (15%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range 1 to 90, median: 30 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.9 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases higher than that reported for the same period in 2021.
- No new healthcare worker affected in the reporting week 18.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Coordination Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate response activities at all levels.

Response activities
-------------------
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to states.
- The national emergency operations centre alert mode level 2 activated for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response.
- Lassa fever preparedness assessment carried out for 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).
- State public health emergency operations centre activated in affected states.
- The 8 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states.
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines.
- Dissemination of reviewed IPC [infection prevention and control] guidelines and health facility IPC advisory.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.
- Distribution of medical response commodities to states and treatment centres.
- Deployment of national rapid response teams to Nasarawa, FCT, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Taraba, and Benue.
- Coordinated sub-national Lassa fever surveillance and response intensive workshop.

Notes on this report
--------------------
- Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

- Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 3 new confirmed and 72 new suspected Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 18 (2-8 May 2022), indicating that LF virus transmission is decreasing. There were 2 deaths among the confirmed cases for week 18, 2022. Fortunately, no newly infected healthcare workers were reported in week 18.

The report above confirms that Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected is 23 so far this year (2022), and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 95.

Nigeria is now in a period where case numbers decline. Case numbers are likely to remain relatively low in the coming weeks. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred between weeks 3 and 11 in recent years and peaked in weeks 7-9 this year (2022).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from this and previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY
