Emergency Operations Center (EOC) - situation report 4: cholera
outbreak in Haiti
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- As of today [25 Oct 2010], the MSPP (Ministere de la sante publique
et de la population/Ministry of Public Health and Population), with
support from partners like PAHO and the CDC, has reported 259
fatalities and 3342 confirmed cases.
- Currently there are 12 cholera treatment centers being built to
support isolation and treatment of cases: 6 in Artibonite, 1 in
Central, and 5 in Port-au-Prince.
- The emphasis is on prevention by ensuring clean water, promoting
good personal hygiene, and food handling practices, including hand
washing and trying to prevent defecation in open areas.
- While no cases of cholera have been reported in Dominican
Republican, the outbreak has prompted the Government to mobilize a
contingency plan in the border area.

Thanks to Haitian officials' rapid response to our query, the National
Laboratory (LNSP) has officially confirmed the strain is not resistant
to doxycycline. It is sensitive [see below - Mod.LL] to doxycycline,
ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, but resistant to ampicillin and
Bactrim.

[The reader should be aware that Bactrim and Septra are brand names
for the fixed combination antimicrobial trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
which is also known as cotrimoxazole. Therefore, the sensitivity data
is flawed since it states that the outbreak strain is both sensitive
and resistant to this therapy. - Mod.LL]
