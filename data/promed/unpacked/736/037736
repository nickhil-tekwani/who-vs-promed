RABIES IN FRANCE: Imported case
See also: 22 June 2001
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 26 September 2002 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Report date: 19 September 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of suspicion: 29 August 2002.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 2 September 2002.
Outbreaks: Location Seine-Saint-Denis département, Ile-de-France region
No. of outbreaks 1
Description of affected population: a two-and-a-half-month-old dog imported
illegally from North Africa. After its arrival, the animal was in direct
contact with a dog and a cat that had not had valid rabies vaccination at the
time of contamination. These animals were euthanised and will undergo
diagnostic tests.
Diagnosis: the animal was taken to a veterinarian because it had difficulty
swallowing and showed signs of anorexia. During the examination, the
veterinarian was bitten and immediately isolated the dog for
monitoring. Subsequently, the animal showed clinical signs compatible
with a diagnosis of rabies and the veterinarian reported the incident to
the Seine-Saint-Denis Department of Veterinary Services. The decision was taken
to euthanise the animal.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Pasteur Institute, Paris.
B. Diagnostic tests used: immunofluorescence test, ELISA(1) and virus
isolation in cell culture.
C. Causal agent: genotype 1 lyssavirus of the Africa 1a phylogenic line.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the virus strain is from North
Africa (Algeria or Morocco).
B. Mode of spread: illicit introduction into the territory of the European
Union.
C. Other epidemiological details:
- The family that imported the dog from North Africa arrived by ship at
the port of Sète (Hérault département) on 16 August 2002 and drove directly
in their own vehicle to the Ile-de-France region on the same day.
- An epidemiological survey was undertaken by the
Seine-Saint-Denis Department of Health and Welfare and Department of
Veterinary Services to identify any people or animals that could have come
into contact with the animal found to have rabies, either during the
crossing on the ship, the drive to Seine-Saint-Denis département and since
the return home. According to the information gathered, the puppy remained
in the cabin during the ship crossing.
- All the people who had been in contact with the puppy were treated at the
anti-rabies centre of the Institut Pasteur.
Control measures:
a. The infected animal and the two animals in contact with it were euthanised.
b. In accordance with the regulations on rabies in urban areas, the
districts of Pierrefitte (where the owners of the puppy reside) and
Saint-Denis (where the veterinary surgery is located) were declared
rabies-infected by prefectural order for a period of three months,
resulting in the application of the following measures in these districts:
- vaccination of domestic carnivores against rabies;
- identification of domestic carnivores;
- domestic carnivores awaiting vaccination to be kept tied up or confined;
- tightening of control measures against stray animals;
- ban on shows and other gatherings of domestic carnivores.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

[Any individuals who may have been exposed to the dog anywhere along the
route from North Africa to the Saint-Denis and Pierrefitte districts
in France should report to the health department officials referred to in
the report for evaluation for post-exposure prophylaxis.
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is always urgent and should occur within
days. Since the date of suspected incident was August 29th, weeks have
now passed. However, human rabies has incubation periods up to one year
and post exposure prophylaxis is still recommended even when a significant
amount of time has passed (Human Rabies Prevention - United States,
1999 Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee
(ACIP) - see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/Prevention&Control/ACIP/ACIP99.htm>)
Canine rabies occurs commonly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America except
where significant efforts have been made to implement canine rabies
vaccination campaigns. Although there have been numerous examples of
successful canine vaccination campaigns in developing countries, they take
considerable resources and expertise. Worldwide estimates of human rabies
deaths exceed 50,000 cases each year, so prevention in dogs is the best
protection for prevention of human disease and is highly desirable. - Mod. PC]
