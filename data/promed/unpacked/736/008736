On Thursday, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said more than
half of the locally raised pigs had not been inoculated against
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The Council revealed the fact after the
disease was recently reported to have hit a pig farm in Penghu, an island
county off the southwestern Taiwan coast.
COA officials said they are still investigating how the FMD virus managed
to reach the offshore island county. An official admitted at a news
conference that local pig farmers have been reluctant to have their pigs
inoculated against the contagious disease, with the average inoculation
rate of major pig producing counties ranging between 30 and 40 percent. The
official added that the rate is even lower in some other counties.
Following the re-emergence of the disease, the official said the COA will
strictly enforce the requirement that pig farmers have their animals
inoculated. [This article does not tell us why the producers are reluctant
to vaccinate. There is no indication if COA officials are charging the
producers for the vaccine or if it is a mandated vaccine without charge. -

Local press reports said at least 10 FMD cases have occurred at pig farms
in various areas since last year, and claimed that agricultural and
quarantine authorities kept the outbreaks under wraps to avoid public panic.
FMD, which ravaged Taiwan two years ago, caused the death of 3.85 million
pigs, including those slaughtered, and financial losses of some NT$160
billion. The local meat market was seriously hit when residents refused to
eat pork for several months.
