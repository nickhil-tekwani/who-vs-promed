Animal Resources Minister Tiemoko Konate announced that 3 cases [poultry or
wild birds? species?] of the deadly bird flu strain H5N1 have been
identified in a farm near Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou.
The minister told Burkinabe public radio that "3 samples from Gampela (a
suburb of Ouagadougou) are H5N1 positive." A total of 65 samples had been
taken in different regions of the country and sent on 13 Mar 2006 for
analysis to the Italian laboratory of the World Animal Health Organization
(OIE).
Burkina Faso is the 5th African country to be hit by avian flu. The others
are Nigeria, Niger, Egypt and Cameroon.
Konate asked the public to keep cool and to report any suspected cases,
saying the government had ordered isolation of the farm concerned and a
cull of its poultry.
"The disease is a real threat. Before the threat was at our borders, now it
is within the country. We must continue to be watchful both inside and at
the borders," Konate said.
In line with a 200 000 euro action plan drawn up by the government in
February, a 3-km (2-mile) "security belt" would be set up around the
infected Gampela farm "where poultry movements will be banned," the
minister explained.
Officially the poultry population of Burkina Faso numbers 32 million birds,
24 percent of them in large-scale farms and 76 percent reared traditionally.
Experts from 46 African nations, joined by UN agencies, agreed [in March
2006] in Gabon on an emergency plan to fight bird flu, making a joint call
for funds from donors and African governments.
"We declare the necessity to give proof of a firm political engagement" and
for each country to give priority to preparing an integrated plan to fight
the disease, said a final declaration adopted 22 Mar 2006 after 3 days of
talks.
A UN mission returning from Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria said
that governments "do not dispose of the necessary resources to put in place
the minimal measures required to start to apply their projects."
The African countries promised to apply "coherent programmes of
communication and public awareness" to reduce the risk of the spread of the
disease and its transmission to humans.

The figures provided in the ProMED-mail posting 'Avian influenza -
worldwide (75)' of 2 Apr 2006 [20060402.0994] under the subtitle "Germany",
refer to Bavaria, not to Germany as a whole.
In Germany, 263 wild birds, 3 domestic cats and 1 stone marten have tested
positive for avian influenza H5N1 Asia so far.

[We are grateful to Prof Conraths for the 1st-hand complementary German
data. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Federal Research Institute for
Animal Health (FLI), is an independent higher federal authority affiliated
with the Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. It
does research in the field of infectious animal diseases of farmed animals
and related sciences. The Institutes of Molecular Biology, of Diagnostic
Virology, of Infectious Diseases and of Novel and Emerging Diseases are
located on the Isle of Reims. The Institute of Immunology is located in
Tubingen and the Institute of Epidemiology in Wusterhausen. The Institutes
of Bacterial Infections and Zoonoses and of Molecular Pathogenesis are
located in Jena.
As previously reported, 38 positive birds have been found among the 3992
wild birds already tested during the 3 first months of 2006 in Bavaria.
According to Prof Conrath's data, an additional 225 wild birds have been
found positive in other parts of Germany during the same period. Tabulated
data on the species of infected and tested wild birds throughout Germany,
along with their respective locations and chronology, will be helpful.
Avian influenza in wild birds is an issue which deserves to be handled in
its broad, extra-territorial scope. An initial contribution in this spirit
is Europe's map on Avian Influenza in wild birds, available at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/index_en.htm#>. The
map, accessed on 4 Apr 2006, was updated on 30 Mar 2006. It shows the
position (locations and number of outbreaks) in the ADNS (EU's Animal
Disease Notification System) region. On this map, a a single infected wild
bird constitutes an "outbreak." Species and dates are not covered.
Presentations of similar data from other countries and regions might help
in improving the understanding of H5N1 dynamics. - Mod.AS]
