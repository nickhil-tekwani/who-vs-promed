Mumps outbreak in British Columbia's Fraser Valley
--------------------------------------------------
AGASSIZ: A growing mumps outbreak has been reported in the Fraser Valley,
east of Vancouver and north of Washington state's Whatcom County. About 200
people have been verified to have the virus in areas as far west as Burnaby
in the Vancouver suburbs, Dr Elizabeth Brodkin, medical health officer for
the Fraser Health Authority, said on Tuesday.

In an average year, fewer than 100 cases are reported across Canada. The
British Columbia Centre for Disease Control is convening a provincial task
force to meet in two weeks to develop a strategy for combatting the
outbreak, Brodkin said. Mumps is spread through saliva, and health
officials warned against the sharing of water bottles, drinking cups,
musical instruments, and cigarettes as well as coughing and sneezing
without covering the nose and mouth. "We've tried to do advertising to the
general public about the importance of not sharing spit because that's how
this thing has spread," she said. "We're calling it the don't-share-spit
campaign."

The virus arrived in British Columbia from Alberta, where 300 people were
infected, and spread through a Fraser Valley religious group that shuns
immunization, Brodkin said. "It's part of their belief system that this is
not the right thing to do," she said. "This outbreak, at least, got going
because it took hold in an unimmunized community, so they are the ones who
are really sitting ducks for infection."

About a third of those who are infected with the virus don't have any
symptoms but could still be spreading it. Symptoms include swelling of the
glands under the jaw and chin and can be as severe as meningitis or
inflamed testicles. Immunity to mumps dissipates over time, and people
who've had the disease 30 years ago could contract it again unless they are
revaccinated, Brodkin said.

[Previous outbreaks of mumps in Canada have been associated predominantly
with the dispersal of young adults from educational institutions.
Involvement of religious communities which do not permit vaccination has
been less common, although elsewhere frequently outbreaks of measles have
involved such communities. The mumps outbreak described above appears to be
an extension of the outbreak further west at Chilliwack (see: Mumps -
Canada (03): (BC) 20080615.1890) and involves a larger number of cases.

Mumps vaccine has had a checkered history. It is now normally administered
as a component of the triple MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. The
current vaccine is effective, and children should be given the 1st dose of
MMR vaccine soon after the 1st birthday (12 to 15 months of age). The 2nd
dose is recommended before the start of kindergarten. The current "Jeryl
Lynn" strain of mumps vaccine was developed by Dr Maurice Hillman from the
mumps virus that infected his 5 year old daughter (whose name was Jeryl
Lynn). Originally, just one dose of the MMR vaccine was recommended. In
1989, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of
Pediatrics, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, changed the recommendation to
2 doses.

Immunity to mumps virus infection is important for adults at high risk of
exposure to mumps infection, including college students and health care
workers. People born before 1957 are generally considered immune to mumps
through environmental exposure in their youth.
