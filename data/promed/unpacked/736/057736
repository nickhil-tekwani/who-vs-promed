Republic of the Congo: Ebola Fever Death Toll Rises to 81
---------------------------------------------------------
According to the data published today by the Congolese Ministry of Health,
at least 81 persons have died as a result of the epidemic of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever in the Cuvette Ouest Region (northwest Congo), on the
border with Gabon. The Ministry of Health information bulletin indicates
that the district of Kelle, 430 miles northwest of Brazzaville, where the
main focus of the epidemic is located, registered 72 deaths, while the
neighboring district of Mbomo, almost 500 miles further north, reported 9
victims since the disease appeared on 4 Jan 2003. In 1996, a similar
epidemic caused the death of hundreds of people in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).
Shortly before, WHO spokesperson Fadela Chaib had stated that in Cuvette
Ouest, 80 of the 97 cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever registered had died.
According to the WHO data, 72 of the 85 cases registered in Kelle died, as
did 8 of the 12 cases registered in Mbomo. According to Chaib, local
communities have begun to have a better understanding of this highly
contagious disease, and have less fear, thanks in part to the medical and
expert teams that have arrived and who are instructing them to not eat dead
monkeys found in the forest, as well as to change their burial rites.
