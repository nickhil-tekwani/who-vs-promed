Mysterious disease continues to claim cattle in Senapati village
----------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 more cattle have been claimed by the 'mysterious
disease' that spread in and around the Makhan village of Manipur's
Senapati district even as state Veterinary Department still has no
clue about the disease.

On 11 Jul 2011, Newmai News Network had reported that over 50 cows
and buffaloes had been killed by the mysterious disease. A team of
officials of the state veterinary department led by its joint director
had visited Makhan village and took stock of the situation on
Wednesday (13 Jul 2011).

While collecting samples required for determining the disease, the
team also provided medicines. They also administered injections to the
cattle infected by the disease as a step towards contentment of the
disease.

Since the day, the number of cattle claimed by the disease has been
reduced but steps to control the disease were yet to be taken up.
There were still apprehensions of killing of cattle in the mind of the
villagers, said Athuiliu, a villager over the phone. He also lamented
that officials of the veterinary department had failed to revisit the
village. "We are unhappy with attitude of the officials when they
remain silent without informing us about the disease till date," he
said.

As no help could be expected from the veterinary department,
villagers have decided to consult with a veterinary clinic. They are
raising funds among themselves to meet the expenditure to be incurred
while consulting the clinic, he added.

The unknown disease, villagers believe, is communicable to the cattle
sharing grazing ground. When an uninfected cow or buffalo happened to
share the grazing with infected cattle, the disease spreads, they
said, adding that the only precautionary measure taken up by them was
to avoid their cattle sharing grazing ground with infected cattle.

In may be recalled that Newmai News Network had, on 11 Jul 2011,
reported claiming of over 50 cattle by an outbreak of the mysterious
disease in Makhan and its surrounding villages around.

[No clinical signs nor PM changes are available. These data are
anticipated in relation to any die-off in cattle, anywhere -- to
exclude a zoonotic potential and/or infectious disease potentially
spreading within or beyond the national boundaries.

Such information, preferably immediately after the onset of the
die-off, has become even more essential in view of the world declared
free of rinderpest, with vaccination world-widely banned. Rinderpest
has been retained on OIE list to facilitate early recognition and
reporting in the (unlikely) event of re-emergence. - Mod.AS]

Mysterious buffaloes deaths in Kaithal district
-----------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease in Khanpur village of Kaithal district led to
the sudden deaths of nearly 25 buffalos in the past 24 hours, plunging
the villagers into mourning.

A team of doctors rushed to the village after reports of the disease,
which is killing one cattle almost every hour, since Friday evening,
but have so far failed to identify the disease or the cause of so many
deaths.

The disease was noticed on Friday [15 Jul 2011] evening when
buffaloes started falling to the ground following which villagers
consulted a veterinary assistant in the village. But even after
treatment there was no improvement and buffalos started dying by late
night on Friday. Villagers informed that the buffalos stopped taking
fodder or hay initially and then laid on the floor. A farmer informed
that he had brought his buffalo home from the village pond along with
many other villagers. The symptoms started soon after returning home.

[Further information, preferably including lab results, is required.
A per-acute death of cattle immediately after returning from pasture
is suspected to be related to intoxications. This deserves a
veterinary investigation to identify the causative agent, as well as
to exclude other possible causes, including infectious ones. -
