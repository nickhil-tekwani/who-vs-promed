Hundreds of British tourists have been hit by an intestinal infection
at a hotel in Kenya, which suffered a similar outbreak in August
2007. Holidaymakers returning from the Sun'n Sand Hotel in Kikambala,
have complained about being severely ill while there and some have
now had their condition confirmed as salmonellosis.

[It is not clear whether tourists returning to other countries in the
EU or elsewhere have been likewise affected. It is also difficult to
assess from the posting exactly how many tourists were affected.

Additionally, it is possible that the symptoms are of multifactorial
etiology. If other multiple bacteria pathogens such as
_Campylobacter_, _Shigella_, and different serotypes of _Salmonella_
and/or viral pathogens are found, this scenario suggests a sanitation
issue such as a sewage-contaminated water supply. If only a single
pathogen is found, a food vehicle may be more significant.
