The press release from WHO is a bit different than what was reported in
the Financial Times. I would suggest anyone interested go to their
website and review their statements.
Financial Times used the word 'family' instead of familial. This
concerned me enough to look it up.

If I am not reading their recommendations incorrectly, WHO recommended
excluding members of families of "inherited" CJD victims, not members of all
families of CJD sufferers.
If, in fact, they do limit it to families of "inherited" CJD victims, how do
they propose identifying those families with the inherited CJD vs. sporadic
or iatrophic? In the US there seems to be no tracking of CJD at all, much
less identifying the genetic strains of CJD.
Second, if CJD is "inherited," how would the blood from family members be
infectious? Is WHO making a backhanded statement that "inherited" CJD is
infectious?

While convalescing, and "lurking", I had not intended to start posting
yet a while, but to me the subject of blood transfusion is now of more
than academic interest -- I received one while undergoing my second
(emergency) surgery very recently.

The WHO Statement actually said on that subject --
"Although there has been no proven or even probable instance of CJD
transmission from human to human by blood transfusion or blood products,
observation must continue. The experts concluded that blood transfusions
continue to be safe. Routine internationally recognized donor selection
criteria should exclude individuals who are at risk of CJD and other
familial TSE. Persons who have undergone treatment using extracts of human
pituitary gland (growth hormone and gonadotropin), have received human dura
mater grafts and have a family history of CJD or other familial TSE should
be excluded from giving blood."
Somewhat different from the Financial Times journalist's interpretation.
Thus, the three named groups of people "identified as potential risk groups"
do not include "people who consumed UK beef products in the 1980s", and
there is no direct mention of this particular decision having been taken "in
the light of scientific evidence suggesting a link between BSE and nvCJD".
The full text of the WHO Statement is as follows --
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Press Release WHO/27
27 March 1997
SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES:
NEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON MEDICAL PRODUCTS
In the light of recent scientific information and as part of the
continued monitoring of risks to public health by the World
Health Organization (WHO), an international consultation of experts
was convened in Geneva from 24 to 26 March 1997 on the issue of human
and animal spongiform encephalopathies and medical products.
The consultation, which brought together 50 experts from 15 countries,
sought in addition to examine the situation of humans and the recent
observations on the nature of the causal agent, while providing an
update on the situation of spongiform encephalopathies in cows and
possibly in sheep.
The experts confirmed their previous conclusions and statements on
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), including the need
for continued and intensified research, which remains hampered by the
lack of a diagnostic test that can identify the infection early in its
course before the onset of symptoms. They also concluded that the new
information does not change previous recommendations regarding milk
and gelatin safety, and reiterated that still no link can definitely
be established between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the
variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) although recent
findings further support the hypothesis.
The consultation has made the following recommendations:
Medical Products and sources of animal origin:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whenever possible, cattle (bovine) sources should be avoided for
the preparation of medicinal products and devices; other animal
species naturally affected by a TSE should likewise be avoided as an
alternative source.
If unable to avoid bovine sources, source countries should be
those which have low or no BSE confirmed by an effective surveillance
system among cattle, and where the possibility of contamination during
the collection of material is maintained at a minimum. In addition,
inactivation and or removal procedures should be used where possible.
The consultation further recommended these guidelines should also be
applied to medical products from other animal species with
naturally-acquired TSE.
Medical Products and devices of human origin:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although there has been no proven or even probable instance of CJD
transmission from human to human by blood transfusion or blood
products, observation must continue. The experts concluded that blood
transfusions continue to be safe. Routine internationally recognized
donor selection criteria should exclude individuals who are at risk of
CJD and other familial TSE. Persons who have undergone treatment using
extracts of human pituitary gland (growth hormone and gonadotropin),
have received human dura mater grafts and have a family history of CJD
or other familial TSE should be excluded from giving blood.
In addition, as over 50 cases of CJD have resulted from cadaveric dura
mater grafts, the consultation recommended that dura mater should no
longer be used.
The main conclusion of this consultation is that despite the new
information available since May 1996, which has been carefully
examined, the recommendations developed at the time regarding products
entering the food chain still stand. Those regarding medicinal
products have been updated. At the same time, additional
recommendations concerning blood and blood products have been made as
outlined above. WHO will continue to follow the situation, taking into
consideration any new element that could modify or change its
conclusions and recommendations in the area of human and animal
spongiform encephalopathies.

If there is a potential risk of CJD transfer via blood supplies, and
having regard to the fact that CJD occurs around the world at a
remarkably consistent level of one per million per year (including the
UK figures incorporating the nvCJD cases), then blood products from
_all_ countries must be recognised by the international community as
potentially risky. Then there are diseases known to be transmitted by
blood where the risk is more that just potential. Perhaps the
greatest risk or potential risk is in countries where I understand
that donors sell their blood. and there is thus a financial incentive
to do so regardless of risk considerations to subsequent recipients.

I doubt that this is "in the light of scientific evidence suggesting a
link between BSE and nvCJD". If so it would be a stupid decision. It is
almost certainly in the light that:

who have had brain or other surgery in which duramater was used to patch
tissue; and families of CJD sufferers

In which case this post has no place here, being misleading at best.

And the numbers of people restricted is probably no more than a few
hundred worldwide.

Excellent idea. Since it's donated free of charge why should it go
elsewhere? This decision might well reduce the importation of blood
products from countries that pay for it, often to drug abusers and very
poor (and potentially infected with many other things) people.

transfusions", but there is a "potential risk".

Yup. Plenty of other things where the risk is not 'potential' but actual
and I rate them several orders of magnitude more likely to be
transmitted.

including blood, should be recognized as potentially risky. Especially
bovine blood and beef products from countries with high BSE numbers.

Fear not, only the Brits are allowed to eat British beef, including
'blood products' whatever they are. Due to the 30 month culling rule I
have never known it so good (except for hamburger joints that import old
cow beef from Argentina). It's all young, tender and delicious. This is
just as well since my family and I are just about to eat a big piece of
sirloin for my Easter sunday joint. Nice and red and bloody on the
inside such that you can only do with young tender animals. Bon appetit!

*** Welcome back, Ralph! ***
WHO's Press Release (WHO/27) of March 27 is, IMO, irresponsible.
Please, notice that the World Health Organization does *not* recognize
nvCJD as a potential risk for the blood supply.
The new variant CJD is an emerging infectious disease, an infectious strain
of spongiform encephalopathy. It's now a disease incubating in humans,in
countries where BSE contaminated beef products have been consumed, and with
a remarkably long incubation period.
It's a potential time-bomb, a serious health problem and the nvCJD epidemic
has actually already started, with future numbers totally unknown.
WHO's experts are suggesting that people who may develop iatrogenic CJD and
families with cases of inherited CJD should be excluded in the donor
selection.
I have suggested that all blood products from the UK should be recognized
by the international community as potentially risky. At least until a
satisfying test can be used to identify the infectious agent of nvCJD in
blood donors.
We can play it safe. Or, we can conclude that "blood transfusions continues
to be safe" (WHO/27), while they are potentially risky.
