[Transmission of the MERS-CoV is continuing in Wadi Aldwasir, Riyadh region in Saudi Arabia, with 6 of the 7 newly confirmed cases reported today (11 Feb 2019) occurring there. While the initial reports classify 3 of the 6 cases reported from Wadi Aldwasir as primary cases, I suspect these classifications may change for 2 of the 3 cases, (cases no: 19-1824, and 19-1825), especially case 19-1825, given the age and disposition as someone on home isolation, usually referring to asymptomatic or mildly ill contacts of previously confirmed cases.

There are 2 primary cases reported with a history of contact with camels, one from Buraidah in Al Qasim region, and the other from Wadi Aldwasir.

Since 29 Jan 2019, there have been 29 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Saudi Arabia, with 4 cases classified as primary cases and the remaining 25 classified as secondary cases -- 2 unspecified community contacts, 17 as hospital acquired infections, and 6 in household contacts.

It will be interesting to see the detailed descriptions of this outbreak as more information becomes available.

MERS situation update -- January 2019
-------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- 2298 laboratory-confirmed cases reported since April 2012
- 811 deaths reported since April 2012
- 27 countries reported cases globally
- 12 countries reported cases since April 2012 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region
- 5 laboratory-confirmed cases reported from Oman in 2019

Highlights
----------
- At the end of January 2019, a total of 2298 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 811 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 35.2%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1915 cases, including 735 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 38.3%).

- During the month of January [2019], a total of 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally; 14 of the cases were reported from Saudi Arabia with 3 associated deaths and 5 from Oman with 2 associated deaths. Of the cases reported from Saudi Arabia, 3 household clusters were reported with a total of 8 cases. The cluster reported from Oman included 5 young females (age range 30-59) living in the same region. Of these cases, 4 were secondary cases, identified through contact tracing of the 1st case detected on the 24th of January [2019]. Prior to this event, Oman has reported 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to WHO since 2012.

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2019, do not show any significant difference or change. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.

- The age group 50-59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[For those who are interested in the epidemiologic profile of the ongoing activity with MERS-CoV transmission, I highly recommend going to the source URL above where there are graphics showing the epidemiologic profile of the disease, including the epidemic curve, age distribution case classifications by transmission type, and a table showing the annual reported profiles of cases in Saudi Arabia.

The summary above gives the profile of MERS-CoV through the end of January 2019. Since then, there have been 36 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia, raising the 2019 reported total as of today, 11 Feb 2019, to 50 cases, more than half of whom are associated with the ongoing transmission in Wadi Aldwasir, Riyadh region.

Note that in addition to the 14 cases reported by Saudi Arabia in January 2019, there were 5 cases reported from Oman, associated with an apparent primary case and 4 contact cases. This cluster of 5 cases included 2 fatalities at least one of whom was in a contact case. Noteworthy is that this cluster involved all women. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Oman [11 Feb 2019]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
From [27 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2019], the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Oman reported 5 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. All 5 laboratory confirmed cases are females from the same family and range in age from 30-59 years. The source of infection in this cluster is under investigation in Oman and 4 of the 5 cases appear to be secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission. While all cases did not report direct contact with dromedary camels, they resided on a farm where dromedary camels and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is testing the dromedary camels. Details of these 5 cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).

Including these 5 additional cases, a total of 16 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by Oman since 2013. Prior to this cluster of cases, the last case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Oman was in March 2018 [see MERS-CoV Disease outbreak news 15 Mar 2018 https://www.who.int/csr/don/15-march-2018-mers-oman/en/ for more details]

Globally, as of [8 Feb 2019], 2311 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 811 related deaths have been reported to WHO. (This global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.)

Public health response
----------------------
For all cases, investigation of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Ministry of Health officials in Oman have established a contact list of healthcare worker and familial contacts in North Batinah Governorate. As of [4 Feb 2019], a total of 60 familial contacts have been identified, with 26 contacts classified as high-risk. All household members of MERS-CoV cases have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and tested negative, except 1 case reported above, who tested positive on [28 Jan 2019]. As of [4 Feb 2019], a total of 119 healthcare worker contacts have been identified. All high-risk healthcare worker contacts have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and all have tested negative. All identified contacts are monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV infection.

While no direct contact with dromedaries has been reported by any of the cases, they resided on a farm where dromedaries and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is investigating the dromedary farms. Samples were collected and initial screening results for have tested negative for MERS-CoV. Further results are pending. Healthcare workers were educated and provided a refresher training course in infection prevention and control measures. Family members were educated about MERS-CoV and personal and respiratory hygiene advice was provided.

WHO risk assessment
------------------
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be or potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[As of 8 Feb 2019, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection is now 2311 including 811 related deaths (reported case fatality rate 35.1 percent). In the small cluster of 5 cases seen in Oman, the reported case fatality rate is 40 percent, both in women with significant co-morbidities. Noteworthy is a 3rd case in this cluster with known pre-existing co-morbidities that pre-dispose to severe disease as well.

It will be interesting to see the final results of the testing of the camels in the farm, as well as other contacts of this cluster. One suspects that the initial transmission classification would most appropriately be "indirect contact with camels" if one lives on a farm where there are camels.

The ongoing transmission in Saudi Arabia, combined with the cluster of cases in Oman, serves as a reminder that while there may be periods of reduced transmission of the MERS-CoV in the Middle East, the virus has not gone away, and still poses a significant threat in the region. - Mod.MPP
