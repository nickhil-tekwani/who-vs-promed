Poliovirus weekly update as of 1 Aug 2018, World Health Organization
---------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 13
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 6
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2018: 21
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 96

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Democratic Republic of Congo, 4 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases
- Nigeria, 1 new cVDPV2 case
- Papua New Guinea, 1 new cVDPV type 1 case

Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of cases for 2018 remains 10. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2018], from Kunar province.
- No new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.
- Preparations for the August [2018] national immunization activity are ongoing.

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported this week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan province.
- No new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Nigeria
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The most recently detected WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] from Borno state.
- One new cVDPV2 case has been reported in the past week, with onset of paralysis on 25 May [2018], from Jigawa state.
- The country continues to be affected in 2018 by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] subnational immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 is also continuing, including to continue to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for the cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- [DR Congo]: 4 new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week, from Mongala and Tanganika provinces, bringing the total number of cases in 2018 to 11.
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication.
- The high-level meeting was convened by the Minister of Health, as well as the WHO Director-General and the WHO Regional Director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since the cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia is reporting a total of 4 cases in 2018: 1 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3, and 1 cVDPV2&3 with date of onset of the most recent case on 26 May 2018.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

Papua New Guinea
- One new case of cVDPV1 was reported in the past week, from Morobe province, with onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2018]. This brings the total number of cases in the country to 2 (both from Morobe province).
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces. In addition, 3 more campaigns are planned for late August, September, and October [2018].
- On [26 Jun 2018], the Papua New Guinea Government declared the cVDPV1 outbreak in Morobe province a National Public Health Emergency.
- The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with GPEI partners to launch a comprehensive response. The NDOH activated the National Emergency Operations Centre for the polio outbreak on [27 Jun 2018].
- Mop-up vaccination has taken place in Morobe and Eastern Highlands provinces with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV).
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented in 6 provinces and the National Capital District, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

[Well, the good news this week is the absence of positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The not so good news this week is the increase in cases of cVDPV reported from 3 countries: Nigeria, DR Congo, and Papua New Guinea. As mentioned in previous posts, the appearance of a case in Ituri near the border with Uganda is of concern, given the people movement in the area and between the countries. Added to this concern is now the identification of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu (Mangina town, not far from the city of Beni). The distance between these 2 cities is approximately 122 km (75.8 miles). With major population movement because of civil unrest in the area, the precarious nature of having these 2 events of public health importance so close geographically adds to the concerns (see map at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/dr_congo_map2.htm).
