Carlos Muñoz, from the provincial Department of Epidemiology, stated that this weekend a 64 year old patient from the El Bebedero area in the Tonosí district, was admitted to the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas [with a hantavirus infection]. Also, a 26 year old patient from El Cacao is [hospitalized and] currently on assisted ventilation.

According to health authorities, so far in 2018, 23 cases have been registered; 14 from Los Santo [province]. Almost all the patients have [a common] characteristic of having had contact with agricultural activities, movement of bales, with crops or cleaning houses that have been closed, among others.

It is recommended that producers keep their grain in plastic tanks and not in cardboard or paper containers that can be broken into by rats seeking the grain, creating [situations] that might lead to hantavirus [infection].

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in the province this year (2018) and now has reached 14. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama.

As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva. - Mod.TY
