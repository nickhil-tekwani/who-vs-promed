In February 2009, the 12th recorded case of Lassa fever, since
surveillance records are available, was imported to the United
Kingdom (UK). This is the 2nd case to be imported to the UK in 2009
and the 1st reported case to have acquired infection in Mali. Risk
assessment of 117 UK healthcare contacts with potential direct
exposure to the patient's body fluids was undertaken. 7 contacts are
considered to be at high risk of infection and are being actively
monitored for 21 days.

Background
----------
Lassa fever is caused by an arenavirus and is an acute illness of
between one and 3 weeks duration. The incubation period is usually 7
to 12 days but may range between three and 21 days. About 80 percent
of human infections in endemic areas are asymptomatic. The overall
case fatality rate is 1 percent, although it is reported to be 15
percent-20 percent in hospitalised patients (1,2).

The natural host of Lassa virus is the multimammate rat (_Mastomys_
species), which sheds the virus in urine and droppings. Transmission
of the virus to humans usually occurs via direct or indirect contact
with rodent excreta. Person-to-person transmission occurs through
direct contact with blood, saliva, urine, faeces, or semen (1).

Lassa fever is known to be endemic in parts of West Africa, with most
cases reported from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. People
living in rural areas of West Africa are most at risk of Lassa fever.
Imported cases to the UK are rare and occur almost exclusively in
individuals who have worked in endemic areas in high risk occupations
such as medical or development workers (4). Although there is some
evidence of endemicity in neighbouring countries (1,3-5), this is the
1st case of imported Lassa fever from Mali into the UK.

Clinical case description
-------------------------
In February 2009, a man in his 20s was admitted to University College
Hospital in London (UCLH) having been medically evacuated from Mali
with a 10-day history of fever and a diagnosis of falciparum malaria
that did not respond to treatment. He had been in a village in
southern Mali for 4 weeks, where he was working in remote rural
conditions on the border with the Ivory Coast. He had travelled
directly from the UK to Bamako, Mali and then travelled overland to
southern Mali. Although precise details of possible exposure to
rodents are not known, rodents including rats were seen regularly in
the village.

On arrival the patient was alert and able to give a clear report on
his medical history. However, he deteriorated rapidly and was
transferred to a negative pressure room in the intensive care unit.
He died of multi-organ failure later the same day. His malaria blood
film and rapid antigen test were negative and a diagnosis of Lassa
fever was confirmed the same night by PCR.

The patient was originally considered at low risk of Lassa fever
because the disease has never been reported in Mali and is thus not
considered endemic there. However, as he became more unwell his
status was upgraded. Standard universal infection control precautions
were followed and visors, but not full body protection, were worn
during the attempted resuscitation.

Virological analysis
--------------------
The diagnosis was confirmed in 2 different reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) assays targeting different regions of the genome and by
sequencing of the 291 amino acids at the N-terminus of the Lassa
virus glycoprotein C (6). The detection of Lassa virus in 2 different
RT-PCRs together with the characterisation of a unique part of the
Lassa virus genomic sequence constituted a definitive diagnosis.
Further studies including virus culture are in progress, and
sequencing of the entire genome of the isolate is planned.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus was distinct from other
Lassa virus strains but grouped most closely with a strain of Lassa
virus (Lassa (AV)) isolated from a case reported from Germany in 2000
(7) . The German patient had travelled through Ivory Coast, Ghana,
and Burkina Faso during the incubation period and the investigations
could not determine where he had acquired the virus. The British case
reported here had been working close to the border with Ivory Coast.

phylogenetic relationship of the Mali virus with other African arenaviruses].

Surveillance and management of contacts
---------------------------------------
An Incident Control Team (ICT) meeting was called by UCLH early the
following day to discuss risk assessment of contacts, safe
decontamination of the environment, and management of the body. The
ICT identified 123 people who could have come into direct contact
with the Lassa virus either through contact with the case or exposure
to body fluids. Almost all of these contacts were UCLH emergency care
and laboratory staff. All UK based contacts were assigned to one of 3
categories depending upon their level of risk (no risk, low risk, or
high risk, and were managed as reported recently (8). Contacts will
be monitored for 21 days from exposure.

None of the category 3 contacts received ribavirin prophylaxis. The
evidence base for the use of ribavirin prophylaxis is limited, but
category 3 contacts were given information explaining its possible
benefits and side effects and were left to make an informed choice.

The German air ambulance crew are being followed up and managed by
German authorities, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is
supporting health authorities in Mali in conducting field
investigations and in the implementation of control measures.

Discussion
----------
In the case described here, the reported diagnosis of malaria and the
fact that Mali has not been considered endemic for Lassa fever made
the clinical diagnosis difficult. As a consequence, the initial risk
of Lassa fever was considered low. Only when the patient developed
multi-organ failure 6 hours after admission was the risk of Lassa
fever upgraded. Universal barrier precautions were used throughout,
but not the high levels of protection currently recommended for viral
haemorrhagic fevers (9). As a result, 76 hospital staff were put at
risk in the space of 8 hours, and 3 of 7 category 3 contacts were
laboratory staff. Although transmission to healthcare workers from
imported Lassa fever cases is very rare, this can cause considerable
anxiety among contacts. There is only one reported case of
transmission in a hospital setting in an industrialised country, and
this was a seroconversion without clinical illness in Germany (10).

This is the 1st Lassa virus to be characterised from Mali. The virus
is closely related to isolates from neighbouring countries and was
amplified using a widely used diagnostic PCR test (6). There is
serological evidence that Lassa virus is present in Mali (3,5), but
this is the 1st proven imported case and has implications for current
risk assessment in travellers returning from this area.
