The Gabonese Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday [12 Dec 2012] that 150 suspected cases of chikungunya, a [virus] disease spread by mosquitoes that causes severe pain, had been recorded at the Melen regional hospital in the eastern outskirts of Libreville.

"From the clinical point of view, this strongly suggests an outbreak of chikungunya," said the statement read out on television by the Gabonese media adviser to the Ministry of Health, Marie Josee Ndombi. According to the text, samples are being examined to ascertain the origin of the epidemic of "fever, headache, muscle and joint pain raging in Libreville."

In late November, the Ministry of Health recognized the existence of an outbreak of chikungunya in the city of Mouila, 444 km [275 mi] south of Libreville.

At Mouila, as in Libreville, patients complained of the same symptoms -- partial paralysis of the lower limbs, abdominal pain, fever, flu, and headaches.

This is the 2nd time chikungunya has been reported in Gabon. The 1st outbreak took place in 2007. More than 21 000 Gabonese were infected. Crisis committees were set up at airports and in health centers, the latter against resurgence. Unlike malaria, chikungunya [virus], also transmitted by mosquitoes, is not as deadly. The disease is cured without complications.

The government recommends wearing long clothes at night, sleeping under an impregnated mosquito net from a health center, and destroying all mosquito breeding centers such as stagnant water.

[This is the 3rd time that chikungunya virus outbreaks in Gabon have been reported by ProMED-mail, the 1st in 2007 and the 2nd in 2010. The partial paralysis reported in the cases above may be a reluctance by infected individuals to move due to intense joint and muscle pain that is characteristic of chikungunya virus infections. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving results of laboratory tests on samples sent in to confirm (or refute) the clinical diagnosis.
