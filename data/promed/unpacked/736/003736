In the past week [7-14 Aug 2014], there have been 9 cases where bats have tested positive for rabies, according to Austin's [Travis County, Texas] Animal Services Office.

In several of the cases, the people came into contact with the bats near the Ann Richards Congress Avenue Bridge.

A total of 9 bats have tested positive for rabies since 7 Aug 2014, but no case in humans has been confirmed. While there was a 10th exposure case, the test was inconclusive because the bat was decomposed.

The Rabies Control Authority for Austin and Travis County would like to remind people to avoid contact with bats, especially a bat that is on the ground.

[Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the estimated 41 bat species in the United States, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species.

Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.
