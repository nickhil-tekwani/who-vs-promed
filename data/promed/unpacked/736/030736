North Queensland apiarist Graham Armstrong sends queen bees to hives across Australia at times when they are not readily available elsewhere.

Mr Armstrong said there was a real possibility the 'precautionary' 10-km control zone could be extended and, if that were to be the case, it would have far-reaching implications for the industry. "The demand for Australian queen bees overseas and all around Australia is very huge," he said. "So, if the mite does get a foothold in the Burdekin, this opportunity for a lot of beekeepers will be lost and it will cause a loss of honey production in this country as [beekeepers] have to wait further toward summer to get fresh queen bees."

His Burdekin operation, situated 90 km [approx 56 mi] south of the port of Townsville [map at http://tinyurl.com/j8qh4av] where the bee-killing parasite was found in a hive of Asian honey bees this week, includes more than 1000 hives and is one of the region's biggest pollinators and queen bee breeders.

Mr Armstrong welcomed the control zone established by biosecurity authorities in response to the varroa mite discovery, which restricts the movement of bees, hives, products and equipment. "A lot of small bee keepers do move hives at night time with no nets on. I think this would have to be stopped very quickly just in case because it could be an easy way to spread mites great distances in a short period of time," he said.

But he acknowledged the difficulty the increased restrictions would pose for the region's beekeepers and the $80 million [USD or AUD?] fruit and vegetable industry, which relied heavily on pollination services. "You've got millions upon millions of dollars of cropping that's planted and being pollinated. You can't have the result without the bees and so, you've got to have a look at how you map out the quarantine areas. It could become a very big, difficult wedge," he said. "If it was varroa and it was the destructor (species), they've destroyed so many bee hives in so many places around the world that Australia will follow suit no matter what happens."

Unchartered territory for Queensland biosecurity
------------------------------------------------
No Asian honey bees or varroa mites have so far been detected in Biosecurity Queensland's surveillance program, which is focused on the initial detection area at the Townsville port.

The varroa mite outbreak will be the first test of the industry and officers operating under the new Queensland Biosecurity Control Zone Act, which came into effect on 01 July 2016. "It sort of caught us out but didn't catch us out," Mr Armstrong admitted."So, a plan was already sitting there and an outlay of what to do. What we need to do is to be able to adopt the plan so it fits into the geographical area as you lay out quarantine areas."

Biosecurity Queensland officers will meet with representatives of the Queensland Beekeepers' Association and the Australian Honeybee Industry Council in Townsville on Mon [11 Jul 2016]. By coincidence, beekeepers from across the state will also be in Townsville next week for the industry's annual conference. People in the area are being urged to keep an eye out for bee swarms or feral bee hives and report them on 13 25 23.

Biosecurity Queensland action to date
-------------------------------------
- restrictions on movement within 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi]radius of bee hives, bees, products (excluding honey) and equipment
- searching managed and feral hives, focusing on immediate 2 km [approx.1.2 mi] radius
- setting traps to attract bees to check for varroa mite
- sweep-netting flowering plants and setting feeding stations to attract any foraging bees
- checking catch boxes set permanently around the port as part of the National Bee Pest Surveillance Program.

[The Australian veterinary services have confirmed that the mites from Townsville port (North Victoria; see map at http://tinyurl.com/j8qh4av) are _V. jacobsoni_ belonging to the Java/PNG haplotype (20160707.4331364). They have included the said information (updated) also in their follow-up report no. 1, submitted to the OIE on Fri 8 Jul 2016. The report includes the following Epidemiological comments: "Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_) hive detected in the Port of Townsville, destroyed on 27 Jun 2016. Dead bees and comb submitted for testing on the same day to the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Operational Science Program, in Brisbane. _Varroa_ species was detected. _Varroa jacobsoni_ was confirmed morphologically by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Black Mountain, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, on 30 Jun 2016. [They] completed DNA testing (mitochondrial marker) of the mites on 6 Jul 2016 and confirmed _V. jacobsoni_ (as distinct from _V. destructor_). Genetic studies of the hive were also carried out and the bees belong to the Java 1 haplotype. Further surveillance work, since 27 Jun 2016, has not resulted in further detections of Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_). Along with surveillance, communication and awareness activities within the community and industry are continuing" (available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20436).

This finding might become a considerable threat to Australia's bee industry and export, as can be deduced from information included in a "Project summary: _Varroa jacobsoni_: a new pest of European honeybees" which was authored by Australian investigators and published in 2014. Their study was funded by the Australian Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.

The following text is an extract from the said publication, available on the Australian web-site "BeeAware" (http://beeaware.org.au/archive-pest/varroa-mites/#ad-image-0). The study turned into a scientific paper published in 2015 (Reference below).

"_Varroa jacobsoni_ is a parasitic mite that has emerged as a serious pest of European honeybees (_Apis mellifera_) following a recent jump from its natural host, the Asian honeybee (_Apis cerana_).

In 2008, a bee pathogen survey in Papua New Guinea (PNG) found populations of _V. jacobsoni_ (of the Java haplotype) reproducing for the first time on the drone and worker brood of the local _A. mellifera_ and causing colony losses. This new _V. jacobsoni_ 'strain' was widespread in PNG, but not yet in neighbouring Papua (Indonesian province of western New Guinea) or Solomon Islands (east of PNG), where _V. jacobsoni_ (of the Java haplotype) also reproduces on _A. cerana_. But interestingly, very small numbers of mites were found in Papua and Solomon Islands that were reproducing only on _A. mellifera_ drone brood. Australia is one of the last remaining places in the world not to have _V. destructor_, so it's important to learn more about this new mite haplotype which is in close proximity to Australia (PNG, Solomon Islands, Papua) and understand the risk to _A. mellifera_ to Australia and around the world.

The research indicates that the mites now reproducing on _A. mellifera_ in PNG appear unable to still reproduce on _A. cerana_. Therefore, the adaptations required of mites to parasitise _A. mellifera_ appear to be permanent and prevent reproduction on _A. cerana_. However, multiple mite populations appear to have switched hosts to _A. mellifera_ and new populations may have started to switch permanently. Two genetically different populations were found on _A. mellifera_ in PNG and the small numbers of mites found in Papua and Solomon Islands reproducing only on _A. mellifera_ drone brood were also genetically different to mites in PNG.

Due to the complicated nature of _Varroa_ mite species, and their specific genotypes, 6 _Varroa_ mite species and their various genotypes are presented in a table [for the summarized table, please refer to the source URL]. The following footnote, addressing _Varroa jacobsoni_ (Java haplotype) in the Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_), was included: "Although the research indicates that once the switch has occurred from _A. cerana_ to _A. mellifera_ for the Java haplotype and that the change is permanent, this still has yet to be fully confirmed. If the Java haplotype Varroa mite were to enter Australia and establish in the North Queensland _A. cerana_ population, there is a possibility that the mite may be in the 'transition' phase between the species and adapt to Australian _A. mellifera_ populations."
