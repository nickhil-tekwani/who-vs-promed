[1] Cholera - Nigeria

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced that 470 fresh suspected cases of cholera and 9 deaths have been reported in the first 4 weeks of this year [2022]. The centre also said children from the age of 5 and below were the most affected. According to the NCDC, a total of 10 states have reported suspected cholera cases in 2022. The states are Abia, Adamawa, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Borno, Cross River, Kwara, Lagos, Taraba and Zamfara.

The centre, in its latest cholera report, stated, "Of all the suspected cases, 45% are males and 55% are females. Three states, namely, Taraba (201), Borno (88) and Adamawa (56), account for 73% of all cumulative cases. Ten local government areas across the 5 states of Borno, Adamawa, Taraba, Bayelsa and Kwara reported more than 10 cases each in 2022."

The centre stated, "Some of the challenges are difficulty in accessing some communities due to security concerns, open defecation in affected communities, and lack of potable drinking water in some rural areas and urban slums. The challenges also include inadequate health facility infrastructure and cholera commodities for management of patients, inadequate trained personnel in states for case management, and poor and inconsistent reporting from states."

The NCDC added that it would continue training in cholera surveillance, hotspot mapping and developing state-level preparedness and response plans, as well as maintaining communication with and support to states.

[2] Cholera - Malawi (Balaka)

The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera case at Machinga District Hospital confirmed on 2 Mar 2022. The patient reported to the facility on 28 Feb 2022, and rigorous investigations revealed cholera in the 57-year-old male patient from Balaka District. A press release signed by Principal Secretary in the ministry, Dr Charles Mwansambo, indicates that this is the 1st case of cholera in the current 2021-2022 cholera season.

Cholera, which is more common during the rainy season, is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio cholerae_. Diarrhea with or without vomiting is the main symptom of cholera, which affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated.

"The Government of Malawi through the Ministry of Health has put measures in place to prevent and control spread of the outbreak by intensifying surveillance including contact tracing of the index case. In addition, Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaigns have been conducted in cholera hotspot areas as well as distributing chlorine to the communities for water treatment, and sending out cholera control information to all the people through different channels," explains Dr Mwansambo in the press release.

The Ministry has further reminded all people in the country to go to hospital early if they develop diarrhea or if they are suffering from any other disease, saying medical supplies for treatment of cholera are available in all health facilities.

[3] Diarrhea - South Africa (Cape Town)
Date: Thu 3 Mar 2022

The City of Cape Town yesterday [2 Mar 2022] announced its clinics had reported a major spike in diarrhea cases amid the surge season. Diarrhea is a fairly common ailment during the warmer months, and it remains one of the biggest threats to children under 5. It is one of the leading causes of death in this age-group in developing countries. Between November and May, the number of diarrhea cases typically increases throughout the population as the warmer weather promotes the spread of germs. This is also known as surge season.

Mayoral committee member for community services and health, Councillor Patricia Van der Ross, said there had been a 70% increase in children younger than 5 presenting with diarrhea at clinics compared to the same time in 2021. "Surge season data tracks cases of diarrhea, pneumonia and severe acute malnutrition in young children. If these are not diagnosed timely and treated, it can have life-threatening consequences.

"The very hot conditions in the city have led to a noticeable increase in the number of children brought to health facilities with symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration," Van der Ross said. During January 2021, city clinics dealt with 1710 cases. This increased to 2908 cases during January 2022.

Van der Ross said the clinics provided services to diagnose and treat diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition and a number of other ailments that affect children.

[As stated by Lutwick et al (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
