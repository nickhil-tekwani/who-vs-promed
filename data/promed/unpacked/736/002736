Nauru: Dengue Fever Spreading in Refugee Camps
----------------------------------------------
An epidemic of dengue fever is sweeping Nauru, the island at the centre of
the Pacific solution refugee policy, as more than 20 asylum-seekers and
staff are "strongly suspected" of having the disease.
A vigorous attempt to solve the problem is under way in the 2 camps, which
house 457 asylum-seekers sent there after being intercepted en route to
Australia. Three "fogging" machines have been imported to kill the
disease-carrying mosquitoes. Children sleep in air-conditioned
demountables, and asylum-seekers are being urged to use insect repellent
continuously.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says 17 asylum-seekers,
including an Afghan girl, 9, and an Afghan boy, 5, are believed to have
contracted dengue fever in the past 2 months. A further 5 staff members
with the IOM, which manages the camps, are believed to have the disease.
All asylum-seekers suspected of having dengue have been sent to the
island's hospital for monitoring, but only a small number have had to stay
overnight. No one has so far developed the potentially fatal hemorrhagic
form of dengue fever. But IOM representatives have expressed frustrations
that asylum-seekers are not wearing insect repellent, despite being advised
to. Chief of Mission Cy Winter said none of the 22 community
representatives or "block leaders" had worn repellent during regular
meetings with IOM staff. Mr Winter said authorities were hopeful the worst
was over, but there were still concerns that it might spread in the camps
because people were not wearing repellent.
The outbreak on Nauru was so bad recently that 100 locals a day were
reporting to hospital with symptoms. That number has dropped to about 20
people reporting each day.

Australia: Dengue Fever May Be Spreading South from Cairns
---------------------------------------------------
There are signs that the dengue fever epidemic may be spreading south from
Cairns in the far north of Queensland, with a case of dengue fever reported
in Townsville.
An Aitkenvale resident contracted the fever about a week-and-a-half ago
during a visit to Cairns. John Piispanen, from the Tropical Public Health
Unit, says authorities are inspecting the suburb and hope to be able to
quickly stamp out any breeding sites for the mosquito which carries dengue.
"It's not what we'd like to have seen but...it's been reported early
between Townsville City Council and ourselves," he said.
"We've got a response in place that's in accordance with the dengue fever
management plan, so I suppose we're lucky we've got the mechanisms there.
We've got the advice early; this is the best possible situation if this did
have to happen." More than 200 Cairns residents have been diagnosed with
dengue since the start of the year.

Tonga: Dengue Fever Confirmed in 2 Persons Recently Arrived from Fiji
---------------------------------------------------
On Thu 3 Apr 2003, Tongan health authorities confirmed 2 cases of dengue
fever in Tongatapu, after blood samples tested positive in New Zealand. The
2 persons were reported to have recently arrived from Fiji, where there is
an outbreak of the mosquito-borne fever.
The medical officer in charge of the infectious diseases control program at
Vaiola Hospital, Dr Seini Kupu, said the pair is being monitored and nursed
in their homes. Health authorities have warned the public to destroy all
breeding areas of mosquitoes and use insect repellent and mosquito coils.
Outbreaks of dengue fever have recently been reported in neighboring island
countries like Fiji, Nauru, and New Caledonia.
