An outbreak of anthrax disease has been reported in Bududa District. This follows the death of 10 cows in Bumabara village, in Bunatsami sub-county.

The Bududa District agriculture officer, Dr Felix Odongo, says that tests carried out by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on Thursday [19 May 2022] confirmed the disease. He says one person succumbed to the disease, and 13 others are undergoing treatment after eating meat from an infected cow. He adds that they have tentatively halted the sale of animals in the open market and movement of animals in and out of the district. Augustine Wamini, the Bunatsami Sub County councillor, noted that the incident has caused fear among the residents because meat from infected animals was being sold in the markets.

According to WHO for Animal Health, infected animals may present with high fever, muscle tremors, and difficulty breathing seen shortly before the animal collapses and dies. Unclotted blood may exude from all the natural openings, and the body may not stiffen after death.

Although routine vaccination has been identified as the only viable preventive measure, local governments often rely on donations from other organizations to acquire the vaccines.

In 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries upgraded anthrax as a priority bacterial animal disease, but the government has not started supplying the necessary vaccines to local governments.

[Bududa District is in the Eastern Region of Uganda and on the border with Kenya: see https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bududa+District+wikipedia&FORM=LFACTRE. Bududa is the chief town of the district.

This outbreak, with its multiple human and livestock cases, reflects a communication problem in Uganda to prevent unexpected carcasses being butchered and the meat sold in local markets, and is compounded by comparative unavailability of the livestock vaccine. Stating that anthrax is a "priority bacterial animal disease" is meaningless unless supported by immediate action, lacking since 2017. Sterne vaccine is probably the cheapest vaccine in the world. Until it is available to livestock owners, we can expect anthrax outbreaks to continue in Uganda. - Mod.MHJ
