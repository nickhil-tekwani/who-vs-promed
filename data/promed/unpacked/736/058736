Fiji meningococcal C outbreak situation report; volume 2, 2018
National Update (1 Jan-5 Apr 2018)
Fiji Centre for Communicable Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Medical Services
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The Fiji Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MoHMS) declared an outbreak of meningococcal [serogroup] C on [Tue 20 Mar 2018]. The Ministry, through the National Meningococcal Disease Taskforce, continues to coordinate the response to the outbreak, including strengthening surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, clinical management, public health interventions, and risk communications.

Surveillance
------------
National surveillance is coordinated by the Fiji Centre for Communicable Disease Control (FCCDC) through weekly indicator based surveillance for meningococcal disease via 34 EWARS [Early Warning, Alert and Response System] sites; EWARS event-based surveillance reporting of suspected cases; laboratory based surveillance for _Neisseria meningitidis_; and active case investigation reports.

National update (1 Jan-5 Apr 2018)
----------------------------------
MoHMS is reporting both confirmed and suspected cases. Therefore, there have been a total of 38 cases from [1 Jan-5 Apr 2018]. Of these, 22 cases are laboratory-confirmed, and 16 are either suspected or probable cases (WHO case definitions). There has been an average of 2.5 cases per week in the last 4 weeks.

As of [5 Apr 2018], all cases were in the 19 years or younger age group:
- 39.5 percent of cases: younger than 5 years old
- 18.4 percent of cases: 5-9 years old
- 26.3 percent of cases: 10-14 years old
- 15.8 percent of cases: 15-19 years old

Males account for 63.2 percent of cases and females, 36.8 percent. 4 confirmed and 2 suspected meningococcal deaths.

A cluster of 6 cases was reported from Navesau Adventist High School (boarding school) in Ra from [28 Feb to 28 Mar 2018]. No deaths reported.

*The current national incidence for 2018 is 4.1 per 100 000 population (38 cases). The Central Division has the highest incidence of 6.0 per 100 000 (23 cases), followed by Western at 3.3/100 000 (12 cases), Eastern at 2.6/100 000 (1 case), and Northern at 1.5/100 000 (2 cases).

*The 6 Navesau Adventist High School cases were reclassified from Central Division to Western Division in week 13 [week ending 30 Mar 2018].

Interventions
-------------
Clinical case management:
- Clinicians have been alerted and have access to the new Meningococcal Public Health Management Guidelines.
- A nationwide training on the guidelines from [9 Apr 2018] covering all 4 divisions.
- Deployment of ceftriaxone to subdivisions completed.
- Ensuring access to rifampicin for prophylaxis of high-risk contacts.

Public health response:
- Nationwide training on use of the new guidelines to start [9 Apr 2018].
- Case investigation, education, rifampicin prophylaxis, commenced from notification of 1st case from Navesau Adventist High School. Active case finding at the school daily.
- Vaccination of students at Navesau Adventist School began [5 Apr 2018].
- Strengthening of infection and prevention control measures has been emphasized to all divisional and subdivisional officers.
- Involvement of the Infection Prevention and Control officers in the rollout of the guidelines.

Risk communication:
Implementation of the Meningococcal Disease Risk Communication plan, including dissemination of key messaging, mass media and school campaigns. Production of risk communication packages targeting the general public and specific focal groups.

[As pointed out by Kathleen Harriman, PhD, MPH, RN (Chief, Vaccine Preventable Diseases Epidemiology Section California Department of Public Health Richmond, CA, <kathleen.harriman@cdph.ca.gov>), the CDC recently updated their meningococcal disease outbreak guidance and no longer recommends the use of an absolute outbreak threshold. The new guidance can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:

8.3 Outbreak thresholds
-----------------------
"The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3- month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.

For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.

"For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.

"Box 4. Outbreak thresholds
Thresholds by outbreak type
Organization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.
Community-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.

"Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period) / (population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM [men who have sex with men], determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.

"Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.

9. Vaccination
--------------
9.1 Decision to vaccinate
"Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.

"The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak."

In terms of an organization-based outbreak, a cluster of 6 cases was reported from Navesau Adventist High School (boarding school) from [28 Feb to 28 Mar 2018], that is, more than the CDC definition of an outbreak of 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period. Vaccination, presumably with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine that covers meningococcus serogroup C, of students at Navesau Adventist School began [5 Apr 2018].

In terms of a community-based outbreak, with a total of 38 cases in the 1st 3 months of 2018 and the population of Fiji being 920 938 (July 2017 est.) (https://www.indexmundi.com/fiji/demographics_profile.html), the national attack rate is 4.1/100 000, as reported above. However, all cases in 2018 were less than 19 years of age and almost 85 percent of cases (32 cases) were less than 15 years of age. This age group represents the population at greatest risk; with 27.7 percent of the Fiji population or about 255 100 people in this age group (https://www.indexmundi.com/fiji/demographics_profile.html), their attack rate is 32 cases/255 100 (that is, 12.5/100 000) in the 1st 3 months of 2018, which is much more than the only 1 to 10 cases, or 0.11 - 1.1 cases/100 000 reported annually in years prior to 2016 (see prior ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Fiji: fatal 20180321.5701022). However, we don't have a breakdown by age for cases before 2016; but, assuming all the cases (1 to 10 cases) were 14 years of age or less, with about 30 percent of the population being 14 years of age or less, or about 270 000 children, the annual attack rate for children 14 years of age or less would be 1 to 10/270 000 or 0.37 to 3.7/100 000.

We are told in the report above that Fiji's Central Division has the highest meningococcal meningitis incidence of 6.0/100 000 (23 cases/383 333 population). However, assuming 30 percent of the Central Division population is under 15 years of age, this group has an attack rate of 20/100 000 (23/115 000).

Nevertheless, no mention is made about vaccinating all Fiji children less than 15 years of age or vaccinating this age group in the Central Division. Also, genotyping of meningococcal isolated would help establish an outbreak strain.

Fiji is an island nation of more than 330 islands in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) north east of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions, Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western, and 14 provinces. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/map-fiji.jpg.
