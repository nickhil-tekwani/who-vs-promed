From: "Justin Mason" <justin.mason@envirodis.com>

I read with interest the information available through your organisation
in regard to the recent fire in Belgium involving potential production
of dioxins arising from transformer combustion.
I am prompted to write following the extensive work that I and my
colleagues have undertaken in investigating dioxin contamination of a
full range of substrates (food, environmental samples, surfaces,
chemicals etc), including long standing contact with the Belgian
government and EC in regard to the food contamination issue of 1999.
As is common in our experience, a large number of theories about dioxin
behaviour abound, much only partially substantiated or based on limited
information.
Not wanting to contribute to this substantially further, I raise for
discussion that when magnesium burns, very fine magnesium oxide
particles are formed (smoke) and it may only be guessed what strange
catalytical effects, adsorption and dispersion effects this may have.
It is my experience that in the absence of detailed knowledge, a more
empirical approach is warranted.
In classical risk assessment terms, one has a source (the PCB containing
transformer oil), a pathway and driving force (the air and the fire,
with the energy of the fire driving the emission) and the target (the
population).
There are established computerised air dispersion models capable of
predicting dispersion into the air arising following a fire. In
addition to this, there are available analytical screening techniques
capable of assessing the level of dioxin contamination of a surface.
[I have to declare an interest at this point as I am involved in bringing
one such assay -- a bio-assay (CALUX) to market, which is capable of
effecting such a screen.
It is only when more well developed, empirical data is obtained that the
real risk of such events can be assessed scientifically. Until then
empirical investigation only remains.
