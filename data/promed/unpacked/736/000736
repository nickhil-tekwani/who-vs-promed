[ProMED-mail has received many questions about the assurance
that CWD was indeed sought. Ms Brown answered some of these
questions, such as where the test was performed and why IHC
was not performed. Her reply is below:
"All histology and ELISA testing was done by the Michigan
State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal
Health <http://www.dcpah.msu.edu/>.
"IHC for CWD for these deer was not done, as the BioRad
ELISA test indicated negative for all of them. IHC for CWD
is done only if there is an inconclusive result on ELISA for
a sample and is used as a confirmatory test.
"If you have any additional questions regarding testing
procedures, please contact Dr Steve Schmitt or Dr Dan
O'Brien. The MDNR Wildlife Disease Lab phone is (517) 336
5030." - Mod.TG]
