The turbulence at the top of Sydney Water has continued with two senior
executives taking indefinite leave. Both were heavily criticised last
month in a second report by Peter McClellan, QC, into the contamination
crisis.
State Cabinet yesterday approved the appointment of three new board
members, including former Liberal health minister and head of community
medicine at the University of NSW, Peter Baume. The other two members
are John Priest, a former executive director of Coca-Cola Amatil, and
Jeff
Wright, a former head of the Victorian Environmental Protection
Authority.
Mr Wright is manager of Wingecarribee council, which covers an area of
the Sydney Water catchment being targeted as a possible source of sewage
overflows. He will take a new position to be created by new government
legislation which will also restore tighter ministerial control over the
organisation.
The appointments follow a major upheaval during the past year which has
seen all but two directors depart from the board.
Since the contamination crisis erupted in late July, both managing
director Chris Pollett and board chairman David Hill have resigned. The
two men left within days of the handing down of Mr McClellan's first
report.
In his second report, Mr McClellan was highly critical of the
corporation's management, saying the initial crisis had been mismanaged.
