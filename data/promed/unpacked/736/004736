Please find herewith an "unofficial" report of the investigation on
the "Epidemic Paralysis" in Nepal. This report was provided by an
expatriate nurse working as a volunteer with the Bankey DHO office.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Onset: since 2 months
- gradual onset (no fever, no cough etc. only weakness)
- trembling of legs and hands
- swelling of legs
- weakness of limbs
- dyspnoea in some patients
- unable to walk after 1-2 months of disease onset
- paraplegia
Epidemiological features:
-----------------------------
- Disease started after Dashaai (a local festival in Nepal).
- Age group: 15 - 35 years
- Sex: male and female
- Ethnicity: Tharu
- Occupation: Agriculture
- Status: lower socio-economic situation
- Case distribution: Rural clusters
- Mortality: None
- Morbidity: lately few new cases. All are old cases with
increasing weakness of limbs.
Apparently there have not been vegetables for a long time in those
villages and instead of that the villagers were eating a type of
soya bean (moseura = local name) As now [fewer new cases are
reported it might be related to a food pattern (or lack of vitamin B
or so) although this also seems strange as usually the Tharus eat
quite well and have a variaty of different food habits and they also
eat fish.
[Up to now there are 41 cases reported and examined but apparently
there are a lot more (in one village there were 23 cases). They talk
about 100-200 known cases.
I did not see any case myself but I know that yesterday doctors from
the hospital and the polio program went there and they could not
decide what it was. If it is food deficiency we do not have the lab
equipment to test that...
