Diamond adds cat food to the growing list of recalled pet foods because of 'potential' _Salmonella infantis_ contamination.

Adding to the list of pet food recalls voluntarily posted recently by Diamond Pet Foods, the company has issued yet another recall in their product lines -- cat food, specifically -- because of salmonella.

_Salmonella_ [infection], also referred to as salmonellosis, causes digestive problems, and cats will typically present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. Other signs can occur.

[Salmonellosis] is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can be passed to humans as well, so care needs to be taken. Hand washing is a must -- even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.

Diamond added the products to the list to alert pet owners to the potential cat food contamination with a general edit to the information on its recall website regarding the Kirkland brand.

The company's website said the recall involves its Kirkland Signature Super Premium Maintenance Cat Chicken & Rice Formula and Kirkland Signature Super Premium Healthy Weight Cat Formula dry cat food. No illnesses with pets have been reported.

Distribution reaches to customers in the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia, as well as in Canada and Puerto Rico. Despite Michigan not being on the distribution list, the product could have made its way here via other pet food channels, the company indicates.

To determine if your pet food is recalled, please check the production code on the bag. If the code has both a "3" in the 9th position AND an "X" in the 11th position, the product is affected by the recall. The best-before dates for the recalled products are 9 Dec 2012 through 31 Jan 2013.

Pet owners who are unsure if the product they purchased is included in the recall, or who would like replacement product or a refund, may contact Diamond Pet Foods via a toll free call at 866-918-8756, Monday through Sunday, 8 a.m.-6 p.m. (EST).
