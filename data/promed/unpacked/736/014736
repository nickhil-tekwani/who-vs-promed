The US Fish and Wildlife Service says it has found white nose syndrome -- a disease killing bats across North America -- in a Jackson County cave that is home to the world's largest documented colony of endangered gray bats.

"Although mass mortality of gray bats has not yet been confirmed from any WNS infected caves in which the species hibernates," wildlife service Endangered Species Coordinator Paul McKenzie said in a news release Monday [8 Apr 2013], "the documentation of the disease from Fern Cave is extremely alarming and could be catastrophic."

The disease, which has been 100 percent fatal in other bat populations, was found in tri-colored bats collected during winter surveys at 2 entrances to Fern Cave National Wildlife Refuge. No visible fungal growth was found on hibernating gray bats during the winter surveys, but lab tests did confirm fungal DNA on swabs from several live gray bats.

The refuge that houses the bats is made up of 199 acres [80.5 ha] of hillside covering a massive cave discovered in 1961 by the National Speleological Society headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama. The society has played a major role in protecting the cave and the bat population. Scientists believe humans can transport the fungus on clothes and gear, so the cave is not open to the general public.

[Alabama can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/6foh. Jackson County can be seen on the map at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/alabama.shtml.

The Fern cave is remarkable and quite huge. It has over 12 separate levels, interconnected by numerous pits and canyons. The horizontal section of the cave is known to be over 15 miles (25 km) long and vertical drops of up to 450 feet (137 m) are found within this one cave. It is an astounding bat cave, sadly now affected by this disease.

While some people believe it has struck hard and fast, which it has, there are pockets of resistance and some caves have shown a glimmer of hope of more animals becoming resistant. Those populations are small, but they do provide hope.

Fern cave becoming infected is sad news as there are so many bats and it seems this disease has racked up another cave, leaving us hope the devastation will stop.
