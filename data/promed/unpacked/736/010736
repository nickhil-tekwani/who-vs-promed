Measles exposure on Auckland flight
-----------------------------------
Travellers on an Emirates flight into Auckland from Brisbane may have
been exposed to measles, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service
(ARPHS) has warned.

To date, 3 cases of the illness have been reported among passengers
of Emirates Flight EK434, which arrived in Auckland at 5:30 pm on Tue
11 Jan 2011. It is the 2nd report of measles being brought into the
country on an Emirates flight in a single month. [For a description
of the 1st incident, see the ProMED-mail post referenced as "Measles
- New Zealand: in-flight exposure, alert 20110111.0129" - Mod.CP]

"Measles is a serious illness and one in 10 people with measles need
hospital treatment," Medical Officer of Health Dr Cathy Pikholz said.
"The 3 passengers with measles would have been infectious at the time
of their travel on this flight. They were travelling as part of a
group who travelled to the Philippines and Singapore. Passengers who
were on the flight may now be experiencing symptoms, if they have
been infected." Measles is [contagious] before the rash appears.

Any passengers on flight EK434 who feel they may be unwell should
telephone their GP or call Healthline for advice before seeking
treatment because measles is highly infectious and people with the
illness can infect others in a waiting room.

"Measles is easily spread through the air, and people sitting in a
row close to an affected passenger are potentially at risk. Even
people sitting further away could have been infected, for example,
while walking past the passengers with measles, or while waiting in
the airport gate lounge. "People tend to underestimate measles -- the
reality is it can be a nasty disease," Dr Pikholz said.

Typical measles symptoms are fever, runny nose and sore red eyes.
After a few days a red blotchy rash comes on and lasts up to a week.
The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the
body. Children and adults with measles are often very sick.

[Those at risk are people who have not received the routine MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination administered to the majority
of the population during childhood. Measles is an acute, highly
communicable disease, transmitted by direct contact with infectious
droplets or, less commonly, by airborne spread. The incubation period
of measles from exposure to rash onset is generally 14 days (range
7-18). Patients are usually contagious from 4 days before until 4
days after the onset of the rash.

There have been no reports so far of any measles cases among
passengers similarly exposed to a measles virus-infected person on
Emirates flight EK406 from Dubai to Auckland via Melbourne on 3/4 Jan
2011. This suggests that the perceived risk may be more theoretical
than real since it is likely that the majority of the passengers will
have undergone routine MMR vaccination in the past and are not
susceptible to infection.
