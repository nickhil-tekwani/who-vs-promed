The directorate of commerce in Blida, after recording the food poisoning incident on Friday evening [9 Jul 2021], took urgent measures to close the 2 shops that marketed the milk product, which is likely to be the cause of this incident, according to what the acting director of trade said Saturday [10 Jul 2021].

Hedi Bouzkar explained that after the Hassiba Ben Bouali Hospital, located in the city center, as well as the multi-service clinic in the Adl district of the municipality of Ouled, received about 195 cases of food poisoning last Friday night [9 Jul 2021] due to consumption of milk, according to preliminary investigations, it was decided to take urgent measures, the 1st of which is to close the 2 commercial shops that marketed this product, located in the municipality of Ouled Yaish.

Also, 160 liters [169 quarts] of the milk product that was found in one of the shops was destroyed, as well as samples were taken from it to ensure its validity and to determine the causes of this food poisoning, says Mr. Bouzkar, expecting the results of these analyzes to appear within 4 days at most.

The process of monitoring the aforementioned localities resulted in a number of violations, as reports were issued regarding non-respect of the cold chain, as well as non-respect of the mandatory prior conformity control, which was transferred to the judicial interests, adds the same official, and this is pending the emergence of the results of the analyzes, which will result in the adoption of procedures provided by law. In continuation of the investigations, samples were also taken from the marketed milk product at the level of a dairy in the municipality of Karaou, which belongs to the father of one of the aforementioned traders, according to Mr. Bozkar.

It is noteworthy that the Hassiba Ben Bouali Hospital in the city center, as well as the multi-service clinic in the "Adl" neighborhood in Awlad Yaish, received about 195 cases of food poisoning last Friday to Saturday [9-10 Jul 2021], all of which left the hospital after receiving treatment.

[The incubation from the ingestion of the alleged vehicle to the beginning of symptoms and the symptoms present (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, presence or absence of fever) can be very useful in assessing the cause of the outbreak. It appears that the source of the milk product was a single dairy.

Blida Province in Algeria is southwest of Algiers, the national capital. The name Blida, or bulaydah, is a diminutive of the Arabic word belda, city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blida). - Mod.LL
