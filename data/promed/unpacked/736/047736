SARS spread in buildings by airborne droplets
---------------------------------------------
Virus-laden aerosols appear to be responsible for the large community
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurred in Hong
Kong in 2003, according to results of study of detailed airflow-dynamics.
Although this type of transmission is probably not common, "airborne spread
of a concentrated source of virus can infect many persons within a short
period of time," lead investigator Dr Ignatius T S Yu told Reuters Health.
In such circumstances: "Avoidance of close contacts alone may not be
adequate," he added. "The prevention of aerosolization of the virus source
should take priority," especially in hospitals. "One should think about
containing and/or removing the aerosols through engineering means, and
personal protective gear will have to be stepped up."
The SARS outbreak that Dr Yu and his team investigated affected more than
300 residents of Amoy Gardens, a private housing complex, they explain in
the 22 Apr 2004 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine [N Engl J Med
2004; 1710-2
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/350/17/1731>,1731-9
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/350/17/1710>]. Hypotheses to
explain the spread include direct person-to-person contact, transmission
through the sewage disposal system, use of communal facilities, and even
roof rats running through sewage and water pipes. The epidemic curve and
spatial distribution of the cases, however, are consistent with virus-laden
aerosols spread from a single source, the report indicates.
Dr Yu, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and colleagues obtained
detailed site plans of the drainage system of the housing complex, along
with meteorological data. They modeled the effects of turbulence on airflow
and the dispersal of pollutants. Among the initial 187 cases in the housing
complex, the index patient and 99 others lived in one building. The
epidemic started on 21 Mar 2003 and peaked on 24 Mar 2003, with onset of
symptoms occurring between 24 and 26 Mar 2003 in most patients. The risk of
contracting the infection was 5 times higher in units on middle and upper
floors than on lower floors.
An environmental health team found that a bathroom exhaust fan could have
distributed contaminated aerosols into an airshaft connected to other units
in the building. It appears that wind then distributed the aerosols from
open doors and windows to other buildings.
The index patient had extremely high concentrations of SARS coronavirus in
feces and urine compared with respiratory secretions, the authors note.
Because this patient had used a toilet in the building during a bout of
diarrhea, the authors suggest that "huge numbers of aerosols [were
generated] when toilets were flushed."
Similar events would require "a large concentrated dose of the virus
source, a mechanism of dispersing the source into fine aerosols that can be
suspended in air for a long period of time, and the appropriate weather and
wind conditions and topography so that the virus could be spread to a large
number of people in a short period of time," Dr Yu said. In such an event,
"many persons could be affected within a very short period of time [and]
transmission [could be] much more efficient than close contact
transmission," he added. The clinical implications of airborne transmission
are particularly important for infection control in hospitals and in public
indoor settings such as airplanes and schools," Dr Chad J Roy and Donald K
Milton write in a related editorial. Dr Roy at the US Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Maryland, and Dr Milton
at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston recommend aggressive
air-sanitation measures, such as upper-room germicidal ultraviolet irradiation.
Dr Yu and his colleagues are now planning field experiments using tracer
particles or gas under similar weather conditions. "Our team of medical
epidemiologists and ventilation engineers will continue to collaborate to
study other diseases and health conditions, infectious or non-infectious,
related to airflows and ventilations."

[A significant feature of the Amoy Gardens incident would appear to have
been the high concentration of SARS coronavirus present in the feces and
urine of the index case, relative to the amount present in respiratory
secretions. If this is a general phenomenon, it would support other
observations that handwashing was among the most important factors in
containing the spread of infection within hospitals. - Mod.CP]
