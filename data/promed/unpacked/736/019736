More samples show low levels of anthrax at ministry center in Durham
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 4 additional samples containing low-levels of anthrax were
found inside the building where a Strafford County woman was exposed
to it last month [December 2009]. State Public Health Director Dr.
Jose Montero said a total of 73 samples were collected last week and
only 4 tested positive for a low-level of anthrax. All came from
common areas of the building's 1st floor, he said.

The samples were taken [on 7 Jan 2010 - MHJ] by the Environmental
Protection Agency during a round of testing at Waysmeet Center last
week, the Mill Road facility that houses the United Campus Ministry
for UNH. In addition to the 4 samples, there are 10 samples that were
inconclusive and are being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for more specialized testing. Montero said the fact
some of the samples are inconclusive might indicate the level of
contamination is so low it's hard to detect.

The recent samples are in addition to 3 previous samples that tested
positive, one from an electrical outlet and 2 from separate drums
stored in the basement of the building.

Montero said officials would await the results of the additional
testing, which could come next week, before preparing a final report
and lifting the quarantine of the campus ministry building. Montero
stressed the building hasn't been condemned but will require some
cleaning before it can be reopened.

This cleaning could include soaking the building's surfaces with
bleach, but Montero said officials would need to evaluate the
situation before deciding what cleaning procedure will be used.

Montero said the Strafford County woman suffering from
gastrointestinal anthrax is out of intensive care and is in stable
condition at a Boston hospital. It's still unknown why anthrax spores
affected this particular victim. "There's no way we're going to be
able to answer that question, at least not yet," he said. Montero said
he hopes to get an answer some day and noted health officials haven't
been able to interview the woman yet.

The recent round of testing is reassuring to health officials because
it continues to support their belief that the risk of exposure and
additional cases is extremely unlikely, according to Montero. He said
the results also reaffirm health officials' hypothesis that the
patient became infected at a drumming circle event in the building on
4 Dec 2009. It's estimated more than half of the approximately 60
people who attended the drum circle have decided to take antibiotics
or get vaccinated against the disease, an option made available by the
state.

The African drums have been the focus of the state's investigation
because of similar cases involving animal hides used to make the drums.

[In that the new "4" do not mention drums makes me suspect that the
"10-to-be-tested drums" all came up negative. "Inconclusive" can,
unfortunately, mean anything you like, but thank God for
[confirmatory] PCR testing. One of the things we have learnt is that
the new hot-shot environmental [rapid] testing kits are seldom as
reliable as they are claimed to be.

If the contamination came from either or both of these drums or
similar circumstances in previous drumming meetings, there is no
knowing when this environmental contamination started. According to
the Washington Post
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011502674.html>:
"Public Health Director Jose Montero said Friday the samples were
taken 7 Jan 2010 from the 1st floor of the United Campus Ministry in
Durham."

There is a strong hint that the investigation is flummoxed. But why oh
why has the single case yet to be interviewed? I presume that there
are sound clinical reasons if, for example, she were comatose --
meningeal infections are not uncommon in anthrax. But in the meanwhile
