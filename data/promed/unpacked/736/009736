Detection of Ebola-Reston virus in pigs; FAO/OIE/WHO offer assistance
to the Philippines
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the detection of the Ebola-Reston virus in pigs in the
Philippines, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) announced today [23 Dec 2008] that the government
of the Philippines has requested the 3 agencies send an expert
mission to work with human and animal health experts in the
Philippines to further investigate the situation.

An increase in pig mortality on swine farms in the provinces of Nueva
Ecija and Bulacan in 2007 and 2008 prompted the Government of the
Philippines to initiate laboratory investigations. Samples taken from
ill pigs in May, June and September 2008 were sent to international
reference laboratories which confirmed in late October that the pigs
were infected with a highly virulent strain of Porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) as well as the Ebola-Reston virus.

Although co-infection in pigs is not unusual, this is the 1st time
globally that an Ebola-Reston virus has been isolated in swine. It is
not, however, the 1st time that the Ebola-Reston virus has been found
in the Philippines: it was found in monkeys from the Philippines in
outbreaks that occurred in 1989-1990, 1992, and 1996.

The Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family (filovirus) and is
comprised of 5 distinct species: Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire,
Bundibugyo and Reston. Zaire, Sudan and Bundibugyo species have been
associated with large Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks in
Africa with high case fatality ratio (25-90 percent) while Cote
d'Ivoire and Reston have not. Reston species can infect humans but no
serious illness or death in humans have been reported to date.

Since being informed of this event in late November [2008], FAO, OIE
and WHO have been making every effort to gain a better understanding
of the situation and are working closely with the Philippines
Government and local animal and human health experts.

The Department of Health of the Philippines has reported that initial
laboratory tests on animal handlers and slaughterhouse workers who
were thought to have come into contact with infected pigs were
negative for Ebola Reston infection, and that additional testing is
ongoing. The Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) of the Philippines
Department of Agriculture has notified the OIE that all infected
animals were destroyed and buried or burned, the infected premises
and establishments have been disinfected and the affected areas are
under strict quarantine and movement control. Vaccination of swine
against PRRS is ongoing in the Province of Bucalan. PRRS is not
transmissible to humans.

The planned joint FAO/OIE/WHO team will work with country
counterparts to address, through field and laboratory investigation,
important questions as to the source of the virus, its transmission,
its virulence and its natural habitat, in order to provide
appropriate guidance for animal and human health protection. Until
these questions can be answered, the FAO and the WHO stressed the
importance of carrying out basic good hygiene practices and food
handling measures.

Ebola viruses are normally transmitted via contact with the blood or
other bodily fluids of an infected animal or person. In all
situations, even in the absence of identified risks, meat handling
and preparation should be done in a clean environment (table top,
utensils, knives) and meat handlers should follow good personal
hygiene practices (e.g., clean hands, clean protective clothing). In
general, hands should be regularly washed while handling raw meat.

Pork from healthy pigs is safe to eat as long as either the fresh
meat is cooked properly (i.e., 70 centigrades [160 DEG F] in all part
of the food, so that there is no pink meat and the juices run clear),
or, in the case of uncooked processed pork, national safety standards
have been met during production, processing and distribution.

Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be eaten and should
not enter the food chain or be given to other animals. Ill animals
should be reported to the competent authorities and proper hygiene
precautions and protection should be taken when destroying and
disposing of sick or dead pigs. The Philippines Department of
Agriculture has advised the Philippine public to buy its meat only
from National Meat Inspection Services certified sources.

As a general rule, proper hygiene and precautionary measures (wearing
gloves, goggles and protective clothing) should also be exercised
when slaughtering or butchering pigs. This applies both to industrial
and home-slaughtering of pigs. Children and those not involved in the
process of slaughtering should be kept away.
