From: Jim van Steenbergen <jim@lci.lcr.nl>

Number of cases: Since the start of the epidemic 2300 cases have been
reported to the LCI. Date of onset of illness of the first case = 15 Apr
1999.
Disease: 82.5% without serious complications, 3 children died, 53 were
hospitalised (30 pneumonia, 4 encephalitis, 19 other), another 130 were
diagnosed with a pneumonia at home, 152 had otitis media, 87 had other
complications (mostly respiratory tract infections).
Age: <1yr 5%, 1-5 yr 30%, 6-10 yr 44%, 11-15 yr 13%, >15yr 7%.
Geographical spread: All over the country but mainly in the so-called
bible-belt where people live that do not have their children vaccinated for
religious reasons.
Vaccination status: 97% not vaccinated, 3% vaccinated. Reasons for not
vaccinating: 86% religious ("It is up to Him to decide who is going to get
a disease, not up to the Municipal Health Department"), 1%
anthroposophical ("to suffer from measles is good for the development of a
child"), 5% below the age of first scheduled MMR-I (measles, mumps,
rubella-vaccination in the Netherlands at the age of 14 months), 6% other
reasons ("forgotten", measles not a serious disease, not important enough,
fear of side effects, bad reaction on earlier vaccination, etc.), 2%
unknown.
The Ministry of Health brought these numbers to the attention of the
public. Municipal Health Departments and Mother and Child Health-clinics
organised special opening hours for measles vaccinations. With the
publicity we tried to convince parents that measles can be a serious
disease and that vaccination is an excellent preventive intervention.
With the experience of earlier measles epidemics in these groups (1987/88,
1992/1993) we expect this epidemic to continue another few months. Once a
case is notified to a Municipal Health Department vaccination is offered to
all contacts over the age of six months. Very few (parents) can be
convinced however. Besides, many cases go unnoticed as parents do not
always seek medical advice, especially not in uncomplicated cases. As was
brought to our attention by our Canadian colleagues we exported measles on
two occasions to Canada, leading to a small outbreak there. We apologise
for further inconvenience due to our tolerance (vaccination is not
obligatory in the Netherlands). The national vaccination coverage for MMR-I
exceeds 98%, but the unvaccinated are geographically and socially
clustered, leading to epidemics once the virus is introduced at a time when
there are sufficient newly born susceptibles.

[I have asked people who are convinced that the world is coming to an end
tonight that they might just as well give me all their money but they
failed that test of faith. No one need apologize for being tolerant but
health threats are more than just related to individuals. The
epidemiologic facts of this measles epidemic is a sad comment on education
(everywhere) but Darwinian evolution still is in effect. Thanks to Jim van
Steenbergen. This string is cut. - Mod.CHC
