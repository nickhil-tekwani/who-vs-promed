One in 10 sausages and processed pork meat products in England and Wales could cause hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection if undercooked, experts warn. There has been an "abrupt rise" in the number of cases in England and Wales as people do not realize the risk, scientists advising the government say. Sausages should be cooked for 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] to kill the virus, they said.

Although serious cases are rare, HEV can cause significant liver damage or be fatal. Official government figures show there were 124 confirmed cases of HEV in 2003, which rose to 691 cases in 2013. There were 461 cases in the 1st 6 months of 2014.

Professor Richard Tedder, at University College London (UCL), said HEV was "very common" in the UK; not all cases are noticed or recorded. "This virus is taking off within the pig herds from which this country sources its processed pig meat in sausages and pork pies," he said.

Prof Tedder said sausages needed to be "caramelized" -- cooked thoroughly -- before eating to make sure they did not pose a health risk. "It's a question of getting people to change," he said. "Everybody knows you can get salmonellosis from chicken."

He said the virus occurred in the animal and in the blood system and warned it would continue unless there was a "big change" in animal practices, such as introducing different hygiene measures.

Dr Richard Bendall, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said HEV was found in 10 per cent of sausages and processed pork meat. This estimate comes from a study that looked at the pork production chain in the UK.

Dr Harry Dalton, also at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, said the virus was not just confined to pigs; people had caught it from strawberries irrigated with infected water. Shellfish in west Scotland and Tuscany had also infected people, he said. In Asia and Africa, hepatitis E is more commonly transmitted by contaminated drinking water.

[Of the 4 recognized genotypes of hepatitis E, types 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens. The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C. Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. Vet Res. 2010; 41(6): 46. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2010018 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865210/):

The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, and D), HEV is the only one with certain genotypes (3 and 4) with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.

Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk. - Mod.LL
