Dengue Fever Outbreak in Caracas at its Peak
--------------------------------------------
CARACAS: According to Baldomero Vasquez, Health Secretary of the
Metropolitan Mayor's Office, the dengue epidemic that has caused great
concern in the entire country over the past few weeks seems to be at its
peak, at least where Caracas is concerned.
On 8 Sep 2001, the Ministry of Health and Social Development stated that,
based on preliminary reports, there have been 41 561 cases of dengue fever
during 2001. However, on 9 Sep 2001, 120 additional patients with symptoms
of the disease consulted emergency services. Of these, 31 cases were of
dengue hemorrhagic fever.
A report signed by Juana Rincon, Regional Epidemiologist for the Capital
District, states that these new numbers bring the total number of cases of
dengue fever in the metropolitan area for 2001, to 6401 cases, of which
5037 correspond to dengue fever and 1364 correspond to dengue hemorrhagic
fever.
