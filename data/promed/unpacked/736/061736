H7N9 Update
-----------
As of 28 Oct 2013: Rare, sporadic human infections with H7N9 avian influenza in China have been reported since the end of May [2013], following a surge of more than 130 cases with illness onset during the month of April [2013]. Most recently, China reported to the World Health Organization that 2 cases of H7N9 infection were detected there in October [2013]. Information about these cases was posted on the WHO website on 16 and 24 Oct 2013. These are the 1st cases of H7N9 reported since 11 Aug 2013 and bring the total number of cases reported to 137, including 45 deaths. These most recent cases are not unexpected and do not change the risk assessment for H7N9 at this time.

As CDC indicated in May 2013, evidence suggests that there is a seasonal pattern to the circulation of avian influenza viruses, with activity declining in warmer seasons and increasing in cooler weather. This suggests that H7N9 avian influenza activity -- among birds and people -- might increase again in China as the weather turns cooler. It's likely that H7N9 cases will continue to be detected this winter in China; however, it's not possible to predict how many cases there will be.

The most recent case of H7N9 in China reportedly occurred in a farmer who had contact with live poultry, suggesting that exposure to infected birds continues to be the main source of infection with this virus. There is no indication that the epidemiology of H7N9 has changed; China continues to report that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission with this virus. If more clusters of human-to-human spread or evidence of sustained human-to-human spread were detected, the risk assessment for H7N9 would change. In the meantime, H7N9 preparedness efforts by the US government have continued over the summer and CDC along with its global health partners are continuing to watch this situation closely.

[This CDC assessment firmly interprets avian H7N9 influenza virus infection in the human population of eastern China as a seasonal event now that greater control has been implemented to reduce human exposure to live poultry. So far the infection has been limited to the Chinese mainland (with the exception of a single case in Taiwan) and there has not been sustained transmission of infection from one human to another. The next few weeks will test the veracity of this interpretation. - Mod.CP
