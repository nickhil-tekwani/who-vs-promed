NSW: Fisheries investigate Sydney rock oyster parasite
----------------------
Fisheries are trying to unlock the secrets of a parasite which could
threaten Sydney's rock oyster population. The parasite, QX, is spreading
across waterways in and around Sydney, but at this stage very little is
known about it. "It has caused substantial deaths in the Georges and Tweed
estuaries but not in others, and it doesn't effect other aquatic animals,
it's quite bizarre", a spokeswoman from the fisheries office said today.

The most recent information shows the parasite, QX, which is harmless to
humans, has doubled its number of locations. "Latest tests have revealed QX
is present in estuaries in Merimbula, Wagonga, Tuross, Clyde, Port
Stephens, Wallis Lake, and Hastings," director of NSW Fisheries, Steve Dunn
said in a statement

"Previously, QX had only been identified in 5 estuaries in NSW -- Georges,
Richmond, Tweed, Brunswick and Clarence." NSW Fisheries is working with
scientists from the state's oyster growers, Macquarie University and the
Queensland Museum to solve the parasite mystery.

"There are several unanswered questions, including; is QX in all estuaries,
where did it come from and what triggers an outbreak," Steve Dunn said. Mr
Dunn said tests suggest QX could exist in the gills of Sydney rock oysters
without causing any harm, however once it moved into their gut some die.

"NSW Fisheries spent [Australian] $100 000 on scientific monitoring last
year, and we expect to spend a similar amount this year," Mr Dunn said.

"Over one million dollars has been spent in the last 10 years to come up
with disease-resistant and faster-growing oysters," he said.

[The parasite responsible for the oyster mortality reported is _Marteilia
sydneyi_, the causative agent of QX disease, a protozoan (_Paramyxea_)
pathogen of the commercial rock oyster in Australia (_Saccostrea
commercialis_).

_M. sydneyi_ has been causing mortality in oysters in culture in southern
Queensland and northern NSW for many years. Management of the disease may
be through moving oysters from susceptible sites (the brackish, estuarine
areas) to QX-free sites, which are generally more sandy. The oysters are
most susceptible during the summer (December - May). Water quality
(including less than optimal pH) may have a significant impact on the
immune system of oysters, and result in increased susceptibility/mortality
in affected populations of oysters. - Mod.TG]
