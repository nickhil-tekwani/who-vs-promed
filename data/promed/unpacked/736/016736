A 78 year old man died on Sunday in North Chungcheong Province. Although not confirmed yet, the cause of death may have been a deadly tickborne virus. The man was first admitted to a hospital in the city of Chungju with a high fever. He was then transferred to Chungbuk National University Hospital as his condition deteriorated. He died shortly thereafter.

The case has been reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [If confirmed, the man will become the 3rd person to die from the tickborne disease]. Health authorities said on Monday [27 May 2013] that some 30 suspected cases of the virus [infection] have been reported so far.

[It is presumed the infection described above is a case of SFTS (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome), a condition associated with a bunyavirus transmitted among livestock and humans by ticks. It appears to be widespread in China and Japan and has been described recently in South Korea. The characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described in detail by Yu XJ and colleagues in 2011 (Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China. N Engl J Med. 2011 Apr 21; 364(16): 1523-32. (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095).

Confirmation of the cases pending in South Korea is awaited.

North Chungcheong Province is in the centre of the Republic of Korea. The province is mostly mountainous, dominated by the Noryeong Mountains to the north and the Sobaek Mountains to the east. It is largely an agricultural area and is also the only true landlocked province in the country.
