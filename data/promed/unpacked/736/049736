A further outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) was confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health; FLI) when a wild boar carcass was found in the district of Gorlitz. The location is in the existing buffer zone and is about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of the Rothenburg/Gorlitz airfield and about 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the Neisse. Since this is south, i.e., outside of the previously endangered area, the restriction zones must be expanded. The expert group and the ASF crisis team of the SMS will meet shortly to coordinate this. The new restriction zones will be announced in the coming week in 2 general decrees from the State Office of Saxony. In addition, the ASF virus has been confirmed by FLI in a wild boar that was found near Skerbersdorf, approximately 80 meters (262 ft) from the Polish border. With these 2 new cases, the number of ASF-positive cases in Saxony increases to 19.

Minister of Social Affairs Petra Kopping explains: "The positive find is a boar that was found during the regular game hunt, which is carried out systematically in the buffer zone. The new find makes our fight against African swine fever more difficult. The epidemiological investigations have already started. First of all, we will draw a mobile electric fence around the location with a radius of 2 to 3 km (1.2 to 1.9 mi) to prevent any further infected animals from scattering. We will quickly adapt the existing endangered area and the buffer zone. It is positive that the previously endangered area is already completely closed with a permanent fence except for a few kilometers."

The 1st ASF outbreak in wild boar was officially recorded in the Free State of Saxony on 31 Oct 2020. With the new cases, a total of 19 wild boars were found positive for ASF.

African swine fever is a general contagious disease affecting pigs (domestic and wild boars), which is almost always fatal and incurable. There is no way to protect the pigs with preventive vaccination. The disease can be transmitted directly from animal to animal or indirectly via contaminated objects (clothing, shoes, vehicles) and food moved to other areas by humans. ASF is not contagious or dangerous for humans or other animal species.

[A "Pig Progress" interactive map presenting locations of lab-confirmed ASF in wild boar in western Poland (eastern and western clusters) and in eastern Germany is available at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-Poland/?dossier=35415&widgetid=0.

According to information published by the Brandenburg state on 20 Jan 2021, following the confirmation of 30 new cases of infection in wild boar, the accumulated number of ASF-confirmed cases has risen to 527; adding Saxony's 19 cases, the total number for Germany becomes 546 infected wild boar since the start of the epizootic in Germany in early September 2019 when ASF virus was introduced from western Poland.

So far, ASF virus has not been reported from domestic pig farms in Germany. - Mod.AS
