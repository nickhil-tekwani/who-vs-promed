Mpumalanga Villages Quarantined in New Anthrax Scare
----------------------------------------
LYDENBURG, SOUTH AFRICA: Tuesday [13 Feb 2001, 2 Mpumalanga villages near
the popular Bourke's Luck potholes were placed under quarantine after
veterinary authorities detected possible anthrax infection in a cow
carcass. The case, believed to have been infected by vultures from the
neighboring Kruger National Park, is the first in Mpumalanga since 1986.
Mpumalanga veterinary services director Dr. Paul Kloeck confirmed that
Dientjie and Elandsfontein villages had been quarantined after the
partially decomposed cow carcass displayed characteristic anthrax symptoms
including swelling and bleeding. Dr. Kloeck said authorities quarantined
the villages when forensic testing on an ear indicated a strong possibility
that the cow died of anthrax. He stressed that the tests were not
conclusive and that no further evidence of infection had yet been found.

All cattle, goats, and sheep in the villages have been isolated and will be
vaccinated. Any contaminated carcasses will be buried in a specially
prepared pit. Dr. Kloeck said burial was preferred to incineration, because
there were indications that anthrax spores could be spread during fires.
The outbreak follows reported infections in Schmidtsdrift in the Northern
Cape last week when 23 people were hospitalized after eating infected meat
from 2 anthrax-contaminated cattle. The victims all displayed skin lesions
and respiratory disorders but are reported stable and recovering in
provincial hospitals.
Dr. Kloeck appealed to rural communities on Tuesday to report any
suspicious livestock deaths immediately to Mpumalanga veterinary at
Lydenburg on (013) 235-2071, and any unusual human illnesses to the
Mathibidi Hospital.

[While spores can occasionally be recovered from the fire-plume during
incineration, the numbers involved are too low to pose any risk. However,
burial is now recognized as a significant cause of ongoing cases in later
years. Unless there is an obvious risk due to drought, carcasses should
always be burnt along with any bloody soil from around the carcass. Recent
burns in Nevada show that by using domestic napalm a cow carcass can be
100% incinerated on-site in 60 minutes, a procedure markedly cheaper and
faster than using wood and rubber tires; carcass incineration with wood
will take 1-3 days.
In Africa vultures do pose a risk, because after scavenging any carcass
they will fly to the nearest pond or cattle trough to bathe. This has long
been recognized as a risk in the game parks in spite of the vultures'
otherwise most effective consumption of dead carcasses.
Maryke Henton informs me that the Schmidtsdrift outbreak has apparently
finished. I apologize for the delay in posting this report. - Mod.MHJ
