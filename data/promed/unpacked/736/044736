It was learned yesterday [5 Apr 2007] that Xiamen No. 1 Hospital
recently confirmed a case of extremely rare visceral leishmaniasis.
Xiamen Municipality [in southeastern Fujian province] has no prior
reports of this type of illness. This may be the 1st case in China
this year. On 19 Mar 2007, the patient was admitted to Xiamen No. 1
Hospital. The 30-year-old Anhuinese patient had had a fever above 40
deg C (104 deg F), accompanied by chills, for more than a month
before hospitalization at No. 1 Hospital. After 11 days of
hospitalization, the patient's fever continued, rising high twice a
day. Upon examination it was found that the patient's blood cell
count was extremely low, and the patient had significant hepatosplenomegaly.

On 26 Mar 2007, large quantities of _Leishmania donovani_ were found
in the bone marrow smears, [leading to] the final diagnosis of
visceral leishmaniasis. The patient was treated with sodium
stibogluconate injections.

A case of visceral leishmaniasis was diagnosed in a young, returnee
labourer, who had returned from working in Xinjiang. Leishmaniasis is
spread through the bite of the sandfly. The patient was transferred
from a rural hospital to Wuhan Union Hospital and because he was
diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis, he was then transferred to a
specialized infectious disease hospital.

Experts at Wuhan disease control agencies say that since 1949,
monitoring has shown that sandflies do not breed in Wuhan, so
visceral leishmaniasis cannot originate locally and cannot be
transmitted in Wuhan.

An official with Wuhan Disease Control Center's Infectious Disease
Prevention and Treatment Unit says that anyone traveling for work or
tourism can take the following precautions against visceral
leishmaniasis caused by bites from sandflies:

- Use of mosquito repellent, mosquito coils, and fumigation by
burning dry artemesia to expel sandflies;
- avoid sleep outdoors;
- ask for screen windows and screen doors;
- in hill zones with visceral leishmaniasis, insecticide sprays can
be used during sandfly season (May-September).

In recent years, visceral leishmaniasis has appeared mainly in Gansu,
Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places.

[Our comment of 10 Mar 2007, to the reported case of leishmaniasis in
Xinjiang province, stated that cases were only seen in the hilly and
newly reclaimed desert areas in northwestern China (Zhi-Biao X:
Present situation of visceral leishmaniasis in China. Parasitol Today
1989;5: 224-8). A review of leishmaniasis in China concluded that
apart from sporadic cases in Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia
(Guan LR: Current status of Kala Azar and vector control in China.
Bull World Health Organ 1991;69: 595-601). If this case was infected
in Eastern China (Fujian) it seems that leishmaniasis is more
widespread in the country than previously thought.
