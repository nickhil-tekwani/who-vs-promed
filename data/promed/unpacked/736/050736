1st report of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus affecting chilli
pepper in Pakistan
M. Hussain, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic
Engineering (NIBGE), Faisalabad, Pakistan; S. Mansoor
<smansoor@nibge.org>, (as for Hussain); S. Iram, (as for Hussain); Y.
Zafar (as for Hussain); and R.W. Briddon, Department of Disease and
Stress Biology, The John Innes Centre, Colney Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UH,
UK. Accepted for publication 15 Apr 2004.
Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a bipartite begomovirus,
infects tomato and watermelon crops in the Indian subcontinent
(Padidam et al., 1995a; Mansoor et al., 2000). Chilli pepper, an
important crop on the Indian subcontinent, often shows symptoms
similar to tomato leaf curl, such as yellowing, leaf curling,
reduction in leaf size and stunting. Since chilli and tomato crops
overlap in the field, it is likely that chilli peppers may become
infected with tomato begomoviruses.
To assess the presence of ToLCNDV in chilli pepper, symptomatic plant
samples were collected from several locations in the Punjab Province,
Pakistan. To confirm begomovirus infection, total DNA was isolated
from leaf samples, resolved in agarose gels and blotted onto nylon
membranes and probed with a radioactively-labelled probe of DNA A of
ToLCNDV. The probe hybridised with bands in all samples collected
from symptomatic plants, when the blot was washed at medium
stringency.
To confirm infection of ToLCNDV, PCR was carried out using degenerate
begomovirus DNA A primers and products were obtained from these
samples. A nearly full-length clone of this DNA A product was
partially sequenced and was found to share 95 percent sequence
identity with DNA A of ToLCNDV. These results confirmed ToLCNDV
infection in chilli pepper in Pakistan. The DNA A positive samples
were also tested by hybridisation using ToLCNDV DNA B as a
virus-specific probe (Padidam et al., 1995b).
A positive signal was detected in 6 of 8 samples that were positive
using the DNA A probe. The presence of ToLCNDV was further confirmed
by PCR using specific primers for DNA B (Padidam et al., 1995), based
on the movement protein gene of ToLCNDV (BC1F
5'-CACCATGGCAATAGGAAATGATGGTATGGG-3' and
BC1R5'-AAGGATCCTCTTAATTTTTTGAATAAATTTGGC-3'). Use of these primers
produced products of the expected size from all samples shown to be
positive by hybridisation.
These results prove the occurrence of ToLCNDV in chilli pepper crops
in Pakistan. Previous reports have identified the presence of
distinct begomoviruses in chilli crops (Shih et al., 2003), but this
is the first confirmed finding of ToLCNDV.

[Tomato-infecting begomoviruses are particularly damaging to
solanaceous crops. In the 1970's there were only 3 tomato-infecting
begomoviruses in the Americas, but at present there are at least 14
new ones, of which 7 are distinct ToLCNDV species. Recombination or
pseudorecombination are driving forces in the evolution of new
viruses, especially in tropical regions.
Disease management of ToLCV depends in part on preventing movement of
Bt-infested plants (e.g.. tomato transplants) to virus-free areas,
where the virus can become established and implementation of
phytosanitary procedures.
Various control options include removal of infected plants (roguing)
and removal or burial of infected crop residues and intercropping in
combination with chemical insecticides and use of available resistant
cultivars. Use of plastic UV-absorbing screening material to exclude
Bt is another method. Genetic resistance to begomoviruses has been
reported in some wild _Lycopersicon_ species such as _L. hirsutum_
and _L. peruvianum_ which might be transferred to tomato. In
Pakistan, resistance to leaf curl virus has been incorporated into
tomato and chili cultivars.
