Another 2 Northeast Michigan herds have been confirmed to have bovine tuberculosis, according to a press release from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD].

A large dairy herd in Alpena County and a large beef herd in Montmorency County were found to be bovine TB-positive during annual surveillance testing. These are the 67th and 68th herds identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998.

Both herds are located within the USDA-designated bovine TB modified accredited zone, which encompasses Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, and Oscoda counties. Annual surveillance testing of herds and testing cattle before movement is required in this area to prevent the spread of disease.

Within the modified accredited zone, bovine TB is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population, and any shared contact between deer and cattle can be a potential source of infection. MDARD, Michigan State University Extension, Alpena Conservation District, the US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, and local producers are working together on a voluntary enhanced wildlife risk mitigation program for high-risk herds in the modified accredited zone. The efforts are to help cattle producers strengthen their herd's protection against wildlife interactions and bovine TB.

There will be an informational meeting for cattle producers in Alpena and Montmorency counties on 10 Jan 2017, at 7 pm, at the MDARD Atlanta [Michigan] office, 16860 M-32, Atlanta.

According to MDARD, a team of disease control experts and local producers, herd owners work to further assess the potential vulnerabilities on their farm. The team provides education on bovine TB transmission, examines deer behavior on their farm, and suggests changes to the farmer, which will help them heighten their bio-security. Also, MDARD has provided cost-share funding opportunities to producers for implementing some of the recommendations that may be cost prohibitive.

"This enhanced wildlife risk mitigation partnership gives these farmers access to the most knowledgeable bovine TB experts in the country, increasing their ability to prevent infection," assistant state veterinarian Rick Smith, DVM, said. "The importance of this program is demonstrated by the amount of time and energy donated to this effort, through these teams, by the cattle farming community in order to help their neighbors."

In 2017, community meetings will be held in these high-risk neighborhoods to discuss this effort and how farmers can work together to further reduce risk from this disease. Cattle producers located in or adjacent to Deer Management Unit 452 should contact the MDARD Atlanta [Michigan] office at 785-5616 to start the enhanced wildlife risk mitigation process.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
