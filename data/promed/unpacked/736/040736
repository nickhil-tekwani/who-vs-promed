The study was designed to compare information on premises with horses
infected with West Nile virus to information on nearby equine premises
where no West Nile virus infections occurred. In addition, an environmental
assessment was conducted to describe the geographic and ecological aspects
of case premises. Factors observed included precipitation, temperature, and
locations of case premises relative to horse inventories, West Nile
virus-positive mosquito pools, West Nile virus-infected wild birds,
elevation, and ecoregions. The study was a collaborative effort of
USDA-APHIS and animal health workers in 7 States with confirmed West Nile
virus equine cases in 2000. Analysis of the data collected for the study
was performed by Veterinary Services' Centers for Epidemiology and Animal
Health.
