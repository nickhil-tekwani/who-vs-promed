The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, has warned that a fresh cholera outbreak is spreading quickly in Yemen's vital seaport of Hudaydah, amid ongoing attacks by the Saudi-led coalition against the besieged provincial capital. "Over a year after cholera broke out in Yemen, killing more than 2000 people, the disease is back and spreading fast in ... Hudaydah," said the UN agency in a report on [Mon 6 Aug 2018], adding that port city has been "a target of continued airstrikes" by the so-called coalition in an attempt "to regain control of the city."

Cholera infection first became epidemic in Yemen in October 2016 and spread until December the same year, when it dwindled. The second outbreak began in the Arabian Peninsula country in April 2017.

Backed by Saudi-led airstrikes, Emirati forces and militants loyal to Yemen's former president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, launched the Hudaydah offensive on [13 Jun 2018] despite international warnings that it would compound the impoverished nation's humanitarian crisis.

Over 70 per cent of all humanitarian aid, and food imports pass through the docks of Hudaydah, which was one of the worst-hit cities in Yemen's cholera outbreak last year [2017] -- the worst in the world at its height. The Saudi-led coalition's current blockade on the city has triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the impoverished country.

UNICEF further said in an attempt to mitigate the risks of the new cholera outbreak, on [Sat 4 Aug 2018], it launched a week-long cholera oral vaccination campaign, with the cooperation of Yemen's Ministry of Health, targeting the most vulnerable 500 000 women, children, and men in and around the city. It added that "other mitigating measures implemented by humanitarian organizations include the continued provision of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities."

The low case fatality rate might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. Although the daily rate has dropped significantly from the same period in 2017, this many new diarrhea cases per day remains substantial. There had been a slowing of cases during the 3-month period of January-March 2017 as well. The daily rate seems to be moving upwards a bit. - Mod.LL
