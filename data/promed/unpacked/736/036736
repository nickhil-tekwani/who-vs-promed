Authorities in Zimbabwe's leading cattle breeding province have announced
an epidemic of lumpy skin disease [LSD], which threatens spreading into
other parts of the country because of the lack of vaccines. Veterinarians
in charge of the Province Matabeleland South [bordering Botswana and South
Africa; map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_pol_2002.pdf>] affirm that
this epizootic propagated quickly and has covered the whole of the area.
The veterinary officer in charge for the province, Polex Moyo, told PANA
(Pan African News Agency) on Tue 29 May 2007 that the government stocks of
vaccines were exhausted, recommending that farmers buy vaccines in retail
magazines, where they may still be available, in order to vaccinate their
animals. "Currently, we are engaged with the LSD vaccination campaign in
the districts Hwange and Binga, where the disease is widely spreading," he
added.
Matabeleland South is the principal cattle breeding region of Zimbabwe, and
the epidemic threatens the beef supply in the country. Frequent epizootics
of blackleg and FMD have led in recent years to the suspension of
Zimbabwe's meat export. The country was not able to control these
epizootics because of currency shortage for the purchase of vaccines.

[Lumpy skin disease, a vectorborne capripox transboundary disease of
bovines, previously an OIE list-A disease, has been recently recorded also
in Zambia (Zimbabwe's north western neighbor). Zambia's National
Broadcasting Corporation reported on 7 May 2007 the increased spread of LSD
in all districts of the Eastern province. The Provincial Veterinary
Officer, Joseph Sitali said vaccines were difficult to acquire because the
epidemic was not common in Zambia ("unexpected and rare"), and as such,
vaccines were not readily available. Similarly to Zimbabwe, he said "the
Veterinary Department does not provide vaccines" but advised farmers to
make their own arrangements to vaccinate their cattle. Eastern Province
last had an outbreak of LSD in 1998, and animals which were vaccinated have
a lifelong immunity against the virus. See

LSD was also mentioned in relation to Kenya. The following text is derived
from a Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Report for Kenya,
covering the period from 10 Apr to 9 May 2007, published on FEWS NET on 16
May 2007:
"The body condition of livestock remained good across the pastoral
livelihood during April 2007, attributed principally to a favorable season
coupled with the control of RVF and other livestock diseases, after an
aggressive vaccination campaign. The Arid Lands and Resource Management
Project (ALRMP) has, however, reported that while incidents of livestock
diseases declined markedly, the contagious caprine pleuro pneumonia and
lumpy skin disease remain problematic, particularly in Mandera, Turkana,
Ijara and Tana River districts. The ALRMP has stated that it is crucial
that the vaccination campaign is widened to cover the remaining
disease-prone areas." See

Since the 1980s, LSD has spread northwards and even beyond the African
realm. It seems to have become endemic in Egypt, where annual mass
vaccinations are being carried out, and has been recorded in Bahrain (last
reported incidence 2003), Kuwait (1991), Lebanon (1993), Oman (1984), Yemen
(1995) and southwest Israel (2006). The latter outbreak was eradicated by
stamping out, combined with ring vaccinations. - Mod.AS]
