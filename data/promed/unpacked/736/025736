[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ belonging to the family _Flaviviridae_. The KFDV was 1st isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state; hence its name. The KFD virus (KFDV) is maintained by ticks, mammals, and bird cycles. The black-faced langur (_Presbytis entellus_) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (_Macaca radiata_) act as sentinel animals, as they are very susceptible to KFDV, as humans are https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.

As per the media report above, a 45-year-old woman from Sattari taluka of North Goa district of Goa died of Kyasanur Forest Disease on [Mon 24 Apr 2017]. To prevent KFD in the local population, there is a need to create awareness of how to avoid tick bites and that KFD vaccination facilities be available in the affected areas. - Mod.UBA
