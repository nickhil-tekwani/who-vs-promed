Soldiers Contract Q Fever During Carcass Disposal
-------------------------------------------------
Today it was revealed that 3 soldiers are recovering after being infected
with the rare disease, Q fever, which they contracted while burying animals
with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), making them the first human victims of
the epidemic. The servicemen began displaying symptoms of flu or pneumonia,
with which Q fever is often confused, after they helped dispose of animal
carcasses on a farm in Northumberland. After complaining of the symptoms,
including breathing problems, 2 of the soldiers were treated in hospital
but later released. It is not clear whether the third man needed hospital
treatment. Though 6 other men, also believed to be soldiers, were screened
for Q fever infection, the results proved negatives. Doctors and public
health officials across Britain have been alerted to watch out for patients
who may have worked on farms during the slaughter program complaining of
similar illness. News of the first people to suffer health problems as a
result of the FMD epidemic was revealed not by the Department of Health but
on the website of the Public Health Laboratory Service, the Government's
monitor of infectious diseases.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "This is like flu. You take
antibiotics and get better. Clearly we have a duty of care to our people.
The divisional operation order did warn of the hazards." [This statement
does not provide much reassurance. Influenza is a viral disease not
amenable to antibiotic treatment, whereas Q fever is a rickettsial disease
responding to tetracycline treatment. - Mod.CP
A Health Department spokesman said the general public was unlikely to be at
increased risk from Q fever although a risk assessment released earlier
during the epidemic suggested bacteria [and rickettsia might be released
for months from animal burial sites. "It is known that the people who have
had it so far have not had it through food," said the spokesman. "They were
involved directly in disposal. It is a known risk. The disease itself is
not a high-risk disease. The exposure among people who work on farms is
very high because the [rickettsiae are so common and widespread." People
handling animals, whether infected by FMD or not, are at particular risk of
catching the disease, especially from pregnant sheep and cattle, many of
which have been killed during the recent cull.
Q fever is rare, with only a few hundred cases reported each year, mainly
in Ulster, although it is believed that numbers are under-reported because
of its similarity to flu. One survey suggested that one in 4 farmers had
the disease.
Thousands of soldiers, slaughtermen, and troops were involved in the cull.
There have been 1788 confirmed outbreaks of FMD and animals on more than
7000 farms have been killed as a precaution. So far 2.76 million sheep, 537
000 cattle and 128 000 pigs have been killed.

[This report is unclear about the nature of the causative organism, which
is a rickettsia. Q fever, or rickettsial pneumonia, occurs world-wide.
Pneumonia is a frequent consequence of infection with an acute onset and in
extreme cases possible involvement of heart valves and other organs. The Q
fever rickettsia, _Coxiella burnetii_, is usually transmitted by inhalation
of small particle aerosols that originate from infected animals. Q fever is
enzootic among domestic animals, particularly cattle, sheep and goats. Q
fever rickettsiae proliferate profusely in the placenta of infected females
and are released abundantly at parturition. They are resistant in the
environment and can be disseminated by dust, dried feces, nd other animal
detritus. Disease occurs sporadically in farm workers, but outbreaks are
more frequent among abattoir workers. Q fever can also be contracted by
consumption of contaminated raw milk. Ticks are a potential but rare source
of human infection.
The present outbreak appears to be confined to military personnel employed
in the slaughter and disposal of FMD-infected animals. Soldiers, in
contrast to farm workers and slaughtermen, would be unlikely to have any
prior immunity as a consequence of their normal employment. Furthermore
they may have been assigned by default to the most emotionally disturbing
tasks, such as the slaughter and disposal of pregnant sheep and recently
born lambs. - Mod.CP
