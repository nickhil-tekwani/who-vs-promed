Three more cases have been reported in a new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Equateur [province], and health officials have fleshed out more details about the cluster of cases.

Yesterday [Mon 1 Jun 2020], the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the DRC had notified it of an outbreak in the northwestern part of the country involving 6 cases, 4 of them fatal. In an update, DRC officials reported 9 cases, according to UNICEF, an increase of 3. And one new death brings that total to 5.

The WHO's African regional office, in its weekly emergencies and outbreaks report, said that the new outbreak in Equateur province's Mbandaka health zone, where a small outbreak was reported in 2018, initially consisted of a cluster of 4 deaths that occurred between 18 and 30 May [2020].

The index patient is a 27-year-old woman who died in a Wangata hospital on 18 May [2020]. Three other people from her community died from an illness with similar symptoms in the following days.

A swab specimen was collected from the last patient who died. Then on 31 May [2020], a health worker who treated the patients, along with his wife, became ill and were isolated at Wangata hospital. Samples from those 3 patients tested positive for Ebola on 1 Jun [2020] at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa.

UNICEF said in a news release yesterday [1 Jun 2020] that one of the 5 patients who died is a 15-year-old girl. The agency added that, of the 4 survivors, all are contacts of the people who died, and one is a child of one of the fatal cases. All are in isolation and treatment at Wangata hospital.

The group's DRC representative, Edouard Beigbeder, said UNICEF is working with the DRC government and other responders to provide equipment, deploy community mobilizers, provide water and sanitation services, and support orphaned children.

"In the ongoing outbreak in Eastern DRC, more children, proportionately, are being affected than in any previous Ebola outbreak, so we must ensure that preventing infection among children is central to the response in Equateur," he said, adding that UNICEF will send 36 staff members to the area.

The WHO said the new outbreak comes at a time when the large outbreak in the eastern part of the country is in the midst of its 42-day countdown until the event, underway since August 2018, is declared over. It said the new outbreak in Equateur province is a reminder that Ebola is present in animal reservoirs in the region, which poses an ongoing threat of reemergence in humans.

The new outbreak is the DRC's 11th since 1976. In 2018, an 11-week outbreak in Equateur province sickened 54 people and led to 33 deaths. The VSV-EBOV vaccine was deployed, and the event was declared over on 24 Jul 2018. The outbreak in the eastern DRC started just one week later and has totaled 3463 cases and 2252 deaths.

[It is important to recognize that Ebola is ever present in animal reservoirs in the region; thus, capture and slaughter of wild animals is always of concern. Although suspected, it is not clear the virus originated from a new strain of Ebola Zaire. Sequence of virus from the Equateur outbreak must be compared with virus from the North Kivu outbreak. According to the ECDC report below, sequencing is underway. Because of the threat of re-emergence of virus from wildlife, it is critical to maintain a strong surveillance system to detect new suspected cases as early as possible and isolate, test, and treat them to break potential chains of transmission. - Mod.LK]

The resurgence of Ebola virus disease in Equateur province has occupied the pages of several Congolese media.

The DRC is once again facing an Ebola epidemic. The announcement was made on Mon 1 Jun [2020] by the Minister of Public Health, reports Cas-info.ca.

According to Eteni Longondo, samples of suspected cases declared positive by the INRB [confirmed] the virus reappeared in Mbandaka.

"I can confirm that we have a new Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka, in the province of the former Ecuador. This means that I myself will go there to provide technical support to the response team," said Eteni Longondo, whose comments are reproduced on the website.

According to information provided by the Congolese government, notes for its part Actualite.cd, 5 people died in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province, in the northwest of the country. The same sources indicate that 4 other infected people are being taken care of. They were in contact with the confirmed cases. All are treated in an isolation unit at Wangata hospital in Mbandaka, the portal added.

The governor of Equateur Bobo Boloko, said that, based on information received from the head of the provincial health division, the dead were recorded in the Air Congo district in the city of Mbandaka.

A meeting involving all the technical health and safety services as well as technical and financial partners was held.

The governor asks the population to be calm and to observe hygiene measures, in particular washing their hands regularly with soap, not greeting each other by hands, not touching the sick and the deceased after having done fever and bleeding, reports Mediacongo.net.

"The new Ebola epidemic in Mbandaka represents a challenge, but it is one that we are ready to take up," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, director of the WHO Regional Office for Africa, says Prosperity.

Dr. Moeti recalled that the UN agency has been working for years with the Congolese Ministry of Health, the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their partners in strengthening capacities to respond to Ebola outbreaks, adds the newspaper.

[2] Summary
- Tue 2 Jun 2020. Sitrep 95
[WHO AFRO (abridged, edited)]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/rf4mntv1lutq720bx6nkml?email=true&lang=en&a=11&p=57146389

From 24-31 May 2020, no new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The source of infection of the cluster reported in April 2020 remains unconfirmed.

From 24-31 May 2020, an average of 2895 alerts were reported and investigated per day. Of these, an average of 429 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. In the past 3 weeks, the alert rate has notably improved in Beni and Butembo sub-coordinations. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 8 laboratories. From 25-31 May 2020, 3017 samples were tested, including 2295 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 308 swabs from community deaths; and 414 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, the number of samples tested by the laboratories was similar to the previous week.

As of 28 May 2020, a total of 3463 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 146 probable cases, have been reported, of which 2280 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%), and 1171 have recovered. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were healthcare workers.

In a new development, the Ministry of Health in Democratic Republic of the Congo notified WHO on 1 Jun 2020 of a fresh outbreak of Ebolavirus disease (EVD) in Mbandaka, Equateur province. The event initially involved a cluster of 4 deaths that occurred between 18 and 30 May 2020. The index case is a 27-year-old female who reportedly died in Wangata hospital on 18 May 2020. No safe and dignified burial was performed.

On 31 May 2020, a health worker who attended to the initial case-patients, along with his wife, presented with symptoms and both have been isolated in Wangata hospital. The swab specimen collected from the last deceased case-patient and 2 blood specimens obtained from the 2 case patients currently admitted tested positive for Ebola virus, _Zaire Ebolavirus_ species, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB), Kinshasa, on 1 Jun 2020.

- Tue 2 Jun 2020
[ECDC (edited)]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-outbreak-ebola-virus-disease-drc

News of this outbreak was 1st announced by the region's governor, Bobo Boloko Bolumbu, on local radio and confirmed later that day [1 Jun 2020] by the DRC's minister of health and WHO's director general. Response measures have been set in motion, including the testing of samples and contract tracing, with additional staff being deployed to Mbandaka on 2 Jun 2020.

Between May and July 2018, the 9th Ebola outbreak in the DRC took place in the same area, in and around the city of Mbandaka, leading to a total of 54 cases including 33 deaths. According to WHO, the current event seems to be separate from the 10th Ebola outbreak, which has been in its final stages in the eastern part of the country almost 1000 km [621 mi] away, with 3463 reported cases including 2280 deaths so far. Sequencing is ongoing to confirm this outbreak as a separate event. If confirmed, this would be the DRC's 11th outbreak of Ebola virus disease since 1976 when it was 1st discovered.

In addition to Ebola, the country is currently battling other major outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic (3195 cases including 72 deaths) and a measles outbreak (369 520 cases including 6779 deaths). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has been on lockdown since mid-March 2020, with the closure of all borders for non-essential traffic and a ban on all trips between the capital and the country's 25 provinces.

ECDC assessment
Ebola outbreaks in the DRC are not unexpected as the virus is present in an animal reservoir in many parts of the country. Implementing response measures is crucial, and a high level of surveillance is essential to detect and interrupt further transmission early. Response measures may prove to be challenging, given the other outbreaks ongoing in the country. The overall risk to the EU/EEA is very low, especially with the current limitation on travel.
