Eight out of a total of 14 affected children from Manafwa district in Eastern Uganda died from an undiagnosed disease. The remaining 6 patients are severely ill and hospitalized.

The ages of the affected children are not specified. As the symptoms of fever and "urinating blood" were the only ones described, no suspected diagnosis is specified.

"Most cases have been reported in Bukusu, Nabutoola, and Bugobelo sub-counties. Doctors have not given any definite cause of the disease."

A strange disease is killing children in Manafwa district in Eastern Uganda, Rose Mutonyi, MP (Bubulo East) told parliament on Wednesday [23 May 2018].

While raising a matter of national concern in plenary, she said: "There is a strange disease ravaging Manafwa district. It attacks the children, and they urinate blood." Mutonyi told legislators that it starts as a simple matter, but with time, it proves to be a serious issue.

Research has been done in 3 sub-counties of Bukusu, Nabutoola and Bugobelo. "14 children have been affected in these 3 sub-counties; 8 of them have died, and 6 are in hospital struggling for their lives," Mutonyi said, adding that of the 14, one family has lost 2 children, and one is still sick.

According to the medical interpretation on the victims who have gone to hospitals, Mutonyi said that "Doctors say it is a fever, but a fever that results in a child passing urine throughout is worrying."

Mutonyi said that doctors have not given any definite cause of the disease. She urged the Ministry of Health to carry out verification and provide a solution to save the children.

Speaker Rebecca Kadaga gave the health ministry up to next week to report on the strange disease. "We ask the ministry to investigate the situation, and, if it is something that is going to spread all over the country, then we should be ready," Kadaga said.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The combination of high fever, severe illness, hemorrhage symptoms -- as seen from the dark urine -- a need for hospitalization, and a high mortality rate of 57% (8/14) all point to a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF).

The individual cases fit well with severe malaria, but severe malaria is not seen as outbreaks in malaria endemic areas and would have been picked up by the routine diagnostic tests.

The haemorhagic fevers seen in such a cluster would most probably be vector-borne, and, especially, yellow fever is a possibility. Other causes of VHF, like Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever, must be excluded. While Lassa fever is also on the list, it hasn't previously been reported outside of West Africa. Another possibility is leptospirosis. All these infections are compatible with the symptoms described in the newspaper report. ProMED will be happy to post more information. - Mods.EP/TY

Sticking my neck out on the chopping block I'm wondering about the description of the illness and the demographics of the cases - all children. We don't know how long this has been going on, or if this is a remote area (I could not find information on the affected district other than the district shares a border with Kenya. In the absence of cases in adult family members who would have been caring for these children, I do wonder about non-VHF diagnoses in the area, such as severe malaria. We await further information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources in the area. - Mod.MPP]
