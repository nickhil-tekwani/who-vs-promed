Congo-Kinshasa: Epidemic of monkeypox in Kasai Occidental Province
-----------------------------------------------
A report made by the Provincial Medical Inspection team of Kasai
Occidental declares that several people have been suffering from this
disease [monkeypox] during the past 3 months, according to a report
from radiokapi.net. According to Dr. Jean-Constantin Kanowa,
Provincial Medical Inspector, the residents of this health zone do
not have easy access to medicines, supplies or infectious disease specialists.
Monkeypox is a disease with obligatory reporting, stated Dr.
Jean-Constantin Kanowa. "We have competent teams and are deploying
them to Dekese. The activities will be carried out in the field, but
it will be necessary to have follow-up."
It is difficult for us to rent an aircraft each month, and our boat,
which is the only way to reach this area at a lower cost, was
wrecked, explained the Provincial Medical Inspector. According to
medical sources, relayed by radiokapi.net, monkeypox is a viral
disease. It originates with the consumption of infected monkey meat.
The disease presents with a cutaneous eruption.
The Provincial Medical Inspection also announced that there has been
a growing number of children suffering with pertussis and measles in
the Dekese Health Zone.

[A map of the Democratic Republic of Congo showing the location of
Kananga in Kasai Occidental province is available via
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>.
The Dekese health zone lies 450 km from Kananga, in the province of
Kasai Occidental Province.
The diagnosis of monkeypox has yet to confirmed by laboratory
testing. Although monkeypox has been recorded previously in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, monkeypox and varicella (chickenpox),
although caused by entirely different viruses, are sometimes
difficult to distinguish clinically. The prevalence of other
unrelated childhood disease (pertussis and measles) in the Dekese
health zone suggests caution in evaluation of this report. Further
information would be welcomed. - Mod.MPP/CP]
[Butchering monkeys for food is not the only source of human
disease. The main reservoir is squirrels of different species, but a
variety of wildlife, including other rodents, is also infected, and
eaten by the local population. - Mod.JW]
