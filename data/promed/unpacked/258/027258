I ran this information through GIDEON. Assuming a known infectious
disease, four interesting possibilities stand out from the differential
diagnosis list: leptospirosis (as in the Nicaraguan outbreak - however,
no
flooding in this case), plague, anthrax (goat contact), hantavirus.
Further clinical details will be helpful.

Using the few clues given: pneumonia, fever, productive cough and
hemoptysis in Sudan, The Infectious and Parsitic Diseases of Man
software
program suggests the following diseases: nocardiosis, tuberculosis,
cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, legionellosis,
pneumococcal
pneumonia and streptococcal pneumonia. The short incubation probably
eliminates tuberculosis, respiratory disease is rare with
sporotrichosis, and
legionellosis is unlikely unless there is some aquatic source for the
organism.
