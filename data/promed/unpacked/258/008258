[In this report, one important discrepancy is apparent. The previous report
indicates that 5 cattle died, but in this official OIE Alert, only 2 cattle
are reported ill. In addition, there is no indication of whether the rest
of the herd has been vaccinated. Please see the excellent commentary of
Mod.MHJ in the reference for insights into the epidemiology and periodic
nature of these anthrax outbreaks on farms in the UK. - Mod.PC]
