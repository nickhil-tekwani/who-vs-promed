New bird-flu measures announced
-----------------------------------------
In a move to prevent the spread of avian influenza after chicken farming
resumes on a mass scale, the Livestock Department yesterday announced
measures to continue to control the movement of chickens.
Livestock Department director-general Yukol Limlaemthong said yesterday
that the department recently issued an announcement designating Thailand as
a suspected bird-flu epidemic zone.
The announcement has been circulated to all provincial governors, advising
them to limit the movement of chickens in their jurisdiction.
After 4 months of the epidemic, farmers have sought permission to resume
raising chickens. Yukol said it would not be possible to raise large
numbers of chickens at many farms at the same time as some areas are still
under surveillance, even though they have met the 21-day period required by
the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The department said it needed
to further monitor the areas for 3 months, at the request of chicken importers.
"It is very risky to allow chicken farms to operate, because each chicken
has not been tested for the virus. We have to make sure all areas are free
from bird flu," Yukol said.

Viet Nam to announce end of bird flu
---------------------------------------------
Viet Nam plans to declare itself free of deadly bird flu on Tues 30 Mar
2004 so it can rebuild it devastated poultry industry, even though U.N.
agencies fear new outbreaks and despite a dispute over the cause of a boy's
death this month.
Scientists say at least 16 people, including the boy, have died in Viet
Nam, where the disease swept through 57 of its 64 cities and provinces,
resulting in the mass cull of some 38 million poultry, 15 percent of Viet
Nam's stock.
Bui Quang Anh, director of the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary
Department, said Mon that a declaration will be made Tues afternoon so the
country can start "restocking the poultry stock and re planning the poultry
industry."
No outbreaks among poultry have been reported since 26 Feb 2004, but
international health and agriculture officials say that that's no guarantee
there won't be a recurrence.
"It's premature, but it's a political decision," said Anton Rychener, head
of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. "In case there are more
outbreaks, which there almost certainly will be, it will undermine the
credibility of the government."
The disease ravaged poultry in Asia and jumped from fowl to people in Viet
Nam and Thailand, killing 24 total. That includes the 15 Mar 2004 death of
a 12-year-old boy in Tay Ninh province, which was confirmed as bird flu by
the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, but never acknowledged by the
government.
Officials from the Ministry of Health said Mon that they had not received
official confirmation about the cause of the boy's death. Anh shrugged off
questions about whether the boy's death was factored into the decision to
declare Viet Nam free of bird flu, saying health officials have been unable
to determine the form of transmission.
World Health Organization officials also received no official word on the
boy's death, and cautioned Viet Nam not to be hasty about sending out a
potentially damaging message.
"It's one thing to declare no active outbreaks, but, when is it safe to
start (restocking)?" asked Peter Horby, WHO epidemiologist in Hanoi.
Restocking "potentially is calling for outbreaks to start up again," he said.
Horby said he hopes Tue's announcement is prefaced with caution.
"One would hope the announcement is strongly couched in caveats and
warnings around the potential for recurrence of avian influenza, and
encouraging careful restocking and vigilance," he said.
42 out of Viet Nam's 57 cities and provinces where bird flu outbreaks were
reported have declared themselves free from the disease. The remaining 15
have met all the conditions and are expected to make similar announcements,
Anh said.

[Political interference in animal health matters is not a new phenomenon;
an example thereof was seen during the 2001 FMD outbreak in the UK.
The main concern is that political decisions, such as the one currently
underway in Viet Nam, might negatively affect professional, science-based
attitudes -- with special reference to the highly needed but politically
unpopular early reporting of possible new cases.
The reversed attitude in Thailand, now more cautious, is to be commended.-
