Up to nine people may have died from Legionnaire's disease in the
Netherlands, after the airborne bacteria spread through a flower show,
health minister Els Borst said on Monday.
Four of the nine victims were confirmed to have died from the deadly
disease, while autopsies are still being performed on the other five, she
said.
More than 40 people are also sick with the illness, and the minister
expressed shock at the rapidly rising number of casualties.
The victims were all infected with Legionnaire's disease after attending a
flower show held in Bovenkarspel, in the western Netherlands, during the
last week of Feb 1999.
Health authorities believe the bacteria was spread through a fountain.
Legionnaire's disease produces symptoms similar to pneumonia. It is
believed to be spread through inhalation of contaminated water vapour.
