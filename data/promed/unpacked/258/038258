12 new cases confirmed in outbreak of pertussis
----------------------------------------------------------
[Press report -- 09/23/98 Utah's outbreak of whooping cough
continues to grow, according to a Utah Health Department spokesman.
Since 11 Sep 1998, when 50 cases of pertussis had been diagnosed in
the state, another 12 cases have been confirmed. Those include seven
in Salt Lake County, one in Weber-Morgan and four from the southwest
part of the state, Ross Martin said.
Pertussis is called whooping cough because of the noise that children
with pertussis make. While the illness poses no serious risk to
adults, it can be very dangerous -- even deadly -- to infants.
Treatment for the bacterial illness is antibiotics. Adults who think
they have pertussis should see their physician to begin a course of
antibiotics if they are around small children.
