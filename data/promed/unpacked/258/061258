Bluetongue disease has been detected in small ruminants [sheep] in an enterprise operating in the Baltaköy District of Aydın's Efeler district. Due to the contagious nature of the disease, the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry has started the application of quarantine in an area of approximately 10 square kilometers [~3.86 sq mi].

In this context, animals are banned from entering and leaving Baltaköy, Armutlu, Bademli, Böcek, Çayyüzü, Çeştepe, Çiftlikköy, Doğan, Gölhisar, Ilıcabaşı, Işıklı, İmamköy, Kadıköy, Kocagür, Kozalaklı, Mesudiye, Ovaeymir, Pınardere, Savrandere, Serçeköy, Sıralılar, Şahnalı, Tepecik, Tepeköy, Yagcilar, Yenikoy and Yilmazkoy. In addition, Efeler Municipality's Animal Market in Çeştepe Neighborhood was also closed.

It has been learned that vaccination work started in the region by the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry, and the [quarantine] measures will be lifted after the work is completed.

[Baltaköy is a village in the District of Efeler (previously part tvvvvof the Aydın district), within the Aydın Province in western Turkey (map at https://tinyurl.com/ycknfc93).

Notably, the 1st officially reported outbreak of bluetongue in Turkey was reported in the same province, Aydın (1977). The disease spread between 1977 and 1979 and became endemic in the provinces bordering the Aegean and Mediterranean seas. The causative agent was isolated in samples from sheep and calves and was identified as bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 4. The vector was _Culicoides imicola_. The disease was controlled by quarantine measures, insecticide treatment and particularly by vaccination campaigns in sheep in the western provinces. Live-attenuated BTV-4 vaccine, produced in the Etlik Central Veterinary Control and Research Institute, was used. The next upsurge was reported in late July 1999 in the Edirne Province, northwest of Thrace, controlled successfully by the measures described above. Since then, bluetongue remained endemic in Turkey's maritime provinces along the Mediterranean, and seasonal exacerbations of BTV have been reported several times (e.g., 2009, 2012, 2014, 2017) from the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea along Turkey's shores, such as Chios, Lesbos and others, remaining unreported from the adjacent provinces in western Turkey during some of them.

The serotyping results of the current event are pending. - Mod.AS
