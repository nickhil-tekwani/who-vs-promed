[Differences of opinion have surfaced between the Health Service of
Llanquihue, Chiloe and Palena (Llancipal) and the regional chapter of the
College of Medicine regarding the death of an 11 month-old from the suburbs
of Puerto Montt that may have been hantavirus related. If the case proves
positive for a hantavirus, it will be the first in Region X.
At the same time, the health union asked for safer conditions for personnel
who treat patients affected by this type of hemorrhagic fever [Note:
western hemisphere hantaviruses are more likely to cause pulmonary
syndromes than hemorrhagic diseases -- Mod CHC whose mortality in Chile
approaches 50%.
While the Director of the Health Service, Mario Rios, [minimized such a
possibility, explaining that the autopsy performed on the youth determined
the cause of death to be a bilateral bronchopneumonia, Dr. Rodrigo Alonso,
Secretary of the Regional Puerto Montt College of Medicine, attributed the
death to a hemorrhagic pneumonitis, [unlikely to have been caused by a
hantavirus. Mario Rios, pointed out that neither a general examination nor
a chest film were compatible with a picture of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Until now, the Health Service of Llanchipal, in whose jurisdiction the
first cases of human hantavirus infection in Chile were registered in 1995,
have noted six proven cases of the disease, of which four were fatal.
Still, four of those affected, two of whom now dead, are included in the
category of "suspicious", awaiting the results of tests of material sent to
Carlos Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
In Llay Llay, a 4 year-old girl died Tuesday in the Gustave Fricke Hospital
in Vina del Mar of a fulminant respiratory complication suspected to have
been caused by a hantavirus. Although medical authorities of Region V
doubt that the death [was caused by a hantavirus because the patient would
have shown distinct symptoms, blood and tissue samples were sent to Buenos
Aires for examination to discount the possibility.
An unfortunate result has been the isolation of the family and relatives of
the girl and false reports of their having contracted the disease.
In the whole country, the total number with hantavirus infections totals
23, 14 of whom have died; suspicious cases total 12. The occurrence of
deaths have created concern among those in the tourist industry, especially
in the regions of Los Lagos and Aisen.
Argentine specialists were reported a few days ago to have said that the
disease [presumably a hantavirus was transmissible from person to person.
Despite a lack of scientific evidence of interhuman [human-to-human
transmission that occurred in the Argentine locality of El Bolson, Paula
Padula, an [Argentine virologist, revealed that the College of Medicine
Puerto Montt confirmed the hypothesis and asked for strong measures such as
rat extermination and protection of medical personnel.
The situation is one of concern in as much as the virus [perhaps two
different hantaviruses has been detected in northern and southern extremes
of the country, and if the case in Llay Llay is confirmed, it would mean
that the disease is approaching Santiago and Valpariso where major [human
population concentrations are located.
In Santiago, the Minister of Health, Alex Figueroa agreed that the
situation created by the presence of a hantavirus in the country "is
serious" and he maintained that no region of the country is potentially
free of the disease. He assured the country that [the Government would
confront the issue, and not ignore it. He said that a commission of
experts had been formed to anticipate all scenarios. He mentioned that
there were doubts about the strain of the virus detected in Arica [in the
north, thus samples have been sent to Atlanta and Argentina to determine
which type of virus they are dealing with because they have suspicions that
it could be distinct from that found in the south of the country. He said
that the first appears more like those detected in Bolivia and Paraguay
that is named the `black lake [virus' while the one from the south is
known as [Andes virus.
Loreto Loraca, president of the medical guild in Region X advised that "it
is necessary to pay attention to all means of infection including those
that are not completely proven since there is a risk to the population and
health professionals. There are doctors involved in attending to
patients... and we don't know all the means of infection."

[This dispute has some merit. Definitive governmental declarations should
be tempered by scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, such knowledge should be
available to people on both sides of the issue. It might be best to refer
to "black lake virus" as "Laguna Negra virus" because that is the name of
the virus in English as well as in Spanish. This virus has been isolated
in Paraguay and the vertebrate host there is _Calomys laucha_. The
vertebrate host of Andes virus is thought to be _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_. Chile is a long, narrow country and extends north/south
through many ecologic zones, so it may be that the vertebrate host of a
hantavirus in the north of Chile may be different from the vertebrate host
of a hantavirus in the south. As well, the viruses may be different. --Mod
