People in Kadugli, Abu Jubaiha, and Habila localities in South Kordofan have complained about the outbreak of an unknown fever. Meanwhile, the state's health minister [has] acknowledged the spread of the potentially fatal hemorrhagic fever, and stated that medical teams have been sent to the affected localities.

A number of residents revealed that the symptoms of this disease are high fever, vomiting, and headaches. It has led to "a high mortality rate," they told Radio Dabanga. The residents pointed to the shortage of medicines and health care. "The state authorities ignored us despite the repeated complaints." South Kordofan's minister of health said that the government has sent medical teams to the affected areas.

Minister Abdallah Imam El Tom acknowledged the spread of hemorrhagic fever as well as leishmaniasis and the rising number of cases in a press release. He revealed that 25 people were infected and have been isolated in hospitals, but no deaths have been reported. The national cabinet has ordered health officials to step up disease surveillance in the areas where the 2 diseases have been reported, including Kadugli, Habila and Abu Jubaiha.

El Tom added that this year's [2014] outbreak of the diseases is smaller than a similar outbreak last year. He said the problem is exacerbated by the movement of cattle herders in the area and the lack of quality healthcare facilities. The minister further attributed last week's mass resignations of physicians and specialists in the state to the non-payment of their financial benefits.

[The outbreak continues to increase in case numbers and spread geographically. On 24 Oct 2014, 4 cases of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever were reported (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141028.2907268). The 5 Nov 2014 report indicated that there were 5 cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141109.2940215), and the above report indicates an increase to 25 cases. Still, there are not enough details provided to make a definite diagnosis. One hopes that the medical team dispatched to the area can take appropriate samples and send them to the laboratory for diagnosis. As noted in the previous post, a thorough laboratory study is needed for the cases above. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about additional cases or results of any laboratory tests that become available.

Yellow fever (YF) virus infection is an obvious possibility, given that it has occurred in the region in the not too distant past. Rift Valley fever is another possibility, but there is no mention of small ruminant animals being affected in the area. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.
