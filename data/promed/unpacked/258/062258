Bovine tuberculosis has been found on a Southland dairy farm for the
2nd time in 12 months.

TB-Free Southland Committee chairman Mike O'Brien said the infected
animal was found this month [April 2011] on a farm at the southern end
of the Takitimu Mountains, one of 2 areas in Southland recognised as
having feral TB problems during Animal Health Board's (AHB) herd
surveillance testing. The animal was killed, with necropsy tests
confirming the presence of TB.

"As soon as it was confirmed as TB, we had guys in there doing vector
control around that area, so they'll saturate all that area, and
anything they catch will be taken away for a necropsy," Mr O'Brien
said. "Further TB testing will take place until the AHB is confident
the disease has been removed from the property," he said.

Initial analysis suggested the infection was unlikely to be related
to the movement of livestock, with a feral animal most likely
responsible.

"It's more than likely ... a ferret has taken a bit of a walk, and
it's one of those unfortunate things that he's stopped in that herd,"
he said. Another positive test was "not unexpected, but still, you
don't really like it to happen."

Restrictions had been placed on the herd's movements and would remain
until all animals had received 2 clear tests.

Southland was declared TB-free in early 2009 after a concerted effort
to eradicate it, but the province lost that status last April [2010]
when a dairy cow in the Edendale area tested positive. The animal had
spent about 18 months on a Western Southland farm after being moved
from the West Coast.

Mr O'Brien said the 2 outbreaks were unfortunate but not unexpected
because of the movement of stock and the difficulty in eliminating the
feral animal population.

"But we're very confident that it's not going to cause any real big
issues for us, and we'll get on top of it and get it sorted. It's just
an issue for the individual farmer, which is the biggest problem."

The testing system was working because it was identifying infected
animals early.

The Animal Health Board was confident Southland was on track towards
eradicating the disease from both livestock and the wildlife
population, Mr O'Brien said.

"As farmers, we must remain vigilant if we are to successfully
protect the region from TB. This includes carrying out regular TB
testing of cattle and deer and allowing wildlife surveys to take
place. Both form an important part of our plan to rid the region of
TB."

[The AHB worries about possums, while those in the UK worry about
badgers. Reservoirs of the disease make it difficult to eradicate. And
wildlife reservoirs bring a more difficult dimension to the problem.

In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a
fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In
the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot
climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight. In contrast, most
infected badgers have no visible lesions and can survive for many
years. In symptomatic badgers, bovine tuberculosis is primarily a
respiratory disease.

And sadly, the test method for bovine tuberculosis is not as accurate
as tests for other diseases, nor is there a vaccine to prevent bovine
tuberculosis. - Mod.TG]
