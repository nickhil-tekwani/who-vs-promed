[1] WHO/UNWTO against travel & trade bans, quarantine
Date: Mon 10 Nov 2014

Statement from the Travel and Transport Task Force on Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Leading international organizations and associations from the transport, trade, and tourism sector stand firmly with the World Health Organization (WHO) against general bans on travel and trade, as well as restrictions that include general quarantine of travellers from Ebola-affected countries.

The Travel and Transport Task Force, established in August 2014, calls for international cooperation of governments and the transport sector in following the recommendations of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on Ebola, convened by WHO. WHO does not recommend general bans on travel or trade, or general quarantine of travellers arriving from Ebola-affected countries, as measures to contain the outbreak. Such measures can create a false impression of control and may have a detrimental impact on the number of health care workers volunteering to assist Ebola control or prevention efforts in the affected countries. Such measures may also adversely reduce essential trade, including supplies of food, fuel and medical equipment to the affected countries, contributing to their humanitarian and economic hardship.

Screening for Ebola
-------------------
Current exit screening of all persons departing affected countries through international airports, seaports and major land crossings is recommended by WHO and can reduce the numbers of people with symptoms from travelling from the countries with high levels of Ebola transmission. While screening upon entry into non-affected countries may provide an opportunity to further increase public awareness about Ebola, such screening also can require significant resources including staff, facilities and systems to care for ill travellers who might be suspected of having Ebola.

Preparedness for non-affected countries
---------------------------------------
The best protective measures for non-affected countries are adequate levels of preparedness, including heightened surveillance to detect and diagnose cases early and well prepared staff and operational planning to ensure that suspect cases of Ebola are managed safely and in ways to minimize further spread. Communication campaigns should be conducted to inform travellers, airlines, shipping crews, staff working at points of entry, and health workers everywhere about the symptoms of Ebola virus disease and what to do if a person has symptoms. Data on the efficiency of exit screening should be made available.

Advice to travellers
--------------------
People who have travelled to one of the 3 West African countries currently affected by Ebola virus disease (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning:
- stay within reach of a good quality health care facility
- be aware of the symptoms of infection (sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and sometimes bleeding)
- immediately report a fever of 38 deg C [100.4 deg F] or higher to their local medical emergency service (ideally by phone) [that is, not by going there personally, especially not by public transport - Mod.JW]
- and mention their travel history.

Note:
- early treatment improves the chance of recovery
- to catch Ebola requires direct contact with the body fluid of an Ebola-infected person
- asymptomatic individuals are not infectious, even if they are incubating the disease.

Attending international meetings
--------------------------------
The IHR Emergency Committee agreed that there should not be a general ban on participation of people from countries with transmission of Ebola from attending international meetings and events. The decision of participation must be made on a case by case basis by the host country. This country may request additional health monitoring of participants.

The Travel and Transport Task Force, which includes WHO, is working together to:
- develop guidance on exit screening recommendations for affected countries
- provide a set of considerations and steps for planning entry screening at point of entry for countries that wish to introduce this as part of their preparedness plan
- inform the aviation and maritime sectors on procedures for caring safely for travellers who are suspected to be infected with Ebola on board an aircraft or ship, or at arrival points
- provide information on Ebola to travellers arriving at or leaving airports, ports, or other transit points
- develop protocols for the passenger shipping sector
- collect data and work with authorities to reduce restrictions to port arrivals and ship and aeroplane movements.
The Task Force is concerned about reports of denial of medical care for ill seafarers on board ships that had previously called at ports in the Ebola-affected region.

[2] USA: (New York) doctor now Ebola free, will be released from hospital
Date: Mon 10 Nov 2014
Source: CNN [edited]
http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/10/health/new-york-doctor-craig-spencer-ebola-free


The doctor who was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City last month [October 2014], is now free of the virus and will be released from the hospital Tue [11 Nov 2014], city officials said. "[The doctor] poses no public health risk and will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow," the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said in a statement on Mon [10 Nov 2014].

The Doctors Without Borders [Medecins sand Frontieres; MSF] physician, became the 1st person to test positive for the deadly virus in the city after returning from treating patients in Guinea. Officials said [the 33 year old physician] was hospitalized after developing a fever, nausea, pain, and fatigue. He has been in isolation at New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment... -- more

[3] USA: (California) some nurses plan strike over Ebola unpreparedness
Date: Sun 9 Nov 2014
Source: The Washington Times [edited]
http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/9/18000-kaiser-nurses-plan-strike-over-ebola-unprepa


Some 18 000 Kaiser Permanente nurses in Northern California are planning a 2-day strike this week against what they say is unpreparedness in fighting the deadly Ebola virus. The walkout scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday [11-12 Nov 2014] would affect 21 hospitals and 65 clinics owned by Kaiser Permanente, said Charles Idelson, a spokesman for National Nurses United, Bloomberg reported. The union said in a statement Thu [6 Nov 2014] that Kaiser "continued to stonewall on dozens of proposals to improve patient care standards, as well as refusing to address the concern of Kaiser RNs [registered nurses] about Ebola safety protocols and protective equipment, refusing to even answer questions by the RNs."

Kaiser spokesman John Nelson denied allegations that health workers aren't being trained adequately. "We are training our staff on how to use the right protective gear, to make sure they know how to use it," he told Bloomberg. "We have repeatedly asked union leadership to work with us on our Ebola strategy. They have refused. Instead, they continue to hold press conferences claiming hospitals are unprepared for Ebola." Mr Nelson said Kaiser hospitals are preparing for the walkout next week by rescheduling elective procedures and non urgent appointments.

[It's not a state-wide strike. California has about 350 hospitals, of which Kaiser Permanente owns or operates only 37, so no need for anyone to panic. We understand that normal shifts will be on duty, with off-duty nurses demonstrating outside -- not a work stoppage inside. But this might not be the best way to promote public confidence in those hospitals' preparedness for the importation of an Ebola case. - Mod.JW]

[Of course, robots operating in a contaminated environment will themselves have to be decontaminated after each shift. They are only likely to be used in developed countries because of the problem of expert maintenance, which would likely be frequently necessary in a tropical country. And even in the USA, would manufacturers be any less reluctant to repair robots than those that are refusing to perform routine maintenance on blood analysis machines used in Ebola labs? - see ProMED-mail: Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (31): Ugandan cured, Texas free, safety, funds 20141107.2938140 item [4]. - Mod.JW]

[5] WHO: Ebola fraud warning
Date: Sun 9 Nov 2014

http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/healthy-choices/article3678251.html


The World Health Organization, master planner of the planet's battle against the deadly Ebola virus, is warning of various fraudulent schemes claiming to be raising funds for the eradication effort. "Beware of scams implying association with the WHO," organization leaders said in a news release urging the public to spurn the deceptive requests for money. "Many of these scams request detailed information and/or money from individuals, businesses, or non-profit organizations with the promise that they will receive funds or other benefits in return," the WHO release said. Most of the phony solicitations are sent as emails from rogue websites. In many cases, somebody will call or fax to try to collect money unlawfully. Some schemes display the WHO logo, and refer to email addresses made to look like WHO or the United Nations' addresses.

"In particular, WHO suggests that recipients do not send money or personal information in response to invitations from anyone who claims to be awarding jobs, funds, grants, scholarships, certificates, lottery winnings, or prizes, and/or who requests payment for registration fees and hotel room reservations in the name of WHO," the release said.

At the same time, WHO officials said they calculate it will take about USD 260 million to stamp out the current outbreak, the worst ever since the virus was discovered along the Ebola River, from which it got its name, in 1960. As of last week, the WHO had received only half of that. Another 15 percent has been pledged, leaving a shortfall of 36 percent of funds needed. For decades, the organization has warned its worldwide member states that poor countries in Africa just recovering from civil strife were ripe for rapid outbreaks because of a lack of sufficient public health facilities... -- more

[6] USA: Google will double gifts for Ebola campaign
Date: Mon 10 Nov 2014
Source: Google [edited]
http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/doubling-down-on-ebola-donations.html


Today [10 Nov 2014], Google is launching a public giving campaign to fight Ebola. For every US dollar you give, Google will donate US 2 dollars. In addition, we're donating USD 10 million right away to support nonprofits such as InSTEDD [Innovative Support to Emergencies, Diseases, and Disasters], International Rescue Committee, Medecins Sans Frontieres, NetHope, Partners in Health, Save the Children, and US Fund for UNICEF. These organizations are doing remarkable work in very difficult circumstances to help contain this outbreak, and we hope our contribution will help them have an even greater impact. Separately, our family foundation will also be giving USD 15 million. Our hearts go out to everyone whose lives have been touched by this tragedy.
