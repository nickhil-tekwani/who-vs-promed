So far this year [2022], 5 minors have died from rickettsiosis, caused by a bacterium of the _Rickettsia_ genus, which is related to the bite of infected ticks. "The cases (of rickettsiosis) that have been detected have died, 5 so far this year," reported Luis Alfonso Carrillo González, director of municipal Public Health. "They were minors and that is what is striking," he explained.

According to sources from the Coahuila Health Secretariat, 4 of the deceased patients were from Saltillo, and 1 was from San Pedro. Carrillo González pointed out that children and young people are generally the most exposed to contracting rickettsiosis due to having more contact with animals and vacant places, although anyone is susceptible to becoming infected.

The deaths in the Coahuila capital represented a significant increase in mortality from this disease, since in previous years there were 1 to 2 deaths in the year, out of a total of 10 or 12 infections, according to the head of the Directorate of Municipal Public Health.

Meanwhile, the State Secretary of Health reported that last year [2021], 6 people infected with rickettsia died, for which he highlighted the importance of the State Program for the Prevention and Control of -_Rickettsia_, mainly in Saltillo, Parras, and San Pedro, where in recent years this type of patient has been recorded for years.

Symptoms of rickettsiosis are severe headache, fever, rash, muscle pain, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain. This bacterium is associated with poor hygienic conditions because it is transmitted mainly by ticks.

So far this year [2021], the Public Health Directorate of the municipality of Saltillo has fumigated around 300 places to prevent the spread of _Rickettsia_. "We have had most of the fumigations in the southern area of Saltillo and in the east, which coincide in being more populated popular neighborhoods. There are more dogs and people and the possibility of contagion," said Luis Alfonso Carrillo.

At the state level, the Secretary of Health of Coahuila started the fumigation campaign on 18 May 2022, since it is a disease related to the hot season.

[Coahuila, one of the 32 states of Mexico, is located along the US border, south of the US state of Texas, between the Mexican states of Nuevo León to the east and Chihuahua to the west; Saltillo is the largest city and state capital. A map of Coahuila can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coahuila,+Mexico.

Because of the known problem with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in Coahuila, Mexico (see also's below), the news report above is likely referring to RMSF, a tick-borne infection caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_. This organism is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly; without early administration of doxycycline, RMSF can be fatal within days. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for adults and children of all ages (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/healthcare-providers/signs-symptoms.html).

RMSF has been reported along the US side of its border with Mexico. In 2010, Arizona reported 41 cases associated with tribal lands, transmitted by the brown dog tick _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ and involved roaming dogs and heavy infestations of brown dog ticks that resulted in peri-domestic transmission and clustering of cases (Buelow ML. The epidemiology of rickettsial diseases on the US-Mexico border: An analysis of incidence rates, clinical presentation and risk factors associated with _Rickettsia rickettsii_, _Rickettsia typhi_, and _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ infection. Available at: https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/3t945r026

Frequently the patient is unaware of a preceding tick bite and the presenting illness is nonspecific, often leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. The case-fatality ratio for RMSF approaches 25 per cent if untreated. Children < 10 years are 5 times more likely than adults to die from RMSF (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/healthcare-providers/signs-symptoms.html). A rash, which develops 2-4 days after the onset of fever, is small, flat, pink, non-itchy macules on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html#rash); but is often absent in the 1st few days, and in some patients, never develops ("spotless fever"). Pictures of the rash of this disease can be seen at the source URL above. The petechial rash of RMSF does not typically appear until day 5 or 6 of illness. Eschars, necrotic lesions that occur at the site of tick bites, generally do not occur with RMSF. - Mod.ML
