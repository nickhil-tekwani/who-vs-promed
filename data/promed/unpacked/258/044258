Cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been reported in cattle in
4 villages of the Dzauskom region of South Ossetia [in the region of
Shida Kartli] (Erman, Zgubir, Styrfaz and Hvtse). This was reported to
the Res news agency by Murat Kabisov, the region's chief
veterinarian.

"On 5 Aug 2011, our service was notified from the mountain village of
Erman of sick cows. We went to the village and observed animals
clinically suspected of FMD. Samples from the affected animals were
obtained and submitted to the Moscow laboratory [this, most probably,
refers to the Federal Governmental Institute Centre for Animal Health
FGI-ARRIAH in Vladimir, near Moscow. It is an OIE reference laboratory
for FMD. - Mod.AS]. According to the results of the lab test, FMD
serotype O was identified."

"The disease caused the deaths of 2 calves, and the situation does not
have to be dramatised: it is under control," said the veterinarian. He
added that a preventive vaccination campaign in cattle and small
ruminants is being completed, and vaccination of pigs has begun.

"The cattle population in Dzauskom is about 7000 head strong.
Revaccination will be required in the affected areas 10-20 days after
initial vaccination. However, the application of revaccination may
have to be omitted in remote villages due to lack of refrigeration and
transportation facilities, and fuel," he said.

"To prevent the spread of disease," Kabisov continued, "the following
actions must be carried out: Vaccination, Disinfection and Quarantine
measures."

The source of the disease is under investigation.

[South Ossetia, formerly the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within
the former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, is a disputed region
which declared independence from Georgia in 1990, calling themselves
the "Republic of South Ossetia." Following several political and
military events, the Ossetian separatists and Russian troops gained
de-facto control of the territory since 2008. See map at
