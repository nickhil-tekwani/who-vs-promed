Severe hand, foot and mouth disease epidemic in Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------------
Nguyen Van Binh, chief of the Preventive Medicine Department in Ho
Chi Minh City warned of a severe epidemic as 17 000 cases of hand foot
and mouth disease (HFMD) have been reported in the country, with South
Viet Nam reporting 13 600 cases alone. Moreover, 90 patients [the
original article mentions 90 percent, which is an incorrect
translation - Mod.CP] of those afflicted patients have succumbed to
the disease. Binh blamed the outbreak to a new etiological agent,
human enterovirus 71 (EV71) of sub-genotype C4 which causes severe
complications.

Meanwhile, the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City claimed that 50
out of 15 000 patients infected with HFMD in South Vietnam have died
this year, tripling the death toll from the same period last year.
Localities with the largest number of patients are Ho Chi Minh City,
and the southern provinces of Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Long An and Tien
Giang.

The Ministry of Health and epidemiologists are on alert for new,
developments of the virus and the disease. Any new developments will
be reported immediately. Binh warned that more children may contract
the disease as its peak infection time falls between the months of
August till November.

[This article is accompanied by graphic illustrations of some of the
symptoms of HFMD. Since the preceding report from Viet Nam on 12 Jun
2011 the case number has risen from 7300 countrywide to the present 17
000. The majority of the cases (and deaths) have occurred in South
Viet Nam.

The severity of the outbreak is being attributed to circulation of
the C4 genotype of human enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been
associated with more severe outcomes of infection. The emergence in
recent years of an EV71 epidemic in the Asia Pacific region has been
associated with the circulation of 5 genetic lineages (genotypes B3,
B4, C1, C2, C4) that appear to be undergoing rapid evolutionary
changes (Lee, T.C. et al., Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009
Oct;28(10):904-10). More recent reports indicate that sub-genotype C4
predominates in China at the present time (Mao LX, et al., J Clin
Virol. 2010 Oct;49(2):100-4), and this appears to be the situation
also now in Viet Nam.

The identification of a B2 sub-genotype virus described in an ProMED
report from Viet Nam [Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam (02): (QN,
HCM) 20110604.1712] now appears not to be indicative of the current
epidemiological situation in this part of South East Asia.
