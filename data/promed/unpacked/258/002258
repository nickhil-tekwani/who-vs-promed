As dozens of panicked people rushed to hospitals across the country
[Turkey] and the emergency culling of fowl continued, avian influenza
among chickens was detected on Saturday [7 Jan 2006] in the
northwestern province of Bursa, some 1400 km (870 miles) from the
worst-affected areas in the east, officials told Anatolia.

The discovery marks the westernmost region where the virus has been
found since last month [December 2005], when it resurfaced in
Turkey's remote east.

In October 2005, a 1st outbreak in a region close to Bursa was
successfully contained.

Birdflu jumps to northern Turkey, found in poultry
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu virus has been detected in dead chickens in 2 villages on
Turkey's northern industrial Black Sea coast, officials said, just
days after a deadly strain killed 3 children in the east of the country.

Authorities began mass culling of birds in the agricultural east last
week [1st week January 2006], after discovery of the 1st human
infections with the deadly H5N1 strain beyond eastern Asia. Sunday's
[8 Jan 2006] announcement may raise fear of a further advance towards Europe.

Yavuz Erkmen, governor of the Zonguldak region, which has a high
concentration of industry and coal mining, said 2 villages were in
quarantine, the state Anatolian news agency reported.

"No infections to humans have been detected ... nearly 1500 poultry
in 2 villages will be culled," said Erkmen.

Officials said it was not clear yet whether the virus detected in the
dead birds was H5N1. Turkey is the 6th country in which the deadly
bird flu strain has jumped from poultry to people.
