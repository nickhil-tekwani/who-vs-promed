Suspected pox kills 200 penguins
--------------------------------
An unidentified illness has killed penguins in the Port Stephens area
of West Falkland. In the past week, approximately 200 gentoo penguins
and chicks have died at the rookeries at Ten Shilling Bay and Port
Stephens Peak. Penguins with similar signs have also been reported
from New Island and Albemarle.
Grant Munro said initial indications are that the disease is an
"avian pox virus."
The penguins appear weak and have wart-like lesions predominantly on
their feet, flippers and around the eyes and beak; however, on badly
affected animals, lesions may occur all over the body.
Grant said that the "eyes may be inflamed with a milky covering over
the front of the eye and a dry crusty excretion around the eye; in
severely affected animals, the eye may be protruding or alternatively
completely closed if swollen lesions occur close to the eye. The
illness affects both chicks and adults."
Peter and Ann Robertson, who have been monitoring the situation,
collected 2 of the affected animals, which were picked up by
Falklands Conservation and sent into the Veterinary Department for
diagnosis and autopsy.
Gidona Goodman, a specialist in exotic animal medicine at Edinburgh
University and wildlife vet at Edinburgh Zoo, who visited the Islands
last year [2005], is assisting the Veterinary Department and
Falklands Conservation. Photographs and samples have been sent to the
UK for analysis, and it is hoped to have a positive diagnosis soon.
Grant said that if the virus is found to be avian pox, it will be the
1st time that this has been reported in the Falklands, and it is
probable that there will be no resistance within the penguin
population.
"Within resistant populations, mortality associated with avian pox
may be only 1-2 percent; however, in susceptible populations,
mortality may be as high as 50 percent." He said vectors such as
animals, birds or infected meat/corpses generally transmit the virus;
however, tourists and visitors, researchers or landowners can equally
carry it.
"Feces will infect soil around the colony, and any dirt or dust
carried from the site on boots, clothing or vehicles will transmit
the virus to new sites. [Feces are not infectious, it is scabs falling off the
lesions that contaminate the soil -- see comment at end. - Mod.JW].
"The Department of Agriculture and Falklands Conservation would
encourage anyone visiting penguin colonies to report any sick animals
showing the above symptoms to Falklands Conservation."
Grant said there is no public health issue, and the pox virus is not
related to the influenza virus either in its human or avian forms.
However, he reiterated that although humans cannot catch the pox
virus from birds, they can transmit it on clothing and boots. "Boots,
clothing and vehicles should be cleaned after visiting any colony,
and visitors should not move directly from one colony to another.
This is essential if it is suspected that infected birds are present;
however, it may be that the symptoms have not yet manifested, and it
is good practice on all occasions. Cruise vessels should use
footbaths prior to tourists disembarking and upon return."
Generally, bird populations in mainland areas have, over time, been
exposed to a wide variety of avian diseases, and resistance
antibodies are present within the population; however, on remoter
islands such as the Falklands, the introduction of exotic diseases
can have catastrophic effects, Grant said.
"In 2002, veterinarians from the Wildlife Conservation Society of New
York, who own Grand and Steeple Jason, took blood samples from
black-browed albatrosses and gentoo penguins and tested for a wide
range of avian diseases.
"It was found that, unlike seabird populations on the coasts of South
America, the Falklands populations had no antibodies and thus no
resistance to the tested diseases. This means that birds may suffer
heavily if or when diseases are introduced."
He added, "Serious outbreaks have occurred in other sub-Antarctic
islands, notably avian cholera on Amsterdam Island and South Georgia
last year [2005] and avian diphtheria in New Zealand."

[Avian pox is a mild to severe, slow-developing disease of birds
caused by an avipoxvirus, and 3 common strains have been identified.
The 3 strains are fowl pox virus, pigeon pox virus and canary pox
virus. The strains vary in their virulence and have the ability to
infect other avian species. However, many of the strains are group
specific. Approximately 60 species of birds from 20 families have
been diagnosed with avian pox. The strain seen in wild turkeys is the
fowl pox virus.
Avian pox lesions (wart-like growths) occur on the unfeathered parts
of the bird's body and, in some cases, the mouth, larynx, and/or
trachea.
Transmission of the avian pox virus can occur in a number of ways.
The disease can be spread via mechanical vectors, primarily by
species of mosquitoes (at least 10). Transmission occurs when the
mosquito feeds on an infected bird that has a viremia (pox virus
circulating in the blood) or on virus-laden secretions from a pox
lesion and then feeds on an uninfected bird. Mosquitoes can harbor
and transmit the virus for a month or longer after feeding on an
infected bird. Experimentally, stable flies have shown the capability
of being able to transmit the pox virus.
Avian pox can also be transmitted by direct contact between infected
and susceptible birds. The virus is transmitted through abraded or
broken skin or the conjunctiva (mucous membrane covering the anterior
surface of the eyeball). Indirect transmission of the pox virus can
also occur via ingestion, when food and water sources, feeders,
perches, cages, or clothing are contaminated with virus-containing
scabs shed from the lesions of an infected bird. The pox virus is
highly resistant to drying and may survive months to years in the
dried scabs. Indirect transmission can also occur via inhalation of
pox virus infected dander, feather debris and air-borne particles.
Mosquitoes are probably responsible for transmission within local
areas, while wild birds are responsible for outbreaks over greater
distances.
Clinical signs observed with avian pox are weakness, emaciation,
difficulty in swallowing and breathing, vision problems, a reduction
in egg production, soiled facial feathers, conjunctivitis, edema of
the eyelids and the presence of the characteristic wart-like growths
on the unfeathered portions of the skin and/or formation of a
diphtheritic membrane on the upper portion of the digestive tract.
A presumptive diagnosis of avian pox can be made due to the gross
lesions on the body. Confirmation of avian pox is accomplished by
microscopic examination for the characteristic Bollinger bodies.
Virus isolation by transmission of the organism via egg inoculation,
serological results and polymerase chain reaction can also be a means
of confirming the disease.
There is no known treatment for avian pox in wild birds. In captive
situations, there are a variety of treatments that have been used
along with supportive care to treat the pox lesions and to prevent
secondary infections in various avian species. These treatments
consist of removing skin lesions and utilizing sodium bicarbonate or
Lugol's solution of iodine washes, removing the diphtheritic membrane
from the mouth and throat and swabbing the area with Lugol's solution
of iodine, bathing the eyes with a 1-2 percent saline solution, and
raising the environmental temperature. In all cases, providing
assistance for recovery may spread the infection to other parts of
the skin or to other birds.
Avian pox is a highly contagious disease, and there are 3 primary
control methods that can be used if infected birds are present.
Eliminating standing water will control the primary vector, the
mosquito. Infected birds should be isolated or culled to remove the
source of the virus. Feeders, waterers, birdbaths and cages should be
decontaminated with a 10 percent bleach solution.
There is no evidence that the avian pox virus can infect humans, and,
therefore, it is not a public health concern.
