Vietnam: Authorities Close to Establishing Cause of Infant Deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health authorities say they are close to tracking down the virus
that has killed 12 infants in southern Vietnam since early February. Dr
Huynh Thanh Thuy of the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City says the
symptoms of the victims suggest _Enterovirus 71_ is the main suspect.
Dr Thuy says he hopes to have test results available in one or 2 weeks.
Outbreaks of enterovirus 71 infection occurred in Malaysia in 1997 and in
Taiwan in 1998, where it killed 78 children.
The 12 infants infected in Vietnam were all under 2 years old and died
within 48 hours of being hospitalised with symptoms of fever, diarrhoea,
and convulsions. Dr Thuy says local health authorities and representatives
from the World Health Organisation will meet shortly to discuss whether
there is any sign of an epidemic outbreak.
