An article in today's Prensa Independiente de Cuba on CubaNet mentions the
reappearance of the epidemic of viral hemorrhagic fever in rabbits in state
farms and private nurseries of various municipalities of Havana.
Municipalities affected are: Caimito, Artemisa, Guanajay, and San Jose, the
province neighboring Havana and in the La Lisa. Transport of rabbits for
commercial purposes or breeding have been banned. The news report mentions
that while this disease is very contagious [to rabbits, it is not
transmitted to humans. The report to the Cooperative of Independent
Journalists was provided by a source in the Institute of Veterinary
Medicine who preferred not to be identified.
