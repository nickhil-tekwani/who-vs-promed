Patient on virus alert
----------------------
A man presenting symptoms similar to viral haemorrhagic fever has been
admitted to the Life Fourways hospital in Johannesburg. The 55 year old
South African citizen, who lives in Malawi, arrived at the hospital on
Thursday [6 Nov 2008] at 7 pm and was brought in to the trauma and
emergency unit before being placed in an isolation unit as a precaution,
said hospital spokeswoman Marietjie Shelly yesterday.

"He had high temperature, severe abdominal and kidney pain, and vomiting.
Initial blood tests gave no indication of internal bleeding," she said.
"Even though no diagnosis has as yet been made for the patient's condition,
as is routine full infection control protocols were immediately implemented
and he was placed in an isolation unit."

This was done as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of hospital
staff, patients and visitors. "He walked into the hospital, he wasn't flown
in or brought in by ambulance," said Shelly.

The National Institute of Communicable Diseases had been informed about the
latest admission, she said. A broad range of blood tests and screenings
were currently in progress as these symptoms may also be indicative of
other non-infectious conditions.

Just a month ago, American scientists identified a new type of arenavirus
which caused the deaths of 4 people since September [2008]. A name was
still being chosen for the virus. The 1st person known to have died from
the virus was a woman who was flown from Zambia to South Africa in
September for emergency treatment. 3 previous visits to health facilities
had failed to determine what was wrong with her. Since then the paramedic
who accompanied her, a nurse at the Morningside Medi Clinic, and a contract
cleaner have died. Another nursing sister is currently receiving treatment
at the Morningside Medi Clinic after presenting with symptoms. However, she
had since been moved from the intensive care unit. "She's improved that
much... however, she's is still in isolation," said hospital spokeswoman
Melinda Pelser. Pelser said doctors indicated that the nursing sister was
not infectious anymore. As a precautionary measure the woman would be kept
in isolation for 3 more weeks.

A total of 39 people who had been in contact with her were still being
monitored for signs of the virus.
