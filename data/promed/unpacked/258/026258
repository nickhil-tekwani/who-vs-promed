Illinois: 1st West Nile virus positive results: crow and mosquito pools
-----------------------------------------------
A dead crow and 2 pools of mosquitoes collected in DuPage County have been
reported West Nile virus-positive; the 1st positive results in Illinois in
2004 for the mosquito-borne disease, Dr Eric E Whitaker, state public
health director, announced on Thu 13 May. Dr Whitaker said the Illinois
Department of Public Health was notified by DuPage County of the findings
as part of the county's routine surveillance for West Nile virus. The dead
crow was found Mon [10 May] in Downers Grove, and the mosquito pools were
collected on 6 May in Wayne, and, on Mon 10 May, in Darien. "Illinois has
seen West Nile virus activity during the past 3 years, and it is not a
surprise to see a positive test result reported in the spring," Dr.
Whitaker said. "These reports simply underscore the fact that the state and
local health departments have in place a very aggressive surveillance
effort for West Nile and other mosquitoborne diseases."

In 2003, the 1st positive bird for West Nile virus was reported on 21 May
in Henderson County. In all, in 2003, 75 of the state's 102 counties were
found to have a West Nile virus positive bird, mosquito, horse, or human
case. A total of 54 human cases of West Nile disease, including one
fatality, was reported in 2003 in Illinois. In 2002, the state led the
nation with 884 human cases (including 66 deaths), and West Nile activity
was reported in 100 of 102 counties.

Surveillance for West Nile virus began on 1 May 2004 and includes
collecting dead crows and blue jays. Citizens who observe a sick or dying
crow, or blue jay, should contact their local health department, which will
determine if the bird is to be picked up for testing. Additional
information about West Nile virus can be found on the Department's website:

Colorado: 2nd suspected West Nile virus positive human case
-----------------------------------------------------------
A Westminster woman, and a Weld County man, may be the 1st people in
Colorado in 2004 to have contracted West Nile virus infection. Preliminary
blood tests on the 61 year old man and the physical therapist were positive
for West Nile virus.

But state health officials, in the midst of a 2nd round of tests on both
persons, are skeptical that West Nile virus has turned up this early in the
year. "We look at test results in conjunction with clinical symptoms and
with epidemiological evidence," said John Pape, an epidemiologist with the
state health department. At the moment, he said, there is little
epidemiological evidence that would point to West Nile virus as the culprit
for either illness.

In 2003, the 1st confirmed human West Nile case was recorded on 22 Jul
2003, according to the state health department. In all, 2947 people in
Colorado got the virus in 2003 -- the most of any state -- and 63 of those
people have died, health department data indicate.

While they await confirmation of the disease, both of 2004's potential West
Nile victims are recovering at home.

[3] Equine case - Arizona

Arizona; 1st West Nile virus positive equine case of 2004
---------------------------------------------------------
An Arizona horse has tested positive for West Nile virus, the state's 1st
equine case of 2004. A veterinarian reported that the horse has been in the
same Phoenix stable for the past few years. State veterinary officials say
that the fact that the animal has been in the same stable for that period
of time rules out the possibility that it contracted the virus while traveling.

Horse owners are being urged to vaccinate their horses against West Nile
virus and Western equine encephalitis virus. Both are transmitted by
mosquitoes that feed on infected birds.

Young pigs may be susceptible to West Nile virus infection
----------------------------------------------------------
Food Safety Consortium researchers at Iowa State University found that
weanling pigs, about 4 weeks old, are susceptible to West Nile virus
infection from a relatively small dose of virus delivered by mosquitoes.
The pigs' susceptibility to the virus appears to decrease as the pigs grow
older, but more research remains to be done to determine the level of risk
in older, market-age pigs. Among the younger pigs studied, the levels of
virus in the bloodstream can be quite high. "There is enough virus in their
blood that I wouldn't want to cut myself with a knife that just went
through [such tissue]," said Kenneth Platt, an ISU Veterinary Microbiology
Professor who conducted the study.

It is common among other animals, and birds, for the virus concentration to
be much higher in younger individuals than in older ones. If more extensive
research into market-age 200 pound pigs shows the virus concentration at
high levels for 3 or 4 days, similar to that found in the weanlings, "then
I think there should be concern with regard to individuals who are handling
those carcasses and derived meat products," says Platt.

The next step would be to examine how long the virus remains infective in
fresh meat and frozen meat products. Infected pigs can pose a problem, not

only for plant workers who come in contact with them, but also because they
can cause uninfected mosquitoes to contract West Nile virus when they feed
on [viremic] pigs. Even so, pigs are still not a significant source of
virus for mosquitoes, noted Platt. Mosquitoes remain the most likely source
of infection in pigs when they are housed together on the farm or at an
abattoir. "In our observations we've had infected and uninfected pigs in
the same pen in intimate contact, and we saw no evidence of transmission
from pig to pig" said Platt.

More research on the subject is necessary. For example, if a 6 month old
market-age pig has a high level of West Nile virus in its bloodstream, the
threat to the processing plant employee could be exposure by cutting
through infected meat or by incurring a scratch from a sharp bone. "If you
pick it up and handle it, and you don't have any scratches on your hand, I
don't think that would be a problem," says Platt. "If you cut yourself on a
bone or knife, it could be a problem. But we don't really know yet."
