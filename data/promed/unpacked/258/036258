LETHAL YELLOWING, MILDEW, TREE CROPS - MOZAMBIQUE

In Mozambique's Zambezia province, Groupo Madal is the largest
employer besides the government, with 16 000 hectares [39 540 acres]
of 1.2 million coconut trees. The civil war and a combination of
lethal yellowing disease that killed a quarter of the plantation,
erratic rainfall, theft of nuts, and a low global price for oil and
copra badly affected the group.

An aggressive scheme will see 200 000 seedlings replanted this year
[2009]. But the group expects to sell just 3000 tons of high-quality
coconut oil -- half of the 2007 figure -- and less than 10 000 tons
of copra to its main Swiss buyer in 2009.

The government has an active extension programme involving 644 field
officers. But this is proving of limited value to coconut as well as
many other crops in Mozambique. Madal sources 65 percent of its nuts
from outgrowers, yet improving yields among such smallholders is
proving tough. Trees produce a third of what some East Asian
varieties get, earning growers just USD 2 a tree a year.

Producers of cashews, traditionally the main export crop, face
similar supply problems. In Nampula province to the north, the
advancing age of the trees, coupled with powdery mildew disease,
means yields are around a third of healthy trees in Viet Nam and
India. Along with the effects of war and volatile weather patterns,
Mozambique's cashew output has slipped from about 200 000 tons before
independence to 80 000 tons today.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_
Phytoplasma palmae). Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening
of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to
be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved
in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the
pathogen cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as
reservoir hosts. LY is spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa,
while in Asia there are a number of coconut diseases suspected to be
caused by related phytoplasmas.

LY affects many palm species, but at least for coconut palm,
susceptibility may vary between cultivars or even within cultivars
depending on the region where they grow. Symptoms can be suppressed
by regular tetracycline treatments, but commercial control of LY
relies on replanting with resistant varieties. Malayan Dwarf
varieties show good resistance, but an unexplained resistance
breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids has recently been
reported and is causing great concern. In Mozambique, LY has been
spreading continuously in the coastal coconut belt to the north and
south of Quelimane in Zambezia province. Nevertheless, substantial
areas still remain LY free and quarantine measures are in place to
restrict movement of coconut planting material.

Powdery mildew on cashew (_Anacardium occidentale_) is caused by the
fungus _Oidium anacardii_. It causes significant yield losses in this
crop in East Africa, sometimes in combination with other factors. In
Brazil however, the origin of _A. occidentale_, it has not been
reported as a serious problem. Infected panicles and leaves are
coated with white, powdery fungal growth. Infection may lead to
pre-mature flower and fruit drop. In severe attacks the entire
panicle may be infected and the fruit fail to set. Neglected trees,
and in particular infected suckers, are the primary source of
inoculum. Spores are spread by wind, water, and mechanical means,
including insect activity. Disease management usually requires an
integrated approach including fungicides, cultural practices, host
resistance, and orchard sanitation. The related species _Oidium
mangiferae_ affects mango crops.
