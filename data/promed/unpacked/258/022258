Shigella, bean/salsa dip - USA (West Coast): recall 20000126190236

The Food and Drug Administration is alerting the public not to purchase or
consume recalled 5 layer dips sold under the brand names Senor Felix's,
Trader Joe's, Delicioso, and The Carryout Cafe because they have the
potential to be contaminated with _Shigella sonnei_ bacteria, an organism
that causes a form of bacterial dysentery which can cause bloody diarrhea,
cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting and can possibly lead to
hospitalization. _Shigella_ infection is serious and very contagious, but
can be treated though prompt medical attention.
The recalled 5 layer dips contain layers of black or pinto beans, salsa,
guacamole, nacho cheese and sour cream, among other ingredients. They were
distributed nationwide in retail stores and can be identified with the
following brand names:
Senor Felix's Five Layered Party Dip
Delicioso 5 Layer Dip
Trader Joe's Five Layered Fiesta Dip
The Carryout Cafe Mexican Fiesta Party Dip 5 Layer
All of the above products were manufactured by Senor Felix's Gourmet
Mexican Foods Inc., of Baldwin Park, California. These products were
recalled voluntarily (with an accompanying press release) by the company on
January 22, after they were linked to shigellosis outbreaks in several
western states.
To date at least 49 illnesses (five hospitalizations) have been reported in
association with consumption of this product. FDA is working with the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments to
track the affected products and to identify the cause of the problem.
Consumers who have purchased any of the affected 5 layer dips should return
them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Those who have consumed
these recalled products and have experienced symptoms of shigellosis should
seek medical attention. Consumers with questions may contact the company at
1-800-807-7335.
