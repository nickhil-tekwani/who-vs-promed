FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - MONGOLIA (11): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Foot and mouth disease [FMD] continues to spread and has become more
serious day by day in Sukhbaatar county [southeast Mongolia]. The
disease has already spread to many counties of the province.

It is reported that among 80 000 livestock in the affected area in
Sukhbaatar province, more than 5000 are confirmed to have contracted
FMD. The emergency commission of Sukhbaatar province called
conferences for 18 days to gather reports and draw up control
measures, but as yet to little avail.

The main reasons why the disease is becoming more and more serious
are the lack of doctors and medicines, especially the acute shortage
of vaccine, said the epidemic prevision workers. It is conjectured
that FMD in Sukhbaatar county was brought in by the Mongolian gazelle
in Mata De County, Eastern Province of Mongolia.

[The above information falls in line with information included in the
speech of Mongolia's President, Elbegdorj Tsakhia, at the Mongolian
Parliament, as cited by the daily UB Post of 26 Oct 2010. The speech
included the following sentence:

"The eastern Mongolian steppe is now being devastated by foot and
mouth disease for 2 months in a row. The cattle believed to be dear
to Mongolian herdsmen and people, who care for each and every calf
and foal, lamb and kid risking their own lives, is being killed and
buried in thousands". (See at
<http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5465&Itemid=36>).

However, the above information is not confirmed by Mongolia's last
report to the OIE, dated 16 Oct 2010, according to which "no new
outbreaks" have been recorded since the follow-up report of 11 Sep
2010. This discrepancy, already pointed out in previous postings (see
archived 201009213400, 20101020.3800), as well as the unusually high
morbidity rate (100 percent) reported from the 2 affected locations,
call for clarification. It will also help to obtain detailed
quantitative and qualitative data on the FMD vaccine(s) applied in
Mongolia for mass vaccinations since the appearance of FMDV serotype
O in April 2010.
