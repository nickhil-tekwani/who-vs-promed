Indonesia: Avian influenza situation - WHO update 33
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 30 year old man from Tangerang
District, Banten Province, developed symptoms on 13 Jan 2008, was
hospitalized on 19 Jan 2008, and is currently in hospital. Investigations
into the source of his infection are ongoing.

WHO catalogs H5N1 viruses, launches tracking system
---------------------------------------------------
Countries affected by H5N1 avian influenza have sent material containing
734 H5N1 virus isolates to the World Health Organization (WHO) over the
past 5 years, and from now on the public will be able to track particular
isolates that have been submitted and what is being done with them,
according to WHO.
An online chart published by WHO yesterday [21 Jan 2008] shows that
countries submitted 8763 samples from humans and animals from 2003 through
2007, and 734 H5N1 viruses were isolated from those samples. WHO needs the
isolates so it can monitor the virus's evolution, potential for human
transmissibility, and susceptibility to antiviral drugs.
Viet Nam contributed the most H5N1 isolates: 375, derived from 1199
samples. But Indonesia provided the second most: 171 isolates derived from
4774 submitted samples. This, despite the fact that the country stopped
sending H5N1 samples for several months last year [2007] because of concern
that vaccines derived from such samples are too expensive for developing
countries. In 2007 Indonesia sent WHO 92 clinical samples, from which 20
viruses were isolated, the WHO chart shows. The country had withheld H5N1
samples from the WHO for about 5 months starting at the beginning of the
year, according to previous reports.
Tracking system announced
-------------------------
On the heels of the report on H5N1 specimens submitted, the WHO today
unveiled an online system to provide information on H5N1 specimens shared
with the WHO through its Global Influenza Surveillance Network. The system
permits anyone to search for particular isolates by date of submission,
source country, host species, and several other variables. The system
provides a page of detailed information for each isolate, including a list
of all the laboratories to which the virus has been distributed, including
pharmaceutical companies.
WHO describes the current system as an interim version. At this point it
contains most of the viruses and clinical specimens that have been
submitted to WHO since 24 Nov 2007, plus all H5N1 viruses that have been
developed into vaccine viruses, according to a WHO statement. Information
on the remaining viruses submitted since 24 Nov 2007 is being added to the
system.
Both the tracking system and the country-by-country report are results, at
least in part, of Indonesia's concerns about the fairness and openness of
the WHO system for the sharing, monitoring, and use of influenza viruses.
A WHO statement today [22 Jan 2008] said the tracking system was developed
following the intergovernmental meeting on flu virus sharing that was held
21-23 Nov 2007 in Geneva. At the meeting, a WHO working group tried
unsuccessfully to resolve Indonesia's concerns about sending H5N1 specimens
to WHO. The country pushed for rules forbidding the commercial use of H5N1
samples, such as for vaccine development, without the source country's
permission. But no agreement was reached. The November meeting and other
discussions in 2007 were held in response to a resolution passed at WHO's
World Health Assembly last May [2007]. The resolution called on the WHO
director-general to come up with a system for equitable sharing of the
benefits of flu-virus sharing, to set up an international stockpile of
vaccines for H5N1 and other potential pandemic viruses, and to revise the
"terms of reference" for international sharing of flu viruses.
Viruses chosen for vaccines
---------------------------
The WHO chart of H5N1 viruses submitted in the past 5 years says 13
isolates were selected for development into vaccines. So far, 8 engineered
viruses derived from these isolates, "suitable for vaccine development and
production, are available for distribution," WHO reports.
The agency says 292 institutions have received one or more copies of the 8
engineered viruses, and 46 institutions have received "wild-type" vaccine
viruses.
Numerous other countries besides Viet Nam and Indonesia have submitted
samples that yielded H5N1 isolates over the years, according to WHO. For
example, Hong Kong submitted 380 specimens that yielded 4 isolates, China
(other than Hong Kong) submitted 26 samples with 22 isolates, Egypt sent
758 specimens with 26 isolates, and Turkey provided 335 specimens with 6
isolates.
