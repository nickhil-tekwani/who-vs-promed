In response to Dr. Peter Cyrog concerning public education about Rabies ---
I can only say it is everyone's job to educate the public about this disease.

I have been a Public Health Officer for 15 years now and I monitor the
Rabies Exposure Program from one of the largest hospitals in the Air Force.
It is shocking at how little the public and sometimes the medical staff
know and understand about this disease. Rabies postexposure prophylaxis is
not taken serious by some people who are less than diligent on returning to
get
the series administered in a timely manner.

Private practitioners (physician and veterinarian) need to talk to their
clients concerning Rabies. This is especially true for pediatricians with
parents of young children.

I believe that the American public has been lulled into complacency
concerning this disease because it appears so infrequently in our
population. I am ashamed to admit that it usually takes either a strongly
suspected case (i.e., encephalitis of unknown etiology) or a confirmed case
of human Rabies to get us back on the right track.

Let's be proactive and don't wait for the motivation to be a confirmed case
of human Rabies. We all need to engage on whatever level is available to
us (hunt it out if need be). Talk at schools, PTA meetings, summer camps,
and don't forget individual client education.

This strikes most closely to home for me now as we just had a patient with
encephalitis of unknown etiology go into comma and be admitted to the
intensive care unit for more than 3 weeks. Thankfully it was not Rabies,
but it had us going for awhile. The patient did regain consciousness and is
improving nicely, but my focus was acutely turned to how little people know
about this serious disease.
