[From Verhagen et al. 2021, 13: 212 https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020212:
"Until 2009, the HPAI H5 virus outbreaks in Europe were caused by HPAI H5N1 clade 2.2 viruses, while from 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses dominated outbreaks, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8. The majority of HPAI H5 virus detections in wild and domestic birds within Europe coincide with southwest/westward fall migration and large local waterbird aggregations during wintering."

The brent goose (_Branta bernicla_) breeds on the arctic coasts of Eurasia and North America, mainly on small islets free of Arctic Foxes. It is migratory, wintering at temperate latitudes or at more southern latitudes during severe winters. _Branta b. bernicla_, breeding in North Russia, predominantly on the Taymyr Peninsula, stages in Wadden Sea and winters mainly in The Netherlands, South England, and North west France. _Branta b. hrota_ from Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land winters mainly in Denmark and may reach England and The Netherlands during severe winters. The separate population _B. b. hrota_ from Greenland and Northeast Canada mainly winters in Ireland. Some of these birds reach the British coasts and also maybe France.

The brent goose is a colonial nesting bird. The incidence of infection with HPAI H5N1 has been found to vary with age. A study of the seroprevalence of known age black brant revealed that no birds <4 years old had seroconverted, compared to 49% of birds â‰¥4 years of age (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057614). - Mod.PMB
