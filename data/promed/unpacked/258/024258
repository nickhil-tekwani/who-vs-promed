UNICEF Denies Assam Anti-blindness Campaign Deaths
--------------------------------------------------
The United Nations says it is confident that reports that several children
have died in the Indian state of Assam as a result of a UN-sponsored
anti-blindness campaign are false. About 8 days ago, hundreds of thousands
of children in Assam were given syrup containing Vitamin A in a campaign
organised by the UN's children's organisation, UNICEF, to prevent blindness.
Shortly after, thousands of children were reported to have fallen ill
because of the syrup, and now the Assam state government says at least 16
children have died. But UNICEF told BBC News Online that it did not believe
there was any problem with the syrup, and that it was being wrongly
connected with child deaths from other causes.
On Sun 18 Nov 2001, Assam's senior health official, SN Thakuria, said at
least 16 children had died after being given the Vitamin A doses. Some
reports say the figure is higher. Most of the deaths were reported in the
southern district of Silchar. That statement was in sharp contrast to
comments by Assam's Health Minister, Bhumidhar Barman, earlier last week
that only one or 2 children had died. UNICEF supplied the vitamin
supplement for the anti-blindness campaign, but it was the Assam Government
which organised its distribution.
Early reports gave 2 possible explanations for the child deaths: (1)
Children could have been given more than the prescribed 2 millilitre dose;
or, (2) the syrup was out-of-date or of poor quality. Local officials have
dismissed the first theory. "I personally visited the families and found
out that the deaths were definitely not because of an overdose," Ashish
Bhutani, a district magistrate, told the AFP news agency. And UNICEF
insists none of the syrup it supplied was past its date for consumption or
not up to standard. UNICEF stated that: All the syrup it gave to the Assam
Government had an expiry date of March 2003; and, all syrup it got from
Indian suppliers had passed quality control checks by independent agencies
in India. UNICEF told BBC News Online that it believed it would be
vindicated by the laboratory tests being carried out on the syrup.
UNICEF maintains that about 800 children under 5 years of age die every day
in Assam. A UNICEF Official sated that some children who were already dying
may have been given the Vitamin A syrup. Then when they died, "rumours
spread" that it was the syrup that had killed them. The UNICEF official
stated also that it is quite normal for children to suffer mild
side-effects from the syrup.

One of the possible reasons under consideration for deaths after vitamin A
administration to children in India is over-dosage. The children might have
been administered 2 1/2 times than the normal dose. In this context the
following points might be of relevance.
Although trials have shown that vitamin A supplementation given, as a part
of expanded program of immunisation is safe, one of the side effects to be
kept in mind is hypercalcemia, as shown by the following reports in the
literature.
van Dam MA. The recognition and treatment of hypervitaminosis A. Nurse
Pract 1989 Aug;14(8):28, 30-1
The increasing incidence of vitamin A toxicity is related to vitamin A
supplementation for unfounded reasons. This article describes the common
symptomatology of vitamin A toxicity, including hypercalcemia,
hepatomegaly, and dermatological and neurological effects.
Aggarwal A. Acute toxicity of vitamin A administered with measles
immunization. Indian Pediatr. 1997 May;34(5):456-7.
Vitamin-A-induced hypercalcemia: response to corticosteroids. Bergman SM,
O'Mailia J, Krane NK, Wallin JD.
Hypercalcemia crisis or severe hypercalcemia represents a life-threatening
emergency. Edelson GW, Kleerekoper M. Hypercalcemic crisis. Med Clin North
Am 1995 Jan;79(1):79-92
Hypercalcemia can also lead to cardiac dysrhythmia which could be
life-threatening.
If the reports of administering high doses of vitamin A is true, then
subsequent hypercalcemia and its effects on the children should be
considered as a potential cause for these deaths.

[It appears as though there are conflicting reports now on the actual
situation in India. The original posting did suggest the possibility of
overdose of Vitamin A attributable to human error combined with
introduction of a new dispensing measurer. The BBC article in this posting
suggests that the deaths were coincidental in previously ill children who
were given Vitamin A supplement. If there are any ProMED-mail readers with
official information to help clarify this situation, it would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP
