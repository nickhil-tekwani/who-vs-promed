An outbreak of bubonic plague is turning prairie dog towns into ghost towns
on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Since the presence of the bacteria
that causes the plague [_Yersinia pestis_ was confirmed on the reservation
and in southern Phillips County last fall, about 3 600 acres of healthy
prairie dog towns have died off, and more are being decimated each month.
Environmental officials suspect the area is on the verge of a plague
epidemic similar to the one that annihilated prairie dogs on nearly 21,000
acres in Phillips County in the mid-1990s. The die-off is hurting
endangered black-footed ferrets and rare mountain plovers. The ferrets,
which are being reintroduced in Montana, feed on prairie dogs and live in
their burrows. The plovers prefer to nest in the sparse vegetation provided
by prairie dog towns. So far, the prairie dog towns infected in and near
Phillips County are in very remote areas, miles from the nearest cities or
tourist attractions.
