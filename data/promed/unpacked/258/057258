Fears that Gujarat may soon face another viral outbreak have grown
stronger. The state government revealed on Wednesday [4 Aug 2010]
that acute viral encephalitis, an illness which causes swelling of
the brain, had claimed 17 lives. Shockingly, of these, 11 people
breathed their last on Tuesday [3 Aug 2010] alone.

Alarmed by the high number of deaths in a day, the state health
department has sent emergency medical teams to Vadodara, Kheda, and
Panchmahal -- the 3 districts where all the 17 deaths have occurred.
"We have sent rapid action teams to the affected regions," State
health minister Jay Narayan Vyas told Mirror. "Every necessary step
will be taken to prevent the outbreak of the disease."

He also said that so far 29 people had tested positive for viral
encephalitis. [The tests employed are not specified, nor specific
viruses implicated. - Mod.TY] Till Tuesday [3 Aug 2010], this figure
was 16. "We have sent samples of suspected cases to National
Institute of Virology in Pune. Once we receive the reports, we will
prepare an action plan (to deal with the situation)," he said.

Of the 17 deaths in Gujarat, 9 have been reported in Panchmahal, 6 in
Kheda, and 2 in Vadodara. The 3 districts seem to be in the grip of
viral encephalitis as they also account for all the positive cases so
far. Sources in the health department said one could contract the
disease through many ways. However, in the current situation, sand
fly appears to be spreading the infection.

Though the number of positive cases is not that high at present,
there is still a lot of concern among health authorities. This is
because more than 36 000 people in the state, including 2006 in
Ahmedabad, are suffering from a "fever of unknown origin" (FUO).
There are fears that a significant number of these people may have
contracted viral encephalitis.

Encephalitis is caused mostly by a viral infection, which can be
contracted through insect bites, food, drink, or contact with an
infected person. Once the virus enters the bloodstream, it localises
the brain, forcing white blood cells to invade the brain issue to
battle the infection. This results in swelling of the brain. The
disease can cause nerve damage, permanent impairment, and even death
if there is a delay in treatment. Fever, headaches, clumsiness,
drowsiness, vomiting, and convulsions are among the symptoms related
to the illness. The elderly, infants, and HIV patients are the most
at risk. Though the acute phase of viral encephalitis lasts for a
couple of weeks, some people may take several months to recover.

"The percentage of children testing positive is high. They have high
fever and suffer from convulsions. There are also instances where
affected people have gone into comma," Vyas said. He said people who
show symptoms of encephalitis should be hospitalised immediately. "If
an infected person is not put under immediate medical observation,
the chances of his/her condition becoming acute increase sharply,"
the health minister said.

On the carrier of the infection, he said that sandflies were mostly
found in mud houses. "They enter through cracks in the walls," he said.

[Although the virus involved in these encephalitis cases is not
specified, the health authorities apparently suspect a
sandfly-transmitted virus. The most likely candidate is Chandipura
virus, which has been recognized previously in parts of India as an
etiologic agent of encephalitis. It occurs both epidemically and in
sporadic cases. In children, the course of the disease can be rapid
with 55-75 percent mortality. Chandipura virus outbreaks have
occurred previously in Gujarat state. ProMED-mail would be interested
in receiving additional information, and especially the results of
the laboratory tests, as they become available.
