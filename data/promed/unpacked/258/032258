Myrtle rust, also known as guava rust and eucalyptus rust, [has been] confirmed on p≈çhutukawa trees [_Metrosideros excelsa_; "NZ christmas bush"] on Raoul Island [Kermadec Island group]. If it were to enter mainland New Zealand, it could affect iconic New Zealand plants, as well as commercially-grown species such as eucalyptus, guava and feijoa.

MPI's Geoff Gwyn says, "Our focus right now is to protect the unique Raoul Island ecosystem, and to prevent the further spread of the fungus to the mainland." New Zealand already has stringent biosecurity measures. Myrtle rust is well established along the eastern seaboard of Australia and in New Caledonia.

[Myrtle or guava rust (_Puccinia psidii_) is thought to have originated in the central and southern Americas. It affects a large number of Myrtaceae, including fruit crops like guava (_Psidium guajava_) and feijoa (pineapple guava; _Acca sellowiana_) which originate in the same region. Additional species have been assigned to a 'eucalyptus/guava rust complex' the taxonomy of which appears to need clarification.

Since its 1st detection in Australia in 2010, the rust poses a threat to native ecosystems, as well as to commercial crops for the production of guava, feijoa and pharmaceutical oils. Eradication attempts have been unsuccessful. In New Zealand, it would also be a threat to _Leptospermum scoparium_ ("Manuka"), a native species used widely for commercial honey production.

Generally, rust spores are spread by wind over long distances, by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material poses a high risk of spreading the pathogens. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit spread as well as build-up of inoculum.
