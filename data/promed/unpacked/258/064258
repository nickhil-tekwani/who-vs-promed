Autochthonous transmission of the Chagas disease in Louisiana
-----------------------------------------------
Autochthonous transmission of the Chagas disease parasite,
_Trypanosoma cruzi_, was detected in a [74-year-old female] patient
in rural New Orleans, Louisiana [in July 2006]. The patient had
positive test results from 2 serologic tests and hemoculture; 56
percent of 18 _Triatoma sanguisuga_ collected from the house of the
patient were positive for __T. cruzi__ by PCR.
Only 5 autochthonous cases of infection with the Chagas disease
parasite have been reported in the United States: 3 in infants in
Texas (2,3), 1 in an infant in Tennessee (4), and 1 in a 56-year-old
woman in California (5). The most important triatomine species in the
United States for Chagas disease transmission are _Triatoma
sanguisuga_, [for photo see:
<http://www.rso.cornell.edu/bugclub/images/Triatoma%20sanguisuga.jpg>
- Mod.JW], whose broad range extends across the southeast and reaches
Maryland and Texas, and _T. gerstaekeri_, found in Texas and New
Mexico (6). There is an active sylvan cycle in the United States;
__T. cruzi__ has been identified directly or by serologic analysis
in >18 species of mammals (7), including raccoons, opossums,
armadillos, foxes, skunks, dogs, wood rats, squirrels, and nonhuman
primates (housed in outdoor research facilities). In Louisiana, __T.
cruzi__ infection has been identified in 28.8 percent and 1.1 percent
of armadillos (8,9), 37.5 percent of opossums (9), 4.7 percent of
rural dogs (10) and rarely in nonhuman primates (11, P.L. Dorn et
al., unpub. data). The lack of human cases is usually attributed to
not having a suitable habitat for the bugs in most US homes, a
preference for animal hosts, and delayed defecation of triatomines
found in the United States compared with those found in Latin America (12).
The Study:
In June 2006, a 74-year-old woman residing in a house in rural New
Orleans was bothered by a considerable number (more than 50) of
insect bites. The woman observed many bugs in the house and showed
them to a fumigator, who identified them as triatomines. An internet
search showed the potential for transmission of Chagas disease, and
the woman sought help from a local health sciences center.
Conclusions:
The assertion that the patient contacted _T. cruzi_ in Louisiana is
strongly supported by limited travel history to disease-endemic areas
and stays mostly in improved housing (risk for Chagas disease
transmission is associated with longer residence in disease-endemic
areas), lack of other risk factors, and large numbers of infected
__T. sanguisuga__ in the house. No periorbital swelling was reported.
However, the streaks on her nightgown consistent with triatomine
feces indicate exposure, and the parasite could have been introduced
into any of her numerous bite wounds.
The residents had not previously noticed large numbers of _T.
sanguisuga_ in the house. However, Hurricane Katrina had hit the area
9 months earlier, and increases in domestic infestation with
triatomines have been previously reported after a hurricane (15).
Anecdotally, the armadillo population increased substantially in the
months after Hurricane Katrina, and one can speculate that these
hosts supported a larger bug population, who later sought other
bloodmeal sources as the armadillo population returned to pre-storm
levels. Follow-up studies of local _T. sanguisuga_ ecology and animal
reservoirs are planned.

[It is highly plausible that the patient was indeed infected in
Louisiana, and even a single case like this demonstrates that there
must be an animal reservoir of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in the locality.
Previous work (cited above in the references) has demonstrated _T.
cruzi_ in Louisiana armadillos, possums and dogs. It should be noted
that transmission to humans requires bites by infected triatomid
bugs, which usually live in cracks in house walls. It is a typical
disease of poverty and poor living conditions. Further studies of the
animal reservoir and vector are needed. - Mod.EP]
