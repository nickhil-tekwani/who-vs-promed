China's Ministry of Agriculture said on [Sun 19 Aug 2018] 88 hogs had died from African swine fever [ASF] in the city of Lianyungang, in eastern China's Jiangsu province, as the highly contagious disease continues to spread through the world's biggest pig herd.

A total of 615 hogs have been infected since 15 Aug 2018 with the swine fever in Lianyungang, in Jiangsu province, where authorities have banned the movement of hogs, related products and animals that are easily infected both into and outside the affected area, the ministry said.

Emergency measures, including culling and disinfecting animals, have brought the outbreak in the city's Haizhou district under "effective control," the ministry said.

The ministry did not answer a call or immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on how it is acting to contain the spread of the [African] swine fever.

The Jiangsu cases are the 3rd outbreak of ASF in China this month [August 2018]. The disease, for which there is no available vaccine, had never previously been detected in East Asia. It does not affect humans.

By road, Lianyungang is about 1300 km [about 808 mi] south of Shenyang, the provincial capital of Liaoning province, where China's 1st case of the fever was reported on 3 Aug 2018.

A 2nd outbreak was reported on Thursday about 600 km [about 373 mi] east of Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province in central China.

The pigs found to be infected in Zhengzhou had travelled from a live market in Heilongjiang province, which, like Liaoning, is in China's northeast.

Liaoning has culled more than 8000 hogs in an attempt to contain the outbreak, while a unit of WH Group, the world's top pork producer, said it had culled 1362 pigs at the slaughterhouse where the Zhengzhou cases were discovered.

[China has officially reported, so far, ASF in 2 provinces: Henan and Liaoning (see OIE's ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/y899xbvf; click on northeast China, then zoom in). However, epidemiological investigation indicated that the pigs found infected in Henan had traveled thousands of kilometers from a farm in Jiamusi city in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, bordering Russia. It is thus highly probable that the additional infected province, Jiangsu, is in fact China's 4th infected province (see 20180817.5969883).

ProMED-mail subscriber David Thomson comments: "[There is] a lot of potential for [ASF] spread in China, and we have just begun to see a small piece of the iceberg. To further assess the potential implications of this, perhaps a reasonable place to look might be the international natural hog casings trade, in particular, origin substitution within that trade." - Mod.AS]
