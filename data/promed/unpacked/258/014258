At least 9 new cases of food poisoning were recorded at the beginning of the week [week of 20 Aug 2018] by the medical teams at Ain-Bessem Hospital. According to a medical source, the subjects all suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and acute renal failure, just as the 7 previous cases transferred to the El-Kettar specialized hospital in Algiers. These new victims bring the number of people affected to 16, including 2 fatalities, since Tue 7 Aug 2018. The source stated that the last patients are aged between 42 and 56 years old and are all from the locality of Mrabhia, in the commune of Raouraoua, and the commune of Bir-Ghbalou.

"They are currently supported at El-Kettar's EPS, and their condition is stabilizing. The origin of these intoxications should be food, since no trace of water contamination was detected in the water-supply networks of the 2 regions. Although the epidemiological investigation has still not revealed the origin of this pathology, we have confirmation of acute gastroenteritis. Moreover, this disease, which is very similar to cholera, affects children and the elderly much more, as is the case with the 2 women who died last week," said Dr Henni, head of prevention at the health department of the province [Bouira].

The Ministry of Health and Population confirmed last Monday [20 Aug 2018] through a press release the thesis of food poisoning, while dismissing a link with waterborne poisoning. "A total of 35 cases of severe isolated gastroenteritis have been recorded in some areas in the provinces of Blida and Bouira. These are isolated cases registered in a supported family circle. The condition of the affected people is gradually improving, pending the results of bacteriological tests," the document from minister of health Professor Hasbellaoui stated, adding that bacteriological control has demonstrated the absence of pollution in the drinking-water supply network. "The control of water remains in force while strengthening the system of control and care at the different health structures. In order to prevent the emergence of other cases, we call for the respect of individual and collective basic hygiene measures through handwashing with soap several times a day," the minister recommended.

[The health authorities in Bouira are working hard to unravel the underpinnings of this health crisis, which has been presented in the form of multiple cases of gastroenteritis of probable food origin, but with other symptoms such as acute renal failure noted in patients. The confirmation of the cholera outbreak in several Algerian provinces makes the situation even more complex. ProMED-MENA would appreciate more information on this "mysterious disease" as well as the results of the bacteriological analyses published as soon as possible. - Mod.AB]

[It is noteworthy that Bouira province borders with Bilda province to its east, a province reporting cholera activity in the past week, raising one's suspicions that this "undiagnosed" illness might be cholera.

Bouira province is in the north central part of Algeria (see https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Algeria_provinces_english.png. - Mod.MPP]
