Cattle Liver Disease Alert
--------------------------
Test results from the Department of Primary Industries and Water's
animal health laboratories have confirmed 2 cases of acute bovine
liver disease (ABLD) in the Evandale and Deloraine districts. This
disease can cause very high losses in cattle and is most often
reported during relatively warm, moist autumns. It is thought the
cause of ABLD is a toxin produced by a pasture fungus. ABLD has
occurred sporadically over a number of years and DPIW has been
working to identify the specific cause.

Affected cattle may have clinical signs ranging from photosensitivity
to sudden death. Photosensitivity typically looks like sunburn on
white areas of skin, edges of ears and around the muzzle. It can also
involve discharge from eyes and the animals actively seeking shade.
The 1st signs a producer sees may be increased irritability in the
dairy during milking or a sudden drop in milk yield.

It is critical that cattle are moved off a suspect pasture as soon as
managers are suspicious of ABLD. Veterinary examination is needed to
rule out other diseases and, if it is ABLD, provide appropriate
treatment for affected survivors and provide more information on the
cause. Affected cattle need shade, easily accessible water and soft
feed. Because of the acute nature of ABLD, suspicions must be acted
on urgently to minimise losses and maximise information.

DPIW's work on ABLD so far indicates the risky paddocks usually have
a lot of dead matter in the base (i.e., not grazed heavily last
spring). In particular, the risk appears even greater if a weed
called Rough Dog's Tail is present. Producers should avoid placing
cattle on such paddocks if they can. It is usually safe to graze them
off with sheep. If, however, they have to take a risk, they should
ensure that the cattle are not hungry when they go onto the paddock.

There is no evidence that ABLD is a risk to human health.

Please contact your local veterinarian or DPIW's Animal Health and
Welfare Branch for more information on ABLD.

[The Tasmanian Dept of Primary Industries & Water has this
information on this disease:

What is it?
-----------
Acute bovine liver disease (ABLD), previously known as phytotoxic
hepatitis, is a disease of beef and dairy cattle. Although it occurs
sporadically throughout Tasmania, most recorded cases have been in
the Northern Midlands and South, particularly the Derwent Valley and
Copping area. Cases have also been recorded interstate. Facial Eczema
is a disease that may appear similar to ABLD, and has been recorded
in dairy herds in north eastern Tasmania. It also occurs sporadically
in sheep, beef and dairy cattle in mainland south eastern Australia.
While ABLD and Facial Eczema are both toxic diseases of the liver,
the cause of Facial Eczema is known. The cause of ABLD is unknown.

Signs of the Disease
--------------------
The signs of ABLD are variable. As the name of the disease suggests,
signs are related to liver disease of sudden onset. In the worst
cases, sudden deaths of cattle over 6 months of age occur and these
may be sporadic or they may involve large numbers within a herd. In
cattle that don't die suddenly, signs observed are mostly related to
photosensitisation, which occurs when plant breakdown products react
with sunlight in the skin. Affected cattle may be distressed,
agitated, seek shade and develop sunburn on the muzzle and areas of
pale skin, such as white faces, white patches, udder and vulva. Other
signs may include fever, a drop in milk production and depression.
Other species such as sheep and horses are not affected.

Cause
-----
Although ABLD may be a very severe liver condition, the cause is
unknown. Cases of ABLD are often associated with the introduction of
cattle into certain paddocks, particularly those that have been
under-utilised and contain considerable standing and/or fallen dry
feed. Signs of ABLD may be observed within hours of introducing
cattle to the 'toxic' paddock. An annual grass known as Rough Dog's
Tail (Cynosurus echinatus) is often associated with cases of ABLD,
however it is unknown whether the plant is directly involved or
whether it is merely an 'indicator' of some other factor. Because
many cases of ABLD are associated with warm, moist weather in autumn
or spring, a fungal toxin associated with Rough Dog's Tail has been
suggested as being a possible cause. There is no current evidence
that the plant itself is toxic. State departments of agriculture and
primary industry are currently studying cases in an attempt to
identify the cause(s).

Complications
-------------
Surviving cattle generally have a prolonged recovery. Areas of
affected skin eventually slough off and may become infected. A drop
in milk production can be significant and if teats are involved,
mastitis may occur.

Treatment
---------
There is no known cure for the condition. Although recovery is
normally prolonged, early intervention by a veterinarian may assist
with recovery by the use of medications such as anti-inflammatories,
anti-histamines and zinc. Affected animals should be provided with
shade and easy access to drinking water, and may require hand
feeding. Skin treatments, particularly those containing zinc and
lanolin (e.g., nappy rash cream), may help if applied to affected
areas of skin. Severely photosensitised cattle may have to be
humanely destroyed.

Prevention
----------
Paddocks may remain 'toxic' for variable lengths of time (hours to
months) following an ABLD event. It is unknown whether 'toxic'
paddocks will be 'toxic' in future years. Management options include:
(1) eating out the paddock with sheep to reduce the amount of dry
standing material,
(2) cultivation of high risk paddocks,
(3) avoiding grazing cattle on paddocks with an abundance of dry
material which have been spelled for extended periods of time, and
(4) trying cattle again but with only a few animals at 1st to test
for 'toxicity'. Cattle should be frequently observed if grazed on
'at-risk' paddocks during 'danger' periods, particularly during
autumn and spring. Cattle should be moved off the paddock immediately
if any unusual signs are observed.
