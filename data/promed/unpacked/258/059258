A paper by Gale P, Young R, Stanfield G and Oakes D, "Development of a risk
assessment for BSE in the aquatic environment" is published in the Journal
of Applied Microbiology, 1998, Vol 84, 467-477.
The summary notes the resistance of BSE prions to degradation, and states
that levels of disinfection used for drinking water treatment would have
little effect. The summary continues:
"This paper presents the assumptions which were used to model the risks from
a rendering plant disposing of cull cattle carcasses in the catchment of a
chalk aquifer which is used for drinking water abstraction. The risk
assessment approach focused on identifying the hydrogeological and physical
barriers which would contribute to preventing BSE infectivity gaining entry
to the aquifer. These barriers include inactivation of BSE agent by the
rendering process, removal from the effluent by treatment at the plant,
filtration and adsorption in the clay and chalk, and dilution in the ground
water. The importance in environmental risk assessment of the cow-to-man
species barrier is considered. Two key conclusions about the environmental
behaviour of the BSE agent are that prion proteins are 'sticky' and bind to
particulates, and that the millions of BSE prion molecules comprising a
human oral LD50 are subject to some degree of dispersion and hence dilution
in the environment. Assuming that the rendering plant processes 2,000 cull
cattle carcasses per week, the risks to drinking water consumers were
estimated to be remote. Indeed, even using worst cases assumptions an
individual would have to consume 2 litres per day of tap water for 45
million years to have a 50% chance of infection through drinking water drawn
from the aquifer".
Intrigued by the reference in the summary to "sticky" I think others might
be interested to see what they say about that in the body of the paper
(which, AFAIK, is not accessible on-line). It is, of course, only one of the
many factors dealt with as part of their approach to the risk assessment.
Under the heading " 5.1 BSE will be bound to particulates and suspended
solids in the aquatic environment" they write
"Infectivity is associated with biological membranes and infectious prion
particles are insoluble (Prusiner 1991). This is responsible for many of the
difficulties which have been encountered during attempts to purify and
characterize the infectious agent in scrapie. Indeed, infectivity is
sometimes described as 'sticky'. The reason for this 'stickiness' and the
insolubility of PrPsc are explained by the biochemistry and biophysical
properties of the PrPsc molecule and, in particular, its hydrophobicity. The
Prpsc molecule is amphipathic (Meyer at al 1986). This means that both
hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-hating) regions exist on
each and every PrPsc molecule. Its amphipathic properties account for both
its binding to cellular membranes and its aggregation into rods (Meyer et al
1986). In view of their hydrophobic moieties, molecules such as prions
cannot exist fee in water. Indeed, through the maximization of hydrophobic
interactions, amphipathic molecules attach with great tenacity to other
molecules to the exclusion of water. It is therefore believed that any BSE
agent in the aquatic environment will be bound to solids and particles. In
whole cattle carcasses and rendered cattle carcasses, those solids and
particles to which PrPbse attaches will be proteinaceous and carbohydrate in
nature. Through decay of those components in the aquatic environment, the
bound proteins will be released and hence dispersed (molecular dispersion)
immediately attaching to other particles. Thus prions will be subject to
progressive dispersion and dilution while remaining bound to particulates at
all times."
The references that they cite in that extract are
Prusiner S B (1991) "Molecular biology of prion diseases", Science,
Vol 252, 1515-1522.
Meyer R K et al, "Separation and properties of cellular and scrapie
proteins", Proc. National Academy of Sciences, USA, Vol 83, 2310-2314.

[A question was raised in the resulting discussion concerning the
calculations:
Re: >>Assuming that the rendering plant processes 2,000 cull cattle carcasses
per week, the risks to drinking water consumers were estimated to be remote.
Indeed, even using worst cases assumptions an individual would have to
consume 2 litres per day of tap water for 45 million years to have a 50%
chance of infection through drinking water drawn from the aquifer".<<
>
>I never believe such simple calculations with unknown factors and one should
not forget that even one prion can eventually infect an individual and that
such nonlethal infections can become lethal if there are amplification
mechanisms like cannibalism in medicine and agriculture.<
The authors did not forget or overlook that. On the contrary, one of the
sections of their review is headed. in bold type "6.3 Low dose extrapolation
suggests that even a single BSE prion molecule has a small but finite
probability of initiating infection".
It is _not_ a "simple calculation". In my two posts related to that paper I
merely quoted from the short summary and picked up the point about
"stickiness". These short extracts were quoted from ten pages of small print
in which they clearly set out their assumptions and the basis for them, and
the working of their calculations, including the those that you ask about.
To comment meaningfully, one really needs first to study the whole paper.

All proteins are of course composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions, the insolubility indicating not much hydrophilic region is exposed.
Hydrophobic regions, not being "happy" surrounded by water, would logically
co-aggregate and precipitate, or attach to other hydrophobic molecules in
the milieu, such as oils or organics.
This is why the removal of organic solvent from rendering might have played
a role in the BSE problem. Traditional methods of protein deactivation
normally depend on leveraging the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. When
water is absent from the structure it is much more difficult to cause heat
or chemical damage.
