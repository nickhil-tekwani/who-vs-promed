Between 10 and 15 Oct 2007, the national reference laboratory at the
Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) detected _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Weltevreden in samples from 4 gastroenteritis
patients. The patients were all living in the southeastern part of
Norway, and had no history of foreign travel during the month prior
to onset of illness. _S._ Weltevreden is a common cause of
gastroenteritis in southeast Asia (1,2), but is a very rare serovar
in Norway. Over the past 30 years, fewer than 10 cases were reported
annually, only 7 of which were domestically acquired.

In response to the detected cases, an outbreak investigation was
initiated on 19 Oct 2007 in order to identify the source of the
outbreak. It involved FHI, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority
(NFSA), and the municipal medical officers. An urgent enquiry was
sent out through the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) on 22 Oct 2007. In response to the enquiry, Denmark
reported a cluster of 18 cases of _S._ Weltevreden that was under
investigation at the time. The onset of illness of the 1st cases had
been in late July 2007. In 3 cases, it was thought likely that the
infection had been acquired abroad. On 26 Oct 2007, Finland reported
a cluster of 7 cases that had occurred between 1 Aug and 1 Oct 2007.

On 23 Oct 2007, a salmonella isolate obtained from a major Danish
alfalfa sprout producer was serotyped as Weltevreden. The Danish
authorities issued an alert through the Rapid Alert System for Food
and Feed (RASFF) on the same day. The isolate was later shown to have
the same multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA)
and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles as the isolates
from the case-patients from Denmark, Norway and Finland. _S._
Weltevreden has also been verified in the sprouts sold in Finland,
but the PFGE result of this strain is pending.

The seeds for growing the alfalfa sprouts had been imported to
Denmark in July and August 2007. The Danish producer had then
exported part of the batch of seeds to a Norwegian alfalfa sprout
producer on 19 Sep 2007. The batch of seeds used in Denmark and
Norway was traded, according to invoices, via retailers in Germany
and the Netherlands to Denmark, and probably originated from Italy
(further information is pending). No clear link has been found as yet
to the seeds used in Finland, except that they came from the same
Dutch supplier. A link may appear when the full traceability accounts
from the Netherlands are provided through the RASFF system. The batch
of alfalfa seeds had been imported to Finland in June 2007. However,
sprouts from this batch were not on the market in Finland before
August 2007. The alfalfa sprouts were recalled and withdrawn in
Denmark on 18 Oct, in Norway on 23 Oct, and in Finland on 28 Oct 2007.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
A case was defined as a person living in Denmark, Finland or Norway,
with a laboratory-confirmed infection with a strain of _S._
Weltevreden that matched the PFGE and/or MLVA profile of the outbreak
strain, and with onset of symptoms of gastroenteritis between July
and October 2007.

Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL] shows the combined
epicurve for the 3 countries of all _S._ Weltevreden cases by week of
taking the sample. By 19 Nov 2007, 19 cases had been reported in
Norway, 19 in Denmark, and 7 in Finland. The patients' ages ranged
from 18 to 83 years (median age 34 years). Thirty-five cases were
female and 10 male. The demographic characteristics of the cases are
comparable in all 3 countries: they are adults and predominantly
female. The dates of symptom onset for the Norwegian cases range from
28 Sep to 15 Oct 2007; 2 cases were not available for interview. The
14 Danish cases that were available for interview fell ill between 23
Jul and 20 Oct 2007. 5 of the Finnish cases were available for
interview; their disease onset was between 11 Aug and 30 Sep 2007.

In Norway, NFSA interviewed the first 6 cases using a standard pilot
questionnaire for foodborne outbreaks, focusing on food items known
to be risk products causing gastroenteritis. 5 cases had eaten
alfalfa sprouts during the incubation period, and 1 had not eaten
this product. As a follow-up, 13 patients identified later were asked
whether or not they had eaten alfalfa sprouts: 7 remembered having
eaten sprouts, 3 were not sure, and 2 were not available for
interview.

Most of the Danish cases were interviewed several weeks or months
after the illness and therefore had difficulties remembering their
food consumption in the relevant time period. Only the 2 cases with
recent illness onset clearly remembered buying and eating alfalfa
sprouts. The Finnish cases were also interviewed several weeks after
onset of illness. 2 of them recalled exposure to alfalfa sprouts
prior to illness. Alfalfa sprouts are typically part of sandwiches
and salad buffets not prepared at home, and it can therefore be
difficult to recall consumption of this product.

Conclusions
-----------
Based on the available information, it was concluded that alfalfa
sprouts grown from contaminated seeds were the source of the outbreak
in all 3 countries. A case-control study will not be conducted, since
the source of the outbreak is well documented by other methods. In
support of this conclusion, molecular typing of isolates from
epidemiologically unrelated cases and of other food sources,
including the 2 different _S._ Weltevreden isolates found in baby
corn related to the recent Shigella sonnei outbreak in Denmark (3),
showed a number of DNA profiles that differed from the outbreak
strain.

Sprouts are a well-known source of salmonella infections and have
been described as the source of a large number of outbreaks (4). The
gender distribution may simply mean more females eat alfalfa sprouts
in salads and sandwiches.

In both Norway and Finland, precautionary chlorination had been used
to decontaminate the imported seeds. No decontamination process had
been used by the Danish producer. The seeds imported to Denmark and
Norway were part of the same batch. The seeds traded to Finland came
from the same supplier in the Netherlands; they were not from the
same batch but probably a related one. More information on
traceability concerning a possible link is pending through RASFF.
Contaminated seeds may therefore have been exported to other
countries and a trace-back investigation is ongoing.

[By the mid-1980s, _S._ Weltevreden had become the most commonly
isolated serotype of salmonellosis in Southeast Asia, being isolated
from cattle, beef, mutton, duck, prawn, dog, monkey, and rat among
sources (1). As an example, a report on the prevalence of
nontyphoidal Salmonella by the Institute of Medical Research of
Malaysia during the period from 1989 to 1994 indicated that _S._
Weltevreden was the most common serotype isolated (31 percent of 6937
strains) of the Salmonella isolates (2).

More recently, a total of 503 isolates of _S._ Weltevreden (3) were
received from laboratories primarily from Southeast Asia (Indonesia
(45), Laos (6), Malaysia (105), Taiwan (7), Thailand (197), Vietnam
(19), Australia (46), Denmark (16), New Zealand (40) and the USA
(22)). The isolates were collected during 1995 and 2001. Most
isolates originated from humans (282), but some were from animals
(59), food products (114) and water, the environment or other sources
(48). Regarding antimicrobial sensitivity, only 48 (9.5 percent) of
the 503 isolates were resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial
agents tested. All isolates were susceptible to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. A low frequency of
resistance was found towards ampicillin (1.8 percent) and
chloramphenicol (1.6 percent). Resistance was observed most
frequently among isolates from Laos and Malaysia, but otherwise the
occurrence of resistance was so low that no major difference between
country or isolate origin could be found.
