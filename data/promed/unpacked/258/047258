Progress on epidemiologic investigation of myocarditis cases in
Chiang Mai
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health,
Thailand is continuing its investigation of cases of myocarditis and
unexplained deaths in Chiang Mai. To date, this investigation has
involved the following organizations, institutions and persons: the
Department of Disease Control and Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of
Public Health, Thailand; the Provincial Public Health Office, Chiang
Mai; Ramathibodi Poisons Centre, Bangkok; WHO Thailand; the WHO
Regional offices of the Americas, Europe, South East Asia, and the
Western Pacific; WHO Headquarters; the United States Centers for
Disease Control; and the International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal
Points of France and New Zealand. In the meantime, staff of the New
Zealand Embassy in Bangkok are periodically consulted and updated.

After the 1st update on 11 Mar 2011, no further new cases of
myocarditis or unexplained deaths have been identified. Therefore, it
remains the case that since the deaths of the husband and wife from
the UK on 19 Feb 2011, no further new cases have been reported despite
the institution of active surveillance (case finding) in all 25
hospitals in the Province of Chiang Mai. Reports of an additional
death in a 59-year old Canadian male who died on 26 Jan 2011 and may
have visited a hotel where other deaths have been reported are being
actively investigated, but at present, the details of this case remain
unverified. The Department of Disease Control is sending an
investigation team to review the details of this case and determine
whether there is any linkage to the cases described in the 1st
update.

The investigation and reporting of these events has been complex and
subject to a number of important constraints. Deaths that occur
outside of a hospital or in unexplained circumstances are the primary
responsibility of the police, resulting in parallel forensic and
public health investigations, but the full integration of all such
efforts is now in progress. Active case finding therefore currently
includes examination of relevant police records and forensic pathology
reports, as well as reports appearing in the media. In addition, all
hotels and guesthouses in the city of Chiang Mai are currently
required to report episodes of severe vomiting in guests.

The different owners of the hotels and guesthouses that have been
associated with deaths are all giving their cooperation to the
investigation including reporting possibly new suspect cases. To date,
no common link has been found between cases with respect to
restaurants, water, food, and travel.

Although many cases appear to have suffered similar illnesses, a
detailed examination of clinical case records shows important
differences that place significant constraints on establishing a
common cause. In addition, one case developed symptoms before arriving
in Chiang Mai and several other cases developed symptoms, and in one
case died, less than 24 hours after arrival in the city. All the cases
of confirmed myocarditis and the other cases (travelling companions)
directly associated with them were identified and clinically
investigated at Chiang Mai Ram Hospital which is an international
standard healthcare facility accredited by the Joint Commission
International Accreditation USA. All the cases of clinically confirmed
myocarditis were diagnosed based on the findings of echocardiography
(cardiac ultrasound) and raised levels of cardiac (heart muscle)
enzymes. However, the clinical details of these cases also show some
significant differences, for example only one had a high fever, and
the histopathology of the heart muscle specimens of the 2 cases on
which autopsies were performed show different findings. The
significance of these findings is currently unclear, but they may
point to different underlying causes.

On 15 Mar 2011, the Department of Disease Control has held a [video]
Conference with WHO Thailand and US CDC, Atlanta about the cases.
Specimens of blood, heart muscle, and urine available from some of the
deceased cases are being shipped for further testing in US CDC. Blood
and stool specimens from the 2 surviving cases in New Zealand
nationals are also being sent to Japan for further testing

Based on available scientific evidence so far and the absence of new
cases in travelers or local population despite vigilant surveillance,
threats to the general public remain low or minimal. The general
public and tourists in Chiang Mai are not recommended to take any
specific precautions, but should continue to observe general
preventive health measures as described in the previous update. Any
persons who may have specific medical or public heath concerns about
this event are invited to report them or make queries using the
following email address: <outbreak@health.moph.go.th>.

We wish to highlight that in the absence to date of any clearly
defined and specific threat to public health, and following specific
requests from grieving family members to show sensitivity and respect
confidentiality, information on some of the cases whose names have
already appeared in media reports is not being made public until a
preliminary investigation has been completed. Furthermore, detailed
personal information of cases will not be made available even after
completion of all enquiries.
