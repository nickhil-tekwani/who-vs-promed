Officials at the Department of Health yesterday
reported the first malaria case among overseas Chinese students in Taiwan.
The officials said the 23-year-old patient -- who is from Burma -- displayed
symptoms of the illness after being in Taiwan for more than 4 months. The
disease was identified as _Plasmodium vivax_, a strain of malaria with an
incubation period of 14 days. The strain had been proclaimed "extinct" in
Taiwan by the World Health Organization in 1967.
The case has baffled doctors because the incubation period of the patient's
illness was much longer than the normal 14 days. The patient is undergoing
treatment at Linkou's Chang Kung Memorial Hospital.

[They shouldn't have been baffled -- _P,vivax_ is notorious for
relapses. I had one 4 weeks after my initial, unrecognised &
untreated infection. Luckily, it is not as serious as _P.falciparum
infection. - Mod.JW]
