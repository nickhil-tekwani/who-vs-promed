A passenger on Northwest Airlines Corp. Flight 51 from Frankfurt to
Detroit on [10 Mar 2009] was found to have tuberculosis [TB], the
airline said today [15 mar 2009]. The Centers for Disease Control
[CDC] in Atlanta is attempting to contact 17 passengers seated near
the infected person, CDC spokeswoman Shelly Diaz said.

"The risk of TB transmission is very low," she said. The CDC is
gathering passenger contact information and passing that along to
state and local health departments to have people tested for the
disease. "Northwest has been proactively working with the CDC to
contact passengers who may be at risk," spokeswoman Leslie Parker
said in a statement today [15 mar 2009]. Passengers who have
questions should contact the CDC or their local health department.

Tuberculosis is caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and is spread
through the air by those with an active form of the disease,
according to the CDC website. About a third of the world's population
is infected with this bacterium, according to the World Health
Organization. Not everyone who is infected becomes sick. The US had
13 299 cases of TB in 2007, a CDC spokeswoman said last week.

[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in the ProMED post
Illness, airplane exposure - multicountry 20081125.3718:

According to the WHO guidelines, "health authorities should promptly
contact potentially exposed passengers and crew and advise them to
seek medical evaluation," and since "airlines usually have a system
in place to reach passengers and inform them of flight changes or
cancellations...airline companies should cooperate with health
authorities in providing all contact information needed by them and
facilitate contact tracing of passengers and/or crew."

Transmission of tuberculosis aboard an airplane depends on the
ability of a patient to generate an infectious aerosol, the adequacy
of airplane ventilation, the duration of air travel, and the
proximity of passengers and crew to the index case.

The WHO guidelines recommend that passengers on flights 8 or more
hours in duration who are seated in the same row and the 2 rows ahead
and behind the index patient, as well as cabin crew members working
in the same cabin section should be contacted for determination if
transmission of tuberculosis has occurred by means of medical
assessment, tuberculin skin testing (TST), or interferon-gamma
release assays, and chest radiography; contact should be maintained
for at least 3 years.

A discussion of aircraft ventilation and the assessment required of
exposed passengers and crew for acquisition of tuberculosis can be
found in this moderator's comments found in ProMED-mail posting
