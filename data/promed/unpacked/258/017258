WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service is working with the U.S. Animal Health Association to
eradicate pseudorabies by the end of 2000.
A new provision of the federal program standards for pseudorabies
eradication requires that all sows in infected breeding herds be tested
prior to or at farrowing. Sows testing positive must be removed for
slaughter or placed in isolation for slaughter within 15 days of weaning.
All boars must be tested quarterly, and those testing positive also must be
sent to slaughter or isolated for slaughter within 15 days after test
results are reported.
"If we're going to eradicate this disease, we need to get serious and speed
up the program," said Joan M. Arnoldi, deputy administrator for veterinary
services with APHIS, a part of USDA's marketing and regulatory programs
mission area.
Effective Jan. 1, program standards developed by APHIS were adopted for the
eradication of pseudorabies virus from all domestic swine in the United
States. These standards were endorsed by state agriculture officials and
swine health practitioners at USAHA's annual meeting in October 1997. The
program standards serve as guidelines that states can incorporate into their
regulations.
Many states are making progress and have significantly reduced the number of
quarantined herds. Twenty-nine states are currently free of pseudorabies.
However, there are still several states that have a lot of work to do.
Almost half of the roughly 1,700 quarantined infected herds in the United
States are in Iowa. Indiana, Minnesota, and North Carolina also report high
numbers.

[As this infection is also found in feral pigs, one might presume that the
USDA/APHIS/VS eradication scheme will include this reservoir at some point?
