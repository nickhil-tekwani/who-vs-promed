The sale of sheep from 2 farms in Tobago is being prohibited for a while, as the animals are being plagued by a contagious disease. A number of sheep may also need to be culled as a result. The farms affected are in Studley Park and Blenheim.

The disease, caseous lymphadenitis abscess or CLA or CL, commonly known as "cheesy gland" or "lympho," is caused by bacteria that can survive within purulent material in shaded areas on wooden fence posts and shearing barns for several months.

The Secretary for Agriculture, Mr Godwin Adams, assured that the outbreak is not as dreaded as it may appear.

"After consultation with the vets, they have indicated to us that they are dealing with the issue at hand and that the sale of animals from those 2 areas will be suspended until further notice."

[Caseous lymphadenitis (CL) of caseous lymphadenitis abscess (CLA) is a chronic, contagious disease caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_. CL occurs worldwide. It is a disease of major concern for small ruminant producers in North America. The disease is characterized by abscess formation in or near major lymph nodes (external form), or in the thorax and abdomen (internal form). The internal form of CL can cause ill thrift and respiratory compromise and is a major rule out for the "thin ewe" syndrome. The disease often becomes endemic on farms because it is difficult to eradicate from infected animals, and subclinical shedders maintain environmental contamination. Economic losses arise from condemnation and trim of infected carcasses, decreased leather and wool yield, culling of infected animals, loss of sales of breeding stock, and deaths from internal involvement.

Although primarily a disease of sheep and goats, CL occurs sporadically in horses, cattle, camelids, swine, water buffalo, wild ruminants, fowl, and hedgehogs. CL occurs occasionally in people, so appropriate precautions should be taken when handling infected animals and purulent exudate from lesions.

CL is a chronic, recurring disease. One to 3 months after inoculation of the bacteria, an encapsulated abscess slowly forms at the point of entry into the skin or in a nearby lymph node. The infection can spread in blood or lymph to internal lymph nodes and to viscera such as the lungs, kidney, liver, uterus, and brain. Less common sites of involvement include the udder, scrotum, and joints. Initial infection is subclinical in some animals but can also be associated with fever, anorexia, and cellulitis at the infection site. Superficial abscesses eventually rupture and discharge infectious purulent material into the environment. The skin wound heals, leaving a scar. Abscesses tend to recur months to years later.

The distribution of abscesses differs somewhat in sheep and goats, possibly as a result of management differences. External abscesses around the head and neck occur more commonly in goats, while the visceral form is more common in sheep. Internal abscesses should be considered as a potential diagnosis for "thin ewe" syndrome, in which an adult small ruminant loses condition despite adequate nutrition. Congregation at shearing time increases transmission, mainly through coughing by sheep with pulmonary infections. Additionally, clipper blades contaminated with purulent material can infect other sheep during shearing.

The incidence of abscesses steadily increases with age; clinical disease is more prevalent in adults, and up to 40 percent of animals in a flock can have superficial abscesses.

The presence of an external abscess on a small ruminant is highly suggestive of CL, especially in an endemic herd, but an aspirate from an intact abscess should be submitted for bacteriologic culture for definitive diagnosis. Other pyogenic organisms such as _Arcanobacterium pyogenes_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pasteurella multocida_, and anaerobes such as _Fusobacterium necrophorum_ can also cause abscessation. Affected animals should be kept isolated pending culture results. Animals with visceral abscesses pose a greater diagnostic challenge. Radiography and ultrasonography can be useful to detect internal lesions. Culture of a transtracheal aspirate obtained from an animal with pneumonia can help determine if CL is the cause.

Once a diagnosis of CL has been established, owner education stressing the persistent, recurrent nature of the disease is necessary. The most practical approach for commercial animals infected with CL is to cull them from the herd. However, animals with draining abscesses should not be sent through sale barns until draining has ceased and the wound has healed. Treatment of individual animals should be undertaken with the understanding that CL is not considered a "curable" disease.

Animals with economic or emotional value are treated mainly for esthetic reasons and to limit their infectivity to the rest of the herd or flock. Whenever possible, an intact abscess should be surgically removed. Alternatively, external abscesses can be lanced and drained, and the abscess cavity lavaged with dilute iodine solution.

The purulent material should be collected into a disposable container and incinerated. The surgeon should wear disposable gloves to avoid inadvertent self-inoculation. The treated animal should be isolated from other small ruminants until the wound is healed.

The efficacy of systemic antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Because most treatments will be extra-label, a client-patient-veterinary relationship is necessary. Although _C. pseudotuberculosis_ is susceptible to penicillin in vitro, treatment is not necessarily effective in vivo because the antibiotic cannot penetrate into the abscesses well.

Commercial CL vaccines are currently licensed for use in sheep. Vaccination of young replacement stock reduces the incidence and prevalence of CL within a flock, but it will not prevent all new infections or cure infected animals. Currently, all contain phospholipase D toxoid, and some also contain killed whole bacterial cells. The vaccine is available as a monovalent bacterin and as a polyvalent preparation combined with _Clostridium tetani_ and _C perfringens_ type D. The initial dose is given subcutaneously in the axillary space after colostral immunity has waned (about 3 months of age) and should be repeated in 4 weeks. Colostral immunity can be improved by administering a booster to pregnant ewes and does 1 month before lambing/kidding. Annual boosters are recommended. Evidence suggests that increasing the frequency of vaccination to every 4-6 moths may be of benefit in flocks in which exposure is high (such as housed in confinement for part of the year). These vaccines should be used with caution in potentially infected sheep, because adverse reactions (such as lameness, lethargy) are sometimes reported.

Extralabel use of the vaccine in goats is associated with poorer efficacy and more adverse reactions (such as decreased milk production, fever, malaise, ataxia, ventral edema, and occasionally death). However, some success using the commercial CL vaccine in goats has been reported. Anecdotal successes have been reported with the use of autogenous CL vaccines in sheep and goats.
