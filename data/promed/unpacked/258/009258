The leptospirosis epidemiological data reported by Dr Berger is appreciated
but unfortunately inaccurate in some important instances. It is essential
this detail is reviewed to avoid incorrect assumptions by clinicians and
other workers in the field on the geographical aspects of the disease in
Australia.
Some of this information appears to have been drawn from our 1997
publication in CDI, Australia which reviewed Leptospirosis in Queensland
from1985 to 1996. The 32% _L. hardjo_ and 23% _L. zanoni_ are actually
serology positives, not isolates as reported.
New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia actually report the lowest number
of notifications for Australia, some of the quoted figures in Dr Berger´s
report are incorrect, e.g. for 1991 the 53 notifications were actually from
Queensland not NSW. Queensland and Victoria provide the highest number of
notifications for Australia.
_L. zanoni_ is becoming the most common serovar reported in Queensland in
recent years.
Our reference laboratory has an ongoing national surveillance program which
sources extensive information on leptospirosis cases and reports this
through hardcopy and homepage as quarterly and annual surveillance reports.
This information is available at the following site address:

[Dr Berger´s GIDEON database is carefully researched and is an encyclopedic
resource. He can give references to all the data therein. We appreciate
this clarification - Mod.JW
