A case of animal plague has been confirmed in eastern New Mexico and
officials say human cases could soon follow.

The New Mexico Department of Health says lab reports confirmed a case
of plague in a dog near San Jon in Quay County this week [week of 12
Apr 2010]. They say the virus is transmitted to humans through the
fleas on rodents, rabbits, and pets.

This is the 3rd case this year [2010] involving animals in New
Mexico. In all cases, the animals have recovered.

[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when
infected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infected fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially in
the case of cats, serve as a direct source of infection.

Although prairie dogs are more sensitive indicators of plague than
cats, these are quite sensitive. Often, plague lesions in cats,
particularly domestic cats, may initially be confused with a cat
fight (or cat bite) abscess, as there are often swellings in the
mandibular region. Plague swellings are buboes, abscesses from
infection. Consequently, veterinarians, technicians, animal shelter
workers and animal caretakers may become victims when buboes rupture.

Plague, caused by _Y. pestis_, is an acute and sometimes fatal
bacterial zoonosis that is transmitted primarily by the fleas of rats
and other rodents. Enzootic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the
western USA and throughout the world, including Eurasia, Africa, and
North and South America. In addition to rodents, other mammalian
species that have been naturally infected with _Y. pestis_ include
lagomorphs, felids, canids, mustelids, and some ungulates. Domestic
cats and dogs have also developed plague from oral mucous membrane
exposure to infected rodent tissues, typically when they are allowed
to roam and hunt in enzootic areas. Birds and other non-mammalian
vertebrates appear to be resistant to plague. On average, 10 human
plague cases are reported each year in the USA; the majority are from
New Mexico, California, Colorado, and Arizona. Most human cases
result from the bite of an infected flea, although direct contact
with infected wild rabbits, rodents, and occasionally other wildlife
and exposure to infected domestic cats are also risk factors.

_Y. pestis_ is a gram-negative, nonmotile, coccobacillus belonging to
the Enterobacteriaceae family. It exhibits a bipolar staining,
"safety pin" appearance when stained with Wright, Giemsa, or Wayson
stains. _Y. pestis_ grows slowly even at optimal temperatures (28 deg
C [82.4 deg F]) and can require greater than 48 hours to produce
colonies. Several types of media can be used to grow _Y. pestis_,
including blood agar, nutrient broth, and un-enriched agar. Colonies
are small (1-2 mm), gray, non-mucoid, and have a characteristic
"hammered copper" appearance. Different virulence factors are
expressed by the organism at different temperatures and environments,
allowing the organism to survive in flea vectors and then be
transmitted to and multiply in mammalian hosts. The organism does not
survive for long at high temperatures or in dry environments.

_Y. pestis_ is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when
released into the air, the bacteria will survive for up to one hour,
although this could vary depending on conditions.

Pneumonic plague is one of several forms of plague. Depending on
circumstances, these forms may occur separately or in combination.
Pneumonic plague occurs when _Y. pestis_ infects the lungs. This type
of plague can spread from person to person through the air.
Transmission can take place if someone breathes in aerosolized
bacteria, which could happen in a bioterrorist attack. Pneumonic
plague is also spread by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in
respiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague.
Becoming infected in this way usually requires direct and close
contact with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also
occur if a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and
the bacteria spread to the lungs.

Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague. This occurs when an
infected flea bites a person or when materials contaminated with _Y.
pestis_ enter through a break in a person's skin. Patients develop
swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache,
chills, and weakness. Bubonic plague does not spread from person to
person.

Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the blood.
It can be a complication of pneumonic or bubonic plague or it can
occur by itself. When it occurs alone, it is caused in the same ways
as bubonic plague; however, buboes do not develop. Patients have
fever, chills, prostration, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into
skin and other organs. Septicemic plague does not spread from person
to person.

With pneumonic plague, the 1st signs of illness are fever, headache,
weakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,
chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The
pneumonia progresses for 2 to 4 days and may cause respiratory
failure and shock. Without early treatment, patients may die.

Early treatment of pneumonic plague is essential. To reduce the
chance of death, antibiotics must be given within 24 hours of 1st
symptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the tetracyclines, and
chloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic plague.

Antibiotic treatment for 7 days will protect people who have had
direct, close contact with infected patients. Wearing a close-fitting
surgical mask also protects against infection. A plague vaccine is
not currently available for use in the United States.
