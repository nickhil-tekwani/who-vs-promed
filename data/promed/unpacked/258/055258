Report on Measures Relating to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in
the United States
--------------------------------------------------
The Secretarys Foreign Animal and Poultry Disease Advisory Committees
Subcommittee on the United States Response to the Detection of a Case of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (hereafter referred to as the
subcommittee), consisted of Prof. U. Kihm (Switzerland), Prof. W. Hueston
(USA), Dr. D. Matthews (UK), Prof. S. C. MacDiarmid (New Zealand), and Dr.
D. Heim (Switzerland). The subcommittee also considered the scope of policy
options and measures being considered to address the newly recognized BSE
situation that exists in the USA and within the broader North American context.
Scope, thoroughness, and appropriateness of the design and delivery of the
epidemiological investigation.
--------------------------------------------
The subcommittee reviewed data relating to the investigation of the index
case of BSE in the USA. This included data from Canada as well as from
investigations conducted in Washington state and elsewhere. The
subcommittee concluded that:
Investigation
- The epidemiological investigation into the origin of the BSE case
conforms to international standards, insofar as it could be conducted in
the face of the limitations of cattle identification systems in place in
North America.
- The active investigation of BSE creates some communications challenges.
The hold orders placed on the index herd (and other herds where imports
were located) conveyed the impression that BSE is contagious. BSE is not a
contagious disease and is not spread by direct contact among animals. The
reasons for actions taken must be clearly explained so as not to create
misimpressions or appear to validate actions that are not supported by the
scientific knowledge of the disease.
- The limitations of the cattle identification system necessitated a more
extensive tracing exercise than would otherwise have been necessary in
order to identify cattle to be culled in accordance with international
standards, thus enabling the identification of some animals only by process
of elimination.
- Culling strategies are inevitably complex, especially because of the
difficulty in identifying a "feed cohort," namely animals exposed to the
same batch of contaminated feed. This is common to the majority of BSE
cases identified worldwide. Therefore, the identification of a "birth
cohort" in accordance with OIE guidelines is appropriate, within the
limitations imposed by cattle identification and tracing records.
- The approach adopted by the USA in targeting the offspring of the index
case born within the 2 years prior to clinical onset is in agreement with
OIE recommendations. The extrapolation of that requirement to include the
slaughter of 448 other calves that were reared alongside the bull calf born
to the index case in November 2003 cannot be justified on animal or public
health grounds, but the decision to do so on practical and economic grounds
is recognised.
- With regard to the timing of the culling of offspring of the index case
and of cohort animals, it should be recognised that current OIE
recommendations do not require the immediate culling of such animals,
provided they are excluded from food and feed chains (i.e. destroyed) at
the end of their lives.
- When any decision is taken to cull animals, whether offspring or birth
cohort animals, in excess of what is recommended by OIE, the reasons behind
the decisions should be made clear in all public statements.
Tracing of products derived from the index case and cattle slaughtered on
the same day and on the same premises as the index case.
- The majority of BSE-related risk material from the index case (e.g.
brain, spinal cord, and other tissues normally categorised as Specified
Risk Materials or SRM) was rendered rather than entering the human food
chain. This, in conjunction with the fact that beef meat is considered
safe, calls into question the justification for the recall of beef sold for
human consumption. Nevertheless, the response was in accordance with a WHO
recommendation that tissues from cattle known to be affected with BSE
should not enter the human food chain.
Termination of epidemiological investigations
- The investigations continue to be highly resource-intensive. Although
attempts should be made to identify the "birth cohort," with approximately
50 percent identified so far, it may not be possible to confirm the death
or location of each and every animal. This is a problem faced by all
countries which do not have an effective animal traceability system.
- The subcommittee believes that the number of cattle actually infected on
the farm of origin in Canada was probably small. Indeed the index case
identified in the USA may be the only infected animal from the Canadian
herd of origin that survived to adulthood. However, it is probable that
other infected animals have been imported from Canada and possibly also
from Europe. These animals have not been detected, and therefore infective
material has likely been rendered, fed to cattle, and amplified within the
cattle population, so that cattle in the USA have also been indigenously
infected. Therefore, animals that have not been identified from the birth
cohort of the index case do not represent significant additional risk for
further propagation of BSE within the USA. Risk materials from these
unidentified infected animals must be considered when developing policies
for the prevention of human infection and infection of cattle through feed.
- Under the circumstances, the subcommittee believes that the
epidemiological investigation should cease, and resources be redirected
into the planning, implementation, and enforcement of an extended,
targeted, surveillance programme and other measures to protect human and
animal health.
Response actions
----------------
Having examined the information provided on trade in live cattle and
livestock feed ingredients within the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), the subcommittee firmly believes that the 1st case of BSE in the
United States can not be considered in isolation from the whole cattle
production system in North America. The significance of this BSE case
cannot be dismissed by considering it "an imported case". The 1st BSE case
detected in the USA, and the 1st "indigenous case" reported in Canada in
2003, must be recognised as both being BSE cases indigenous to North
America. For this reason, close collaboration between all appropriate
agencies in NAFTA is essential for the proper management of North America's
BSE problem.
Policy actions being considered by the USA must achieve the following
objectives:
- reduce public health risk for consumer protection
- limit recycling and amplification of the agent
- establish the level of effectiveness of measures through surveillance
- prevent any inadvertent introduction of BSE from abroad in the future
- contribute to the prevention of the spread of the epidemic worldwide
The objectives cannot be successfully achieved by government alone;
effective implementation of measures requires a shared commitment and
action on the part of national and state governments, producers, consumers,
private industry, and veterinary professionals. Extensive national
coordination and cooperation is imperative, and should be extended to
include the continent of North America. We suggest that a BSE task force,
which includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, be
established under the leadership of the USDA in order to assure that
policies are developed and implemented in a consistent, scientifically
valid manner.
Specified Risk Materials (SRM)
- SRM are those tissues that are considered to represent the greatest BSE
exposure risk to humans and animals because they contain infectivity at
some point during the disease incubation period. Infectivity has been
consistently shown to be present in the central nervous tissue of naturally
and experimentally infected cattle. In experimentally infected cattle,
ganglia associated with the CNS (trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia) have
also been assayed and shown to be infectious. Distal ileum was also
infectious at several time points during the incubation
phase. Experimental results for tonsil and bone marrow remain to be fully
interpreted.
- Removal of all tissues with demonstrated potential for accumulation of
BSE agent and strict attention to preventing cross-contamination of the
carcass through stunning, slaughter, and processing practices are the
internationally recognized standards for protection of public health and
animal health.
- The proposed US ban on SRM removes the highest-risk tissues (i.e. SRM
from cattle over 30 months) from the human food supply and is in accordance
with OIE standards when the number of cases which have been reported so far
are considered. However, given the epidemiological evidence indicating that
BSE agent was already circulating in ruminant feed prior to the feed ban in
1997, and the integration of the North American cattle and feed industries,
strong consideration should be given to excluding all SRM from both the
human food and animal feed supplies. This recommendation also follows the
current trend in international recommendations to stop amplification and
limit exposure.
- Unless aggressive surveillance proves the BSE risk in the USA to be
minimal according to OIE standards, the subcommittee recommends that the
SRM identified below be excluded from both the human food and animal feed
chains.
- Brain and spinal cord of all cattle over 12 months of age
- Skull and vertebral column of cattle over 12 months of age -­ these are
not inherently infected, but cannot be separated from dorsal
root/trigeminal ganglia or from residual contamination with CNS tissue
- Intestine -­ from pylorus to anus -­ from all cattle.
- In the mean time, until the level of BSE risk has been established, the
subcommittee concedes that exclusion of CNS, skull, and vertebral column
from cattle over 30 months, and intestines from cattle of all ages, for use
in human food is a reasonable temporary compromise.
- The current guidelines for the definition of some of these cut-off points
are derived from scientific evidence from ovine and experimental murine
scrapie. The detection of infectivity in the CNS of infected animals at
approximately mid-incubation was extrapolated to 30 months for cattle, as
this is half-way through the mean incubation period of 60 months for
BSE-affected cattle in the UK. In other words, CNS was assumed to be
infectious in infected cattle aged 30 months or older. Nevertheless, a
cut-off of 12 months represents a recognition of the fact that some cattle
under 30 months of age may be slaughtered with infectivity present in the
tissues described above.
- Limited scientific data suggest that, in experimental and naturally
infected cattle, infectivity enters the CNS at a later time point in the
incubation period than the mid-point. This is an issue that must still be
addressed experimentally to evaluate not only the appropriate age for
definition of SRM, but also the time at which the various diagnostic tests
are effective in detecting such animals. It is very much hoped that the US
government will contribute resources to support international
investigations into these questions.
- While the removal of SRM will significantly reduce risk, it must be
recognised that contamination of the carcass with SRM (specifically CNS)
also should be avoided. The subcommittee recommends that slaughter and
carcass-dressing procedures, including currently used stunning procedures
and mechanical deboning processes, which increase the risk of contaminating
meat and meat products with CNS tissue (including associated ganglia) be
brought into line with international standards. Specifically, processing of
skulls and vertebral columns of cattle over 30 months by mechanically
recovered meat (MRM) and advanced meat recovery (AMR) systems should be
banned. The complete separation of these tissues may be very difficult to
implement, therefore the banning of all mechanical tissue-processing
methods should be considered.
Non-ambulatory (downer) cows
- The subcommittee considered both the merits and the unintended
consequences of the ban prohibiting non-ambulatory cattle (downers) from
entering the food supply. It is true that non-ambulatory cattle are more
likely to be BSE-infected than are healthy slaughter cattle and therefore
may pose a greater risk to public and animal health. The goals for measures
related to these cattle must be to (1) test them for surveillance purposes
and (2) prevent potentially infective tissues from entering the food and
feed chains. Given their exclusion from supervised slaughter at inspected
slaughterhouses, this important subpopulation may no longer be available
for the BSE surveillance program at these locations. Therefore it is
imperative that the USDA take additional steps to assure that facilitated
pathways exist for dead and non-ambulatory cattle to allow for collection
of samples and proper disposal of carcasses. This most likely would involve
expending resources to assist with costs associated with sampling,
transport, and disposal.
- In order to decrease the risk of these potentially infected cattle
entering the normal slaughter process, supplemental measures to encourage
compliance must be in place. These may range from financial incentives to a
strengthening of ante-mortem inspections to identify questionable animals.
To further prevent these cattle from being brought into the normal
slaughter process, consideration may have to be given to the random
sampling of appropriate subpopulations of aged cattle that have passed
ante-mortem inspection on presentation at slaughter plant.
- Veterinary authorities must consider all possibilities, including
education of the farmers of their role as producers of safe food, in order
to achieve maximal surveillance of this risk population.
Surveillance
- The goals of surveillance are to estimate the prevalence of BSE in the
cattle population and monitor the success of the prevention and control
measures. Now that it has been established that the BSE agent is
circulating in North America, the surveillance programme in the USA must be
significantly extended in order to measure the magnitude of the problem.
- The subcommittee recommends that future surveillance programmes be
targeted to the population with highest risk of exposure to the BSE
agent. At some point in the past, targeting based on the location of
cattle imported from Europe and other BSE risk countries, their points of
slaughter and rendering and subsequent consumption in cattle feed was
theoretically possible. However, with the passage of time since the
importations and the amplification of the agent within North America , this
approach is no longer appropriate.
- The populations with the highest risk for BSE have been shown to be those
exhibiting signs compatible with BSE (passive surveillance), fallen stock
(cattle that die on the farm or during transport), and cattle for emergency
slaughter older than 30 months, which includes all categories of downer
cows. Surveillance systems targeting these subpopulations have been shown
to be the most efficient at identifying BSE cases.
- The subcommittee recommends testing of all cattle older than 30 months in
the above risk populations and strengthening of the passive surveillance
system. This will not only establish the prevalence of BSE but also build
confidence both domestically and for trading partners. This could be
achieved by means of a one-year programme, the outcome of which would then
assist in designing future ongoing testing programmes.
- The subcommittee recommends that estimation of the age of cattle (to
determine whether or not they are over 30 months of age) can most
satisfactorily and cost-effectively be done by examination of dentition.
Examination of dentition is a well-established and widely accepted means of
aging cattle and is completely adequate for the purpose of determining
those cattle to be tested in the BSE surveillance programme.
- The subcommittee considers testing of all cattle slaughtered for human
consumption to be unjustified in terms of protecting human and animal
health. However, to support the overall surveillance system and encourage
reporting at the farm level, testing of a random sample of healthy
slaughter cattle over 30 months should be strongly considered.
Laboratory diagnosis
- The comparison of findings from surveillance programmes conducted by
different countries will be facilitated if similar or equivalent tools,
including diagnostic tests, are adopted. The subcommittee recommends the
adoption of rapid immunodiagnostic assays as the primary screening tests
for active surveillance. Those tests currently approved for use in Europe
have already been shown to be fully effective if used in accordance with
manufacturers' instructions.
- Decentralisation of testing facilities to appropriately trained staff in
laboratories that can guarantee testing with a minimum of delay will be
required for the surveillance programme recommended. The delay between
receipt of samples and testing will need to be shorter if derived from
animals slaughtered for human consumption than if derived from risk
animals. Nevertheless, speed of confirmation maximises the ability to trace
birth cohort and other risk animals, as well as any by-products that may
need to be recalled. It is therefore recommended that a number of
laboratories throughout the country be governmentally approved to conduct
screening tests as part of the national surveillance program. The BSE
reference laboratory should remain within the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory, and should be responsible for confirmatory and proficiency testing.
- The subcommittee strongly urges the US to collaborate with the global
community in the evaluation and validation of new BSE diagnostic tests
Feed restrictions
- All SRM must be excluded from all animal feed, including pet food.
- Considering the BSE situation in North America, the subcommittee believes
the partial (ruminant-to-ruminant) feed ban that is currently in place is
insufficient to prevent exposure of cattle to the BSE agent. The current
ban reflects the situation in Europe early in the outbreak where, with the
benefit of hindsight, it can be concluded that propagation of BSE
infectivity continued, albeit to a lesser extent than would have occurred
in the absence of any controls. Epidemiological investigations in the UK in
particular highlighted the dangers to cattle of infection through the
consumption of feed that had been contaminated accidentally when
manufactured in premises that legitimately used mammalian meat and bone
meal in feed for monogastric species (pigs and poultry).
- Data from ongoing studies at the UK Veterinary Laboratories Agency show
that cattle could be orally infected with as little as 10 mg of infectious
brain tissue. The prevention of cross-contamination at this level is
virtually impossible to deliver where mammalian MBM intended for inclusion
in pig/poultry feed or pet food is present in feed plants that produce
ruminant feed. Although the subcommittee endorses the need for rigorous
audit of compliance with feed controls, it should be appreciated that
testing of feed and feed ingredients is unlikely to detect contamination of
this low level because of the limitations of sampling techniques and test
sensitivity.
- While science would support the feed bans limited to the prohibition of
ruminant-derived MBM in ruminant feed, practical difficulties of
enforcement demand more pragmatic and effective solutions. The prohibition
of the use of all MBM (including avian) in ruminant feed is justified
partly due to the issues of cross-contamination as well as the current
problems in differentiating mammalian and avian MBM. It also prevents the
inclusion of ruminant-derived protein contained within the lumen of porcine
or avian intestines at slaughter in animal feed that may be used for ruminants.
- Fishmeal can still safely be used in ruminant feed, provided that the
possibility for cross-contamination and deliberate adulteration are
excluded through compliance audits with testing.
- Cross-contamination must be prevented throughout the feed chain, from
reception and transportation of feed ingredients, during the manufacturing
process, through transportation and storage of finished feed, and on farm
where mixing, blending, and feeding will occur.
- Recognising the absence of an established infrastructure for the
separation and disposal of SRM or MBM, the subcommittee accepted that a
staged approach may be necessary for implementation.
- Exclusion and destruction of such a high volume of raw material is a
massive burden on all countries currently affected by BSE. Given the
susceptibility of cattle to low-dose exposure, and the fact that no
processing system exists at present to guarantee destruction of infectivity
in commercial processes, it is probable that restoration of traditional
uses in feed may be impossible. More radical and innovative solutions are
required to enable the safe use of such materials in future. This should
include adding value through their use for purposes other than the
manufacture of feed and fertilisers (e.g. as a fuel source).
- The subcommittee recommends that the current feed ban be extended to
exclude all mammalian and poultry protein from all ruminant feeds, and that
this ban -- as well as measures to prevent cross-contamination -- be
strongly enforced. This recommendation must be enforced through an
inspection program including sampling and testing of feed. If at some
point it becomes possible through other means (e.g. inspection, testing,
and enforcement) to achieve the equivalent result of assuring that no
ruminant proteins are ingested by ruminants, then exclusion of all
mammalian protein from feed for ruminants may not be required.
Education
- It is not possible to achieve compliance with legislative controls
without an effective educational programme. This is particularly important
in an environment when mixed messages potentially confuse those who are
required to enforce legislation, and may undermine compliance. In other
words, statements that "beef is safe" should not undermine efforts to
eliminate or reduce risk, because in reality "beef is safe because of the
risk reduction measures."
- Furthermore the justifications for government action must be made clear,
whether for practical, economic, or risk-reduction purposes in order to
avoid unnecessary public anxiety and avoid reinforcing misconceptions about
the disease.
- The dissemination of information on the variety of clinical signs of BSE
is crucial, especially considering the subtle nature of many of the signs
that are not normally portrayed in TV coverage. This will ensure that the
effectiveness of the surveillance programme is improved by ensuring the
capture of all appropriate risk animals for testing.
- BSE educational programs must be designed to meet the needs of multiple
audiences with variable levels of scientific training. Countries around
the world have routinely underestimated the need for a wide variety of
educational materials and training techniques to meet both technical and
non-technical audiences. The subcommittee recommends that extensive
education and training materials be developed in collaboration with
academic, professional, trade, and consumer organizations so that
scientifically sound and accurate information about the nature of BSE and
the importance of aggressive prevention and control strategies can be
disseminated widely and incorporated into the curricula of schools,
colleges, universities, and professional continuing education programs. As
traceability, transparency, and access to current information increases, so
does consumer confidence and effectiveness of the control and prevention
measures.
Lessons learned
- The North American cases demonstrate again that exporting countries feel
significant national social and financial impacts when importing countries
fail to comply with international rules regarding trade.
- Therefore, the subcommittee recommends that the US should demonstrate
leadership in trade matters by adopting import/export policy in accordance
with international standards, and thus encourage the discontinuation of
irrational trade barriers when countries identify their 1st case of BSE.
- In addition, the subcommittee hopes that the US will continue to act
responsibly when considering export of potentially contaminated materials
such as live cattle, MBM, and feed. Risk materials must be destroyed or
safely utilized to protect human health, animal health, and the
environment in the USA and worldwide.
