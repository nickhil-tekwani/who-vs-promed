[2] South Korea: outbreak over

South Korea on [Tue 16 Oct 2018] officially declared an end to the country's 1st Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 3 years, health authorities here said.

The announcement made at midnight is in line with guidelines set by the World Health Organization that require no new infections for a minimum of 28 days, which is twice the length of the virus' incubation period, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.

On [8 Sep 2018], a single person was diagnosed with MERS after returning home from a 3-week business trip to Kuwait via the United Arab Emirates. It was the 1st confirmed case of the disease in the country since 2015.

On [21 Sep 2018], the KCDC lowered its alert level to its lowest readiness posture, as 21 people who came into close contact with the patient all tested negative for the disease.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease with a fatality rate of 20-46 percent. It is caused by a novel coronavirus carried by camels and can be spread when someone is in close contact with a patient for a sustained period.

The 1st MERS case was recorded in Saudi Arabia, and it has since spread to other countries. As of June this year [2018], the World Health Organization has reported 2229 laboratory-confirmed cases.

South Korea was hit by an outbreak in 2015, resulting in 38 deaths and 186 people testing positive for MERS.

[Clearly, much has changed in healthcare seeking and delivery practices in South Korea since the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015. With early suspicion (and, therefore, testing) combined with early implementation of infection control procedures, a repeat occurrence of nosocomial transmission was avoided, and the definition of outbreak in this situation was limited to a single case. - Mod.MPP
