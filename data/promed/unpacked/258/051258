[2] Indonesia - 62nd death

Avian influenza killed a woman in Indonesia, the 62nd death from the virus
in the country with the highest human fatality rate, a Health Ministry
official said on Sat 20 Jan 2007. The 19 year old woman from West Java died
on Fri 19 Jan 2007, Dr Muhammad Nadirin at the Ministry's bird flu centre,
told Reuters. "She had been ill since 11 Jan 2007, had a high temperature
and cough and then entered Garut hospital on 17 Jan 2007," he said. "Six
days before she became ill she had contact with a sick chicken that,
according to the agriculture department's rapid test, was also positive for
bird flu."
Most human bird flu cases have resulted from contact with infected fowl.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country and one that stretches
across 17 000 islands in an archipelago as wide as the continental United
States, faces an uphill task in fighting the virus.
Millions of backyard fowl live in close proximity to humans and health
education campaigns have often been patchy and rules difficult to enforce.
This week a campaign began to rid the Indonesian capital of such fowl but
it got a mixed reaction from residents. Some welcomed the culling amid
health concerns but others worried about losing a key source of income.
Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but it has infected nearly
260 people worldwide since late 2003, killing more than 150, according to
the World Health Organisation, and sparking fears of a pandemic. Since
2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in about 50 countries and territories.
