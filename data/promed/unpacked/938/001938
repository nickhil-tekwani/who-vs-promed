Subject: [BSE-L] nvCJD onset and death data

The Lord Lucas asked Her Majesty's Government:
Whether they will place in the Library of the House, or on the Internet,
full details of each of the persons who have died in the United Kingdom of
new-variant CJD, showing (a) the date of death; (b) the age at death; (c)
the age at onset of symptoms; (d) identified exposure to possible sources
of infection; and (e) the genetic makeup of the prion gene. (HL1549)
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath):
To protect patient confidentiality, precise details cannot be supplied but
the following information may be helpful:

*Cases not confirmed neuropathologically and therefore classed as "probable
vCJD"
Table 2; vCJD cases in the UK, by age at death

50 - 59 4
59+ 0
Total 52
Forty nine of the fifty two 'definite' cases to date have been
methionine/methionine homozygous at codon 129 for the prion protein,
results on one of the remaining cases are still awaited, and in the
remaining 2 cases no blood was taken on which to conduct the appropriate
genetic tests.
To date the National CJD Surveillance Unit has no record of a case of
variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease having arisen as a consequence of medical
or surgical intervention.
