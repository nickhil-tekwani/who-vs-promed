The [autonomous community] of Madrid has detected, since 19 Oct 2022, 16 cases of minors with invasive disease due to streptococcus [group] A [also called Group A streptococcus (GAS) and _Streptococcus pyogenes_], including 2 patients who died, and at this time, after the alert issued by the United Kingdom, is studying whether the frequency of these infections is higher than usual.

In a statement released this Wednesday [7 Dec 2022], the Madrid Ministry of Health explains that the other 14 diagnosed cases, all of them aged between 1 and 12 years, are hospitalized with the corresponding antibiotic treatment and are responding favorably.

_Streptococcus_ [group] A is a common bacterium that usually does not cause complications. It usually produces a wide variety of infections as common as pharyngitis or mild irritations that are treated with antibiotics, although it can lead to more serious ones such as pneumonia or scarlet fever. The General Directorate of Public Health of Madrid is reviewing the series of cases from the years prior to the coronavirus pandemic to determine whether there is a change in the pattern of severity.

The Ministry of Health, through its General Directorate of Public Health, has assured that "it is in contact with the autonomous communities and cities to gather information on the possible cases detected in recent weeks and to be able to carry out an analysis of the situation." Therefore, the health systems are "in a situation of active surveillance."

[The autonomous community of Madrid (pop., about 6.7 million residents in 2019), located in the center of the Iberian peninsula, is one of the 17 autonomous communities of Spain; the city of Madrid is its capital and the capital of the country. A map showing the location of Madrid can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Community+of+Madrid,+Madrid,+Spain.

For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) commonly cause pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis) and superficial skin infections, but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids documenting a common source of an outbreak.

ProMED has posted several reports of outbreaks of invasive GAS infection (iGAS) in the past in the UK and in Canada among homeless people and people who inject drugs, due to particular emm types (see the See Also section below). There is a current outbreak in the UK of iGAS (see ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918; Streptococcus, group A - UK (03): scarlet fever, iGAS, fatal, RFI 20221209.8707158; and Streptococcus, group A - UK (02): (England) children, fatal, RFI 20221206.8707105). Molecular emm typing would be important to document relatedness of the outbreaks in Spain and the UK.

In the UK, in 2016, 84% of all emm1 strains isolated upper respiratory GAS isolates had a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The iGAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous versions of emm type 1 isolates.

More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
