A Missouri mother has urged parents to monitor their children for hand, foot, and mouth disease, amid fears the debilitating condition -- which usually affects children -- could spread to adults.

Chewanna Prak told NBC 12 a child in her daughter's school class in St. Louis fell ill with the condition, but parents weren't alerted, and the youth wasn't taken out of class.

"If you're sick, keep your kids at home. No one else wants to go through that; I especially don't as a parent," said Prak.

The enterovirus family of viruses is the culprit behind hand, foot and mouth disease. Mostly it affects children, but the virus can spread to adults, too.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common condition among young children.

When a person is infected with the virus, their symptoms will change as it develops.

A fever, loss of appetite, a sore throat and a general sense of malaise will strike 1st. About a day later, painful red sores will form in the mouth, while flat, red spots will appear on the hands, soles of the feet, elbows, knees, genitalia and buttocks.

Just last week, New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard found himself on the disabled list after coming down with hand, foot and mouth disease [see following report].

Unfortunately for sufferers, there is currently no cure for the condition, and it must simply be left to run its course. This can take up to 10 days. Painkillers can be taken to ease the discomfort and lower the fever, while mouthwash can be used to numb the mouth.

"It's a miserable virus," Dr. Melissa Aquilo of Patient First told NBC 12.

The majority of individuals with hand, foot and mouth disease recover without complications. But in some cases, aseptic meningitis and encephalitis can develop. In such instances, urgent medical help must be sought, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread when contagious nose and throat fluids, feces or liquid from the blisters touch the eyes, mouth or nose. The virus is also transferred through close contact, including changing a baby's diapers and hugging. Inhaling an infected person's sneeze or cough is another mode of transmission. That makes it particularly easy for the virus to spread among children, said Dr. Aquilo.

"They share their toys. Their toys have their germs on. They don't wash their hands as well as most adults should. If they put a toy in their mouth and set the toy down and another child plays with it, we'll see a little outbreak in daycares in that kind of situation," she said.

It's, therefore, important to wash hands and practice good hygiene at all times, as some carriers don't experience symptoms but can still pass the condition on.

[The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact, through the air from coughing, and the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease.

HFMD is caused commonly by enteroviruses including coxsackieviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other viruses in this group. The disease is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD can also be caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71), as it is with these cases in Missouri. This virus has been associated with serious complications and may be fatal (excerpted from http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_10072012_HFMD/en/).

If the many losses, continual injuries, head-scratching mistakes and personnel changes were not enough to completely demoralize the Mets [US baseball team] this season, try this latest development: Noah Syndergaard, 2 starts into his return from a finger injury, is headed back to the disabled list with hand, foot and mouth disease.

Even in the middle of this eventful season, the Mets could not believe it.

"Are you serious?" Mets Manager Mickey Callaway recalled thinking when he received the news. "I guess it's very uncommon in adults, period. It's kind of odd. Maybe it's the 1st D.L. [disabled list] stint in baseball with hand, foot and mouth. I don't know."

John Ricco, the Mets assistant general manager who is part of the triumvirate leading the team during General Manager Sandy Alderson's medical leave, announced Syndergaard's ailment before Sun 22 Jul 2018 night's game against the Yankees in the Bronx was rained out.

Ricco said he had a final announcement to make: Syndergaard had received a diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease and was expected to miss a start. The team thought Syndergaard, 25, had been exposed to the virus on Thu 19 Jul 2018, when he was helping run a children's baseball camp in New Jersey. The illness commonly affects children younger than 5 and can be spread through contact.

And then Ricco revealed Syndergaard's puzzling ailment. The Mets believe the infection was behind Syndergaard's diminished velocity during his latest start on Friday [20 Jul 2018]. Callaway pulled Syndergaard after 84 pitches because he was showing signs of fatigue.

"We knew he was having trouble breathing," Callaway said. "I put my hands on his legs to talk to him when he came out, and I said, 'Hey man, is everything O.K.?' And I felt his legs shaking, so he was just weak and run-down, and I think the virus just took its toll."

Splotches and blisters associated with the disease were also starting to show up on Syndergaard's hands. He was sent to the doctor and told to stay away from the team to avoid infecting others. Callaway said the team has been keeping an eye on those who had touched Syndergaard on Fri 20 Jul 2018 to make sure that they do not show any symptoms.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease can cause illness in adults as well as children; adults generally contract the disease from children.

Bad luck for the Mets pitcher who was generously helping run a children's baseball camp in New Jersey. - Mod.LK
