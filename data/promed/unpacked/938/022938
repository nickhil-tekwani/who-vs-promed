Researchers from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) and the National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru have detected the 1st evidence of rabies virus in Indian bats.

The team of researchers, led by D Pilot Dovih, a PhD student with Ecology and Evolution Department at NCBS, and Reeta S Mani, Associate Professor, Department of Neurovirology, NIMHANS, isolated rabies neutralising antibodies in samples of fruit bats and insect bats from 6 villages in Nagaland. The samples were tested at NIMHANS, which is a WHO Collaborating Centre for reference and research on rabies.

While dog bites are the primary cause for death because of rabies in south Asia, incidents of contracting rabies from a bat bite have been reported in Western countries for decades, say the researchers.

"We have isolated antibodies in the blood, indicating that the bat may have been infected with the virus at some point in its life cycle. We could not isolate any virus or virus nucleic acid, which would confirm whether the bat had the virus at the time of death," said Dr Mani.

She added that there has been no systematic surveillance for detecting rabies, or any other pathogenic virus, in bats in India. The team carried out awareness programmes in the 6 villages to educate residents about the pathogens spread by bats, including Ebola and Nipah viruses.

Villages in Nagaland were chosen for obtaining samples due to the traditional culture of bat harvesting in some parts of the state. Mr Dovih said that lack of good hospitals and testing facilities in these villages meant that even when deaths were recorded, the cause of illness was seldom discovered.

"There was a disease outbreak in the late 1970s in a bat harvesting village, but there is no official documentation regarding the cause of the outbreak. Many residents migrated elsewhere during this outbreak," said Mr Dovih. Even today, residents from the villages surveyed report that at least 2 or 3 people in their late 20s to 30s die every year of unknown reasons.

However, Dr Mani said it was too soon to sound an alarm bell. "One study should not affect the government's focus as 99 percent of rabies cases is caused by dogs. We have a major problem with controlling rabies. We still carry 1/3 of the world rabies burden. That should be the priority," she stressed, while pointing out that it is not as common for bats to come in contact with human beings.

[The dog has been, and still is, the main reservoir of rabies in India. Bats are the natural reservoirs of most lyssaviruses, including rabies virus. Bat lyssaviruses, reported in Australia, Europe, and Asia, are closely related but not identical to rabies virus. According to this report, the survey found rabies virus.

This is not the 1st report of infection by rabies virus in bats in India. In 1980 there was a report of a flying fox bat (_Pteropus poliocephalus_) infected with a virus belonging to the rhabdovirus group in Chandigarh.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure. - Mod.PMB
