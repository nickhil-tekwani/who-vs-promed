Wild pigs may have spread deadly bacteria onto a spinach field in
California, which sparked an outbreak that killed 3 people and
sickened more than 200 others nationwide, investigators said Thu, 26 Oct 2006.
State and federal investigators have narrowed their focus to the
ranch where boar trampled fences that had protected a spinach field.
Samples taken from a wild pig, as well as from stream water and
cattle on the ranch, have tested positive for the same strain of _E.
coli_ implicated in the outbreak, said Dr. Kevin Reilly of the
California Department of Health Services.
"We are not saying this is the source at this point," Reilly said of
the ranch. Reilly told reporters the outbreak appears to be over. It
sickened 204 people in 26 states and one Canadian province, he said.
Wild pigs are one "real clear vehicle" that could explain how _E.
coli_ spread from cattle on the ranch to the spinach field less than
a mile away. The pigs could have tracked the bacteria into the field
or spread it through their droppings, Reilly said. Investigators
also are looking at runoff, flooding, irrigation water, fertilizer
and other wildlife, including deer, as possible sources.
Investigators first recovered the same strain of bacteria this month
from 3 cattle manure specimens collected on the ranch. On Thu, 26 Oct
2006, Reilly said the strain has been isolated from 6 other samples
collected on the ranch, including from cattle and calves. The finds
mark the 1st time that investigators have identified a possible
source for any of the multiple _E. coli_ outbreaks linked to the
heavily agricultural area.
Investigators have taken roughly 750 samples from the 4 ranches. They
have found _E. coli_ on all 4 ranches -- the bacterium commonly is
found in cattle -- but turned up the particular strain involved in
the outbreak on only one.

[Cattle are the animal most frequently identified as a source of _E.
coli_ O157:H7, although other livestock may also carry the bacterium.
In a recent report, _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from livestock at
31 of 32 fairs, including 11.4 percent of 1407 cattle, 1.2 percent of
1102 swine, 3.6 percent of 364 sheep and goats, and 5.2 percent of
154 fly pools. Cattle, swine, and flies at some fairs shared
indistinguishable O157:H7 isolate subtypes (Keen JE, Wittum TE, Dunn
JR, et al: Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli O157 in agricultural
fair livestock, United States. Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12: 780-86). - Mod.LL]
