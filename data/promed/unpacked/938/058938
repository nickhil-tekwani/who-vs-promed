Victoria agricultural officials are responding to a confirmed incident of anthrax in sheep on a single property near Swan Hill. Victorian Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Cameron Bell said quarantine notices had been put in place until the necessary biosecurity requirements, including carcass disposal and site disinfection, were completed. He said the case was on a farm which has had a history of anthrax and at-risk stock on the property are vaccinated.

"Anthrax detections in livestock occur in Victoria from time to time. They commonly occur during the warmer months when it is drier and cattle and sheep forage deeper into the soil when grazing. Quarantine controls will not affect the movement of local people or vehicles, including school bus routes."

Local farmers, veterinarians, and Agriculture Victoria are well prepared to handle these incidents. This isolated case was detected as part of ongoing surveillance for anthrax and other livestock diseases. "We are taking the necessary steps to reduce the chance of more livestock being affected," Dr Bell said.

Anthrax is a bacterial pathogen in livestock and wild animals. Some of the more common herbivores are cattle, sheep, goats, horses, camels, and deer. Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected. Strict enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses from livestock suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

[There has been a series of sheep anthrax outbreaks in Swan Hill, Victoria, starting in March 2017; see 6 Mar 2017 Anthrax - Australia: (VI) ovine, human exp 20170306.4882640 and further links below. Extensive livestock vaccination has been done, both in 2017 and 2018. While Sterne vaccination should provide adequate protection it is only temporary and wears off after 6-9 months. Plus animals get missed and newly purchased stock may not be vaccinated on entry as promptly as they ought. It can get frustrating but eventually cases cease to occur. One just has to remember to keep vaccinating regularly until it is clear that some 6-8 years have passed without any new cases.

And at all times keep one eye open for any unexpected deaths, and promptly check them if and when they occur.
