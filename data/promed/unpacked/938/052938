Virus threatens tomato crop
---------------------------
A virus affecting tomatoes grown in Western Fresno County could eventually impact the cost of processed products. Farmers say shriveled up tomato plants have been infected with the curly top virus. From a distance a tomato field looked nice and green but up close you can see some plants are dying.

[A farmer who] has been growing tomatoes for 30 years said, "This is the definitely the worst I've ever seen since I've been out here. Normally we'll have a little bit or have one field affected somewhat but never like this." He finds more damage every time he checks on the 2000 acres [809 ha] he manages. He said some farmers suffered complete losses and had to re-plant fields. "We've got fields from 3 percent all the way to 23 percent so I think it's all over the board."

The curly top virus is carried by the beet leafhopper. He believes some of the leafhoppers came down from the nearby foothills, where they had been feeding on tumbleweeds and wild mustard. "They tend to stay up there longer, as long as it stays green, but this year [2013] with little rain they came early," he said.

The processing tomatoes won't be harvested until August [2013]. If the infection rate grows, a smaller crop could result.

[Curly top disease of tomato is caused by _Beet Curly Top Virus_ (BCTV; genus _Curtovirus_). The virus has a wide host range and also affects other crops, including beans, capsicum, spinach, sugar beet, cucurbit vegetables, as well as a range of ornamental and weed species. Symptoms may include distortion (curling) and yellowing of leaves, necrosis of phloem tissue, as well as stunting of roots and plants. The disease reduces plant vigour and yield can be severely affected, or plants may die all together.

BCTV is spread by the beet leafhopper (_Circulifer tenellus_) and can also be transmitted by grafting. The virus overwinters in the vector insects which remain infective for live. The leafhoppers migrate in spring and spread the virus. Weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as vector and pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult but may include control of vector insects and reservoir plants by pesticide/herbicide sprays or cultural methods. No genetic resistance has been found in tomato so far and all commercial cultivars are susceptible.
