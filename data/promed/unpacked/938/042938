Date of previous occurrence: 14 Jan 2018
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Mitoyo-City, Kagawa
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Nov 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 330 000 / 2000 / 2000 / 328 000 / 0
Affected population: poultry (broilers)

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.61 / 0.61 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 4 Nov 2020, the local veterinary service in Kagawa Prefecture received a notification from a domestic broilers farm on an increase in the number of dead birds. The samples were sent to the laboratory of the local veterinary service (Seibu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre; LHSC) and the samples collected from dead birds were positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On 5 Nov 2020, the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 6 Nov 2020, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8 and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. Stamping-out policy applied to the affected farm. Destruction of all the susceptible birds in the affected farm is being implemented. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] and 3-10 km [1.9-6.2 mi] of the affected farm respectively.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; quarantine; stamping out; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Seibu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (local laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 Nov 2020 / Positive
Seibu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (local laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 5 Nov 2020 / Positive
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Birds / gene sequencing / 6 Nov 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to a media report published on 8 Nov 2020, another outbreak was confirmed at a poultry farm in the city of Higashikagawa in Kagawa Prefecture. This same source describes that during the month of October, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was found in wild duck droppings in the city of Monbetsu, Hokkaido. Avian influenza H5N8 subtype was isolated on 24 Oct 2020 by Hokkaido University. (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/08/national/bird-flu-shikoku-kagawa/).

"Wild birds, as natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds, however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.

"The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

"Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure, and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans".
