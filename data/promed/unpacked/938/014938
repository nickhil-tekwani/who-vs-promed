ProMED has heard from reliable sources that the this outbreak, with 59
confirmed or suspect cases and 5 deaths between February & April 2005, was
caused by St Louis encephalitis virus.

[We asked Charlie Calisher, an expert on flaviviruses and a moderator
emeritus of ProMED, to comment. He wrote:]

Whereas serologic surveys in the 1960s indicated a high prevalence of
infection of humans and domestic animals in Argentina with St. Louis
encephalitis virus (SLEV), only small numbers of human illnesses and
seroconversions without illness due to this virus have been reported to
date in Argentina. Prevalence of neutralizing antibody to SLEV in sentinel
horses in Argentina has been in the range of 40-90 percent, so the
possibility exists [see refs. below].

This cluster -- perhaps outbreak -- of cases may be simply an odd
finding. The obvious question was whether these are misdiagnosed West Nile
virus infections. However, we have learned that West Nile virus infections
have clearly been ruled out and that this very interesting outbreak is one
of SLEV.

We await details regarding the diagnostic tests employed, virus isolations
from case-patients (difficult from tissues, rare from blood) and
mosquitoes, the epidemiologic details, attack rates, etc. Given the
expertise of those who attended the meeting convened by the Ministry of
Health, these studies are in good hands. Further details would be
appreciated, as always.

[The earlier report on an outbreak of flavivirus infections and deaths in
Cordoba, Argentina, was confirmed as caused by SLEV, instead of West Nile
virus, according to a reliable source. Further information regarding what
other animals and birds were affected and the rate of infection among
mosquitoes in the affected areas will be helpful in terms of outbreak
control and prevention measures. - Mod.RY]
