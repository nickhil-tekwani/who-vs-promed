Australia: infections rise in flu outbreak in Canberra
------------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Canberra suspect that another person has been
infected in an influenza outbreak which has swept through a nursing
home and already killed 6 elderly residents. The [lethal] strain has
infected 57 people, including at least 7 nursing home staff. Tests
were still being conducted yesterday [19 Nov 2006] to determine
whether the latest respiratory illness was part of the same strain
[outbreak], a spokeswoman for ACT (Australian Capital Territory)
health minister Katy Gallagher said.
The latest victim was a 90 year old man who passed away at the
Jindalee Nursing Home in Canberra's south on Thursday [16 Nov 2006]
night. Staff had notified authorities on 1 Nov 2006 that an unknown
illness had swept through the residence.
Health authorities have offered staff and residents of the home
anti-viral medication, including the drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir), and
have sought assistance from the Commonwealth. ACT acting chief health
officer Charles Guest reassured residents, staff, and their families
that the outbreak was not connected to pandemic influenza or the
deadly H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu, following analysis of
the virus.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) yesterday [19 Nov 2006]
warned that Australia's pandemic management plan lacked consistency.
AMA president Mukesh Haikerwal said state governments had neglected
to share their pandemic plans with doctors, and there was a lack of
coordination across states and territories on the role of fever
clinics and how to direct patients to the most appropriate care.
"General practitioners are keen to properly prepare for a flu
pandemic but they're currently trying to do so in a vacuum of
information on how jurisdictions propose to mobilize, integrate,
finance and protect primary care," Dr Haikerwal said. Australia has
spent AUD 600 million [USD 462 million] since 2003 preparing for a
possible influenza outbreak.

Australia: another suspected influenza case in Canberra nursing home
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities are investigating another suspected case of
influenza that has already claimed 6 lives at the Jindalee nursing
home in Canberra. Acting chief health officer Charles Guest says 57
people have so far been infected with the flu and another suspected
case was uncovered at the weekend.
Dr Guest says staff and residents have been given anti-viral
medications. "We are investigating very actively at Jindalee and
other aged care facilities around Canberra at the moment to check
this influenza outbreak," he said.

[The outbreak of respiratory illness at the Jindalee nursing home in
Canberra has now been attributed to an unspecified strain of human
(seasonal) influenza virus. Although this is an unusual time of year
for an epidemic of influenza in the southern hemisphere, nursing
homes caring for elderly and immunologically deficient patients are
particularly vulnerable to any respiratory virus infection at any
time of the year. Further information would be appreciated regarding
the serotype of the virus or viruses responsible for this outbreak. -
