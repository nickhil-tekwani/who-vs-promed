From: "Charles H. Calisher" <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

We have had inquiries requesting further information on the vaccine being
used to combat dengue and yellow fever in Colombia [see: Dengue - Colombia
(03). The report said, in part, "The Health Ministry began a vaccination
campaign to combat the high incidence of dengue and yellow fever,
consequences of heavy rainfall in the area." Given that there is no
available dengue vaccine, the vaccine alluded to must be the yellow fever
vaccine.
Sorry, I thought that was obvious.
