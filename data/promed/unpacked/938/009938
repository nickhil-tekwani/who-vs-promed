Equine anemia outbreak Johnson County ranch
-------------------------------------------
A total of 38 horses have been put down at a ranch in Johnson County
due to an outbreak of equine anemia. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
reports in Friday's [26 Aug 2011] edition that 2 other horses at the
property had died from the illness.

State Veterinarian Pat Badley says there is no indication the outbreak
has spread beyond the ranch.

In June [2011], 5 horses in Van Buren County had the illness, and 1
horse was found with the malady in St. Francis County in February.

Badley says this year's outbreak of 46 cases is the highest since
2002, when 51 horses contracted the disease.

The virus has a variety of clinical signs, including fever,
hemorrhaging on the mucous membranes, swelling and collection of fluid
in the lungs.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a contagious, viral disease
affecting all members of the equine species, including horses, ponies,
donkeys, and mules. Once animals become infected they are life-long
carriers of the virus.

There are 3 clinical forms of EIA: acute, chronic, and inapparent. The
majority of the clinical signs of the disease are related to the
reaction of the animal's immune system to the viral infection.
Clinical signs of the acute form include high fever, depression, loss
of appetite, small areas of hemorrhaging on the mucous membranes,
stocking up (swelling of the legs), and edema (collection of fluid)
along the ventral abdomen. Clinical signs of the acute form of the
virus usually appear 7 to 30 days after exposure to (or infection of)
the virus.

Clinical signs of the chronic form of EIA include reoccurring
intermittent fever, depression, lack or loss of appetite, weight loss,
anemia, weakness, and incoordination of the hind legs. The severity
and frequency of the reoccurring episodes decrease over time. Animals
that are infected without showing detectable clinical signs are
"inapparent carriers" of EIA.

Mares that are infected with EIA typically fail to conceive, or to
abort if they are pregnant.

EIA is found in the blood of all infected animals even if they are
inapparent carriers. Typically equines with the acute form of the
disease are more infectious than others carrying the virus because of
the high levels of virus circulating in the blood. The primary method
of transmission is through blood sucking insects, including horse
flies, deer flies, mosquitoes, and gnats. Less common modes of
transmission are virally contaminated instruments such as needles,
syringes, and dental and teeth floating equipment. Transmission may
also occur between infected pregnant mares and unborn foals. About 10
percent of foals born to infected mares are infected with the virus.
The virus may also be transmitted through natural service or breeding.


There are several preventative management measures equine owners can
take to decrease the risk of their animals contacting the disease. One
important measure is the establishment of an effective fly control
program. Blood sucking insects are the primary transmitters of EIA, so
decreasing the presence of these pests, can decrease the risk of
equine animals getting the disease. Effective fly control programs can
utilize foggers, fly repellants, and electronic or automatic fly
control systems in barns. Perhaps the easiest and most cost effective
method of fly control is the removal and spreading of manure and
generally keeping barns and other areas clean.

Another preventative measure is sterilizing and disinfecting all
animal health equipment. Use syringes and needles on only one animal.
Follow the rule of thumb, "One horse, one syringe, one needle." Be
sure surgical, dental, and tattooing equipment is sterilized and
disinfected after each use.

Require all equines entering the premises to have a negative EIA test
within the past 12 months and test all horses annually for EIA.

It is imperative to remember that infected animals are lifelong
carriers of EIA. Currently there are no effective treatments for the
disease. Likewise, there are no vaccines available in North America
for prevention or protection of EIA.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has thoughtfully
provided educational material to owners, to state authorities, and to
all of us. There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service page at
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf.
