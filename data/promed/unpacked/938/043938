A Briton who is in a coma after being bitten by a mosquito is thought to
have become the 1st European victim of the deadly eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) virus. The man, 35, began to feel tired after he
returned from a fishing holiday in Rhode Island, in the north east United
States, with [mosquito] bites around his ankles.
When the man, a painter from Livingston, West Lothian, went to see his
general practitioner (GP), he suffered a seizure and then lost
consciousness. If he lives, he is expected to be severely disabled for the
rest of his life.
His family are cautioning other holiday makers to be aware of the rare
virus in the US. About a 3rd of all those who contract the virus
[infection] die. His sister said: "There is no cure for this, so the only
thing that can be done is prevention. I'm sure that most people are like me
in thinking that if you are bitten by a mosquito in the US, it's the same
as somewhere like Spain, irritating but not life threatening." She added:
"He was just an ordinary guy who enjoyed spending time with his family."
The EEE virus is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases
on the North American continent. It is found mainly in the eastern regions
of the US, but transmission to human beings is rare.
The man had traveled to the US in July [2007]. He spent 6 weeks with family
and friends in Rhode Island and stayed in a log cabin on the Saco River in
northern New Hampshire. He fell ill on 31 Aug [2007], a day after flying home.
Within 2 days, he had lost consciousness and was transferred to the
intensive care unit of Western General Hospital, in Edinburgh. The rare
condition was diagnosed on 13 Sep [2007]. According to his sister, doctors
said that it was the 1st case of EEE to be discovered in Europe.
The man is being cared for at the hospital's neurological unit, where he
remains unconscious and unresponsive. "He has opened his eyes, but is not
aware of anything," his sister said. "Our family has been devastated by
this. We have been told that he is likely to be severely disabled at best.
It seems that there is nothing we can do apart from warn people. The more
people know about this virus, the better."
US health records show that there were 220 confirmed cases of EEE between
1964 and 2004, an average of 5 per year. According to reports there has
been one death this year [2007] in the US, a 6 year old boy in Alabama.
The man's local member of parliament said that he would be writing to David
Miliband, the foreign secretary, to urge him to publish an official warning
about the dangers of the virus. "This is a very tragic case, and I would
like people who travel to this part of America to be warned about this," he
said.
EEE was recognized in Massachusetts in 1831, when 75 horses died of
encephalitic illness. The 1st human cases emerged in 1938, when 30 children
died in north eastern USA. The virus is maintained through a bird-mosquito
cycle that increases throughout the summer, as more birds and mosquitoes
become infected. The 1st winter frosts end the annual cycle. Transmission
to humans is rare; it generally takes from 3 to 10 days to develop
symptoms. Many infected people have no apparent illness; for those who do
become ill, symptoms range from mild flu-like illness to inflammation of
the brain, coma and death. There is no specific treatment. Since 1964,
there have been an average of 5 cases a year; up to 35 per cent of victims
die. A vaccine is available to protect horses but not human beings. The US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people use
repellents to avoid mosquito bites.

[A warning to all UK tourists who visit the USA about the dangers of EEE
virus infection seems an over-reaction. Caution to avoid mosquito bites is
prudent, however. The risk of being infected by West Nile virus, for
example, is considerably greater than the risk of infection by EEE virus.
As the USA dollar falls in value relative to other major currencies, an
increase in tourism from abroad can be expected. Some of these tourists
will be outdoor enthusiasts, as in the case of this unfortunate man, and
will be in areas where the risk of exposure to infectious agents, such as
arthropod-borne viruses, is real. It is wise for tourists to acquire travel
health information before traveling to other countries, and take measures
to reduce the risk of infection.
