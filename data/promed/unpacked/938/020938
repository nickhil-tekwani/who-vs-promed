The history of EVA occurrence, surveillance and control in New Zealand was
reviewed in 1998 (1). At the time of the review there was only one
Standardbred stallion known to be a semen shedder registered for service in
New Zealand. No clinical signs of disease have ever been attributed to the
presence of the virus here, although the unpredictability of disease
outbreaks must be acknowledged. Probably as a result of the lack of disease
in this country, industry attitudes vary on the significance of the virus
and the benefits of control. This creates a major challenge for control of
EVA.
In summary, the New Zealand EVA Control Scheme requires:
1. All stallions to be tested for EVA prior to registration, and a register
to be kept of this testing;
2. Controls on premises where shedder stallions are resident, such that:
- any seronegative stallion on the same premises must be vaccinated
against EVA;
- all mares bred to shedder stallions (either naturally or artificially)
to be retained on the premises, in isolation from other horses not bred to
shedder stallions, for a minimum of 21 days after service.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) agrees there were
unfortunate aspects to the events surrounding the newly identified shedder
stallion. Specifically, it is true that a positive blood test result in
December 1997 was not followed up with semen testing, as would normally be
required, until October 1998.
Investigations have also highlighted that the stallion was, in all
likelihood, infected when standing at stud with the only other registered
shedder without prior vaccination. Since semen testing revealed the
stallion was an EVA shedder, MAF has worked with New Zealand Equine Health
Association (NZEHA) to review what actions are necessary. MAF has tested 22
stallions which had contact with the newly identified shedder stallion,
either directly or indirectly via contact with inseminated mares. Of these,
6 returned positive blood tests, so their semen will be tested.
NZEHA have stated their wish to continue with control and eventual
eradication of EVA. From the results of blood testing, it would appear that
New Zealand will be left with a manageable number of EVA shedder stallions,
although the actual number must be confirmed by semen testing prior to the
onset of the breeding season.
If EVA is to be eradicated, control over shedder stallions will continue to
be necessary and industry will need to agree what form that control will
take. Changing industry practices, such as transport of semen within the
Standardbred industry, must be considered in relation to the existing
control strategies. MAF and NZEHA are working together on these issues.
Regardless of the domestic control policy for EVA, MAF will continue to
meet all trading partners zoosanitary requirements for EVA during export of
horses from New Zealand.
