Increased Risk of Hantavirus Infection in Chongqing Province
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese authorities in Chongqing province have indicated that there is a
significantly increased risk of hantavirus infection [i.e. increased risk of
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or HFRS this year in this area.
Hantaviruses are transmitted by mice and may causes fever, bleeding, and
kidney and liver damage [HFSR.
Changshou county, just outside of Chongqing, is one of the areas of highest
risk in China for hantavirus infection, and each year a few cases of
[hantavirus-related disease are reported. Historical records demonstrate
that there is an epidemic of hantavirus infection [i.e. HFRS every 10 years
in this region. The last epidemic was in 1990. The incidence that year was
350 cases per 100 000, and the mortality rate was between 30-50%.
Two new cases have been reported in the last few weeks. The Chinese
authorities are now recommending that all persons living in these environs
receive hantavirus vaccine which has a 98% protection rate. The Chinese
authorities started vaccinating the local population in October. The local
vaccine is given in 3 doses, at 0 days, 14 and 35 days.
International SOS is recommending that all travelers or workers in this
area should receive vaccination. There is a Korean vaccine (HANTAVAX) which
is also available and has been evaluated by the international medical
establishment. This vaccine is given at 0 days and 30 days, and has shown
100 percent protection when 2 doses are given. There are no significant side
effects of the vaccine.
For more information, call International SOS, Medical Department, China, at
Beijing - 8610-6462-9100 ; Hong Kong - 00-852-2528-9900; or Shanghai -

[Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses classified in the genus _Hantavirus_
of the family _Bunyaviridae_. They are transmitted to man from a variety of
rodents [differing according to virus by inhalation of infected urine,
saliva, faeces, etc. Infection in rodent hosts is inapparent and persistent
for life. Person-to-person spread of infection is rare or non-existent.
There are 2 main presentations of hantavirus infection. Haemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) results from infection by any of a number
of hantaviruses which occur in the Northern Hemisphere in a broad sweep from
the Far East to Western and Northern Europe. HFRS presents with greatest
severity in the Far East. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a recently
described sporadic infection characterized by a high mortality, which is
associated with certain hantaviruses (such as Sin Nombre virus) in the
Americas.
HFRS is a major public health problem in China. The predominant hantaviruses
responsible for HFRS appear to be Hantaan virus and Seoul virus, but recent
phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Chinese isolates represent lineages
distinct from those present in other parts of Eastern Asia. For a recent
evaluation of the Korean Hantavax inactivated vaccine, see Vaccine 1999 Jun
4; 17920-21):2569-2575. - Mod.CP
