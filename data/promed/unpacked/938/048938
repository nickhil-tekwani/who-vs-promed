[Ref: RO Adegbola et al: First Report of _Banana bunchy top virus_ in Banana and Plantain (_Musa_ spp.) in Nigeria. Plant Disease (2013) 97, 290; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-08-12-0745-PDN]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plantain and banana (_Musa_ spp.) are among the most important staple crops for food and income generation for the rural and urban populations in the humid forest agroecological zone of West Africa. Until recently, _Cucumber mosaic virus_ and _Banana streak virus_ were the only viruses reported to occur in _Musa_ spp. in West Africa. In 2011, an outbreak of banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) caused by _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_, family _Nanoviridae_) was reported in Benin [ProMED-mail post 20120425.1112745] in regions bordering Ogun State of Nigeria. BBTV is well established in Central Africa and also in Angola, Malawi, and Zambia in Southern Africa [see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below].

Investigations were conducted during May 2012 at 31 locations in Ogun State. Typical symptoms of BBTD were observed in 4 locations. Samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplicons of expected size were obtained from 17 [out] of 90 samples (19 percent). BBTV in the symptomatic plants was further confirmed by nucleic acid spot hybridization (NASH) using DIG-labeled probe. The probe specifically reacted with the symptomatic plants, but not with negative controls, providing conclusive evidence for BBTV.

The sequences from 3 banana plants infected with BBTV were 100 percent identical with each other. [They showed] 100 percent nucleotide sequence identity with a BBTV isolate from Benin, and 99 to 100 percent identity with several other BBTV isolates from Africa, Australia, India, and the South Pacific. Further analysis grouped the BBTV isolate with the South Pacific isolates.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BBTV in Nigeria. This underscores need for surveys to assess the extent of BBTV spread in Nigeria and strict implementation of phytosanitary measures, including restrictions on the movement of planting material from disease-affected regions, to prevent further spread of this important disease.

[2] Malawi: update

[A] former Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security allowed the banana disease bunchy top to spread in the country. This has been revealed by 2 senior officials from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Banana bunchy top [was] first noted in Malawi in Nkhotakota in 1994 but confirmed in 1997. Today the disease has affected all the banana growing districts of Nkhatabay, Karonga, Nkhotakota, Mulanje, and Thyolo.

Bvumbwe Agriculture Research Station's [BARS] Misheck Soko said, "As of now, 60 percent of bananas in Malawi is gone and the remaining 40 percent is infected." He said farmers should uproot all bananas in the country and start afresh with clean planting materials. He said BARS has clean materials but farmers are not uprooting the infected plants.

According to New Partnership for Africa's Development and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, banana production began to drop in Malawi in 1994 because of the disease.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus _Babuvirus_ and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia, and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

BBTV disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting is usually impossible. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates from different regions: the South Pacific group (from, for example, Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga, and Western Samoa) and the Asian group (from the Philippines, Taiwan, and Viet Nam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 percent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.

The BBTV outbreak in 2011 in Benin was the 1st report of the virus from West Africa (ProMED-mail post 20120425.1112745).
