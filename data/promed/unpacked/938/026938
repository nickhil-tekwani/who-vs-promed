The 1st case of DHF in Salvador was confirmed, and at least 7 people
have been admitted to hospital as having contracted this most serious
form of the [dengue] disease. According to the Couto Maia hospital,
there are 3 children and 4 adults. In Itabuna, a 4-year-old child
died, a victim of DHF.

Since the beginning of the year [2009], 6 people suspected of having
dengue died. Up to the present, 2 cases were confirmed.

The municipality has declared an emergency due to the epidemic of the
disease. Technical personnel of the Ministry of Health and of the
state government are in the city. They are analyzing the situation
and are planning strategies to combat the focal areas of mosquito
[breeding] and to attend to patients who are victims of dengue.

The city's hospitals are full of patients with symptoms of dengue.
According to doctors, the dengue cases that occurred in Jequie have
the more aggressive type of the disease.

The city asked the Public Ministry to authorize access for health
workers to the 1200 buildings that are closed in the city. If the
authorization is granted, the officers may break into the properties
with the support of the Military Police. The judge of the 11th civil
and commercial court said that he is not authorized to give such
approval. This process is in the Public Finance court.

Just in January this year [2009], 4242 [dengue] cases were reported
in the state of Bahia. This number reflects an increase of 116
percent over the same period of last year [2008].

The numbers of suspected dengue cases continue to increase. In just
15 days of February [2009], 12 children were admitted to the Joao de
Barros Barreto University Hospital, presenting with symptoms of the
disease. According to Vivian Cartagenes, Coordinator of the
epidemiological surveillance nucleus of Barros Barreto, despite the
number [of dengue cases] considered as being high, they continue to
be less than in January of this year [2009], when 20 suspected cases
were registered. Of these [current cases], 6 were confirmed, with 4
classified as dengue with complications, and 2 were DHF. According to
the Coordinator, 5 children continue to be attended to in the
hospital. "The other children were released but continue to await
results of laboratory tests."

The Coordinator stated that the number of suspected cases in Belem
must be higher than announced. "Many public and private hospitals do
not report cases. Where are the numbers from the other hospitals? All
the health professionals must report dengue cases. When they do not
do this, it is difficult to maintain control [of the disease].
Everyone needs to be aware that dengue kills," stated Vivian.
According to her, this year, there have been no recorded deaths due
to the disease. The Coordinator explained that in most cases, dengue
has had a benign course.

Mato Grosso had 9 cases of hemorrhagic dengue confirmed since the
beginning of rainy season, which began in November 2008. The
municipalities of Cuiaba, Varzea Grande and Rosario Oeste had 2 cases
each. Already, Tangara of Serra was highest in notifications, with 3
occurrences [cases] and one death, which is undergoing investigation
for confirmation of the cause [of death]. The technical person of the
dengue program in the State Secretariat for Health, Rita Cristina
Martins, explained that hemorrhage is a complication of the disease;
in its classic form, it can kill in up to 24 hours.

In the municipality of Sierra de Tanger (239 km [149 miles]
north-central from the Capital), all affected [dengue patients] are
children. The technical person of Epidemiological Surveillance of the
municipality, Juliana Marques da Silva, announced that the patients
were 3, 4, 7 and one year of age. She talks about the events that
took the organization by surprise, and, in the neighborhoods where
people live, chemicals were used to kill the vector [mosquito].

Martins stated that there is still a high number of under reported
[cases]. The people tend to self-medicate and not seek medical care.
This fact affects the formation of an efficient fight against the
disease. She explained that application of chemicals or barriers are
done only when there is an outbreak in the area. Otherwise, it is
best to visit health workers. The number of cases may increase in
coming days due to rain.

The government of President Evo Morales decided to redouble its
efforts to combat dengue in the face of the report of more than 22
000 suspected cases.

"We see that the number of dengue cases will increase, and we wish to
guarantee that there are no deaths from DHF; that is why we are
redoubling our efforts to combat dengue," said the Minister of
Health, Ramiro Tapia, in statements made on the national radio Patria
Nueva.

"Now we are awaiting the arrival of a significant donation from the
government of Venezuela which will be finalized tomorrow [23 Feb
2009], which includes more than 20 tons of materials for fumigation
and the arrival of 10 experts. This is one of the more important
donations," said the Minister.

The Bolivian government declared a health emergency and laid out a
large fumigation plan with the help of soldiers, universities and
personnel from the Church in order to control propagation of the
disease.

According to the latest epidemiological report of the Ministry of
Health, 15 people have died of DHF, and 2118 confirmed cases of
classical dengue have been recorded. There are more than 22 000
suspected [dengue] cases, 70 percent of which have been recorded in
the department [state or province equivalent] of Santa Cruz.

Tapia also announced the arrival of a group of Mexican experts in the
next few days.

"We are grateful for international collaboration with Mexico,
Venezuela as well as Cuba. One of the best Cuban experts is now
incorporated in the Bolivian team for fighting dengue," explained the
Minister.

[Bolivia's eastern lowland departments of Santa Cruz, Beni,
Cochabamba and Pando continue to suffer a significant dengue
outbreak. Dengue virus types 1 and 3 were reported circulating in
Bolivia by the Pan American Health Organization release of 17 Feb
2009 (sent in by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp)
(<http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=706&Itemid=1>).
Help with the dengue campaign is also being provided by Paraguay
(reported in MSN Latino in Spanish, posted in ProMED-PORT,
<http://salud.latino.msn.com/noticias/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100233192>
with 4000 liters of insecticide and 1000 liters of larvacide. The 20

<http://www.fmbolivia.com.bo/noticia8748-japon-y-espana-ayudaran-para-enfrentar-epidemia-del-dengue.html>
reported that Japan and Spain were also providing assistance. One
hopes that with the help the Bolivian Ministry of Health is
receiving, the outbreak can be slowed or halted soon.

The dengue fever epidemic in far north Queensland has spread to the
small Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Queensland Health yesterday
[20 Feb 2009] reported 2 cases of the mosquito-borne disease at
Yarrabah, south of Cairns.

Cairns has 416 dengue cases; Townsville has 66, and Port Douglas has 2.

In northern Queensland, 3 types of dengue virus have been detected so
far, increasing the chances residents could develop a potentially
fatal re-infection.

Deaths from dengue fever occur when someone who has recovered from
one infection is re-infected by a different type of the disease.

For the 5th week [of 2009] ending 7 Feb 2009, 3 more people have died
from dengue fever, bringing the total deaths so far to 18 compared to
only 7 for the corresponding period last year [2008].

Health Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai said 1232 cases were reported
compared to 1013 cases the previous week, an increase of 219 cases of
which 50 percent were from Selangor.

"Eight states had recorded increases led by Kelantan (162 percent),
Johor (40 percent), Selangor (33 percent), Perak (18 percent), Sabah
(13 percent), Melaka (10 percent), Pahang (8 percent) and Sarawak (2
percent)," he said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur today [16 Feb 2009].

Some 13 new "hot dengue areas" had been identified bringing the total
to 39. Selangor had the largest number with 33, followed by Wilayah
Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur-Putrajaya with 4, while Johor and Sarawak
had one each.

Liow said checks by local authorities found that 1672 premises were
breeding grounds for _Aedes_ mosquitoes and that 74 percent comprised
houses and shophouses.

He urged State Health Departments to step up prevention and control
efforts aimed at reducing the number of "hot" dengue areas.

"This is in line with the ministry's efforts to reduce the number of
dengue cases by 10 percent annually," he added.

In Kuching, Environment and Public Health Minister Datuk Seri Wong
Soon Koh said no major dengue outbreak had been reported in Sarawak
despite new cases recorded recently. "The dengue situation is still
under control. There is denial of such a thing, and he said the
Health Department report from 10-15 Feb [2009] stated there were 8
cases and that none were from Carpenter Street.

He said most of the patients were given out-patient treatment and
some had been discharged.

Health authorities in New Caledonia say dengue fever is spreading at
an alarming rate, with over 1000 cases reported in the French Pacific
territory since the New Year [2009].

In the 1st 6 weeks of this year [2009], 1027 dengue cases have been
reported, a figure close to the total number of cases recorded last
year.

Health officials say they are particularly concerned that 546 of the
2009 caseload were reported in the past 2 weeks.

New Caledonia's director of sanitary and social affairs, Jean Paul
Grangeon, says the situation is worrying. "There is a serious
outbreak of dengue in New Caledonia. We've got nearly 60 new cases a
day now," he said.

Most of the infections involve [dengue virus] type 4, which was last
recorded in New Caledonia 30 years ago and against which most people
have no immunity.

The outbreak has also spread to neighboring Pacific countries
including Fiji, Samoa, Palau, Kiribati, Vanuatu, American Samoa and
the Cook Islands.

Health authorities say that as the weather gets cooler and milder,
the breeding rate of mosquitoes should slow, making it easier to
bring the epidemic under control.
