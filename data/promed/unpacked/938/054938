The Ministry of Health in Chubut province confirmed 3 more deaths from [a] hantavirus [infection] on [9 Jan 2019], meaning the current death toll from the outbreak has reached 9 people.

Those who lost their lives were 2 women and a 16-year-old, reported La Naci√≥n, all of whom were being treated in Esquel hospital [Chubut]. One of the women was the daughter and sister of 2 people who have already died from the outbreak which started in the small town of Epuyen, near the Chilean border. Although likely, it is unsure as yet whether one of the fatalities was due to [a] hantavirus and tests are still being carried out to confirm this.

The primary states of hantavirus [infection] are very similar to that of flu, so it is not always immediately obvious whether an individual is in a life-threatening situation.

In order to mitigate the spread of the disease, the Chubut province government have cancelled all popular festivals in the region and confirmed that the illness has now gone further than just Epuyen.

[The cases of hantavirus infection in Epuyen continue to increase with deaths going from 5 on 1 Jan 2019 to 9 in the report above 8 days later. As noted earlier, Epuyen is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved, although not stated, is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season there, when cases of hantavirus infection occur.

Health officials in a previous report hypothesize that the outbreak is due to human-to-human transmission, which would be unusual. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. Transmission of the virus person to a person at a party would seem unlikely.

The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or its excretions. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region. A public information in the area would be helpful in order to reduce possible exposure to the virus and places where the rodent hosts are present. A study of these rodents in the area where these human cases occurred would determine if prevalence of the virus is high.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg and an additional map of the area can be found at https://www.ezilon.com/maps/south-america/argentina-maps.html. - Mod.TY
