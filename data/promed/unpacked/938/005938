-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In reference to [this posting] regarding CHIK virus outbreak in Italy, I
want to define precisely that chikungunya virus has been isolated on 12nd
[sic] Sep [2007] from _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes collected in the
affected areas by the Central Unit of Istituto Zooprofilattico della
Lombardia Emilia e Romagna located in Brescia by Dr Paolo Cordioli
(veterinary virologist). The sequence of whole viral genome region
codifying for E1 and E2 glycoprotein will be ready in the next days. [It is
not clear if these isolates were made on 2 or on 12 Sep 2007, as Dr
Cottori's message was distorted electronically on transmission to
ProMED-mail. - Mod.TY]

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Dottori for the additional information on the
chikungunya virus isolates from _Aedes albopictus_. It is hoped that there
is a centralized chikungunya virus repository so that genetic analyses of
isolates from this Italian outbreak can be compared with the Indian Ocean
area massive outbreak.
