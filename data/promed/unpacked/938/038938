LEISHMANIASIS
The Republic of Panama, located in Central America constitutes the link
between South and North America. Among Tropical Diseases present in the
country, Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a zoonosis of the tropical rain forest is
considered a remarkable health problem. Visceral leishmaniasis has not been
reported in the country, though it has been so, from several other
countries in America including Costa Rica and Colombia located on the west
and east respectively, of the Republic of Panama.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in America is due to _Leishmania chagasi_ (=
_infantum_) and transmitted by _Lutzomyia longipalpis_. Marsupials are good
reservoirs of the parasite, but the principal reservoir are canids such as
_Lycalopex vetulus_; however, domestic dogs in peridomestic areas usually
replace wild dogs as reservoirs.
Studies on possible _Leishmania_ vectors in Panama were initiated in 1942.
Since then, more than 450,000 specimens have been identified. Sandflies
collections were performed all along the Panamanian territory. Seventy six
different species of sandflies are present in the country, of these 5 of
them have been incriminated as vectors (_Leishmania gomezi_, _L. trapidoi_,
_L. panamensis_, _L.ylephiletor_ & _L. sanguinaria_). The presence of _Lu.
longipalpis_ seems however restricted since this species has been collected
only in: Rio Hato in Cocle Province in 1953; Taboga Island in the Gulf of
Panama in 1954; Chame located in the west part of Panama Province in 1955;
Isla Bona located across the District of Chame in the Gulf of Panama in
1967 and this year from the National Park of Altos de Campana, also on the
west part of the Province of Panama, less than 70 km from the City of
Panama and approximately 17 km from the town of Chame.
Therefore, these observations, alerts us to point up the west part of the
Province of Panama as well as the Province of Cocle as possible risk areas
for visceral leishmaniasis transmission due to the presence of the known
vector of the disease. Serologic test by IFI performed on domestic dogs
bled in the area seem to corroborate the [present - MHJ absence of the
parasite, since no antibodies for _L. chagasi_ could be demonstrated.
At this point, it is important to mention that a wild canid, the coyote,
_Canis latrans_ has been moving from North America into South America; and
its presence being noted in the provinces of Cocle and Panama. This could
be a natural way of introducing the parasite into the Panamanian territory.
