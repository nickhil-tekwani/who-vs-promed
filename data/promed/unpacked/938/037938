Summary
Report type: follow-up report no 1
Start date: 1 Feb 2011
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 11 Feb 2011
Report date: 10 Mar 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 11 Mar 2011
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 31 Mar 2001
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: pending
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 28 [For the details of each of the 28 outbreaks
covered in this follow-up report, please go to the source URL above. -
Mod.AS]
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1183 / 854 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 18 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 10 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: no clinical signs of disease. Seropositive
results counted as cases. Number of animals sampled was used as the
number of susceptible animals.

Outbreak statistics (rates expressed as percentages)
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 72 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 50 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 30 / 0 / 0 / 0
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: although some NSP [non-structural protein]
ELISA tests were positive, most NSP ELISA test results are
inconclusive. To date, no FMD virus could be isolated.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country,
screening, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: zoning, vaccination in response to the
outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Transboundary Animal Diseases Programme,
ARC-OVI (OIE's reference laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Non-structural protein ELISA / 2 Mar 2011 / Positive
[It may be assumed that the same tests have been applied in samples
from sheep and goats. - Mod.AS]

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The apparently high "morbidity" (in fact, seropositivity) rate,
involving cattle as well as sheep and goats, may be indicative of a
highly infective virus strain. The apparent absence of clinical signs
may be indicative of its low pathogenicity. Both assumptions need
substantiation.

The map included in the report shows the proximity of the Mozambique
and Swaziland borders to the affected area in north east
KwaZulu-Natal.

Mozambique has, reportedly, suffered an epizootic of FMDV-SAT 2 in
late 2010; ProMED-mail posted the immediate notification of this
outbreak on 10 Oct 2010 (archive no 20101001.3561). Subscribers are
referred to Mod.PC's commentary in the said posting. For the 3
follow-up reports and a map, showing the locations of the 10 FMD foci
reported from Mozambique, see
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9766>.
No follow-up reports have been submitted during 2011; has the disease
been declared endemic in Mozambique?

It would be interesting to obtain information on the FMD situation in
Swaziland (where the last FMD outbreak was reported in 2001).
According to the data of the WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for
FMD, Pirbright), the history of FMD in Swaziland is the following:
"FMDV-SAT 1: 1965, 2000, 2001?
FMDV-SAT 2: 1969
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000
Note: All 3 SAT types are probably endemic in the African buffalo
population."

According to the same source, the history of FMD in South Africa is
the following:
"FMDV-O: 2000 (KwaZulu-Natal ex. Far East)
FMDV-A: 0000
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 1: 1955, 1957-1958, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1973-1975,
1979-1981, ????, 2000, 2009
FMDV-SAT 2: 1951, 1959-1961, 1967-1970, 1974, 1977-1979, 1981, 1983,
????, 2001, 2003-2004, 2008 (buffalo)
FMDV-SAT 3: 1958-1959, 1961, 1979, 1980, ????, 2006
Note: All 3 SAT types are endemic in the Kruger National Park buffalo
population".

The serotyping of the current causal agent is anticipated with
interest.

For further information, particularly in relation to the impact of
the event upon South Africa's exports, please refer to the
