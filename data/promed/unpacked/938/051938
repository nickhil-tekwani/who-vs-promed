Turkish Health Minister Fahretin Kocja reported that 48 people from the Silivri Istanbul district, which have been found to have been in contact with anthrax animals in this area, have been summoned for hospital examination and research, Turkish television channel NTV quoted BTA as saying.

The Minister pointed out in a written statement that in only 6 of the investigated women cutaneous lesions that are symptoms of anthrax were found and no other signs of disease were found in the others. The 6 patients with skin lesions, which can be life-threatening, have been released after treatment, the minister said.

At the same time, designated livestock are being quarantined in the quarters of Balaban and Sandjaktepe in Silivri, because of suspicion of anthrax-infected animals, according to NTV. A total of 3500 animals in both neighborhoods will be vaccinated.

Dozens were taken to hospital over suspicions of anthrax in İstanbul, after anthrax was detected in Turkey's capital of Ankara and eastern province Sivas among cattle imported from Brazil, Cumhuriyet newspaper reported on [Sat 1 Sep 2018].

Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Bekir Pakdemirli said that 22 people were taken to hospitals in İstanbul over suspicions of anthrax, adding that some of the patients have already been discharged, while 4 are still in hospital.

A farm in Silivri which sold the infected cattle for the feast of sacrifice has been quarantined and 3500 cattle in the area have received emergency vaccinations to control an outbreak, Pakdemirli said.

A staffer of a hospital in İstanbul's Bakırköy district told Cumhuriyet that 25 people have applied over suspicions of anthrax and only 2 have been discharged. A total of 9 others were taken to another hospital after getting suspicious from the colour of the meat they were eating and are still in hospital, Cumhuriyet said. Relatives of a family under quarantine told Cumhuriyet that the meat of the cattle they bought for the feast of sacrifice was buried inside the refrigerator [It is unclear what this means; possibly that the contaminated meat still had not been disposed of and the refrigerator cleaned and disinfected. - Mod.MHJ].

A total of 150 cattle died of anthrax in Ankara on [Mon 27 Aug 2018] and 10 000 cattle had emergency vaccinations. While the infected cattle in Ankara had been imported from Brazil, the cattle in İstanbul were bought from a local producer.

Turkey's agriculture and livestock policy has come under criticism recently, as the meat production in the country has been steadily decreasing and Turkey has become dependant on cheap meat imported from other countries.

[It is hard to tell whether there are 2 separate outbreaks of bovine anthrax, one in imported Brazilian cattle and the other in domestic livestock, or whether some of the imported animals had been sold to other farmers, when the importer was faced with a financial loss. It happens, whatever the regulations insist upon.

And the Eid means that meat from sick animals will find its way to market. Hopefully the various vaccination actions will soon kick in and the cattle will remain healthy and safe. It will be interesting to see whether isolates from the various affected herds will demonstrate that are all suffering from known domestic strains of _B. anthracis_ or that the imported livestock came down with a Brazilian strain. I suspect the former as anthrax is presently seldom reported in Brazil. - Mod.MHJ
