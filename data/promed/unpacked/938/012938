Hantavirus-associated Disease in Chile Continues to Increase
------------------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus infection has caused 26 deaths so far this year in Chile,
Health Minister Michelle Bachelet said on Sat 8 Dec 2001, as she
launched the second stage of a program to prevent the spread of the
disease. The rate of infection, affecting 71 people, is the highest
since the disease first appeared in Chile in 1993, though the
percentage of infected persons dying from the illness has fallen from
60 percent in 1997 to the current figure of 37 percent.
The disease primarily affects men who live or work in rural areas in a
corridor extending from Copiapo, 800 km (497 miles) north of
Santiago, to Aysen, 1500 km (932 miles) south of the capital.
During a visit to [a seaside resort town near Santiago, the minister
said that 4 new cases were confirmed this week; all in rural areas of
southern and central Chile. One of the 4 people has died, while 3 are
hospitalized, one in serious condition.

[There are of course many hantaviruses, and only a few are associated
with fatal
disease. In this report it is presumed on account of the high
mortality that the term hantavirus is used colloquially to refer to an
agent causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which in Chile is likely
to be the hantavirus called _Andes virus_. This hantavirus is
transmitted by long-tailed mice, which are found in rural areas
throughout most of the country. - Mod.CP
