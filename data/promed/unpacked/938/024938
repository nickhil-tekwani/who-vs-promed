The death toll of hepatitis E epidemic in Napak District has hit 30. Sunday Monitor has learned that 1000 have been infected with the deadly viral infection since the breakout in the district in mid-2013. Dr James Lemukol, the district health director, said majority of the dead were pregnant mothers.

He said the transmission of the disease in the community is still high yet some development partners who had been supporting the district to fight the epidemic through community mobilization on hygiene have slowed down their efforts due to lack of money. He said the increasing number of infected people proves there's no improvement. The most affected areas are Lorengechora and Iriiri, the highly populated sub-counties in Napak.

"The disease situation has gone up and I am worried it might double since some of the instrumental developmental partners are running short of funds," Dr Lemukol said. "The low coverage of pit-latrines in the district which stands at 22 percent and few clean water sources, are the major challenges hindering the fight against hepatitis E in Napak," he added.

A source at the Ministry of Health told this newspaper that the minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, has called a meeting in Kampala to discuss ways to tame the epidemic.

[The current outbreak of the fecal-oral transmitted hepatitis E virus in the Karamoja subregion of northern Uganda continues with a mortality most prominent in pregnant women. This association has been found with the virus and pregnant women since the initial descriptions of HEV several decades ago.

In rare cases, hepatitis E can result in acute liver failure and death. Overall population mortality rates from hepatitis E range from 0.5 to 4.0 percent. Fulminant hepatitis does occur more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of both obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, especially in outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent and Africa.

As discussed in Navaneethan U, Al Mohajer M, Shata MT: Hepatitis E and pregnancy: understanding the pathogenesis.
Liver Int. 2008;28:1190-1199, the high mortality rate in pregnancy has been thought to be secondary to the associated hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) changes during pregnancy and consequent immunological changes. These immunological changes include downregulation of the p65 component of nuclear factor (NF-kappaB) with a predominant T-helper type 2 (Th2) bias in the T-cell response along with host susceptibility factors, mediated by human leucocyte antigen expression. Thus far, researchers were unable to explain the high HEV morbidity in pregnancy, why it is different from other hepatitis viruses such as hepatitis A with similar epidemiological features and the reason behind the difference in HEV morbidity in pregnant women in different geographical regions. - Mod.
