[In the previous follow-up report, No. 4, submitted 31 Jul 2013, 8 outbreaks were reported: 7 of them in ferret-badgers, and one in a different species, namely an Asian house shrew: _Suncus murinus_ (Soricidae). For details on the latter, including its picture and geographic distribution map, see https://taxo4254.wikispaces.com/Suncus+murinus+-+Asian+House+Shrew. The report included the following epidemiological comments:

"Between 25 and 29 Jul 2013, 3 wild ferret-badgers were found [see comment] in Nantou County, 3 wild ferret-badgers and one Asian house shrew were found [see comment] in Taitung County, one wild ferret-badger was found [see comment] in Kaohsiung City. The Animal Health Research Institute (National Laboratory) has confirmed that these animals were infected with rabies virus by direct fluorescent antibody tests. Lyssavirus genotype 1 was detected from the brain sample of the Asian house shrew by RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Comparing with the cases of 4 ferret-badgers reported in immediate notification and 1st follow-up report, the Animal Health Research Institute (National Laboratory) also identified the identity similarity ranging from 90.5 to 99 percent. Intensified vaccination activities targeted at dogs and cats were conducted on the areas where these ferret-badgers were found; the monitoring is ongoing."

Taiwan's reports consistently state, for "Manifestation of disease": "Sub-clinical infection". Does this mean that the rabies-infected animals were found alive without clinical signs? The above and earlier reports also state that the animals were "found", without further information on their condition, alive or dead. Such information will be helpful.

Since the start of the Taiwan rabies event on 23 Jun 2013, a total of 23 "outbreaks" have been reported. Their summary and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013846_20130802_115733.pdf. - Mod.AS
