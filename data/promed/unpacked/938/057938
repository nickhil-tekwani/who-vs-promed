Human to human transmission of the H5N1 [avian influenza] virus
between a brother and sister in Egypt cannot be ruled out yet,
although both siblings seem to have been exposed to sick birds, the
World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tue [3 Apr 2007].
A 4-year-old boy, from Qena province around 670 km (400 miles) south
of Cairo, was among 3 human cases announced by the Health Ministry at
the weekend. His 6-year-old sister was one of 2 children diagnosed
with the virus infection late last week. "Human to human transmission
cannot yet be ruled out. We are continuing investigations," WHO
spokesman Gregory Hartl said in Geneva. "But we know all the children
had exposure to sick or dead birds."
In all, 5 Egyptian children have been reported as being in hospital
in stable condition. "Egypt has an extremely good record of child
survival of H5N1 virus infection," Hartl added.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is not easily transmissible between
people, although there has been evidence of several clusters
involving human-to-human transmission over the past 3 years,
according to the WHO. Egypt has the highest number of confirmed human
bird flu cases outside Asia. Of the 32 confirmed cases in the country
to date, 13 have been fatal.

Egyptian health authorities have now excluded the possibility of
human-to-human transmission in the case of a brother and sister with
bird flu, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said [later] on Tuesday
[3 Apr 2007]. A 4-year-old boy, from Qena province around 670 km (400
miles) south of Cairo, was among 3 human cases announced by the
health ministry at the weekend. His 6-year-old sister was one of 2
children diagnosed with the virus late last week.
"We have heard from the Ministry of Health that human-to-human
transmission has been ruled out," WHO spokesman Greg Hartl told
Reuters. Both of the children had been exposed to poultry infected
with the H5N1 virus, the most common way in which bird flu has been
spreading.
In all, 5 Egyptian children have been reported as being in hospital
in stable condition. "Egypt has an extremely good record of child
survival of H5N1," Hartl added.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is not easily transmissible between
people, although there has been [circumstantial] evidence of several
clusters involving human-to-human transmission over the past three
years, according to the WHO.

[3] Indonesia - suspected 72nd case
Date: Tue 3 Apr 2007

Initial laboratory tests showed a 23-year old Indonesian woman had
died of bird flu, Indonesian Health Ministry said Monday [2 Apr
2007]. The health officials were waiting for the result of a 2nd
laboratory test for confirmation that she was positive for the avian
influenza virus, an official of the Anti-bird flu Center of the
Ministry Ahmad Prihatna said.
The woman from Central Jakarta died on Sunday evening [1 Apr 2007] at
the hospital of Persahabatan in East Jakarta, he said. She died at
the hospital one hour after being moved from the Islamic Hospital in
Central Jakarta, said Prihatna.
Should the 2nd test be positive, she would be the 72nd fatality case
out of 92 contracted [cases] in the country. The official said that
it was not clear whether the woman had historical contacts with fowls.
The number of bird flu cases in Indonesia has increased recently
after months of absence of new cases. The country has agreed to share
its bird flu virus samples with the World Health Organization (WHO)
for scientific purpose. Indonesian health authorities have imposed a
firm policy of separating fowls from human and surveillance on the
viruses. Raising fowls in residential areas is forbidden. But the
policy seems not to be working, as authorities in most of the 32
provinces in the country have failed to put it into effect,
Indonesian Health Ministry Siti Fadilah Sufari told the Xinhua News
Agency.
Officials from the home affair ministry said that lack of funds,
human resources, and fluctuating weather were among obstacles to
control of the disease.
Experts have warned international community of the risks of the
disease should Indonesia fail to prevent the highly pathogenic H5N1
virus from spreading. Millions of people could be killed should the
virus mutate into a certain level, which can make it transmittable
among humans.

[The evidence for person-to-person transmission between the 2
Egyptian siblings is not strong since it has been established now
that both children were exposed to the same batch of sick or dying
birds.
The success of the Egyptian physicians in treatment of the most
recent 5 cases (all young children) is encouraging and possibly due
to prompt initiation o Tamiflu therapy. The overall survival rate of
59.4 percent for bird flu patients in Egypt contrasts with the
survival rate of 21.7 percent rate in Indonesia (if the 72nd case is
confirmed). - Mod.CP]
