An outbreak of chestnut blight is threatening northeast Victoria's
AUD 10 million [USD 9.4 million] chestnut crop.

The Department of Primary Industries [DPI] has detected suspected
outbreaks of the disease on 2 properties in the Ovens Valley near
Myrtleford and set up quarantine arrangements to control and track
the outbreak.

DPI staff are working with the property owners to contain the disease
to the infected trees, trace the movement of grafting material and
survey other groves and nurseries in the area.

DPI teams have been sent across the region in an effort to determine
whether the blight has spread. The disease had never been found in
Australia before it was spotted at Eurobin in early September 2010.

David McIntye from Chestnuts Australia says: "We hoped it was a
native [pathogen]; there are a few, but as we inspected the orchards,
we got more and more worried." The North East produces around 90
percent of the country's chestnuts.

David McIntyre says despite extreme vigilance by farmers and
government authorities, the industry remains on a knife edge. He
says: "Worst case scenario is it has spread throughout our orchards;
we're going to have to radically modify our operating procedures, our
pruning programs and how we manage our orchards."

The exotic disease ruined the chestnut industry in North America more
than half a century ago, wiping out around 6 billion trees within 40
years. The DPI is urging growers to be on the lookout for cankers or
spores on trees and to report them immediately.

[Chestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_.
It affects chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.) and some other tree genera (for
example oaks, maples and eucalypts), but susceptibility varies
between species. Most susceptible are the European chestnut (_C.
sativa_), which is most often used for commercial chestnut crops
(including in Australia), and the American chestnut (_C. dentata_).
In the late 1800s, the disease spread from the Far East, where native
species show very low susceptibility, to North America, where it
caused massive extinctions. In the 1930s, it spread to Europe, but
until now, it was prevented from entering Australia by strict
quarantine regulations.

A virulent and hypovirulent form of the pathogen exist. Virulent
strains induce variable symptoms which may include necrosis and
cracking of the bark (cankers), orange to beige fungal growth,
distortion of bark due to the destruction of the underlying tissues,
yellowing of leaves, wilting of shoots, and dieback of branches.
Symptoms progress quickly, and death of the tree occurs due to
girdling by cankers. Hypovirulent strains cause mild and/or transient
symptoms which do not normally kill the host. The fungus enters
through wounds and survives as a non-lethal parasite on a number of
tree species. It is spread mainly by infected plant and other
materials, mechanical means (including insect activity, tools and
machinery, birds over long distances), wind and splashing rain.

Hypovirulence is due to infection of the fungus by _Cryphonectria
hypovirus 1-EP713_ (CHV1-EP713; type species of genus _Hypovirus_).
The virus can be transmitted through hyphal anastomosis converting
the recipient strain to the hypovirulent phenotype. However,
transmission is limited by a vegetative incompatibility system in the
fungus. In Europe, the disease has lost its severity due to the
natural spread of the hypovirus, which has enabled re-growth of
chestnuts in many affected regions. Hypovirulence provides the basis
for disease management, and research is in progress on virus
diversity, dispersal and the establishment of hypovirulence.

The means of introduction of chestnut blight into Australia remains
to be clarified, but illegally imported cuttings or fruit have been
the source of previous incursions of tree diseases in the country
(for example citrus canker; see ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
