African swine fever [ASF] has been successfully controlled in Ngoc Thuy Ward, Long Bien District and Phu Thi Commune, Gia Lam District, according to the Ha Noi Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

So far, the disease has been identified in 895 livestock farming households in 18 districts of Hanoi, including Dong Anh, Soc Son, Gia Lam, Quoc Oai, Hoang Mai, Thach That, Phuc Tho, Thanh Tri, Phu Xuyen, Thuong Tin, Chuong My, Hoai Duc, Dan Phuong, Ha Dong, Me Linh, Ung Hoa, Bac Tu Liem and Ba Vi.

More than 12 940 pigs have been culled in an attempt to stop the outbreak, New Ha Noi newspaper reported.

The agriculture department has required the Animal Husbandry sub-department to closely monitor the disease and continue to take random samples from slaughterhouses for testing.

Local farmers should be given more information on the disease so that they can be aware of the danger, infection and solutions to prevent this disease.

In Nam Dinh Province, the disease struck 9 of 10 districts and cities, with nearly 28 000 pigs culled, vietnamplus.vn reported. Only Y Yen District has not detected this disease.

The provincial government has asked localities to take drastic measures to control the outbreak. People's committees at city and districts set up a mobile quarantine team and 87 quarantine spots on the roads to control the transport of pigs and pork products into and out of the region.

Son La Province also saw 8 districts suffering from this disease, with nearly 3150 pigs culled.

[On 19 Feb 2019, ASF outbreaks were reported for the 1st time in Viet Nam in Hung Yen and Thai Bin provinces. Since then, and as of 24 Apr 2019, a total of 812 outbreaks of ASF have been reported in Viet Nam in 24 provinces/cities. As of 19 Apr 2019, more than 89 600 pigs have been culled in the country.

Viet Nam's most recent follow-up report (No. 12) was submitted to the OIE on 28 Mar 2019. Later, the Cambodian authorities called for alertness in their eastern provinces, since ASF was reportedly spreading in Viet Nam's provinces bordering Cambodia (20190320.6377843).
