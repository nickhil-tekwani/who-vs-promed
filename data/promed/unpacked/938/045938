Rabies scare after bat tests positive
-------------------------------------
A bat found injured in a park has tested positive for a strain of
rabies, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.

The Daubenton's bat [_Myotis daubentonii_; picture at
<http://www.dkimages.com/discover/previews/934/10002445.JPG>. -
Mod.AS] was found last August [2007] in Bushy Park, Surrey, by a
member of the public and passed to experienced bat handlers to be looked after.

The animal was destroyed earlier this month [May 2008] after it
started behaving abnormally and tests showed it had European bat
lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), a strain of bat rabies.

Defra said the risk to human health of the disease was "negligible"
as treatment was highly effective, but said anyone who believed they
or their pets had come into contact with that particular bat to
contact the authorities.

The EBLV-2 strain has been found in 6 bats in the UK since 1996, in
Sussex, Lancashire, Surrey, Oxfordshire and Shropshire, Defra said.

There is a known low prevalence of EBLV-2 in Daubenton's bats in
England, but it does not affect the UK's rabies-free animal health
status, the department said. The virus can only be transmitted by the
bite of an infected bat, and the Health Protection Agency advises
anyone who is bitten to wash the wound with soap and water and seek
medical advice immediately.

Anyone who finds a sick or injured bat should not approach or handle
it, but should contact the Bat Conservation Trust. Bats are a
protected species and it is illegal to kill them or damage their
roosts, Defra added.

Anyone who believes they or their pets have been in contact with the
bat should contact the Animal Health Office at Chelmsford on 01245
358383 for animals or the Health Protection Agency on 020 8200 6868
for human contacts.

[European Bat Lyssaviruses (EBLVs) 1 and 2, commonly referred to as
bat rabies, are 2 strains of rabies-related lyssaviruses found in
bats across Northern Europe. On rare occasions EBLVs have been known
to infect other animals and humans. The risk of EBLV infection to
humans is thought to be low. However, since 1977 there have been 5
human deaths in Europe (3 confirmed, 2 possible) from EBLVs, all in
cases where the human had been bitten or scratched by bats and had
not received rabies vaccination either before or after being bitten by bats.

DEFRA's information bulletin on the current case (Ref: 137/08, 9 May
2008) can be accessed at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/080509.htm>. It includes the
following additional information:

"The bat was euthanased on 2 May 2008, after it started behaving
abnormally on 27 Apr 2008. It was then sent for routine testing.

"Advice from the Health Protection Agency is that if anyone is bitten
by a bat the wound should be cleaned with soap and water and they
should seek medical advice immediately. The risk of humans being
infected by EBVL-2 is negligible if they receive appropriate and
timely medical treatment after exposure.

"Anyone finding a sick or ailing bat should not approach or handle it
but seek advice from the Bat Conservation Trust Helpline on 0845 1300 228."

It will be interesting to note if the investigators suspect the
infection of the bat to have taken place prior to its collection
(incubation period exceeding 7 months), or during the bat's period of
captivity.
