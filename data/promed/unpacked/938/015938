Measles epidemiology in the EU continues to deteriorate. In 2010, a national outbreak in Bulgaria accounted for the majority of confirmed cases; in 2011, large increases in cases and outbreaks were reported by several EU countries. The commitment to eliminate indigenous measles and rubella was renewed for 2015 but will not be achieved unless effective interventions to increase vaccine coverage are achieved by several Member States.

Most other vaccine-preventable diseases continued to show either a declining or stable trend in reported incidence of confirmed cases. Mumps case rates appear to be declining from the reported peak in 2010. Confirmed rubella case rates again decreased in 2010, but the burden of disease is hard to assess due to variations in surveillance systems and reporting, and particularly low rates of laboratory confirmation.

Currently, citizens of the Republic of Georgia can obtain free vaccination at clinics throughout the country. Nonetheless, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cases of measles in Georgia. Epidemiologists say that this was to be expected, because the majority of the population has ignored the availability of vaccination. At present, all citizens from 6 months to 30 years of age can obtain vaccination, which is free.

A whole body red rash and fever are the principal symptoms of the disease. According to Paata Imnadze, the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Georgia, in 2008, the turnout and demand for vaccination was minimal due to civil strife and unrest. [The Russia-Georgia War of 2008 (also known as the Five-Day War, the 2008 South Ossetia Conflict, or the August War) occurred in August 2008 between Georgia on one side and Russia and the separatist governments of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other. - Mod.CP]. According to the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, this is the reason for the current sharp rise in the number of measles cases among adults in Georgia. Doctors are recommending that citizens of Georgia should seek vaccination without further delay.

In the last month, about 100 cases of measles were diagnosed in Tbilisi, mostly people between 20 to 30 years of age. More than half of them require hospitalisation. Talking about the disease, the General Director of the Health Agency, Professor Tengiz Tsertsvadze, stated that the symptoms of measles involved the respiratory tract and eyes and a red body rash. Complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis might follow in some cases. In order to calm the population, Professor Tsertsvadze added that, as yet, there is no cause for panic as the epidemic is just beginning. In Georgia in 2004, a severe epidemic affected 12 000 people.

Health bosses have advised people to get their children's immunisations up to date after a spike in the number of measles cases. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed there have been 75 cases of the virus in Lancashire so far this year [2013]. GP surgeries in the Colne area have put up posters offering advice about the highly infectious virus after at least one case was found in the area.

Nationally, there were almost twice as many confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales reported to the Health Protection Agency in 2012 than the previous year, and the increase has continued to grow so far this year [2013]. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the HPA, said: "It's extremely concerning that measles cases are continuing to rise. Measles can be very serious, and parents should understand the risks associated with the infection, which, in severe cases, can result in death.

"Although uptake of the MMR vaccine has improved in recent years, some children do not get vaccinated on time, and some older children, who missed out when uptake was lower, have not had a chance to catch-up. Therefore, there are still enough people who are not protected to allow some large outbreaks to occur among unvaccinated individuals. "It's vital that children receive both doses of the MMR vaccination ahead of returning to school after the holidays. We are urging parents to ensure their children have received the 2 doses, which will provide the best protection against the risks associated with measles, mumps and rubella.

A spokesman for the Health Protection Agency said that doctors' surgeries across the county have been advised to ensure their stocks of the measles vaccine are full in the event of a rush of people requiring it. She said: "We have been working closely with GP surgeries across Lancashire to ensure that the message is for people to get themselves or their children vaccinated." She added: "Surgeries are also being informed of any outbreaks and, in that event, are being advised to have stocks of the vaccine available."

Seven more confirmed and 20 more suspected cases of measles have been reported in the region. Since the beginning of September 2012, when the numbers started increasing, 122 confirmed cases and 128 suspected cases of the illness have now been reported. This is an increase of 7 confirmed and 20 suspected cases on the previous week.

The majority of cases continue to be reported in County Durham, Darlington, and the Tees area. People aged between 10 and 19 years continue to be most affected, making up 38 percent of all cases. Julia Waller, spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency in the North East said: "Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region.

20 new cases of measles have been reported as part of an outbreak in south west Wales. There have now been a reported 209 cases of the infection in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot since November [2012].

Health officials are continuing to urge parents to ensure their children receive the MMR vaccination.

The majority of new cases are around Swansea, but a smaller number have been reported across the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area. 20 new cases have been reported since last Thursday.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said measles is a very contagious disease that will be contracted by 90 percent of unvaccinated people who come into contact with cases. "Parents can easily protect their children by having them immunised with the MMR vaccine," she said. "After completing a 2-dose course of MMR, 99 per cent of children will be protected against measles.

Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common even in healthy people, and around 20 percent of reported measles cases experience one or more complication. These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis, and serious eye disorders.

The Yobe Government says it recorded 361 cases of measles with 4 deaths in 14 of the 17 Local Government Areas of the state from January 2013 to date. This is contained in a statement signed by Mr Musa Alaraba, the Press Secretary to Yobe Deputy Governor in Damaturu on Friday [8 Mar 2013].

The statement said that the 4 deaths were recorded in Nangere Local Government. It stated that Potiskum recorded 87 cases, Tarmuwa 37, Nangere 33, Bursari 30, Jakusko 29, Bade 27, Fika 25, Fune 24, Gulani 22, Nguru 20, Karasuwa 12, Giedam 8, Yusufari 6, and Damaturu one.

It stated that 357 children were treated and discharged, while 4 died out of the 33 cases recorded in Nangere Local Government. The statement described reports that 87 children died in Potiskum as misleading. "The figure represents the total number of cases recorded in Potiskum, and there were no deaths. In Potiskum, all the victims were treated and discharged," it said.

The statement further stated that the state Ministry of Health introduced an integrated measles campaign alongside the routine immunisation. As a deliberate policy, the Ministry took advantage of the routine Immunisation Plus Days to administer measles' vaccines to children who missed the initial immunisation. "A surveillance network had also been introduced in all the 17 Local Governments for early disease detection and quick response," it added.
