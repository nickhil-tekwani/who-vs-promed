Chinese scientists report bird flu in sparrows [2004]
-----------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists said they had found the H5N1 bird flu virus in
sparrows 2 years ago, the 1st time it has been detected in
non-migratory birds in China, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday
[26 Oct 2006]. Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, in the
central province of Hubei, found the virus in sparrows' excrement
following an outbreak of bird flu in a county in neighboring Henan
province [see ProMED 2004 archive below]. "There's no need for the
public to panic. The findings are 2 years old, and there is no
indication that sparrows pose a risk," Xinhua quoted Li Tianxian, a
researcher at the institute, as saying.
Chinese officials have in the past blamed outbreaks of bird flu in
the country on migratory birds, but the findings indicate that the
virus could also be among local birds common in urban areas.
With the world's largest poultry population, China is seen as a
center in the fight against bird flu, which scientists fear could
mutate into a form that can pass easily between people, potentially
causing a pandemic. The country has already seen dozens of outbreaks
of the virus in birds and at least 21 human cases, of whom 14 have died.
