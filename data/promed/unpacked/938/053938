[1] _E. coli_ O104

On Thursday, 19 May 2011, Klaus Stark, an instructor in
gastrointestinal infections and zoonoses at the Robert Koch Institute
(RKI), received a worrying message: in Hamburg, several patients were
being treated for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Stark knew that the
syndrome was a dangerous complication of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_
infection.

HUS cases occur only rarely. Throughout the year 2010 only 65
patients develped the syndrome. "If on one day several people in a
city with HUS were being hospitalized, then of course, an alarm bell
rings," says Stark. On that day, he sent a 1st team of 3 RKI-employees
to Hamburg, in order to collect information and to interview the
patients.

Within a weekend, the small accumulation of HUS cases blossumed into
one of the largest outbreaks that have ever been was registered. "We
assume that we have in Germany at least 80 people with HUS," says
Stark. "In Hamburg only, 60 people a day with bloody diarrhea in
hospital have been reported. This is a tragedy."

To find out what was the vehicle for transmission in this outbreak,
the disease experts search for clues by finding out what the sick ate
as compared to people who did not develop the infection.

The public health department reported in Frankfort that all sufferers
in the city had eaten in the same cafeteria. Now experts are trying to
find out which delivery could have introduced the canteen the
pathogen.

The national reference laboratory for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_
infections in Wernigerode has been investigating the _E. coli_
isolated from patients. "It looks like at the moment, _E. coli_ O104
is the cause of the diseases," says Stark.

[It appears that the culprit is an O104, non-O157 _E. coli_. This
outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of
verotoxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have
been associated with VTEC (verotoxin-producing _E. coli_) disease
include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones
such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from
sheep and cattle and, although they cause as many as 30 percent of
outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at least more
variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups,
it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have
unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The
serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and
O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme
immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4
strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a
cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in VTEC
infections treated with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials should not
be used for known acute cases. It is not yet known if antimicrobials
have played a role in more severe in this outbreak.

[2] 2 more deaths, spread to the south of Germany

The next 24 hours will be critical for scientists in Germany who are
trying to understand if an outbreak of infections from a deadly strain
of _E. coli_ currently sweeping the country is a severe instance of a
normal infection, or something different.

A total of 3 women have died today from suspected infections with the
bacteria enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). Health authorities have
reported a further 400 confirmed cases, mostly in young women.
Authorities have been shocked at the rate at which this outbreak has
spread.

Today's deaths were of 2 women in their 80s: one of these has already
been confirmed as an EHEC case, and a young woman.

Early cases were confined to northern Germany, but this afternoon, 24
May 2011, the 1st suspected cases have been reported in the southern
German state of Bavaria.

[It appears now that cases, which have been all in the northern part
of the country, are now occurring further south. Additionally, there
are 3 deaths, an increase from the one reported earlier today. - Mod.
