2004/100 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
By browsing through the CABI Abstracts, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted
the following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on
the EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest concerned is indicated in
bold, using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
New records
_Xiphinema rivesi_ (EPPO A2 list) is reported for the 1st time from Iran
(Fadaei et al., 2003). Present, no details.
_Xiphinema rivesi_ (EPPO A2 list) is reported from Western Australia (AU),
on grapevine (Sharma et al., 2003). Present, found in Western Australia.
Detailed records
------------
_Nacobbus aberrans_ (EPPO A1 list) is present in the state of Oaxaca,
Mexico. It was identified in roots of _Capsicum annuum plants_ in Cuilapam
de Guerrero (Vazquez-Lopez et al., 2002).

[In South America and Mexico, _Naccobus aberrans_ [Na] (also called the
false root-knot nematode) has been reported to cause crop losses as high as
65 percent on potato and 36 percent on bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_). Na is
spread through soil debris, poorly sanitized bare root propagative plant
material and edible roots or tubers. It is ranked in the "top 3" nematode
pests of potato in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia (Anon., 1973),
along with the potato cyst nematodes _Globodera rostochiensis_, _G.
pallida_ (EPPO/CABI, 1996) and root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.); in
some areas, e.g. Puno Department of southern Peru, it is the most
important. Most potato fields in southern Peru and Bolivia are heavily
infested (Jatala, 1979). Na populations can be decreased by nematicides,
fumigants (Stone & Burrows, 1985b) and crop rotation over a 4-6 yr period.
Recent work has demonstrated that antagonistic fungi and bacteria
(Zuckerman et al., 1989) may be useful biological control measures.
Breeding for resistance has shown some promising preliminary results
(Finetti Sialer, 1990), but resistant potato cultivars are apparently not
yet available.
Regarding _Xiphinema rivesi_, it is present in the EPPO region (France,
Germany, Portugal and Spain). It may be an introduction from North America
(Lamberti & Ciancio, 1993). It is widespread in USA and is possibly present
in South America. The distribution of European populations of _X. rivesi_
is illustrated by Alphey & Taylor (1986). _X. rivesi_ is a vector of Tomato
ringspot nepovirus.
