A cattle ranch in Río Negro suffered an unusual death of cattle, and when they were analyzed it was found that the cause was a pathology known as anthrax, which can cause sudden death in affected animals. From the National Service for Agrifood Health and Quality (Senasa), the diagnosis was confirmed, so the agency provided recommendations to producers from neighboring fields, since it is an infectious disease.

Cases of animals with anthrax were detected in a property located in the Department of Conesa, province of Río Negro. Specialists warned that it is a disease that mainly affects cattle and is transmissible to both animals and people.

The coordinator of Animal Health of the North Patagonia Regional Center of Senasa, Leonardo Ripoll, remarked that when the disease is suspected, the institution must be informed. In fact, he indicated that this time the warning was given by a private veterinarian. After notifying them of the infections, "our staff began with the health protocol that is applied in these cases," Ripoll remarked. Following the planned steps, the fact was notified to the Public Health authorities.

"Laboratory analysis confirmed that the death of animals was caused by this disease," Ripoll said in reference to anthrax, also stressing that immediate measures were taken to prevent an increase in cases.

In this regard, he explained that Senasa ordered "the interdiction of the establishment where the case was confirmed, preventing the entry and exit of animals, as well as that of hides and offal." As a preventive measure, producers from neighboring fields were recommended to vaccinate all the animals located on the farm under the supervision of veterinary inspectors and, in addition, they were made aware of the risks involved in the disease.

"Our staff will be verifying this entire animal vaccination process in the field where the case originated," remarked the Senasa referent. In addition, he explained that it is an acute disease and "is responsible for significant economic losses, but vaccination prevents its spread and the consequent mortality."

Due to the danger posed by the presence of the disease, Ripoll stated that it is necessary for vaccination to be incorporated into the health plan of production establishments, despite the fact that it is not currently mandatory.

From the national body, it was advised that when suspected of having a case of anthrax, not to skin or move the animals, call the veterinarian to make a good diagnosis and Senasa to notify the disease.

In addition, it was advised to use personal protection elements that can be discarded or thoroughly sanitized. Among the recommended products are glasses, gloves, chinstraps, overalls, boots, utensils and disposable material. At the same time, it was requested that those establishments that present cases correctly dispose of the carcasses of the animals using the "controlled cover" technique.

[Thanks to Mahmoud for forwarding this more informative Argentine report. We now know that there were unstated multiple cattle deaths on this establishment in Rio Negro. From years of experience, I have found this obduracy usually results from only single samples being submitted for analysis with minimal or no background information. And official numbers generated from laboratory data, not field reports. An unfortunate fact of life. - Mod.MHJ
