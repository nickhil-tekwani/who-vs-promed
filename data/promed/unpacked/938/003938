Increase in fatal cases of dengue fever in Thailand
-------------------------------------------
BANGKOK: Heavy rain and warmer weather, coupled with an influx of illegal
aliens, have contributed to an upsurge this year in cases of the
potentially fatal disease dengue fever, health officials said on Tue 22 May
2001. A Public Health Ministry report noted 20 400 cases of dengue fever
nationwide for the first 4 months of this year, a 25 per cent increase over
the 16 267 cases reported for the same period in 2000. Fatal cases of
dengue fever over the same period have increased more than 27 per cent, to
33 from 43. Saravudh Suvannadabba, director of the Ministry's Dengue
Control Division. said that rain was the main problem, because it created
pools of still water where mosquitoes can breed.

Dengue fever emergency in border region between Ecuador and Peru
----------------------------------------------------------------
QUITO: Today the Ecuadoran government requested that Peru declare a health
emergency at the Peruvian border [with Ecuador, [presently affected by an
epidemic of dengue fever, which is in danger of spreading. The Ecuadorian
Ministry of Health "had solicited from the Peruvian Ministry of Health, a
declaration of emergency in the northern parts of Tumbes and Sullana,
because it is there (in these Peruvian localities) where there is an
infectious focus [of dengue fever," read a communication from the
Presidencia of Quito.
The health authorities of Ecuador have sent several medical brigades to the
border with Peru and are collaborating in the epidemiological control [of
dengue/DHF in these Peruvian localities, where they have reported at least
7 deaths due to hemorrhagic dengue. The Ecuadorian government declared a
health emergency in the entire national territory last week, in order to
control the outbreaks of classical dengue fever and malaria which have
resulted from the severe rains that have affected the country. In the
contingency plan they will collaborate with specialists from the Pan
American Health Organization [PAHO, the Venezuelan epidemiologist Iris de
Chacon, the Bolivian physician Angel Valencia, and the Colombian expert
Diego Victoria.
The Ecuadorian authorities plan to eliminate the breeding sites of _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes, the transmitters of dengue fever. The "classic"
disease in the first stage [dengue fever presents with joint pains, fever,
and rash. The second phase of dengue, which can affect those who have
previously had classical dengue, has additional hemorrhagic symptoms that
may be fatal. In Ecuador one death due to hemorrhagic dengue has been
reported officially , although there are more than a dozen suspected cases,
leading to concerns that this disease will spread easily if strict sanitary
controls are not implemented.
