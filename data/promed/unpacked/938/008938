A mother and daughter are being treated at the Sanglah General
Hospital in Denpasar, Bali after contracting suspected bird flu [avian
influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection].

Hospital spokesman Kadek Nariyantha said the hospital was awaiting
test results to determine whether the pair had avian influenza, which
is prevalent on the island. There have been 2 confirmed deaths this
month [October 2011; see: Avian influenza, human (64): Indonesia (BA)
WHO 20111027.3198].

Kadek identified the [patients as a 42-year-old woman and a
10-year-old female child] from the village of Pande in Abiansemal,
Badung. Both patients were in stable condition, he said.

[Further information and confirmation of the diagnosis from a
WHO-accredited laboratory are awaited. Of the 181 cases confirmed to
date in Indonesia, 149 have been fatal. Ten cases and 8 deaths have
been confirmed so far during 2011. The most recent 2 confirmed cases
(also a mother and her daughter) were recorded in a different regency
