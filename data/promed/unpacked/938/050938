[The disease in both sunflower and groundnut is caused by a strain of the
seedborne Tobacco streak ilarvirus. In 2000 the disease devastated the
largest single groundnut-growing area in the world (Ananthapur and Kurnool
districts of Andhra Pradesh), causing crop losses of more than 300 crores
of rupees (US$ 64 million) and affecting the lives of more than half a
million farmers. TSV is transmitted by species of thrips (_Thrips tabaci_
and _Frankliniella occidentalis_). The vectors become contaminated by
infected pollen, which is likely introduced into wounds created by the
vector's feeding habits, leading to plant infection. Disease management
involves use of virus-free seed, control of susceptible weedy plants, and
intercropping with cereals which are immune to TSV. Parthenium weed, (a.k.a
congress grass, _Parthenium hysterophorous_ ) was accidentally introduced
to India in 1956 and has spread rapidly throughout the country. It causes
asthma and dermatitis.
