[1] Cholera - Cameroon (Far North Region)

Rains and insecurity caused by Nigerian Islamist militants are aggravating a cholera outbreak in northern Cameroon which has killed at least 75 people and infected some 1400 others since April 2014. Water scarcity, poor public health care, and risky hygienic practices have rekindled the disease, which badly hit the country between 2009 and 2011, experts say. Population movement during the current school holidays could help spread infections to other regions of Cameroon or even to neighboring countries, said Felicite Tchibindat, a UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in Cameroon.

The 1st cholera case was in a Nigerian family who were among a group of refugees fleeing to Cameroon from bombings and attacks by Nigeria's Boko Haram extremist militia in April 2014. Scarcity of safe drinking water, open defecation, and other poor hygienic habits have exacerbated the cholera cases in northern Cameroon, Tchibindat said. More than 26 000 cholera cases have been reported in Nigeria since the start of the year [2014], according to health authorities.

Cameroon's Far North, North, Adamaoua and East regions suffer chronic shortages of health workers. Nationally, there are 1.43 healthcare personnel per 1000 people. In the Far North Region, for instance, the ratio is 0.47 doctors for 1000 people. Most of the staff deployed to the remote regions "feel that it is a punishment," the UNICEF representative said. More than half of the country's health workers are in the Central, Coastal and Western regions, which host the 3 largest cities of Yaounde, Douala and Bafoussam.

"Most hospitals lack facilities to test and treat patients in good time," said Peter Tambe, a health expert in Maroua, the capital of the Far North Region, where 97 percent of the cholera cases have been reported.

Three persons have lost their lives following reported cases of a cholera outbreak in Gumbur Ward of Wase Local Government of Plateau State.

The Council Chairman, Mr. Zakari Abdul, told newsmen on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] in Wase in Southern zone of the state that the disease broke out in the locality last Sun 3 Aug 2014, adding that 34 other persons from the area were suffering from diarrhea.

Abdul said he had reported the matter to the state Ministry of Health for assistance considering the number of persons affected. He called on the people of the affected area and the people of the council to be hygienic so as to prevent the spread of the disease.

The chairman, who spoke through the Director of the Primary Health Care (PHC) Department, Mr. Ayuba Ahuta, said it was the 2nd time the state was experiencing a cholera outbreak in the council. He said 2 persons were killed and 40 affected by last month's [July 2014] outbreak recorded in Gaji, Zak and Wase town.
