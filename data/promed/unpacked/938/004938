West Bengal leads in snakebite and rabies deaths
------------------------------------------------
West Bengal accounted for the maximum snakebite and rabies deaths in India last year. A total of 1440 persons died of snakebite and another 223 of rabies during 2011 in the country, out of which as many as 380 and 73 deaths were reported on the 2 counts respectively in West Bengal. Health and Family Welfare Ghulam Nabi Azad told the Lok Sabha that following West Bengal, Orissa reported 296 snakebite deaths, while 258 were in Andhra Pradesh and 119 in Madhya Pradesh. He said 58 deaths due to snakebite had also taken place in Maharashtra and 50 in Uttar Pradesh, while Karnataka reported 49 and Gujarat 48 such deaths and Himachal Pradesh 40 and another 39 in Tamil Nadu.

In rabies deaths, Andhra Pradesh followed West Bengal with 45 deaths. There were also 24 rabies related deaths taking place in 2011 in Orissa and 21 in Tamil Nadu, besides 18 in Karnataka, 17 in Delhi and 16 in Gujarat. Delhi also reported 3 deaths due to snakebite. The Minister said to prevent human deaths due to rabies, a pilot project was carried out in the 11th 5-year Plan in the five cities of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Pune, Madurai and Delhi to help create awareness in the community about timely action and post-exposure treatment in such cases and medical and paramedical personnel were also trained in providing timely animal bite management.

Azad said since Health is a state subject, it is the primary responsibility of the state governments to ensure availability of anti-rabies vaccine and anti-snake venom serum in the health care facilities, but the Centre was providing funds to states under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) for purchase of drugs and vaccines to make up for shortages and strengthen primacy health care centres.

Rabies Deaths in India
----------------------
While even one death from rabies is unacceptable since rabies can be totally prevented and eradicated, the answer of the Health Minister, Gulam Nabi Azad in the Lok Sabha recently should at least show the massive contribution made by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) in this field.

Whether the number of deaths as estimated by the WHO between 1992 and 2002 was indeed approximately steady at 20 000 *per year* is another matter, the figure given by the Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare is in the opinion of many of us working on the ground much closer to reality. This figure is 223 human deaths in 2011 from rabies as compared to 1440 from snakebite. The figure reported for Tamil Nadu of 21 agrees perfectly with every other figure I have received.

If the Union Government sets its mind to it, we can make rabies in India history.

[Venomous snakes occur throughout many regions of the world and are a threat to public health, especially in the rural tropics where they are most abundant. Out of more than 3000 species of snakes in the world, some 600 are venomous and over 200 are considered to be medically important. The risk of snakebite envenoming is a public health hazard that many people in the rural tropics face on a daily basis. In these areas, snakebite envenoming is a common cause of occupational injury affecting agricultural workers and hunters with important socioeconomic implications. Open-plan housing and the practice of sleeping on the floor, common in tropical regions, also exposes people to bites from nocturnal snakes. Overall women, children and farmers are the most common victims of snakebites. Children often suffer more severe effects than adults, due to their smaller body mass.

Snake antivenom immunoglobulins (antivenoms) are the only specific treatment for envenoming by snakebites. Antivenoms can prevent or reverse most of the snakebite envenomings effects, and play a crucial role in minimizing mortality and morbidity. A database and image library has been created by WHO to enable users to easily identify the most important venomous snakes in their country, territory or area; see the distributions of each species; and find information about antivenom products for treating envenoming caused by their bites (see: http://apps.who.int/bloodproducts/snakeantivenoms/database/.

The production of antivenins is hazardous and requires the use living animals. The complexity of the production of antivenoms, in particular the importance of preparing appropriate snake venom mixtures for the production of hyperimmune plasma (the source of antivenom immunoglobulins), the decreasing number of producers and the fragility of the production systems in developing countries further jeopardize the availability of effective antivenoms in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

Consequently while the high mortality from snake bite in India is understandable and excusable, the high mortality from from rabies virus infection is less so. Potent and effective cell-produced anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin are available and completely protective if administered soon after exposure. Furthermore the vectors of rabies virus are predominantly urban and feral dogs which could be eliminated or controlled by a variety of means. Consequently S. Chinny Krishna's comment is justified and hopefully will be heeded.

West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India and is the nation's 4th-most populous. It is also the 7th-most populous sub-national entity in the world, with over 91 million inhabitants. Covering a total area of 34 267 sq mi (88 750 km2), it is bordered by the countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, and the Indian states of Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata (formerly Calcutta).
