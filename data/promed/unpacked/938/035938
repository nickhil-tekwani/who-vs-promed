Bulgaria's first suspected cases of bird flu in poultry were not caused by the
potentially lethal H5 or H7 viruses, final test results from the EU reference
laboratory [VLA, Weybridge] has shown.
Samples of the virus, detected in July [2006] on 2 farms in the village of
Slanchogled, near Djebel in southern Bulgaria, "proved negative for the highly
pathogenic strains [of] H5 and H7, dangerous for humans," the national
veterinary service said in a statement, citing the results from the [world
reference] laboratory in Weybridge, UK.
However, the samples were positive for "Newcastle disease and a low-pathogenic
form of bird flu," which are not lethal to humans, it added.
Bulgarian veterinary authorities culled some 1000 birds in the 2 affected
farms and the country banned all exports to the EU of live poultry, raw
poultry products and brood eggs to prevent spread of the viruses.
The suspected bird flu outbreak was the 1st in domestic poultry in Bulgaria,
although 4 cases of the potentially deadly H5N1 bird flu virus were registered
in February [2006] in wild swans in the north of the country.

[In ProMED-mail's post 20060721.2009, which included data derived from a
Bulgarian press release about a suspected outbreak of avian influenza, we
indicated the need for confirmation from a reference laboratory and details of
the virus; these have become (indirectly) available now, fortunately excluding
high pathogenicity of the isolate. It would help to have information on the
exact H and N identity of the Bulgarian isolate, not clear from the above
media item, thus not (yet) excluding low pathogenic H5 or H7.
For several weeks, commencing 20 Feb 2006, DEFRA published on its website
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla> a table entitled "Avian Influenza
Update from VLA" (see 20060220.0550). The table was updated continuously to
provide information on the samples received for diagnosis at the CRL
(community reference laboratory), VLA, Weybridge, and on their results, when
obtained. This most commendable and useful service is, unfortunately, not
available any more. - Mod.AS]
