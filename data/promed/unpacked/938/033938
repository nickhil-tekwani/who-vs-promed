Preliminary testing by the Province of Ontario has confirmed the presence of H5 avian influenza on a turkey farm near Woodstock, Ontario.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has placed the farm, and a neighbouring farm, under quarantine to control disease spread and the industry sector has been notified to adopt enhanced biosecurity practices. Further testing by the CFIA is underway to confirm pathogenicity and to determine the precise subtype and strain of the virus. Pathogenicity refers to the severity of the illness caused in birds. Results are expected within days.

Avian influenza does not pose a risk to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked. Avian influenza rarely affects humans who do not have consistent contact with infected birds. Public health authorities stand ready to take precautionary measures as warranted.

Initial tests for the disease were conducted on 5 Apr 2015 at the Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph, after the turkey farm experienced sudden deaths of birds over several days.

All birds on the infected premises will be humanely euthanized and disposed of, in accordance with provincial environmental regulations and internationally accepted disease control guidelines. As lead response agency the CFIA will ensure the quarantine of the infected farm, and determine a surrounding surveillance zone for further testing and movement control measures. The CFIA will also lead on required depopulation of birds, while the Province will provide technical support on required carcass disposal. Once all birds have been removed, the CFIA will oversee the cleaning and disinfection of the barns, vehicles, equipment and tools to eliminate any infectious material that may remain.

The Province of Ontario, the CFIA, the owner of the infected birds, and the poultry industry are working closely together to manage the situation. Both levels of government will work with the poultry industry to address issues as they emerge. The Canadian poultry sector currently practices a high level of biosecurity that reduces the risk of disease spread.

A bird flu outbreak on an Ontario turkey farm is caused by the same virus that has triggered outbreaks in British Columbia and 9 U.S. states since late 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced Wed 8 Apr 2015.

The culprit is a highly pathogenic H5N2 virus, said CFIA vice-president Paul Mayers, who noted Canada would inform the World Organization for Animal Health, known as the OIE, about the finding.

Under international regulations, countries must notify the OIE when they have outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu viruses because these viruses can devastate poultry operations. OIE rules also allow countries to ban poultry imports from affected countries.

Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Uruguay have already imposed trade sanctions as a result of the Ontario outbreak and Mayers said more may follow.

10 countries still have in place bans on poultry from Canada because of the British Columbia outbreak, which began in December 2014. Mayers said quarantines have been lifted on all the farms that were affected in that outbreak in the Fraser Valley. But while it appears to be over, Canada had not yet been declared bird-flu free -- and now won't be until the Ontario outbreak is extinguished.

The outbreak is on an unidentified turkey farm near Woodstock, Ont. Updated numbers for that operation released by CFIA indicate that more than 10 000 birds have died so far. The remaining 34 000 turkeys will be humanely euthanized in an effort to arrest spread of the virus, Mayers said.

CFIA has quarantined that farm and 8 others which are close by or are deemed at high risk of spread because of contact between the operations. But to date the virus has only been detected on the 1 farm.

The virus is a new hybrid, containing the hemagglutinin gene -- the H in a flu virus's name -- from an H5N1 virus that has been decimating poultry flocks in Asia since late 2003. The H5N2 virus has a neuraminidase -- the N in a flu virus's name -- that is found in wild birds in North America.

The arrival of a virus containing the Asian H5 gene -- first spotted in December 2014 -- was a surprise. Years of wild bird surveillance suggested there was no mingling of flu viruses between the Eurasian bird flyways and those of the Americas.

"These highly pathogenic viruses never crossed the big oceans before," said Dr. Ruben Donis, associate director for policy evaluation and preparedness in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's influenza division. "This kind of intercontinental transmission of highly pathogenic viruses, this is unprecedented."

This H5N2 virus has not yet been seen to have infected people. H5N1 viruses have; the World Health Organization says 784 people in 16 countries are known to have been infected since 2003 and 429 of them have died.

But all H5N1 viruses are not identical; they are a family of viruses. And the branch this particular H5 belongs to has not often infected people in Asia, Donis said.

However, the virus appears to be well adapted to wild birds. Donis said the virus's spread across North America has traversed the wild bird flyways. First seen in the Pacific flyway -- British Columbia, Oregon, Washington and Idaho -- it then moved into the Central and Mississippi flyways. Ontario is in the Mississippi flyway.

The virus has not yet been spotted in the Atlantic flyway.

[Given the rapid movement of this virus, in the various flyways, we can only hope that the mingling of wild birds does not infect the Atlantic flyway, and thus continue a broader spread of this virus. And hopefully this strain will not spread to swine or to human beings. - Mod.TG
