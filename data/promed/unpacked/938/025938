Goel et al [1] report a death from transfusion-transmitted anaplasmosis in a 78-year-old man. The patient died of septic shock 2 weeks after a perioperative transfusion with erythrocytes harboring _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_. The patient's blood specimens were positive for _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA beginning 7 days after transfusion; serologic testing remained negative until death.

[ProMED-mail thanks Greg Folkers for the case report of transfusion-associated anaplasmosis.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ are found in the blood stream and can survive in refrigerated blood, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission through blood transfusion (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57: 1145-8. October 2008 [date cited] Available from human granulocytic anaplasmosis human granulocytic anaplasmosis http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm). - Mod.ML
