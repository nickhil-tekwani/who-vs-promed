A tick-borne illness is becoming more prevalent in Rensselaer County [New York State]. NewsChannel 13 reported that 8 cases of anaplasmosis were reported Friday morning [7 Jul 2017] alone, and more than 100 cases have been reported in the county since May [2017]. In June [2017], the Rensselaer County health department issued an alert about the bacterial infection.

Symptoms of the disease include headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and weakness. Some individuals may experience confusion, nausea, vomiting and joint pain. Symptoms appear one to 2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick.

U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, is calling on Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to update the country on efforts to establish a Tick-Born Disease Working Group. Blumenthal says it's required by the 21st Century Cures Act.
