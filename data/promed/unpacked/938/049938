A team of professionals from the National Institute of Health Laboratories (Inlasa) and the National Center for Tropical Diseases (Cenetrop) arrived in the city of Villa Montes to assess the possible outbreak of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease spread by the bite of an infected mosquito.

The person in charge of the Health Unit of the Regional Government of Villa Montes, Agustín Quispe, explained that the arrival of these professionals is due to the fact that apparently 2 cases have been registered in this municipality. He stressed that they will be present doing fieldwork and socialization until Friday [28 Jan 2022].

Quispe stated that together with a health brigade they will be touring the area where these cases have been detected. He added that this fieldwork will be done in the surroundings and inside the house where the suspected cases live.

"The objective of these tasks is to confirm or rule out cases of leishmaniasis, in order to subsequently take the measures and recommendations made by Inlasa and Cenetrop professionals," he said.

The official acknowledged that this disease is "rare" in Villa Montes, since there are usually 1 or 2 reports a year. He stressed that this disease has previously been reported in Bermejo, but not in Villa Montes, so it would be the first time.

"We as a Health Unit are looking to collaborate with all the logistics, both in human resources, means of transportation, we are providing everything necessary so that this team can carry out its work in the best conditions," Quispe emphasized.

Juan Sergio Mollinedo et al. Leishmaniasis en Bolivia. Comprehensive review and current status in Tarija, at the border with Argentina. Biomedica 2020;40(Supl. 1):45-61. doi: https://doi.org/10.7705/biomedica.4990 (In Spanish).

The study found that: "In the department of Tarija in the Bolivian-Argentine border, human cases with ulcers on uncovered parts of the skin plus clinical and epidemiological characteristics related to leishmaniasis were reported for the first time in 1997. This is a longitudinal study from 1997 to 2018 in humans, as well as captures of Phlebotominae and potential reservoirs. Results: A total of 1250 patients were registered; increasing from 190 (1998) to 249 cases (2002) and 51 patients/584 (8.7%) had mucosal lesions. _Leishmania braziliensis_ was isolated and characterized from mucous ulcers of sick dogs. The initial 1997 leishmaniosis presence in the municipality of Bermejo had spread out over 4 municipalities in 2018 (Padcaya, Caraparí, Entre Ríos, and Yacuiba), northeast of the department of Tarija". - Mod.EP
