Soybean rust was positively identified for the 1st time this week in
Nebraska. It was detected in a south eastern Nebraska soybean field.
Identification was confirmed at UNL's [University of Nebraska-Lincoln]
Plant and Pest Diagnostic Clinic and the National Plant Diagnostic Network
regional lab at Kansas State University Friday (5 Oct 2007). The disease
was found on soybeans in south eastern Richardson County near the town of
Rulo and in Otoe County south of Nebraska City. Leaf samples were collected
from scouting activity by Seth Watson, UNL soybean rust sentinel plot
coordinator, on 3 Oct 3 2007.
Samples of hundreds of leaves were collected as part of scouting activity
with the national soybean rust sentinel plot system. The sentinel plot
system is funded by the Soybean Checkoff program and the US Department of
Agriculture. "As we are late in the season and many of our identified
sentinel plots are mature at this time, leaf samples were being collected
from fields with green leaves remaining starting on Monday [8 Oct 2007] of
this week," said Loren Giesler, UNL Extension plant pathologist. "Based on
where other reports of soybean rust had been confirmed in southern Kansas
and near Des Moines, Iowa, we thought it should be here."
Giesler said the find is not unexpected as the disease has been found in
many states this year [2007] and has been moving north from its
overwintering location in the Gulf States and spread into Texas earlier
this summer. Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources faculty and
staff are working to determine if other fields in the state also have rust.
"Fortunately for soybean producers this year, the disease is showing up too
late for any impact on yield, and management will not be needed," Giesler said.
Further finds on the distribution and severity of rust occurrence this year
[2007] will greatly help forecasting and modeling research, which is
ongoing. "This demonstrates the ability of the fungus to move northward,
and had it occurred earlier in the year a totally different scenario could
have developed," he said. Updates on where soybean rust has been confirmed
in Nebraska and other parts of the US can be found on the USDA [US
Department of Agriculture] soybean rust website at <http://sbrusa.net>.
"As mentioned, no management will be needed this year [2007] for soybean
rust in Nebraska, but growers should continue to stay aware of where
soybean rust is being found in future years," Giesler said. "Each year the
disease has spread north and west earlier, and this year we have observed a
totally different distribution compared to last year [2006]. No rust was
observed in the western soybean states in the Great Plains area last year
compared to this year, and this year we are seeing movement north further
west than last year's movement up the Mississippi Delta into Ohio."
If rust arrives earlier in the season in future years, management options
will include fungicide application, but once the crop reaches the R6 growth
stage (full berry stage), the impact of soybean rust is minimal and most
fungicides cannot be applied based on the minimum pre-harvest intervals.

Arrival of the soybean rust fungus into the top soybean-producing states of
Iowa and Illinois will not hurt yields in 2007, but US plant pathologists
and the industry urged growers on Wednesday [3 Oct 2007] not to become
complacent.
Soybean rust, which can slash yields by up to 80 per cent on untreated
fields, was found last week [24-30 Sep 2007] in central Iowa, southern
Illinois, and parts of Missouri. State officials said those cased posed no
risk to this year's [2007] harvest. This year the fungus has been found in
157 counties in 14 states, up from 88 counties in 8 states at this time
last year [2006]. The greatest concentration has been in eastern Oklahoma,
eastern Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, south western Alabama, and the Florida
panhandle.
"The disease we are seeing in the Midwest is unlikely to cause any yield
loss at all because those plants are so far along," said John Rupe, a plant
pathologist at the University of Arkansas. Once soybeans reach the R6 stage
and have developed full seeds, he added, "I don't think people have to
worry about it." The Agriculture Department said on Monday [1 Oct 2007]
that 29 per cent of the US soybean crop had been harvested, with Illinois
and Iowa ahead of the national average with 43 per cent and 35 per cent,
respectively.
Plant pathologists and soybean growers cited three keys to determining
whether soybean rust will affect the Midwest and how severe it will be: if
there is good over winter survival in the South, if weather allows the
fungus to build up and spread in the 1st part of the growing season, and if
the right weather conditions exist in the Midwest.
Greg Tylka, a plant pathologist at Iowa State University, who helps monitor
more than 20 sentinel plots and 40 soybean fields for the fungus, said
soybean rust spores make it to his state throughout the growing season, but
the right weather conditions have not been present to allow the disease to
develop early in the year. "You could have a lot of spores show up and if
you don't have the right moisture and temperature conditions the disease
isn't going to develop," said Tylka. "It just takes the right series of
events."
Soybean rust thrives under cloudy, warm, humid, and moist conditions. The
1st case of soybean rust was detected in the US mainland late in the 2004
growing season. Experts suspect Hurricane Ivan blew soybean rust spores
from South America. An outbreak one year does not mean major problems the
next, since spores that blow into the Midwest die from the cold in the
winter. Soybean rust can only survive in southern Florida or possibly the
Gulf Coast. Over the past 2 years, few hurricanes have hit the United
States hard enough to push the fungus north early in the season when the
crop is most susceptible to yield loss.
"We were lucky to once again escape a major outbreak in the larger
production areas in the Midwest," said Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the
American Soybean Association. Still, he urged soybean growers to remain
vigilant and learn more about the disease "because next year [2008] could
be a whole different ballgame."

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902 as the
cause of soybean rust. It can cause premature defoliation, with yield
losses of up to 70 per cent reported on farms in Asia. It is widespread in
Asia and Africa, but data are lacking concerning its establishment in
Europe. The 1st detection of _P. pachyrhizi_ in the New World was in
Paraguay in 2001, and it was introduced into the USA in 2004. It has a wide
host range unusual for rust fungi, and besides soybean, a number of other
species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can also be affected. Weed species, for
example kudzu (Japanese arrowroot, _Pueraria lobata_) can serve as pathogen
reservoirs, and spores are spread by wind over long distances. New strains
of _P. pachyrhizi_ with increased virulence are emerging. Fungicides may be
used in disease management and partially resistant soybean lines are available.
The system of soybean growth stages divides plant development into
vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) stages. The vegetative stages are
numbered according to how many fully developed trifoliate leaves are
present. The reproductive (R) stages begin at flowering and include pod
development, seed development, and plant maturation. The stages can overlap.
