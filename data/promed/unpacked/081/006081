The CDC has received reports of fraudulent emails (phishing)
referencing a "CDC sponsored State Vaccination Program for H1N1". The
messages request that users create a personal H1N1 (swine flu)
Vaccination Profile on the CDC.gov web site. An example of the
phishing email is reproduced below:

"You have received this e-mail because of the launching of State
Vaccination H1N1 Program.

You need to create your personal H1N1 (swine flu) vaccination profile
on the cdc.gov web-site. The Vaccination is not obligatory but every
person that has reached the age of 18 has to have his personal
Vaccination Profile on the cdc.gov site. This profile has to be
created both for the vaccinated people and the non-vaccinated ones.
This profile is used for the registering system of vaccinated and
non-vaccinated people. Create your personal H1N1 Vaccination Profile
using the link [deleted]."

Users who click on the embedded link in the above email are at risk of
having malicious code installed on their system. CDC reminds users to
take the following steps to reduce the risk of being a victim of a
phishing attack:

- Do not open or respond to unsolicited email messages.
- Do not click links embedded in emails from unknown senders.*[see below]
- Use caution when entering personal information online.
- Update anti-virus, spyware, firewall, and anti-spam software regularly.

[* or even known ones. Spammers pick up entire address books, so you
may get a phish purportedly from someone in your book. I even got a
spam allegedly from myself once! I always reply to sender asking them
to confirm it was really them who sent an unexpected attachment. -
