SARS cases linked to Beijing death
----------------------------------
Two laboratory workers in Beijing suffered SARS-like illnesses in Feb 2004
that were not detected until an outbreak traced to the same facility 2
months later killed one person, the World Health Organization said today.
WHO called on China and other governments to tighten rules on handling the
SARS virus after Chinese investigators on Thursday said sloppy work at the
Beijing laboratory was to blame for the April outbreak that sickened 9
people. The 2 workers who fell ill in February recovered and went back to
work, said Roy Wadia, a WHO spokesman in Beijing. He said they weren't
detected until they tested positive for SARS antibodies when hundreds of
lab workers were screened following the April outbreak.
Doctors couldn't confirm whether the two had SARS because too much time had
passed since their illness, Wadia said. "The fact that these cases weren't
found sooner suggests that the detection system isn't fully in place
throughout the Chinese health system," said Wadia. He said one of the ill
workers oversaw the inactivation of the virus, which should have made her
"a prime suspect" for SARS. "It seems that the right questions weren't
asked," he said. On Thursday, China said the chief of its disease-control
agency had resigned to take responsibility for the outbreak traced to the
National Institute of Virology, which is run by his agency.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome emerged in the southern Chinese province
of Guangdong in late 2002 and killed 349 people on China's mainland and 774
worldwide before subsiding last June. During that outbreak, Chinese leaders
were widely criticized for failing to release information promptly and
respond to foreign pleas for cooperation.
In the April outbreak, 2 people working at a Beijing virus institute are
believed to have contracted SARS and spread it to 7 people outside the lab.
The mother of one lab worker died. China quarantined more than 500 people
following the outbreak and ordered hospitals and universities to hand over
virus samples to secure government laboratories for storage. The Chinese
government informed WHO of the February cases in May, Wadia said.
A statement Friday by WHO called on other governments to reduce the number
of laboratories handling the virus and to watch the health of lab workers
closely. "WHO believes that member states should carefully review biosafety
standards and strengthen them to avoid further incidents," Dr Shigeru Omi,
WHO's regional director, said in the statement.

WHO urges laboratory safety reviews for SARS
--------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization urged countries on Friday to review safety in
laboratories after finding that this year's outbreak of SARS probably
originated in China's National Institute of Virology in Beijing. WHO said
at least 4 laboratory workers may have been infected with severe acute
respiratory syndrome [virus] at the institute at the start of an outbreak
in March that killed one person and infected 9 others.
"In light of the investigation, WHO believes that member states should
carefully review biosafety standards and strengthen them to avoid further
incidents," Shigeru Omi, regional director of WHO's western Pacific region,
said in a statement. WHO said an inactive SARS virus was used several times
in early 2004 in experiments at the Beijing laboratory when the 4 workers
were present. China's Health Ministry said on Thursday that the outbreak
originated in the laboratory.
WHO said it would work with countries to develop strategies to strengthen
safety, including the reduction of laboratories storing and working on
SARS. It also said scientists working with highly pathogenic viruses such
as SARS needed to handle inactive material with the utmost caution.
"Disease detection systems need to be designed to take these risk factors,
as well as clinical information, into account, and to be robust enough to
ensure that nobody slips through the net and evades detection," it said.
SARS first emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread around the
world to infect 8000 people in nearly 30 countries, devastating the airline
and tourism industries. Nearly 800 people died. China, hardest-hit after
hiding the extent of the disease in the early stages, declared victory over
that outbreak in July 2003. WHO declared 2004's outbreak contained in May.

Results of investigation into lab-linked SARS outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
As part of the investigation into the background of the SARS outbreak in
Beijing and Anhui, the Medical Department established an investigation
group made up of 7 representatives from the Military Medical Science
Academy, The Beijing Centers for Disease Control, and the China (national)
Center for Disease Control. A WHO expert also took part in the
investigation. Results of the investigation are as follows:
1. The epidemic was associated with transmission in the laboratory. (1)
There were 2 identified index cases who worked in the same laboratory. (2)
The laboratory where they worked has been continuously involved in
scientific research related to the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
After access to the viral institute was blocked, there were no additional
cases of SARS. Analysis of a chest fluid sample from the mother of the
index case residing in Anhui, a 2nd-generation case, identified a SARS-CoV
(HT-SCoV-2) with a gene sequence consistent with that studied in the
laboratory [? machine translation awkward here - Mod.MPP] (4) the 2 index
cases working in the laboratory did not report wild animal contact and (5)
did not have known contact with other SARS cases during the incubation
period prior to illness and (6) there was a 15-day period between their
contact in the laboratory and onset of illness [suggesting their infections
were independent of contact with each other - Mod.MPP].
2. The virus that had been studied in the room in which the index cases
worked was a virus from the diarrhea virus laboratory. (1) Both index cases
associated with the laboratory came from the diarrhea virus room. In
addition 2 other people in this room were positive for SARS-CoV IgG and IgM
antibodies [laboratory workers at the China CDC were tested serologically.
- Mod.MPP], (2) specimens from the 2nd-generation case [mother of the index
case from Anhui] had gene group sequencing consistent with HT-SCoV under
study in the diarrhea virus room, and (3) a serosurvey conducted on the
entire staff of the Viral Institute found no individuals in other units
within the Institute with evidence of SARS-CoV infection.
3. Absence of observance of level 3 safety requirements were associated
with the SARS epidemic. (1) the 2 index cases associated with the
laboratory did not observe level 3 laboratory safety (2). Even though the
diarrhea laboratory requires level 3 safety procedures, work on blood
immune serum was conducted by the 2 cases was conducted [? without
observing level 3 standards -- difficult machine translation here] (3). The
diarrhea virus laboratory is a designated level 3 laboratory and is
equipped with appropriate laboratory hardware, and the basic structure of
the laboratory conforms to regulations.
4. Etiology of the laboratory infection link: The [? decontamination after
research on the virus was not thoroughly conducted -- difficult machine
translation here - Mod.MPP]. At the end of the 2004 Spring holidays, no
additional experiments were done on the SARS-CoV in the laboratory during
the period when the 2 index cases in this current outbreak were working in
the laboratory. The method used for decontamination of the laboratory (1
per cent NP40 + PBS + 1 per cent SDS for 60 mins) had not been monitored
[suggesting poor quality control of laboratory procedures -- machine
translation difficult here. - Mod.MPP]
The findings of the investigation recognized that the source of the SARS
outbreak was the laboratory, where safety controls were bad, enforcement of
rules and regulations was lax, and technical personnel did not follow
correct procedures, resulting in a laboratory accident which led to
infection of laboratory staff members.

[The finding of serologic evidence of SARS CoV infection in 2 additional
laboratory personnel working on SARS CoV research in the same laboratory
where the 2 index cases from the April/May 2004 outbreak worked is further
evidence of laboratory exposure as the origin of the outbreak. What is
unclear from the press releases (probably related to difficult
translations) is whether there was direct contact between these 2
additional individuals and the index cases, or whether the exposure was
purely laboratory contamination. The fact that both of the other
individuals with serologic evidence of recent SARS CoV infection had
illnesses compatible with SARS back in February makes the latter hypothesis
-- laboratory exposure -- more likely. We hope an official translation of
the findings of the investigation will be available soon. - Mod.MPP]
