The number of people infected with a strain of _E. coli_ rose to 57 in Ansan, while the source of the bacteria is still unknown, health authorities said Sat 27 Jun 2020.

Health authorities have widened a probe into the _E. coli_ outbreak in the city, about 50 km south of Seoul, since a kindergarten student in the city showed symptoms of illness on 12 Jun 2020.

The outbreak centered on the kindergarten in Ansan as health authorities collected samples from all 202 students and teachers for clinical analysis. As of Sat 27 Jun 2020 at noon, 111 of them showed symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of _E. coli_ that can cause kidney failure [It is not clear that 111 individuals have HUS, which would be a huge amount of those affected having the complication, but rather 111 have symptoms compatible with enterohemorrhagic _E coli_. - Mod.LL].

The number of patients has been increasing since 4 children complained of stomach pains on 16 Jun 2020. A total of 22 people, including 22 kindergarten students, have been hospitalized after experiencing stomachache and diarrhea.

Health authorities have conducted epidemiological research, suspecting the mass food poisoning may have been caused by lunch provided by the kindergarten. The kindergarten has been ordered to close until the end of this month [June 2020]. They also fined the kindergarten for failing to preserve some food ingredients offered to students in case of a food poisoning outbreak.

[Hemolytic uremic syndrome is sometimes called hamburger disease, related to the 1st recorded outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome linked to, at the time, a rare serotype of _E. coli_ (O157:H7) associated with undercooked hamburgers from a chain restaurant, although these organisms, which O157:H7 is the prototype, can be acquired from other foods or environments from contamination with (usually) bovine faeces.

The specific serotype in these cases is, as yet, not stated.

Most cases of HUS associated with these organisms occur in children and usually in less than 10% of total cases. The number of HUS cases seems a bit higher here, but we need to wait until all the statistics are reported. The use of antimicrobials early in the course can increase the risk of HUS.

Ansan is located in Gyeonggi Province, the most populous province in South Korea. Its name, Gyeonggi, means "the area surrounding the capital" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province). - Mod.LL
