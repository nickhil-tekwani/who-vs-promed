[Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus classified in the family _Arteriviridae_. Only one major serotype of the virus has been identified so far. Equine arteritis virus is found in horse populations in many countries worldwide.

Although infrequently reported in the past, confirmed outbreaks of EVA appear to be on the increase.

The majority of naturally acquired infections with EAV are subclinical. Where present, clinical signs of EVA can vary in range and severity. The disease is characterised principally by fever, depression, anorexia, dependent oedema, especially of the limbs, scrotum, and prepuce in the stallion, conjunctivitis, an urticarial-type skin reaction, abortion and, rarely, a fulminating pneumonia, enteritis or pneumo-enteritis in young foals. Apart from mortality in young foals, the case-fatality rate in outbreaks of EVA is very low. Affected horses almost invariably make complete clinical recoveries. A long-term carrier state can occur in a variable percentage of infected stallions, but not in mares, geldings, or sexually immature colts.

The above and additional information on EVA are available in chapter 2.5.10 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.10_EVA.pdf. - Mod.AS
