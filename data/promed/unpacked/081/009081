Equine influenza - Australia (NSW, QLD) Summary Situation Report
This information is an update on information provided on 7 Sep 2007,
which should be referred to for background information.
1. Key Points
There are a total of 490 infected premises (IPs) - 410 in New South
Wales (NSW) and 80 in Queensland (Qld).
There are 434 dangerous contact premises (DCPs) and 306 suspect
premises (SPs) being assessed.
Confirmed cases remain confined to NSW and QLD.
State-wide horse movement bans remain in place in NSW, Qld and the ACT.
Significant efforts are being made to investigate vaccination options
in case vaccination is required in the future. The Australian
Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) contains Australia's basic
policy approach to vaccination for EI. Vaccination of horses may be
approved under certain circumstances, such as if the disease is
widespread when first detected or if the disease is likely to become
endemic in the general equine population.
Local spread from IPs appears to be a continuing issue.
2. Current Situation
New South Wales
-------------------
43 new IPs have been reported. There are now 410 IPs, 359 DCPs and
195 SPs in NSW.
Current Restricted Areas (RAs) include: Auburn Parramatta Strathfield
and northern parts of Bankstown, Baradine, Brackendale, Brocklehurst,
Broughton (near Gerringong), Bundella, Camden Liverpool, Caroona
(north-west of Quirindi), Centennial Park and Redfern, Coonamble,
Cooyal (north-east of Mudgee), Gulargambone, Gunnedah, Gwydir,
Hornsby, Hunter Valley and Tamworth, Lake Macquarie, Lexington
(Coonamble), Moree Plains, Narrabri, Parkes, Sydney Metropolitan and
its Environs, Wauchope (Oxley Highway) and Wollondilly.
Assessment of Mt Hunter, Cattai and Eastern Creek IP clusters suggest
windborne transmission up to 1.8 km [1.1 miles] under favourable wind
conditions. Proposals for "buffer zones" at Parkes, Mt Hunter and
south west Sydney, and possibly Scone, Central Coast and the Upper
Hunter remain under consideration.
An Order prohibiting all horse sales, shows or events within NSW has
been extended until Monday 17 Sep 2007, when it will be reviewed.
Planning for the placement of sentinel horses to monitor the EI
status at Centennial Park with a view to lifting quarantine measures
is continuing.
Biosecurity guidelines have been provided to farriers in NSW to allow
them to return to work in both Control and Restricted Areas.
Queensland
-------------
Seven new IPs have been reported. There are now 80 IPs in Qld. The
IPs are in/near Warwick, Minden/Rosewood , Brisbane western suburbs,
Tamborine, and Goondiwindi. There are 75 DCPs and 111 SPs.
Planning for the implementation of zones continues in concert with
the NSW proposal for a four zone system. It is aimed to have the same
movement conditions in Queensland and New South Wales.
Other jurisdictions
--------------------
Surveillance activities in all states continue unchanged. EI is a
notifiable disease and suspect cases must be reported to state authorities.
Horses from Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA), Victoria
and Tasmania will be accepted into the Northern Territory. Movement
of horses and equipment from NSW and Queensland into Victoria is
still banned. The ban on importation of horses into Tasmania has been
extended until 15 Sep 2007 and this ban will be reviewed weekly.
Entry of horses into SA and WA is banned until further notice.

[We appreciate Dr. Bernoth's continued and excellent efforts at
keeping us updated on the situation and apologize for the delay in posting.
Australia has not had equine influenza prior to now. Consequently
vaccination was not considered. Now the disease is present and they
are trying to eradicate it. However, with the situation on-going, it
is also appropriate for them to examine the regulatory requirements
for importing the vaccination.
Regulatory hurdles to import a vaccine from another country are not
easy, even in the face of an outbreak. - Mod.TG]
