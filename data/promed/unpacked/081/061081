Nipah/Hendra-like Virus Outbreaks, Western Bangladesh, 2001 and 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
2 outbreaks of encephalitis, both caused by Nipah/Hendra-like
viruses, occurred in separate areas in western Bangladesh in 2001 and
2003. Both outbreaks occurred over brief periods and had high
case-fatality ratios. In contrast to previous experience with Hendra
and Nipah viruses in which no human-to-human transmission had
occurred in Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore, epidemiologic
characteristics of the outbreak in Bangladesh suggested the
possibility of person-to-person transmission. Exposure to animals may
have contributed to disease transmission to humans during the
outbreaks, but nevertheless, the ultimate source of the virus is its
zoonotic reservoir.
Epidemiological Investigation
-----------------------------
Between 26 Apr and 26 May 2001, 9 deaths occurred among people with
febrile illnesses and neurologic symptoms in Chandpur village of
Meherpur district, 17 km from the border with India; 7 deaths
occurred among people within the same family who lived within the
same home or whose homes were adjacent to each other. The mean age
was 40 years (range 32-60 years); 6 were males. During the same time
interval, 18 other residents of the village were reported to have a
similar illness and survived. An investigation led by the Director
General of Health Services (DGHS) in May 2001 was followed by a 2nd
investigation from 26 May to 1 Jun 2001 by a team that included staff
from DGHS, the World Health Organization (WHO), and ICDDR,B. Results
of antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) done at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States
suggested that at least 2 people in the Chandpur outbreak were
infected with Nipah/Hendra-like viruses.
Between 11 and 28 Jan 2003, another outbreak of severe illness
including features of encephalitis was reported affecting at least 17
residents (range 4 to 42 years) of Chalksita and Biljoania villages
(located 45 km northeast of Rajshahi) in Naogaon district; 8 people
died. In February 2003, an investigative team from ICDDR,B and
CDC-Atlanta visited Chandpur to learn more about the scope and risk
factors for the 1st outbreak. Upon concluding studies in Chandpur,
the team visited Naogaon District with the objective of defining the
etiology and scope of the 2nd outbreak. The team collected specimens
of blood from 119 residents of Chandpur and 89 residents of Chalksita
and Biljoania villages who reportedly had been ill and recovered and
those who were contacts (family members, close acquaintances, and
neighbours of cases) of residents who had died, during either of the
outbreaks. Sera were not available from any of the patients who died
during the outbreaks. 4 people from Chandpur had evidence of
antibodies (by ELISA) to Nipah antigen; all 4 had been ill during the
outbreak period and were relatives of patients who died. Similarly,
in Chalksita and Biljoania, 4 residents were found to have antibodies
reactive with Nipah virus antigen; all 4 had been ill and had contact
with patients who died. No health care workers were identified with
illness during the outbreak periods.
A case of Nipah/Hendra-like virus infection was defined as a resident
of one of the villages where the outbreaks occurred who died during
the outbreak periods or who had measurable antibodies to Nipah virus
antigen. A total of 13 cases (including 9 deaths) were identified
from the 1st outbreak and 12 cases (including 8 deaths) were
identified from the 2nd outbreak.
Fever, headache, and altered consciousness were the most common
symptoms. Cases in the Naogaon outbreak were more likely than
non-cases to have had contact with a herd of pigs that had passed
through the villages. In the Meherpur outbreak, cases were more
likely than non-cases to report contact with a cow during the 2 weeks
before illness. Close contact with ill people in the Meherpur
outbreak, including contact with patient secretions, was reported
much more commonly in cases than in non-cases. Sera were collected
from a variety of animals with the goal of identifying the source of
the virus for these outbreaks. Antibodies reactive with Nipah virus
antigens were found in 2 of 44 _Pteropus giganteus_ bats tested,
while none were found in the remaining animals tested, including 2
other species of bats, pigs, rodents, shrews, pigeons, and dogs in
areas near case-households.

Comment and Conclusions
------------------------
Findings of this report suggest that Nipah/Hendra-like viruses were
the etiological agents of both outbreaks. Because diagnoses were
dependent on serologic tests in both outbreaks, the precise
etiological agent is not known and may be due to a pathogen that
cross-reacts with Nipah virus antigens in antibody assays. Hendra and
Nipah virus-associated illness was first recognized during outbreaks
in Australia in 1994 and an epidemic in Malaysia and Singapore in
1998-1999. A total of 105 of 276 patients with laboratory-confirmed
Nipah virus in Malaysia and Singapore died with viral encephalitis.
Close contact with sick pigs was highly associated with human
illness, but a few patients had no direct contact with pigs. No
person-to-person transmission was shown. The reservoir for Hendra and
Nipah viruses are bats of the genus _Pteropus_. In Australia, horses
have been the domestic link to human infections, while in Malaysia
and Singapore, pigs were clearly the linking animal host. Antibodies
to Nipah viruses were identified in other animals (dogs, cats, and
horses), but transmission from these animals to humans was not
documented. Subsequent studies in Cambodia have also shown that
evidence of infection (antibodies) with Nipah/Hendra-like viruses can
be found in apparently healthy bats. No cases of human illness due to
Nipah viruses were identified following the mass culling of >1
million pigs in Malaysia.
In contrast to the Australia and the Malaysia/Singapore outbreaks, no
clear source of transmission was identified for either of the
outbreaks in Bangladesh summarized within this report. Because of the
clustering of cases among family members and neighbours, the
secondary peaks of cases following a period of no illnesses, and an
epidemiologic suggestion of increased risk for illness among people
who had exposure to secretions of other sick patients,
person-to-person transmission cannot be ruled out. However, absence
of illness among health care workers creates some uncertainty about
this possibility. Increased risk of illness following exposure to
pigs in one outbreak and a sick cow in the other raise the potential
of animal-to-human transmission, but this possibility cannot be
validated with the limited data available.
Systematic surveillance for encephalitis is not routinely done in
Bangladesh. It is possible that other outbreaks and sporadic cases of
Nipah/Hendra-like virus encephalitis have occurred or will occur.
More information will be needed to define the magnitude of the
problem and to identify strategies to prevent illness and deaths.

[The above paper describes the outcome of investigation of 2 previous
outbreaks of Nipah/Hendra-like virus-associated encephalitis in
Western Bangladesh. The paper is accompanied by figures, tables, and
references, which can be accessed using the above URL. Nipah and
Hendra viruses are related but distinct paramyxoviruses which now
comprise a new genus (_Henipavirus_ ) in the sub-family
_Paramyxovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. These viruses have
molecular characteristics that distinguish them from previously known
paramyxoviruses. It is likely that the virus associated with the
outbreaks of encephalitis in Western Bangladesh is a novel member of
the genus _Henipavirus_, in view of its distinctive epidemiological
characteristics. - Mod.CP]
