On 22 Mar [2021], the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) issued an advisory against Japanese encephalitis throughout the nation, as the 1st _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ -- the vector mosquitoes of Japanese encephalitis -- of the year were identified in Jeju.

Most people who are bitten by the vector mosquitoes carrying the Japanese encephalitis virus are asymptomatic. However, it requires caution, as it can lead to fatal, acute encephalitis in rare cases. There were 7 Japanese encephalitis patients in Korea last year [2020], and one of them passed away.

The _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito is dark brown and has no distinct pattern. There is a wide white band in the middle of the mouth, and the length is about 4.5mm. The population of these mosquitoes starts to increase in southern regions such as Jeju, Busan, and Gyeongnam in June and is soon spread nationwide. They can be observed in Korea until the end of October.

KDCA recommended that children 12 months to 12 years of age be vaccinated. As for adults, vaccination is recommended for those who live near areas with high vector mosquito populations, such as rice paddies or pig farms, or plan to travel to countries with a Japanese encephalitis epidemic.

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency issues an advisory every year when the vector mosquito that carries Japanese encephalitis is 1st identified. The announcements were made on 8 Apr 2019, 26 Mar in 2020, and 22 Mar this year [2021], arriving early each year due to factors such as climate change. KDCA hypothesizes that because the average temperature in Jeju this year is 1.34 degrees higher than the average of previous years, mosquitoes that survived the winter may have started activities earlier, hastening the timing of the Japanese encephalitis advisory.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) mosquito vectors occur in Korea. It is interesting that they have become active earlier since 2019, perhaps due to a warming climate. The JE cases in recent years are not surprising, since South Korea is within the JEV endemic area, and cases occur sporadically there. Although severe JE cases are uncommon, vaccination recommended by the health authorities is prudent since infections can be serious and even fatal. Affected individuals acquire their JE infections in agricultural areas where the mosquito vectors are common and birds that are the reservoir hosts are present and breeding. Transmission of JE virus will continue until the 1st killing frosts of autumn occur. - Mod.TY
