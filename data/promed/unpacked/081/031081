Informed sources who attended the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture, which was chaired by Assistant Secretary-General for Livestock Ali Abu Nuqta in the presence of the President of the Syndicate of Agricultural Engineers and Cattle Breeders in the Al-Dulayl area [20230110.8707716], told Al-Ghad that the results of the tests conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in the laboratories of the University of Science and Technology proved that the virus strain is endemic to Jordan, and it is not coming from abroad.

The sources confirmed to farmers that the vaccine supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture confers protection against this "strain".

Abu Nuqta agreed with the farmers not to license new farms for calves next to cow breeders' farms, and it was also agreed to transfer calf farms near cow breeders' farms, in addition to requiring that new cow farms be granted licenses with 3 new vaccinations instead of 2 vaccines.

[The above complementary information refers to "calf farms"; it may be assumed (pending confirmation from local sources), that this refers to calf fattening farms that keep imported calves, exclusively or mixed with calves from local cattle herds. Such calves, which are imported without being vaccinated prior to being loaded/shipped, are susceptible to infection once introduced into an endemically infected destination. Such a scenario has been recently presented during an interview with Jordan's assistant Secretary-General for Livestock, Ali Abu Nuqta, by national media (https://urlz.fr/koqm, in Arabic; thanks are due to Mod.SF). Abu Nukta insisted the FMD-affected calves were imported from an FMD-free country. A similar situation was observed in Israel/PA in early 2022 when imported, unvaccinated lambs and calves were introduced to a private holding which functioned as a quarantine station (in Mechola), from where they carried the virus to their destined fattening farms (see commentary in archive no. 20220421.8702742).

On the other hand, a scenario of exotic FMD strains being introduced by imported cattle/sheep deserves being excluded. Such a scenario was recently presented and discussed in the paper "Molecular detection and phylogenetic analysis of newly emerging foot-and-mouth disease virus type A, Lineage EURO-SA in Egypt in 2022" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170222002891?via%3Dihub#:~:text=https%3A//doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2022.198960; SA stands for South America).

Serotyping and genotyping results of the samples forwarded to Jordan's veterinary research laboratory in Irbid, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
