Three new farms have been confirmed as being infected with the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ (_M bovis_).

Authorities are working to eradicate the disease after the virus was 1st found in New Zealand in 2017.

A report from MPI said 6 properties have had their Restricted Property (RP) status revoked, including 5 previously categorised as infected.

Four of the revoked Infected Properties (IPs) are in Canterbury and one is in Tasman.

The report said the 3 new infected properties are a beef farm in the Far North, a beef farm in South Canterbury, and a dairy farm in Otago.

Meanwhile, authorities fighting the disease said there is now a much greater understanding in rural communities about the risks of spreading _M. bovis_ and how the presence of the disease affects cattle.

_M. bovis_ can have a devastating impact on farms, causing severe mastitis, arthritis and pneumonia in cows, and can hugely affect the productivity on infected farms.

[_Mycoplasma bovis_ was detected for the 1st time in New Zealand in July 2017. The bacterial disease is harmless to humans and not transmitted through milk or meat but can cause untreatable mastitis, abortion and arthritis in cattle. It is present on both the North and the South Island. However, it would appear, as the Restricted Property status is being revoked in some areas, perhaps there is some positive headway being made? I say perhaps because diseases are funny creatures and have a way of appearing again when least expected. For the sake of the producers and for the sake of the animals, I hope this is positive progress. - Mod.TG
