Nebraska: More than 1000 Horses Confirm ted West Nile Virus-positive
-------------------------------------------------
Officials with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture confirmed Tuesday the
number of horses with West Nile Virus has increased to 1008. Nebraska's
first positive case of West Nile Virus in equines was confirmed in Aug 2002
in Lancaster County. Since then, the numbers have soared across the state.
However, Dr. Delwin Wilmot, Nebraska Deputy State Veterinarian says the
number of cases is beginning to taper as mosquito season winds down. "We're
seeing fewer cases each day," Wilmot said. "Hopefully we have reached our
peak numbers."

Nebraska veterinarians are looking for some answers as to why horses across
the state are being plagued by West Nile virus this year. The Nebraska
Department of Agriculture is assisting with a cooperative study between the
University of Nebraska's Veterinary Diagnostic Center and Colorado State
University (CSU). Veterinary students from CSU are now conducting phone
interviews with horse owners who had animals confirmed with the disease
this year. "The purpose is to obtain important information that might be
used to help determine the outcome of horses with West Nile Virus and to
track the disease and prevent other horses from being affected in the
future," Wilmot said.

As of Fri 11 Oct 2002, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arthropod Borne
Viruses - Western Hemisphere, at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), has reported 2946 human cases of West Nile virus
infection, with 160 deaths occurring in 35 states and the District of Columbia.

During 2002, West Nile virus activity (evidence of infections in birds,
humans, mosquitoes, and other animals, primarily horses) has been
documented in 43 states and the District of Columbia (see previous report:

Texas: Unconfirmed Report of Fifth Death of Texas Resident
----------------------------------------------------------
A Randall County resident diagnosed last week with the West Nile virus
infection has become the first person in the Panhandle to die of the
mosquito-borne disease, a spokeswoman with the city of Amarillo Department
of Public Health said on Mon 13 Oct 2002. Amarillo television station KAMR
reported that the man died on the night of Sun 12 Oct 2002. night. Health
officials say it was the only human case of West Nile in Potter and Randall
counties. Doug McBride, a spokesman at the Texas Department of Health, said
he could not confirm the death. He said the official number of deaths from
the virus remained at 5, including 4 deaths in Harris County and one in
Tarrant County.

New York State: Death of Immunosuppressed Patient from Ohio
------------------------------------------------
An Ohio man visiting his family in upstate New York has died from a West
Nile virus infection that he apparently contracted at home, health
officials said. The 62-year-old patient, a retired firefighter from
Findlay, Ohio and a native of Auburn, came to New York on 27 Sep 2002 to
visit family. He was taken to the St. Joseph's emergency room that day for
treatment of flu-like symptoms. He refused a recommended admittance to the
hospital then, according to Onondaga County Health Commissioner Lloyd
Novick. "We just thought he was coming down with the flu at the time," his
wife of 43 years, told The Post-Standard of Syracuse in Tuesday editions.

The patient returned to the hospital on 2 Oct 2002 with much worse symptoms
and died on Saturday at St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, Novick said.
The patient had received a second kidney transplant previously on 13 Aug
2002. Novick said a weakened immune system associated with anti-rejection
drugs given to transplant patients may have contributed to his
susceptibility to the West Nile virus. Novick said a 1-2 week incubation
period for the virus means that the patient had been infected before he
came to central New York.

Ohio has had the third highest number of confirmed cases of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus infections and the third highest number of
deaths this year from the virus in the United States, according to
statistics by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have
been 341 cases and 14 deaths in Ohio. Nationally, there have been 2946
cases and 160 deaths. In New York, there have been 63 cases and 6 deaths.
Novick said 3 central New York residents have become ill from the virus and
all are recovering. The threat from the virus is nearly over this year
because cold weather kills mosquitoes, he said.

Louisiana: 4 Dogs Positive for West Nile Virus Antibodies
-------------------------------------------------
We would like to report to you [Louisiana veterinarians and others] that
the Louisiana Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (LVMDL) and the
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) has identified 4 dogs that
tested positive for antibodies to West Nile virus using the viral
neutralization assay, and thus indicating exposure to the virus. Also this
group of dogs had clinical signs that include high fever (104.0 - 105.30
F), signs described varied, but included: "like a typical poisoned dog",
"hyperesthetic", "polymyositis-like", "extremely painful", "unable to stand
or walk". Improvement was seen with various treatments. However, 2 dogs
died after being sent home.

The dogs vary in breeds, age, and sex. The dogs resided in East Baton
Rouge Parish, East Feliciana Parish, and Rapides Parish; 2 dogs had been
around horses and mosquitoes and one ate a dead bird. If you are presented
with a neurological case, please consider West Nile Virus as a
differential. To further understand the clinical significance of West Nile
virus in dogs, additional work up on such a case should include sending in
whole blood and/or CSF for viral isolation and PCR. Please consider
sending in the body of the dog for necropsy if the dog is euthanized or
dies. All of this can be performed at LVMDL.
