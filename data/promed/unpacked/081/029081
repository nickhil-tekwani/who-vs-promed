Continued high levels of parvovirus B19 activity in England
-------------------------------------------------
In June 2012 we provided some background information on parvovirus B19 and reported on increased activity observed in the first 5 months of that year. This news report updates on the current situation in England only with the seasonal drop in confirmed cases in winter, but then high levels of activity still being observed to the end of May 2013. Whilst the previous news report was based on confirmed infections reported to Labbase only, this update has been extended to also include reconciled PCR [polymerase chain reaction]-positive samples submitted to the PHE Virus Reference Department at Colindale.

Parvovirus B19 is not a notifiable disease and testing practice is likely to vary around the country: with the exception of women presenting with a rash illness in pregnancy, there is no recommendation for routine testing for parvovirus B19. Testing continues to be largely biased towards pregnant women due to this recommendation which is based on the potential serious consequences to the fetus and the demonstration that the complications of in-utero infection can be successfully treated with fetal transfusion. Thus cases of parvovirus B19 in pregnant women have been seen to dominate total confirmed infections accounting for approximately 60 percent of cases in the time period shown.

With the proviso regarding variability in testing practice, confirmed parvovirus B19 cases were relatively high in 2012 peaking the 2nd quarter and following a similar pattern to that observed in 2008. Parvovirus B19 activity has followed a similar pattern of increase in 2013 to date with a rise in confirmed cases observed in March [2013] and sustained through to May [2013]. This period of increased activity (between January 2012 and May 2013) has been widespread across England (see table).

Parvovirus B19 causes the common childhood illness, erythema infectiosum or 5th disease -- widely known as "slapped cheek" due to the typical presentation of erythematous cheeks [redness or rash on the cheeks] which, together with rash and fever, are characteristic of this disease. Accurate diagnosis on a clinical basis can be difficult, however, and parvovirus B19 infection cannot be clearly differentiated from other infections such as rubella. Infection in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is associated with increased risk of intrauterine death and hydrops fetalis. In most individuals infection presents as a mild febrile illness, whilst in patients with increased red blood cell turnover (i.e., underlying haemolytic haemoglobulinopathies such as sickle cell disease) infection can lead to transient aplastic crisis, and in patients who are immunocompromised infection may lead to pure red cell aplasia and chronic anaemia. Both these groups of patients have high level viraemia and should be considered infectious. For these reasons, the current increased parvovirus B19 activity in England and Wales warrants increased vigilance by clinicians and awareness of relevant available guidance on diagnosis and management of the infection especially in hospitalised patients.

Whilst the 2nd quarter is usually the seasonal peak in parvovirus B19 infection levels, relatively high numbers of cases continue to be reported in 2013. This news item is therefore intended to draw attention to the current increased parvovirus B19 activity and to highlight available NHS [National Health Service] Clinical Knowledge Summaries [2] and HPA [Health Protection Agency] guidelines for managing the infection in healthcare settings and the community [1] and in pregnancy [3].
