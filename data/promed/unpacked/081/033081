Natural occurrence of a begomovirus on Pigeonpea in India

Pigeonpea (_Cajanus cajan_.; family _Fabaceae_) is an important pulse crop
in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar for dietary
protein requirements. The disease occurs in most pigeonpea-growing areas at
a low incidence. Symptoms of the disease consist of yellow mosaic,
mottling, shortening of leaves and stunting. The association of a
geminivirus with the disease was suspected due to the presence of the
whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt] on the plants. In transmission tests, Bt
successfully transmitted the virus from infected plants to pigeonpea
seedlings, inducing typical disease symptoms. Mechanical inoculations
failed to transmit the disease to pigeonpea.
To confirm the association of begomovirus with the disease, PCR was
performed using total DNA isolated from infected plants and 2 pairs of
broad-spectrum begomovirus-detecting primers (Deng et al., 1994; Hallan,
1998). The PCR products obtained were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Amplicons of the expected size (around 500 bp and 800 bp,
respectively) were produced from samples with symptoms, but not from those
without. In Southern hybridization experiments, with a probe generated from
the cloned coat protein region of the begomovirus Tomato leaf curl New
Delhi virus (ToLCNDV; Hallan, 1998), the PCR products hybridized strongly
under high-stringency washing conditions.
The PCR product obtained using the Hallan primers was sequenced (Acc. No.
AY927997). In alignments, the highest nucleotide sequence identities (95-97
percent) were with ToLCNDV-[Solanum] (AJ620187); a ToLCNDV isolated from
Luffa (AY309957); ToLCNDV-Mild (U15016); ToLCNDV-[Lucknow] (Y16421);
Pumpkin yellow vein mosaic virus (AY184487); and _Cucurbita maxima_ yellow
mosaic virus (AY396151). Based on these findings, the virus associated with
the disease was tentatively identified as an isolate of ToLCNDV.
This is the 1st report of the occurrence of a begomovirus on pigeonpea from
India.

[There are 7 ToLCNDV isolates that have been reported from India and 2 from
Thailand. Recombination or pseudo-recombination are driving forces in the
evolution of new begomoviruses, especially in tropical regions. Disease
management of ToLCNDV depends in part on preventing movement of Bt-infested
plants (e.g.. tomato transplants) to virus-free areas. Various control
options include removal of infected plants (roguing), removal or burial of
infected crop residues and intercropping in combination with chemical
insecticides and the use of available resistant cultivars. Use of plastic
UV-absorbing screening material to exclude Bt is another method. Genetic
resistance to begomoviruses has been reported in some wild _Lycopersicon_
species such as _L. hirsutum_ and _L. peruvianum_, which might be
transferred to tomato. In Pakistan, resistance to leaf curl virus has been
incorporated into tomato and chili cultivars.
