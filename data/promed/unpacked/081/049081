Thirteen additional MERS-CoV cases confirmed
--------------------------------------------
- 10 out of 13 cases presumed to be from Samsung Medical Center; patients no. 90 and 76 confirmed dead.

- MoH MERS-CoV Task Force announced on [Wed 10 Jun 2015] 13 additional confirmed cases of MERS-CoV

- 10 of the newly confirmed 13 cases are presumed to be related to patient no. 14, and exposed to the virus at Samsung Medical Center ED between 27-28 May 2015, after exhibiting flu-like symptoms.

- The remaining 3 patients are presumed to be sporadic infections from various different medical institutions;

- 2 out of the 3 are presumed to be related to patient no. 16, and both come in contact with the virus while hospitalized in Konyang University Hospital and Daecheong Hospital respectively;

- The remaining patient is presumed be in relation to patient no. 16, having come in contact with the virus at Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital ward sometime between 29-31 May 2015;

- The Task Force has also announced that on 8 Jun 2015, patient no. 98 -- also infected at Samsung Medical Center -- was transferred from Mediheal Hospital after having received treatment from 3-7 Jun 2015, to Ewha Womans University Medical Center;

- Mediheal Hospital is currently undergoing investigations to determine whether any further patients have come in contact during patient no. 98 at admission, and are taking necessary precautions for possible quarantine;

- The faculty at Ewha Womans University Medical Center have also revealed that patient no. 98 arrived at the medical institution wearing a protective mask, and assured that all medical staff involved were wearing proper personal protection equipment upon receiving the patient;

- Additionally, on 8 Jun 2015 it was revealed that patient no. 105 (also from Samsung Medical Center) was admitted to Seoul St Mary's Hospital ED [emergency department];

- According to Seoul St Mary's Hospital, the patient arrived on the premises wearing protective mask and gloves, and was greeted by faculty who were also donning appropriate personal protective equipment. Upon the patient's arrival to the medical center, he was promptly transported to the temporary MERS clinical ward outside of the main hospital grounds, and into a negative pressure clean room, thus minimizing exposure and contact with other hospital patients and faculty;

- The Task Force has also divulged details about the 2 additional fatalities (8th and 9th respectively):

- The 8th fatality is confirmed to be patient no. 90 (62-year-old male) who had a history of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, and died while receiving isolation treatment at Eulji University Hospital ICU;

- The 9th fatality is confirmed to be patient no. 75 (75-year-old female) who had a history of multiple myeloma, and died at Konkuk University Hospital ICU while receiving treatment for respiratory distress;

- Both the 8th and 9th fatalities are confirmed to have contracted the virus at Samsung Medical Center ED;

- Regarding the confirmed cases from Samsung Medical Center:

- The Task Force has announced that its key focus will be the containment and the limiting of the spread of MERS-CoV to other patients within the Samsung Medical Center or to other medical institutions;

- The Task Force has also asked -- as it had been the case for Ewha Womans University Medical Center, Seoul St Mary's Hospital -- for the cooperation and trust of not only the government, but the entire nation, in preventing any further proliferation of the virus.

[With the announcement of these 13 newly confirmed cases and 2 fatalities, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by South Korea is now 108 including 9 deaths. The information provided on the fatalities demonstrates that, to date, they all had pre-existing serious co-morbidities prior to the onset of MERS-CoV infection related illness. As this outbreak is nosocomial, the majority of cases involved in it are individuals who were admitted to the hospital or treated in the hospital emergency department for an underlying disease that would pre-dispose to severe disease when infected with the MERS-CoV. Patient no. 14 and patient no. 16 continue to have been the source of 3rd generation cases consistent with a label of "superspreader".

All hospitals enforce survey of pneumonia patients
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Welfare [MoH MERS-CoV Task Force] and the [Private and Public Joint Action TF] declared that [10 Jun 2015] would now become [Investigation Day for MERS-Suspected Pneumonia Patients], and they will conduct an investigation of MERS on suspected pneumonia patients all across the country.

The survey is to investigate the pneumonia patients over the age of 15 who may have been exposed to MERS-CoV during infectious period.

The purpose of the survey is to manage unreported patients with MERS and to prevent the virus from spreading across the country.

Once the investigation begins, all hospitalized pneumonia patients are restricted in their mobility and their doctors will closely look after the patient's medical history using patient referral system and patient health questionnaire.

After the examination, those pneumonia patients who are related to the spread of MERS are transferred to single rooms and they will be tested with MERS genetic testing.

We anticipate that these surveys will alert us at the right moment by detecting MERS suspected patients.

[It appears as though the MOH is undertaking a massive endeavor to identify all pneumonia admissions in the country in an effort to identify potential MERS-CoV cases that may be "under the radar" and not being tested for. Given the tremendous movement of patients from one health facility to another, this does not appear to be an unreasonable approach (see section [4] South Korea, other hospitals - media report below). - Mod.MPP]

Did poor ventilation lead to MERS 'superspread' in Korea?
---------------------------------------------------------
How did one patient with the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infect so many others? That is one of the mysteries at the heart of an explosive outbreak of the viral disease in Korea that has so far sickened 41 and killed 4 [now up to 108 cases including 9 deaths]. Now, scientists have a hypothesis at last. According to JongKoo Lee, director of the Seoul National University Hospital and former head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), bad ventilation in one of patient zero's hospital rooms played an important role. The investigation is still ongoing, he cautions. "But that is our tentative conclusion."

The initial patient, a 68-year-old man who had just returned from a business trip to the Middle East, was treated at several clinics before being diagnosed with MERS on 20 May [2015] -- 9 days after he fell ill. He was treated at St Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, a city about 1 hour south of Seoul, from 15 to 17 May [2015]. Most of the people sickened have been tied to the same hospital.

The room in which patient zero stayed was originally meant for 6 people (the standard in Korea), but it had recently been divided, Lee says. It had only one small window that remained closed during the day, and there was no ventilation. An air conditioning unit cycled the air in the room, Lee told ScienceInsider. "The air conditioner is working in this small room with the door closed, so we are speculating that there is a very high density of virus particles in the air." He also says that [MERS-CoV] RNA was detected on the membrane of the room's air conditioning unit.

None of the scientists leading the investigation could be reached for comment, and a spokesperson at KCDC acknowledged only that a "team consisting of experts in various fields is investigating the ventilation system of [that] hospital." Peter Ben Embarek, the point person on MERS at the World Health Organization (WHO), says that he has also been informed about a lack of ventilation in the room. "It's very difficult to draw any conclusions based on what little information we have. We will hopefully get a more detailed picture soon of that part of the investigation."

Bad ventilation alone would hardly explain the catastrophic spread seen in the hospital, says Christian Drosten, a virologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. But if there was bad ventilation plus a patient shedding a greater than usual amount of the virus, it could make a difference. In a study of dozens of MERS patients in intensive care in Saudi Arabia, for example, some had a much higher virus load in their exhaled breath than others, he says. "This must have been such a patient." In combination with the constant circulation of the air in the room, this could help explain the high number of infections, Drosten says.

"A highly infectious case, combined with poor infection control can easily lead to this kind of cluster," says Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. That that combination happened in Seoul was just bad luck, he says. "This could happen just as well in New York or Berlin." But the government in South Korea did botch the initial response, he says. "There was no reason to close those schools, for instance. And distributing patients over many hospitals probably helped the virus spread," he says. "But I think they are starting to get it right."

After refusing for days to name the hospital at the heart of the outbreak, the Korean government finally revealed at a press conference today that 30 of the 41 patients had been infected at St Mary's. The Ministry of Health also asked people to contact a hotline if they had been at the hospital in the 2 weeks after the index patient was admitted. Finding and isolating these people is key to stopping the outbreak, says health minister Moon Hyung-pyo. Already more than 1600 people suspected to have had contact with a sick person have been isolated.

Early today [5 Jun 2015], WHO announced a joint mission with Korea "to gain information and review the situation," including epidemiological patterns, virus characteristics, and clinical features. A team of 7 or 8 scientists led by Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security at WHO, should arrive in Seoul this weekend [6-7 Jun 2015], Ben Embarek says. The mission is expected to last about a week.

Meanwhile, KCDC finished its sequencing of the MERS virus causing the current outbreak and just today [5 Jun 2015] shared it with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A spokesperson says it will release the sequence publicly tomorrow [6 Jun 2015].

[The article above was published last week (5 Jun 2015) but just came to my attention today (9 Jun 2015). There has been much speculation about the culture surrounding the care and management of patients in the hospital environment in South Korea, including large crowded wards/rooms (6 patients to a room) and the lion's share of care provided for the patient is given by family members who spend days and nights caring for their loved ones. There was a sobering discussion on hospital experiences by NY Times readers published today (9 Jun 2015) worth a read to try to understand how there are significant challenges to routine infection control procedures when faced with many persons caring and visiting for patients further crowding the rooms where patients are admitted (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/world/asia/amid-mers-outbreak-readers-reflect-on-south-korean-hospitals.html?_r=0). - Mod.MPP]

MERS spreads to more facilities
-------------------------------
A medical residential facility for senior citizens with fragile health conditions may have been affected by Middle East respiratory syndrome, the Health Ministry said [Tue 9 Jun 2015].

This has raised questions about the government's lack of safety measures for those who are most vulnerable to the virus, especially the elderly with pre-existing health conditions such as lung or kidney disease.

As of [Tue 9 Jun 2015] afternoon, the virus had killed 7 people, infected 95 -- including a pregnant woman and a teenager --, and pushed public health officials to quarantine almost 3000 others.

Also on [Tue 9 Jun 2015], 10 Koreans who had been quarantined in Hong Kong and China since [26 May 2015] were released. They had been isolated after taking the same flight with Korea's 10th confirmed MERS patient from Incheon to Hong Kong on [26 May 2015]. They never showed symptoms during the incubation period and are currently healthy, said the Healthy Ministry. The 10th patient, however, still requires additional treatment in China, authorities said.

As the number of infected patients continued to soar against hopes that the virus will start to abate this week [week of Jun 2015], the 16-member joint mission team from the Korean government and World Health Organization started its investigation [Tue 9 Jun 2015].

"I want to thank the government (of Korea) for being very active in inviting WHO to come and work with your experts," said Dr Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general for health security at WHO.

"We know when new outbreaks of new viruses appear in any country it often causes tremendous amounts of difficulties. So we again congratulate the government for making such strong efforts to deal with the situation."

With the newly confirmed cases, 3 more facilities, including one of the biggest hospitals in the country, have been reported as MERS-affected hospitals.

Health authorities also confirmed that the 94th patient, who was diagnosed on [9 Jun 2015], left the Hallym University Medical Center in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, on [28 May 2015], and moved to a residential medical facility for senior citizens.

It is believed that the 71-year-old was exposed to the virus on [27 May 2015], when the 15th patient stayed at the same hospital.

The 15th patient was diagnosed with MERS on [29 May 2015], a day after the 94th patient had already left the hospital, so the authorities weren't aware of the possibility of infection for the 95th patient.

He was eventually discovered by the Health Ministry and was quarantined at another facility. At the time of being quarantined, he had been asymptomatic, said Jeong Eun-kyung, an official from the Health Ministry. Jeong didn't reveal the name of the residential facility for the elderly.

Concerns have been rising about the government's lack of protective measures for the most vulnerable, especially the elderly with pre-existing health conditions. When asked [Mon 8 Jun 2015] if the Centers for Disease Prevention had any additional plans to help the elderly avoid the virus, Jeong from the agency said it is "unclear whether those who died of MERS in fact died because of the virus or because of their pre-existing medical conditions."

All of the 7 deceased were aged 50 or older, and had been suffering from other diseases prior to their MERS diagnosis, including cancer, kidney and lung conditions.

"I don't think much is being done to protect those who are vulnerable," said a Seoul-based doctor who wanted to remain anonymous.

"I think there should be a special task force team just to prevent the spread of the virus among the elderly, pregnant women, and those with fragile health conditions. They are the ones who need the attention and extra care the most, who need safe access to health services the most."

Seoul also confirmed the 1st MERS case of a pregnant woman [Tue 9 Jun 2015]. The woman in her 40s appeared to have been infected with the virus while briefly staying at an emergency room at the Samsung Medical Center, where the 14th confirmed patient was staying. The woman is due to give birth this month [June 2015] and was staying in the hospital's maternity ward.

However, health officials said the number of new cases may begin to dwindle this week. This week is very crucial to combat the disease," acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said in a meeting with officials over the spread of the virus.

"We will mobilize all available resources and required budget to help tackle the disease as soon as possible."

Another newly confirmed patient on [9 Jun 2015] is a 27-year-old who was infected by the 6th patient while staying at the emergency room of the Asan Medical Center, one of the largest hospitals in the country, in Seoul on [26 May 2015].

The 6th patient, who was diagnosed on [28 May 2015], died on [1 Jun 2015].

The 7th MERS death was confirmed [9 Jun 2015] morning. The deceased was diagnosed with the virus on [6 Jun 2015]. The 68-year-old had a chronic heart disease and was admitted to the Samsung Medical Center's emergency room for dyspnea [shortness of breath] on [27 May 2015], where she was exposed to the 14th patient. Her condition deteriorated following the diagnosis and she died [8 Jun 2015].

In addition, 2 other hospitals were confirmed as MERS-affected facilities. 2 newly confirmed patients, aged 64 and 71, respectively, were infected at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul by the 15th confirmed patient. Meanwhile, a 47-year-old man was infected by the deceased 6th patient -- his father-in-law -- while caring for him at Yeouido St Mary's Hospital on [28 May 2015].

Among the 95 confirmed patients, 3 people have been discharged, while 9 are reported to be unstable.

[This article highlights how the number of hospitals involved in the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea has been increasing exponentially. It does appear as though it is not unusual for patients to go to multiple hospitals seeking medical care, at times in rather diverse geographic areas. Another practice that has increased the likelihood of continued transmission as more individuals are travelling around while infected and shedding virus. - Mod.MPP]

[As can be seen from the details provided, outside of the index case and his wife, all of the other cases are related to nosocomial spread within the healthcare environment involving previously admitted patients and/or their families. All of the fatalities to date had significant serious underlying illnesses that would pre-dispose to more serious illness when infected with the MERS-CoV. These same individuals are at significant risk of severe morbidity and mortality if infected with influenza virus as well.

The global tally according to the WHO update is now 1218 cases including at least 449 deaths. As the number of cases reported by South Korea is now 108 and the number of deaths is now 9, there are an additional 44 cases and 4 deaths from South Korea not yet included in the global tally maintained by WHO, and an additional 9 cases and 1 death reported by Saudi Arabia also not yet included. - Mod.MPP]
