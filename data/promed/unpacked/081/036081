Avian flu disease returns after 8 months
H5N1 virus outbreak confirmed in Phichit
---------------------
The 8-month bird flu-free hiatus in Thailand ended yesterday as the
Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry confirmed a fresh outbreak of
the H5N1 virus in the northern province of Phichit. The confirmation
came shortly after poultry farmers and an outgoing senator accused
the ministry of covering up the re-emergence of the deadly disease
after massive deaths of poultry in many provinces from early this
month [see prior ProMED-mail postings on Undiagnosed deaths, poultry
- Thailand listed below - Mod.MPP].
The ministry had repeatedly denied bird flu had recurred but
eventually verified the outbreak yesterday.
The Livestock Development Department's lab detected the avian flu
virus in a fighting cock carcass from Bang Mun Nak district. This was
where almost 300 fowls had been culled after the mysterious deaths of
around 30 fighting cocks and free-range chickens 2 weeks ago,
caretaker Agriculture Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told a press conference.
Khunying Sudarat, however, tried to ease public concerns over the
detection of the bird flu virus.
''Finding the virus in an area that used to be plagued with the
disease like Bang Mun Nak district is considered to be a common
thing. It would be more frightening if the virus was found in a bird
flu-free zone,'' she said.
Nirundorn Aungtragoolsuk, director of the Livestock Development
Department's Disease Control Bureau insisted that test results had
confirmed the bird flu outbreak late yesterday morning and the
ministry had informed the public right away.
Dr Nirundorn said the virus was unlikely to spread since all fowls in
the infected area had been culled from Saturday [22 Jul 2006].
The department had now employed extreme measures to contain the
outbreak, including imposing a total ban on fowl movements in the
province and sealing borders to prevent smuggling of poultry from
neighbouring countries.
The department had reported the re-emergence of the disease to the
World Organisation for Animal Health and major importers of Thai
cooked chicken.
The area within a 10-km radius of the infected farm had been put
under a 21-day surveillance.
The Public Health Ministry, meanwhile, reported yesterday that an
11-year-old boy from Phichit had been listed as the country's latest
suspected bird flu case.
A blood sample from the boy had been sent for testing. Results were
pending for another 7 suspected cases.

Thailand finds bird flu, testing for H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
A strain of bird flu has been found in chickens in Thailand, and it
may prove to be the deadly H5N1 virus, senior Agriculture Ministry
official Yukol Limlaemthong said on Monday [24 Jul 2006].
"There is a high possibility it is the N1 strain, given that the area
has had outbreaks before," Yukol told Reuters.
Officials said the H5 virus was detected on a farm in the northern
province of Pichit, one of 7 "red zone" provinces where surveillance
was stepped up this month [July 2006], and test results were expected
in a few days.
If H5N1 is confirmed, it would be Thailand's 1st confirmed outbreak
of the virus in nearly 9 months.
Livestock officials culled all chickens in the affected area and
restricted poultry movements within a 10-km (6-mile) radius for at
least 30 days.
The H5N1 virus has killed 14 Thais since it 1st arrived in the
country in late 2003. The last death occurred in December 2005.
An 11-year-old girl was in a Pichit hospital on Monday [24 Jul 2006]
with flu-like symptoms, after chickens died on her family farm, a
doctor told Reuters. Test results are due on Tuesday [25 Jul 2006].
"The chickens started to die on 8 Jul 2006, and she helped her mother
bury the dead chickens without any protective gear," said Sunee
Thirakaroonwongse of the Pichit Provincial Hospital.
Thailand was slow to respond to bird flu when it began ravaging
poultry flocks in late 2003, but it now has one of the strongest
surveillance systems in the region.
However, recent incidents in which villagers have ignored government
warnings and handled dead chickens have raised fears that public
vigilance against the disease is waning.
The global human death toll is now at least 132 since the virus
reemerged in east Asia in 2003.

Thailand bans poultry imports to prevent new bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand has banned poultry imports from neighboring countries to
prevent a new outbreak of bird flu.
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Khunying Sudarat Keyuraphan
said on Monday [24 Jul 2006] that the ministry had ordered a total
ban on importing poultry from any neighboring country to prevent the
outbreak of bird flu.
The ban was imposed after some neighboring countries sent dead fowl
samples for laboratory tests in Thailand and some samples tested
positive for the virus.
Khunying Sudarat affirmed that no outbreak had been reported in areas
where many fowl died of unknown causes, and some weakened and became
vulnerable to bird flu virus. The minister, however, admitted the
presence of bird flu after an absence of nearly a year.
Khunying Sudarat announced that tests conducted on samples of dead
fighting cocks and domestic fowl in Bangmoonnak District of the
northern Phichit Province were positive. The laboratory technicians
have not yet been able to identify which strain it is. The fighting
cocks and domestic fowl sickened and died. The lab test showed that
they died of bird flu after Thailand had not confirmed the presence
of avian influenza for 254 days.
The Department of Livestock Development culled the remaining 260
chickens at the site and banned the movement of poultry within a 10-km radius.
Until now, there has been no report of bird flu patients in the area
where the chickens died.
Avian influenza outbreaks occurred in 14 locations in Phichit in 2004
and 3 locations last year [2005].
Meanwhile, Thailand's public health establishment breathed a
collective sigh of relief Monday [24 Jul 2006] as laboratory tests
confirmed that no new cases of H5N1 bird flu virus have been
transmitted to humans in recent months. [However, a suspected case is
mentioned in the 1st item above. - Mod.AS]
No deaths have occurred since February last year [2005], and no new
human bird flu cases have been found in Thailand over the past year
and a half, a senior Public Health Ministry official confirmed here
Monday [24 Jul 2006].
Director-General of the Department of Disease Control Dr. Thawat
Suntrajarn said, according to laboratory tests, patients who were
previously reported to have bird flu-like symptoms in many provinces
had all been proven to be bird-flu free.
"The patients, including 2 men in Phichit, were all found not having
contracted avian flu, but a strain of human influenza," he told journalists.
Dr. Thawat said, however, that more public health workers would be
sent to Phichit to help control the situation, following an official
report from the Department of Livestock Development that chickens in
Bangmoonnak District were found to have contracted the H5N1 virus.

[Thailand's official alert message to the OIE regarding an outbreak
of HPAI caused by an H5 virus in Bangmulnarg district (Pichit
province), was sent on 24 Jul 2006; see
<http://www.oie.int/Messages/060724THA.htm>.
Reportedly, the outbreak was found during the 2nd active surveillance
program for 2006, in progress since 1 Jun 2006 in high risk areas.
The previous outbreak of HPAI in poultry in Thailand was reported to
the OIE in November 2005.
ProMED-mail has been repeatedly reporting about mortalities in Thai
poultry, allegedly caused by fowl cholera, since 4 Jul 2006. In view
of the doubtful diagnosis, these postings were titled "undiagnosed
deaths," and information was requested, with special reference to
HPAI. The course of the current outbreak seems to be reminiscent of
the history of H5N1 diagnosis/reporting in Thailand in December
2003/January 2004 (see references).
Final confirmation of the causative agent by a reference laboratory
is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
