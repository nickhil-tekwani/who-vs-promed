[1] Japan comment

We have noticed that there is some misunderstanding and misinterpretation regarding the measles situation in Japan (commentary in the ProMED posted on 29 Oct, Measles update (54): Australia ex Japan, Liberia, Romania, USA SSPE
Archive Number: 20161029.4594189). We would thus like to bring to attention the latest situation of measles in Japan.

While it is true that in the past, Japan was known as a "measles exporter", the situation has considerably changed in recent years. First, since 2008, the proportion vaccinated has greatly increased. Since 2006, a 2-dose routine Measles-Rubella vaccination has been introduced for all pre-school children. In addition, a catch-up campaign was offered for ages 12-13 and 17-18 years from April 2008 to March 2013. From the result of seroprevalance surveys based on the measles PA antibody titer, the antibody-positive (1:16) ratio of people aged over 2 years has been more than 95 percent since 2012 and the number of reported measles cases has dramatically decreased from 86.7 to 1.8 per million people per year from 2008 to 2013.

In addition, measles surveillance has become much more active than what it was in the past, and it changed from a sentinel to a notifiable disease system under the national Infectious Diseases Control Law since 2008. All clinically suspected cases must be reported by physicians (within 24 hours of diagnosis whenever possible); and, whenever possible, samples from suspected cases are collected to make sure that the cases are confirmed based on laboratory test results. Each suspect case is also actively investigated, with active control measures, such as contact tracing, taken when a case is confirmed. Due to these measures, the indigenous strain D5 has not been detected since May 2010, and Japan was verified as achieving measles elimination by WHO on March 2015.

In fact, in 2015, only 35 laboratory confirmed measles cases were reported nationwide, and 15 of them were found to be imported based on both their travel history and genotyping results. This year [2016], we have experienced multiple measles outbreaks, with 155 cases reported as of Oct 26. The majority of index cases are suspected to have been imported cases, as observed similarly in 2014, when 462 cases were reported https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4113659/ (see reference citation below). However, the situation is currently stabilizing, with a decrease in both suspect cases and confirmed cases. Thus, with relatively high MR vaccine coverage, a sensitive surveillance system, and active response measures, Japan is maintaining elimination status.

Further detailed information regarding the measles situation in Japan is available in English in "Measles and Rubella/Congenital Rubella Syndrome in Japan, as of March 2016" http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol37-e/865-iasr/6460-434te.html and "Measles in Japan, as of March 2015" http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-vol36-e/865-iasr/5592-tpc422.html. Please also refer to "Measles in Japan (IDSC)" http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/measles-e/655-idsc/2180-measles-e.html, where the latest updates on the measles situation are available, by week -under "Notified measles cases in Japan (preliminary figures, weekly)"-. In addition, the earlier 2014 situation mentioned above has been described in the paper: "Ongoing increase in measles cases following importations, Japan, March 2014: times of challenge and opportunity. Takahashi T, Arima Y, Kinoshita H et al. Western Pac Surveill Response J. 2014 May 16;5(2):31-3. doi: 10.5365/WPSAR.2014.5.2.001, PMID: 25077035."

We hope the ProMED-mail readership finds this official information from Japan useful and that the correct information on the Japanese measles situation can be shared. We would sincerely appreciate your understanding and posting of the official information above.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sunagawa for the clarification of the current status of measles in Japan - the country now has a relatively high MR vaccine coverage, a sensitive surveillance system, and active response measures, as stated above, and has been considered measles free since March 2015 by the WHO. The commentary in the original report was excerpted from The Japan Times from 2014 reporting on a spike in measles patients that year. Because cases may be imported from other parts of the world with measles activity, it is important to maintain high levels of vaccine coverage even in countries declared measles-free, as Japan is currently doing. - Mod.LK]

West Australians (WA) are being warned about an increased risk of measles after a 2nd person within a week was diagnosed with the illness upon their return from overseas.

The person visited many places throughout Perth's southern and eastern suburbs, and was infectious from 21 to 28 Oct [2016]. WA Health director of communicable diseases Paul Armstrong said staff had been contacting potentially exposed people directly where possible, but it was impossible to identify and specifically warn people in public places.

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness spread when infected people cough and sneeze, and is contagious for about 4 days before and after the development of a rash. "Children and adults who have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if they are not immune," Dr Armstrong said.

A person is immune if they have previously received 2 doses of a vaccine or were born before 1966.

Dr Armstrong said anyone who developed a fever with other symptoms including cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and a rash within 3 weeks of potential exposure to measles should stay home and consult a doctor, but should call ahead and mention their possible contact before visiting a GP or emergency department.
