A press release from the State veterinary and phytosanitary services [Gosvetsluzhba] reports anthrax has been found in cows in the village of Voznesenovka (Melitopol district, Zaporizhia region).

According to the authorities, veterinarians at the Zaporizhia Regional Laboratory of Veterinary Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of anthrax in cows on 18 Aug 2012.

Veterinarians collected the samples for testing on 15 Aug 2012 and treated the location where the carcass was found with disinfectants. But after confirming the diagnosis the veterinarians discovered that the carcass of the cow had disappeared.

A search for the carcass was initiated and involved investigators from the district police and veterinary department. According to Gosvetsluzhba, the owner of the cows sold 150 kg [331 lb] of meat to the private entrepreneur magazine, "Eugene" (Melitopol). According to the owner of "Eugene," he managed to sell 12 kg [26 lb] of meat. The rest was returned to the owner. The sold meat was partially recovered, and 10 kg [22 lb] of meat were found in the cafe, "By the Sea" in Akimov district.

The specialists of the sanitary-epidemiological services and veterinary medicine have carried out sanitation and epidemic control measures.

[One thing one cannot claim is that anthrax investigations are dull and repetitive.

But this event does point up the importance of rapid diagnosis and proper site control. The farmer was left in the dark for 3 days and reverted to his normal practice of butchering the carcass and selling the meat. Fortunately all but a couple of kilos were recovered, this time. Might not be so lucky next time. The report indicates at one point that there were multiple cases and later refers only to one. This could be just poor reporting or that a number died but samples were only taken from one carcass and the farmer assumed that it was "safe" to butcher the others.

The Ukraine has only sporadic outbreaks of anthrax as a result of their very aggressive vaccination programme.
