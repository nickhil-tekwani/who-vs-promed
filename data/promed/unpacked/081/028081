[In Europe, the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) was developed in the late 1970s and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the eradication of the disease in Western and some Central European countries. Following the accession of the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) to the European Union in 2004, subsequent financial support has allowed the implementation of regular ORV campaigns since 2005-2006. In Lithuania, ORV was tested for the 1st time in 1983. In 1993 ORV was occasionally assessed on 3 districts. Between 1995 and 2000, following the Lithuanian National Rabies prevention programme, ORV was performed generally manually and a large range of vaccines was used over variable geographic areas. From 2006 to 2013, on average, 20 baits/km2 were distributed over the entire territory of Lithuania. During that period, 10% of 11 829 red foxes were rabies-positive.
