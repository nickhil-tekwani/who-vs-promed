A safari park is to permanently close its penguin enclosure after several birds died following a 2nd outbreak of malaria. Longleat in Wiltshire said a number of Humboldt penguins had died after contracting the avian strain of the disease from mosquitoes.

Avian malaria cannot be passed on to humans, but the park has decided to close Penguin Island to visitors. The safari park described it as "a difficult decision".

Longleat said it had put measures in place to protect the birds since the 1st outbreak of avian malaria in 2016, but "despite our best efforts" the park has decided to close Penguin Island in January [2019].

Head keeper Graeme Dick said: "This will be the last year that we hold penguins here at Longleat. The penguins are very susceptible to the problem and this is the 2nd year now that we've been hit with the disease."

Mr. Dick said the remaining penguins would be "moved on to a nice, new home" and the enclosure would be "repurposed for another species".

Humboldt penguins are normally found around coastal areas of Peru and Chile. They are listed as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which means they are at immediate or imminent risk of becoming endangered.

[Avian malaria is a disease caused by protozoans in the Genus _Plasmodium_, which are transmitted by mosquitos. _Plasmodium_ infections are naturally acquired in populations of some penguin species (e.g. African black-footed penguins) where they are often subclinical. There have been reports of mortality in captive colonies.

It is known that, within limits, arthropod populations are favored by heat and moisture. Therefore, it is expected that climate change will influence vector-borne diseases. In fact, a number of vector-borne human and domestic animal diseases, including malaria, have increased in incidence or geographic range in recent decades (e.g., African trypanosomiasis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, plague, dengue, African horse sickness, and bluetongue).

It would be interesting to know which _Plasmodium_ species is implicated in this event. UK anophelines are considered competent vectors. Climate modeling has suggested that transmission of _Plasmodium vivax_ (and to a lesser degree _Plasmodium falciparum_) could already occur in the UK, although no cases have been reported. - Mod.PMB
