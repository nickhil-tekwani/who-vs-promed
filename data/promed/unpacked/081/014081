There have been at least 3 deaths and a total of 8 cases of swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) virus] reported from the business city of Ahmedabad in [Gujarat, India]. Sources say it may have come from a patient referred to Ahmedabad based hospital. It is hot summer time with receding winter.

Spread of this news has caused a surge in demand of oseltamivir, causing a temporary shortage and also the demand for vaccination has increased.

[WHO's most recent influenza update (7 Apr 2014) indicates that influenza is decreasing in Asia generally, although there is no specific information provided for India (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/). The report above suggests that the influenza incidence in Ahmedabad is increasing. Influenza A/(H1N1) virus infections in India are not new. A report in the 3 Aug 2014 edition of The Hindu stated, "Swine flu (H1N1) was at its most virulent form in the country when it spread in 2009. Till May 2010, 1035 people had died of the disease in India, and more than 10 000 were infected."
