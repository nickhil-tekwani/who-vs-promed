The whooping cough outbreak in Grand Traverse County has reached 81 cases. Four babies younger than 12 months have been affected, the health department reported on Tue 22 Dec 2014.

An advisory [notice] from the health department regarding pertussis, also called whooping cough, encourages residents to take precautions with holiday travel and get-togethers to prevent the spread of disease. Children and adults are advised be up-to-date on vaccinations, including booster shots for pertussis. And people are urged to stay home if they are sick.

The pertussis outbreak has affected students at 22 schools in the county. The health department also reports 21 cases of parapertussis, an illness similar to pertussis.

A hotline set up to answer questions from those who have been exposed to pertussis has received more than 3900 phone calls. "Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority," the advisory says. The health department "urges all pregnant women to get vaccinated and parents to vaccinate infants as soon as possible."

Infants who are too young to be vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis. The health department says it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants to have up-to-date vaccines, an approach called cocooning. Mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles and anyone who might be around an infant during the holidays should be vaccinated, said Wendy Trute, the Grand Traverse health officer.

[Grand Traverse County is located in the north west part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa, meaning "large water" or "large lake." Those living in the Upper Peninsula (or UP) are called "Yoopers," now an official word in the Merriam Webster Dictionary. The 2 peninsulas are connected by the famous Mackinaw Bridge, and those of us residing in the lower regions of the state are sometimes referred to by our northern neighbors as "Trolls", as we live underneath the bridge.

In Grand Traverse County, there are a number of reasons why the local outbreak has occurred, including decreased efficacy of the current acellular vaccine (see below), the natural 3-5 year waves of the infection, and a substantial "philosophical" objection rate among parents to the vaccine.

It should be noted that _Bordetella pertussis_'s cousin, _B. parapertussis_, causes a similar, although milder, illness to _B. pertussis_. There is, however, no cross-protection against parapertussis with the pertussis vaccine. Parapertussis does not produce the pertussis toxin. Co-infections with pertussis and parapertussis are not rare. - Mod.LL]

Lincoln-Lancaster County health officials have recorded 110 confirmed cases of whooping cough, and the number is growing.

On Tue 23 Dec 2014, one family in Lincoln learned that their 16-year-old son was one of those afflicted. "The doctor said he's got pertussis or whooping cough," the teenager's father said. That meant even though no one else in the family has it yet, it was home for the holidays. "It is a terrible gift to give, so we don't want to give this to anybody," the mother said. The family even left gifts they were going to take to relatives out on their porch. "They didn't say, 'Hi,' or nothing. They picked it up and drove off," the teenager said.

No one appreciates that more than health officials in Lincoln, faced with all the cases in 2014. "It's the highest we had recorded. The last numbers even close to that were in 2005, and we had 87," supervisor of the Communicable Disease Program Tim Timmons said.

Pertussis outbreaks are occurring all across the country. Health officials said the vaccination apparently wears off. Kids are supposed to get 4 doses of it by age 2, another when they enter grade school, and a booster shot in high school. "The immunity doesn't seem to last as long, maybe 3-4 years," Timmons said. That's why so many middle and high school students, like this teenager, seem to be getting the disease even when they had their shots.

[3] Pertussis toxin evolution

Analysis of strains from 2012 shows the parts of the pertussis bacterium that the vaccine primes the immune system to recognize are changing. It may have "serious consequences" in future outbreaks, UK researchers state in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. But experts stressed that the vaccine remains highly effective in protecting the most vulnerable young babies.

Rising figures prompted health officials to recommend vaccination of pregnant women so immunity could be passed to their newborns, a strategy that a recent study showed was working well. But there has been much debate among experts about whether the introduction of a new vaccine in 2004 has been a factor in rising rates of whooping cough.

One issue is that immunity from the newer acellular vaccine does not seem to last as long as the previous whole cell version, leaving teenagers and adults lacking protection. In the latest study, researchers analysed the genes coding for the proteins on the surface of the pertussis bacterium responsible for the UK outbreak. They found proteins being targeted by the vaccine were mutating at a faster rate than other surface proteins not included in the vaccine. Potentially, it means the bacteria are changing quickly to get around the immune system's defenses put in place with immunization.

But the researchers are still trying to work out what the changes mean in reality; for example, do the mutations boost the ability of the bacteria to cause infection. "We wanted to look at strains from the UK to see if there was anything sudden that had occurred that had led to these really large outbreaks," said study leader Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath. The "million dollar question," he said, was what, if anything, could be done to improve the vaccine, which is still the best defense we have, and prevent future outbreaks.

Options to consider include adding more or different proteins to the vaccine, adding novel adjuvants (chemicals which boost the immune response), or even revisiting the old-style whole cell vaccine, he said. "Pertussis has a cyclical nature, and another big question is are we going to see another increase in late 2015?," he added.

Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric immunology expert at the University of Bristol, said the importance, or not, of the subtle changes found in the study was, as yet, unclear. "But the control of pertussis is a significant worry," he added.

[The publication mentioned is Sealey KL, Harris SR, Fry NK, et al. Genomic analysis of isolates from the UK 2012 pertussis outbreak reveals that vaccine antigen genes are unusually fast evolving. J Infect Dis. 8 Dec 2014. pii: jiu665. [Epub ahead of print].

Abstract:
"A major outbreak of whooping cough, or pertussis, occurred in 2012 in the UK, with nearly 10 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 14 infant deaths attributed to pertussis. A worldwide resurgence of pertussis has been linked to switch to the use of acellular pertussis vaccines and the evolution of _B. pertussis_ away from vaccine-mediated immunity. We have conducted genomic analyses of multiple strains from the UK outbreak. We show that the UK outbreak was polyclonal in nature, caused by multiple distinct but closely related strains. Importantly, we demonstrate that acellular vaccine antigen encoding genes are evolving at higher rates than other surface protein encoding genes. This was true even prior to the introduction of pertussis vaccines but has become more pronounced since the introduction of the current acellular vaccines. The fast evolution of vaccine antigen genes has serious consequences for the ability of current vaccines to continue to control pertussis."

Another recently published study (van Gent M, Heuvelman CJ, van der Heide HG, et al. Analysis of _Bordetella pertussis_ clinical isolates circulating in European countries during the period 1998-2012. Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2014 Dec 20. [Epub ahead of print] with Frits Mooi as the senior author has also addressed this issue:

Abstract:
"Despite more than 50 years of vaccination, pertussis is still an endemic disease, with regular epidemic outbreaks. With the exception of Poland, European countries have replaced whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) by acellular vaccines (ACVs) in the 1990s. Worldwide, antigenic divergence in vaccine antigens has been found between vaccine strains and circulating strains. In this work, 466 _Bordetella pertussis_ isolates collected in the period 1998-2012 from 13 European countries were characterized by multi-locus antigen sequence typing (MAST) of the pertussis toxin promoter (ptxP) and of the genes coding for proteins used in the ACVs: pertussis toxin (Ptx), pertactin (Prn), type 2 fimbriae (Fim2) and type 3 fimbriae (Fim3). Isolates were further characterised by fimbrial serotyping, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The results showed a very similar _B. pertussis_ population for 12 countries using ACVs, while Poland, which uses a WCV, was quite distinct, suggesting that ACVs and WCVs select for different _B. pertussis_ populations. This study forms a baseline for future studies on the effect of vaccination programs on _B. pertussis_ populations."

To me, the evolutionary changes in current pertussis strains documented in the USA, Europe and Australia are playing a significant, but not at all the sole role in the upswing of pertussis throughout the world, and alteration of the current vaccine may be needed. - Mod.LL
