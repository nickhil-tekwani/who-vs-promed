Indonesia: A Comment on the Source of the Avian Influenza Infections in Jakarta
-----------------------------------------------
It could be true that the "escaped" bird(s) across the street were the
source of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus that infected 3 members of a
family in Tanggerang, Jakarta, based on the finding of a trace of avian
influenza virus in the dried bird droppings. However, this does not explain
why only those 3 were affected, while the other family members showed
negative results for both serologic and PCR tests. Also, none of the
neighboring families showed a positive result.
There is also a question as to whether those 3 victims were exposed to the
source at the same time or whether one of them was the index case and
transmitted the virus to the other close family members sharing the same
genetic susceptibility to the virus. As we know, the 2nd case showed
symptoms 10-11 days after the 1st, the 3rd case a few days later: an
unusual incubation period for avian influenza if they were exposed at the
same time. My hypothesis is that they were grossly exposed to a (so far
unknown) source, possibly repeatedly. Alternatively, one victim could have
become a new infection source for the others who have similar genetic
susceptibility. Could an intentional targeted spreading of the virus
possibly play a role in this case?

[With these comments from a local observer, the Jakarta incident discussion
is now closed. Dr. Soebandrio has made the interesting comment that
differences in genetic susceptibility may have played a role in the Jakarta
incident. This is an issue that deserves further study, particularly with
respect to an apparent greater vulnerability of Vietnamese people to avian
influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]
