The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) confirmed a measles outbreak among 5 persons.

According to an LA Public Health press release issued on 5 Feb 2020, this measles outbreak began when a measles virus infectious international visitor was visiting the greater Los Angeles area. Furthermore, Public Health says, "additional measles cases may occur in LA County."

According to Public Health, during 2019, "there were 20 measles cases among LA County residents, in addition to 14 non-resident measles cases that traveled through LA County. Most of those individuals were not immunized or did not know whether they had ever been immunized or previously infected with the measles virus."

Eight of the measles outbreaks in the USA during 2019 occurred in under-immunized, close-knit communities.

During 2019, the CDC confirmed 1282 individual cases of measles in 31 states. About 73% of the cases were linked to recent measles outbreaks in New York City and Rockland County, NY.

Tonga measles outbreak 2019-20: Situation report 17

1. Summary of situation
Background
The outbreak of measles in Tonga began in early October 2019, following the return of a national youth team of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand. The index case developed measles while in New Zealand. Subsequently, a further 12 teammates developed laboratory-confirmed measles. The early outbreak involved mainly teenagers from associated schools on Tongatapu and Vava'u Islands. Since the initial 2 waves of the outbreak, cases were widely reported in all age groups but are now declining.

An inter-disciplinary Ministry of Health Epidemic Task Force (ETF) meets weekly to advise on management of the outbreak. In addition to routine outbreak response activities, a time-limited vaccination program targeting secondary school students and 6-11-month-old infants was conducted between October and December 2019. Additional immunization activities have been conducted in January and February [2020] to target the 1-9-year-olds.

Note: Refer to earlier SitReps for further detail of the initial cases and response.

2. Current Situation
- As of 5 Feb 2020, 656 confirmed and suspected cases of measles have been reported in Tonga. Till date, 98 specimens have been tested for measles, of which 78 (79.6%) have been PCR laboratory confirmed.
- Of 656 cases, 578 (88.1%) cases occurred on Tongatapu and 66 (10.1 %) occurred on Vava'u Island. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve for the current outbreak in Tonga.
- Ongoing transmission of measles virus in Tongatapu and Vava'u. Onset of illness for most recent case in Tongatapu was 1 Feb 2020. Onset of illness for last reported case in Vava'u was 8 Jan 2020 (28 days to date). Islands of Ha'apai, Eua, and Niuas have interrupted transmission (Table 1).
- Throughout the course of the outbreak, most cases presented with mild symptoms and were mostly managed by home isolation.
- Between October 2019 and 25 Dec 2019, there were 20 measles-related hospitalisations. All cases recovered completely and were discharged. No deaths have been reported till date.
- Between 30 Jan and 5 Feb 2020, 4 additional cases were reported. Of these, clinical confirmation for 2 cases is pending. All reported cases were from the island of Tongatapu. The 2 suspect cases were females aged 15 and 24 years.
- Of the 656 cases, majority (452, [68.9%]) of cases have been in males. This is consistent with early transmission occurring in male boarding schools.
- Figure 2 presents age and gender graph for all cases of measles in the current outbreak. Majority (435, 66.7%) cases occurred in persons aged 10-19 years (Figure 2 and Table 2).
- Vaccination records have been verified for 560/652 (85.9%) cases. In-depth results will be available following complete verification.

Venezuela is in the throes of a political uprising, as opposition leader Juan Guaido wrests power from incumbent president Nicolas Maduro. An outbreak of measles in the country has only added to the current chaos.

Measles outbreaks have passed over the world from 2018-2019, infecting 10s of thousands of people and killing thousands more. The resurgence of the once near-eradicated disease has been blamed on "vaccine hesitancy" as people are refusing to vaccinate against measles. In Venezuela, vaccine coverage is at an all-time low, and political disturbance has only exacerbated the problem. Researchers have been following the outbreak and recommended exactly what should be done by Venezuelan and international authorities.

Researchers from the University of Groningen analysed funding and vaccine coverage in Venezuela and found just above half of the country was vaccinated.

They said: "The Venezuelan national funding level for the 2nd dose of the measles vaccine (1st dose at 14 months and the 2nd at 9 years old) is estimated at 52% on the basis of data from the Venezuelan Ministry of Public Health.

"The report contains data for a period of 16 months (June 2017-October 2018), in which a total of 7524 suspected cases of measles have been reported in Venezuela."

The team of researchers found some 66% of the country is living in extreme poverty as a result of hyperinflation and declining oil sales under Nicolas Maduro. With the economic struggles has also come social upheaval, with escalating violence and crumbling healthcare forcing people out of the country.

Some 280 000 children are at risk of dying under these conditions according to the researchers, and Venezuela is unlikely to see an end any time soon.

As a result, the researchers have warned against a developing measles epidemic. They have also touched on the measles cases from Venezuela eventually spilling over into neighbouring South American countries and local native populations.

The researchers said: "The measles outbreak also affects indigenous people in the Amazon and the Orinoco river delta. In addition, as a result of the recent refugee influx, measles infections are also detected in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador."

The team of researchers have outlined how Venezuelan health officials could best deal with measles.

How should Venezuela battle the measles outbreak?

Adriana Tami, a Venezuelan researcher from the University of Groningen's Department of Medical Microbiology, outlined how Venezuela could tackle the outbreak.

She said: "World Health Authorities should urge the Venezuelan government to allow humanitarian aid to address the extreme shortages of food and medicines immediately."

"In addition," she added, "the emergency aid (both nutrition and vaccinations) should be given not only in Venezuela but also together with Colombian and Brazilian authorities, for example, to limit the consequences of mass migration."
