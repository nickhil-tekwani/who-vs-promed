Situation update [for the week 22-29 Mar 2019]
[The next update will be issued on 5 Apr 2019].
------------------
China:
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, a total of 114 ASF outbreaks have been detected in 28 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. Around 1 000 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

Viet Nam:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks on 19 Feb 2019, a total of 556 outbreaks were reported in 23 provinces/cities, and more than 89 600 pigs have been culled [the figures in the previous weekly report were, respectively, 366, 20 and 46 600].

Between 23 and 29 Mar 2019, ASF outbreaks were reported in Thai Binh (167), Hai Phong (72), Hung Yen (68), Hai Duong (47), Bac Ninh (44), Ha Noi (30), Thanh Hoa (23), Dien Bien (17), Quang Ninh (17), Lai Chau (17), Son La (14), Thai Nguyen (11), Nam Dinh (9), Ha Nam (7), Nghe An (4), Hoa Binh *(2), Bac Kan* (1), Lang Son* (1), Ninh Binh* (1), Thua Thien-Hue* (1), Bac Giang (1), Quang Tri (1) and Vinh Phuc (1). [All but the 5 noted by asterisk* suffered ASF cases also during the week 22-29 Mar 2019].

Viet Nam has implemented movement control of pigs and pig products from affected communes; ASF-positive farms have been depopulated according to the emergency response action plan against ASF. On 20 Mar 2019, MARD requested the provincial/city people's committee to allow healthy pigs in infected areas to be slaughtered for consumption within: infected commune; infected district if (more than) one commune infected; or provinces if (more than) one district infected. No movement from infected provinces is allowed. The Prime Minister's Office announced on 7 Mar 2019 the increase of compensation for piglets and fattening pigs to 80%, and 1.5-2 times the normal compensation rate for sow/boar.

[2] ASF virus dissemination in plant-based feeds and liquids; research
Date: Mon 25 Mar 2019

African swine fever [ASF] may be orally transmittable in plant-based feeds and liquids, although higher doses of the virus are needed to generate infection from feeds, says researcher.

A team of researchers from Kansas State University examined the minimum and average amounts of ASF virus (ASFV) that would need to be present in swine feed or water before the animal started to develop the disease.

The group published details of its project in the Center for Disease Control journal, Emerging Infectious Disease [details in commentary].

During the feeding trial, pigs were exposed to varying amounts of ASFV in liquid or feed and allowed to voluntarily or naturally consume the contaminated product, the researchers said. They were then tracked and checked for the presence of ASF.

The group found that pigs could become infected with the disease following the natural consumption of the contaminated feed or in a liquid medium, the researchers said. No evidence of the disease was found in the 14 negative control pigs.

The probability of infection increased as a larger amount of virus was added to either feed or liquid, they said. At the largest dose tested in liquid, 100% of pigs receiving the oral challenge developed the disease, however, no in-feed dose generated 100% infection.

One of the surprising outcomes of the disease challenge was how small a dose provided in a liquid medium was necessary for pigs to become infected, Niederwerder said. "The lowest dose that we're confidently able to test in pigs caused infection in almost 40% of the pigs that consumed it; it was extremely infectious when consumed through liquid," she added.

However, she said, another interesting finding was what could happen according to the modeling performed using the data generated if pigs received the contaminated feed for a longer period. "It was surprising to see how the infection probability goes up in feed even at a low dose due to the infection probability increasing after repeated exposures," she added.

"What we would anticipate in the field would be that an entire batch of feed would become contaminated from a contaminated ingredient, which would be mixed thoroughly into the feed," she said. "The pigs would be exposed several times over several days; even though the dose required for infection was higher in feed compared to liquid media, the likelihood of the repeated exposures may make feed an even higher risk." In the study, pigs were given 100 grams [0.2 lbs] of feed with a specific dose of the virus, she said. In a real-world scenario, a pig at a grow-finish facility might have up to 4kg [8.8 lbs] of feed a day, so the pig would be exposed to about 40 times the amount used in the trial.

"It's another important factor to consider for implementing feed biosecurity protocols for the industry," Niederwerder said. "Whether that be considering where the feed ingredients are imported from, what foreign animal diseases are circulating in that country, [or] what feed ingredients are at risk of becoming contaminated. "The findings also suggest that mitigation strategies need to be considered, she said. "Whether that be storage time, whether that be heating up ingredients to a certain temperature, or whether that be adding a chemical mitigant to reduce the risk of transmission through feed, it all goes back to how do we consider not only pig biosecurity or farm biosecurity, but also start implementing feed biosecurity procedures."

[The paper, to which the above post refers, is: Niederwerder MC, Stoian AMM, Rowland RRR, Dritz SS, Petrovan V, Constance LA, et al. Infectious dose of African swine fever virus when consumed naturally in liquid or feed. Emerg Infect Dis. 25 (5) May 2019. Ahead of Print, Original Publication Date 13 Feb 2019 https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2505.181495.

The following excerpts from the discussion chapter deserve be noted:

1. "Productive infection resulted in almost 40% of the pigs exposed to an ASFV liquid inoculum containing as little as 1 TCID50. The low infectious dose of ASFV through natural liquid consumption should be considered as a possible factor in the spread of ASF through water, consistent with the epidemiologic evidence linking the Danube River with ASF spread in Romania."

2. "Our experimental studies using the contemporary isolate Georgia 2007 show that ASFV infection through the consumption of plant-based feed requires a higher dose compared with liquid. Compared with liquid media, feed might stimulate salivary proteases that degrade virus integrity. Furthermore, the feed matrix might inhibit tonsillar contact, reducing virus exposure to lymphoid and epithelial tissues before gastrointestinal entry."

3. "Despite infection after consumption of ASFV in contaminated feed being a lower-probability event compared with liquid, the high frequency of exposure might make feed a more important risk factor for transmission. Adding to this risk is the fact that highly centralized feed mills use ingredients from a global distribution supply chain. For example, inventory from a midwestern US swine farm indicated feed ingredients originating from 12 countries in North America, Asia, and Europe."

4. "How ASFV is moving across such vast areas within the largest pork-producing country in the world [China] is unknown; however, movement of the virus within feed or feed ingredients should be considered. The results of our study demonstrate that ASFV can be easily transmitted orally through natural consumption of both liquid and feed, supporting the potential role of feed in the emergence of this virus in new pig populations throughout the world."

Traditionally, the pig-feed ingredient regarded as the most significant contributor to the spread of ASF has been recycled porcine tissue. This remains unchanged, though the above research illuminates other potential modes of ASFV spread. Plant-based feed is more likely to play an epidemiological role in countries suffering ASF in wild boar, their excretions and cadavers becoming sources of potential spatial contamination. - Mod.AS
