CDC says new flu strain shows epidemic risk - By MIKE COOPER, Reuters:
A child in Hong Kong who died after being infected with an influenza virus
previously seen only in animals is likely an isolated case, but it
illustrates the risk of a sudden flu epidemic, U.S. health experts said
Thursday. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) said they still do not know how a child who died in Hong Kong in May
became infected with the type A (H5N1) flu strain previously seen only in
birds and pigs. "Fortunately for us, the H5N1 virus does not appear to
have the ability to spread from person to person," Dr. Nancy Cox, the chief
of the CDC's influenza branch, told an advisory committee on immunization
practices.
The three-year-old child in Hong Kong died May 21, only 12 days after he
began suffering from a fever, sore throat and cough. Researchers said they
are not sure if the child's illness is linked to outbreaks of the flu virus
on poultry farms between March and May. "We know that the child was in
contact with or proximate to ill chickens shortly before he became sick,"
Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the chief of the CDC's influenza epidemiology section,
said. "What we have been unable to establish, but are trying to establish,
is whether those chickens had any evidence of H5N1 infections. " CDC
researchers, working with the Hong Kong Department of Health, said they
have found no other human traces of the flu strain. They are developing a
more precise laboratory test for 2,000 serum samples taken from family
members, school children, neighbors and health care workers who came into
contact with the victim. "There have been no reported unusual increases in
influenza-like illness cases" in Hong Kong or south China, where
surveillance was stepped up after the child's death, Fukuda said.
However, health experts warn that the influenza virus can suddenly change
through "antigenic shifts" where gene segments are exchanged between human
and avian or swine influenza viruses. Officials are preparing a
contingency plan for the next time a sudden outbreak of Type A flu occurs,
such as the 1968 epidemic of Hong Kong flu that killed 46,500 people, or
the 1957 epidemic of Asian flu that caused 98,000 deaths. Dr. Raymond
Strikas, co-chair of a working group on influenza preparedness and
emergency response, said it is a question of "when....not if" a flu strain
will suddenly infect all age groups on a global scale.
