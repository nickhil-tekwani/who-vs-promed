The following background data on yellow fever in Brazil were extracted from
the GIDEON software program:
Brazil is Designated an infected country. As of 1997 risk existed in almost
two-thirds of the country: Amapa Territory and Amazonas, Goias, midwestern
Maranhao, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Para, Rondonia and Roraima states.
Current (1997) risk in Amapa, Amazonas, Maranhao and Para States. The last
cases of urban yellow fever were reported in 1942.
Eight hundred ninety-eight cases were reported during 1930 to 1992,
(including 150 during 1981 to 1988) -80.1% of these from Para, Goias and
Mato Grosso; and 1.6% from Maranhao.
Nine cases (3 fatal) were reported in 1989; 2 (1 fatal) in 1990; 15 (8
fatal) in 1991; 12 (8 fatal) in 1992.
Seventy-four cases (17 fatal) were reported in 1993 - from Maranhao
(including 62 cases in Mirador), Amazonas and Para States; 18 (5 fatal) in
1994; 4 (2 fatal) in 1995. No cases were officially reported during 1996 to
1997; however, two travelers (Switzerland and United States) developed
fatal malaria on return from Brazil
in 1996.
Twenty-two cases (1 fatal) were reported during January to May 1998 - 16 of
these from Afua Municipality (Para State), with additional cases in Amapa,
Amazonas and Mato Grosso States.
Eight million were vaccinated annually during 1986 to 1988.
During 5 outbreaks of sylvatic yellow fever, the following mosquito species
were implicated: _Haemagogus janthinomys_, _Hg. slmaculatus_, _Sabethes
chloropterus_ and _Sa. soperi_.
Proof of vaccination is required for travelers over 9 months of age
arriving from infected countries (defined as Angola, Bolivia, Cameroon,
Colombia, Ecuador, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Peru,
Sierra Leone, Sudan or Zaire). Vaccination is also recommended for travel
to rural areas of the Tocantins River basin; Amapa and Roraima states; and
