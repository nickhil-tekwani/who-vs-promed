More than 400 000 infected birds to be slaughtered in Chile
-----------------------------------------------------------
Santiago: Chilean agricultural authorities said on Fri 31 May 2002 that at
least 400 000 birds must be slaughtered because of an outbreak of avian
influenza. Official Hernan Rojas said that the measure was adopted to avoid
the spread of the virus, whose presence was being investigated following
the death of 110 000 chickens in central Chile. In addition to the
slaughter of the birds at the plant in San Antonio, which had nearly 509
000 chickens, the plant will be quarantined along with another smaller
plant in Rancagua, which also tested positive for the virus.
Authorities have begun an investigation to determine the origin of the
outbreak and have enlisted the aid of a laboratory in the United States to
identify the virus. The testing may take at least two weeks. If the
findings indicate the most dangerous form of the virus, Chile may decide to
eliminate all the birds that are affected or at risk, and even cancel some
poultry sales abroad.
President Ricardo Lagos visited one of the processing plants in central
Chile on Friday. Deputy agriculture minister Arturo Barrera insisted that
buyers of Chilean poultry had been duly informed. Shipments of poultry from
Chile to Japan were suspended on Fri 31 May because Japan wanted to know
what type of avian influenza had been found.

[The initial suspicion of avian influenza in Chile, as reported on 30 May
to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), was based upon clinical
observation (elevated mortality rate among hens in a breeding farm) and
serological (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and agar-gel
immunodiffusion) evidence. The authorities said that no positive serology
of avian influenza had ever been detected in Chile. Since Jan 2000, over 70
000 serological tests have been carried out, with negative results.
The current laboratory investigations are meant to determine if the virus
strain involved has the virulence of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI), also known as fowl plague, which is an OIE list A disease. The
methods used to determine strain virulence for birds have evolved over
recent years with a greater understanding of the molecular basis of
pathogenicity, but still depend on the inoculation of a minimum of 8
susceptible chickens aged 4 to 8 weeks with infectious virus; strains are
considered to be highly pathogenic if they cause over 75 per cent mortality
within 10 days. For further details, see the OIE Manual of Standards
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2000, chapter 2.1.14.
