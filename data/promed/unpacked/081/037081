New virus, but no signs of West Nile virus, found in Rhode Island mosquitoes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROVIDENCE ­ The State Department of Environmental Management (DEM) says
there are still no signs of the West Nile virus in Rhode Island. However,
some bird-biting mosquitoes trapped in the Ocean State have been found to
be carrying another virus called Highland J. virus. Officials say that:
"While this virus cannot be transmitted to humans, its appearance increases
the likelihood of finding other viruses which are dangerous to humans such
as Eastern Equine Encephalitis and West Nile viruses". The State says that
for the time being, it still has no plans to spray.
West Nile virus was detected in a dead crow found in a park in Bostons
Jamaica Plain neighborhood over a week ago. Massachusetts state health
authorities say a second dead crow, found in Hopkinton, also tested
positive for the West Nile virus. However, none of the mosquitoes taken
from the Boston pond where an infected bird was also found over the weekend
have tested positive. Boston officials have begun anti-mosquito spraying.
The State laboratory in Massachusetts has been inundated with dead birds,
which have been arriving in much greater numbers since the first dead crow
was found. Officials with the State Public Health Department say that the
lab is now getting about 300 dead birds a day, when it usually only gets
about 12 birds a day.
The Rhode Island DEM said test results of 60 pools of mosquitoes and 10
birds for the West Nile virus are negative. There is a statewide action
plan to address concerns with the virus. Testing has been conducted weekly
since 30 May and will continue through the fall.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus and Highlands J. virus belong the
_Alphavirus_ genus of the family _Togaviridae_ and these two viruses are
not related to West Nile virus, which is a member of a different virus
family, the _Flaviviridae_. Molecular studies suggest that Highlands J.
virus is a recombinant New World alphavirus with the glycoprotein gene
sequence derived from a Sindbis-like virus and the remainder of the genome
from an EEE-like virus. The isolation of Highlands J. virus from mosquitoes
does not increase the likelihood of isolation of West Nile virus, contrary
to the above statement. -Mod. CP]

Ontario wants dead birds tested for West Nile virus as safety precaution
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TORONTO: Ontario residents are being asked to report any unusual bird
deaths to their local health department as a precaution against the spread
of West Nile virus. The provincial Ministry of Health has also asked its
health units to gather all dead birds and test them or the virus, which is
carried in a bird's blood and can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
The virus, which causes the potentially fatal disease encephalitis, had
never been seen in the western hemisphere until it infected 62 people and
killed seven in New York City last summer, including a visiting Toronto
resident. As a precaution to monitor a possible spread to Canada, health
officials have started surveillance plans.
"It has not been detected in Canada, but it could show up here. There's no
question about that, but the risk of death in an automobile accident this
long weekend, is still higher than the risk of infection by West Nile
virus", said Dr. Gordon Surgeoner, a University of Guelph Entomology Professor
