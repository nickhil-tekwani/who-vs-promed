[1] Egypt - 21st death

An Egyptian teenager died from the H5N1 strain of bird flu on Saturday [5
Apr 2008], the health ministry said, the 21st person to succumb to the
virus since it was discovered here in 2006. The 19 year old teenager from
the Nile Delta province of Beheira died in hospital, health ministry
official Nasr al-Sayyed told the state MENA news agency. "The boy had been
taken to a hospital in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria on Thu 3 Apr
2008 after complaining of high fever and shortness of breath," Sayyed said.
"He had been exposed to infected poultry," he said.

The teenager was the 48th reported case of human bird flu in the country.
In January 2008, 4 people died of the disease in just one week, after
safety precautions had been relaxed with the belief that the virus had
disappeared when no case had been reported in 6 months. Last month [March
2008], a woman died from the virus in Cairo after she was unsuccessfully
treated with Tamiflu [oseltamivir].

Egypt's location on major bird migration routes and the widespread practice
of keeping domestic fowl near living quarters have led to it being the
hardest-hit country outside Asia. The government says it is conducting a
vigorous campaign to combat the spread of the virus through vaccinations
and raising awareness, but experts and officials have warned against people
dropping their guard. Earlier this year [2008], Health Minister Hatem
al-Gabali warned against slackness in the preventative measures taken to
fight bird flu. Health ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin has
repeatedly urged the public to remain vigilant and deplored the relaxation
of precautions.

Officials have called for the banning of raising fowl in towns and
transporting them between provinces without authorization. They have also
warned sick people that failure to report that they have been in contact
with contaminated domestic fowl makes it more difficult to detect the virus
and to treat it. Women and children have borne the brunt of the virus
because of their role in taking care of domestic fowl.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this year [2008] that
countries around the world had improved their defenses against bird flu,
but the situation remained critical in Egypt and Indonesia where the risk
of the H5N1 virus mutating into a major human threat remains high. A total
of 238 [239 including the 19 year old. - Mod.CP] have been killed by the
virus worldwide.

[2] Egypt - 21st death

An Egyptian man has died of the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus,
bringing the number of fatalities in Egypt to 21, a WHO official said on
Saturday [5 Apr 2008]. Cairo-based WHO official John Jabbour told Reuters
the 19 year old victim had died on Friday [4 Apr 2008] after falling ill
following contact with infected birds in the Nile Delta province of
Beheira. The man is the 48th Egyptian infected with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus since it arrived in Egypt in February 2006. The Egyptian
News Agency MENA said that the man had been admitted to hospital on
Thursday [3 Apr 2008] after suffering from a high fever, difficulty
breathing, and a pulmonary infection. He was treated with the antiviral
drug Tamiflu [oseltamivir] but did not survive.

A 25 year old woman died of bird flu in Egypt last month [March 2008]. It
is the 3rd winter the virus has struck after lying low during Egypt's hot
summers. About 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income, and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated despite a large scale poultry
vaccination programme.

[3] Indonesia - 108th death suspected

A 16 year old Indonesian girl has died of suspected bird flu, a doctor said
today [6 Apr 2008]. The girl died on Saturday afternoon, 3 days after being
admitted for treatment at the Sulianti Saroso bird flu referral hospital in
the Indonesian capital, hospital spokesman Ilham Patu told AFP (Agence
France-Presse). "She showed all the symptoms of bird flu infection such as
high fever, coughing and low blood cell count," Patu said. "But we have not
yet received the results of tests of samples taken from her. She remains a
suspected bird flu case," Patu said. Health minister spokesperson Lili
Sulistiawati confirmed officials were still awaiting the results before
confirming the case as a bird flu death. Two positive results are needed
before Indonesian authorities confirm a human infection of bird flu. The
Tempo newspaper quoted the girl's father as saying that officials conducted
a check of poultry in their neighborhood in Sawangan, southeast of Jakarta,
and found some were positive for the deadly virus. The girl fell sick on
Monday [31 Mar 2008] and was taken to a private hospital 2 days later,
before being referred to Sulianti Saroso on Thursday [3 Apr 2008].

Indonesia has the world's highest number of human bird flu victims, with
107 known fatal cases, 13 of them this year [2008]. Experts fear the virus,
which is usually spread directly from birds to humans, could mutate into a
form easily transmissible between people, sparking a deadly global pandemic.
