Death from spotted fever in Tombos, MG [Minas Gerais], alert
------------------------------------------------------------
After the death of a man from spotted fever in August [2013], the Prefecture of Tombos, Zona da Mata, has installed 2 warning signs about suspected star tick infestation on the Carangola river [the information should be alert, not suspected - Mod RNA]. Over the past 6 years, 66 cases of the disease were confirmed in Minas Gerais.

The official, 68, was fishing in the Carangola river bed , where there are several animal hosts of the star tick species [_Amblyomma cajennense_ - Mod RNA], which transmits the disease. According to his daughter, the father always came home with many ticks on his body.

The last time, he began to feel ill after fishing and was hospitalized for 3 days with headaches and fever. She says that doctors asked for medical examinations for hepatitis and dengue [With what was he treated? Died how far along in his medical history? - Mod RNA], but the report of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (Funed) pointed to the possibility of spotted fever. "The greatest suspect is the capybara, judging by the number of animals that we see in the vicinity of the city," said [his daughter]. [No. The major clinical suspicion is spotted fever. Transmission is by the vector tick. The capybara neither transmits, nor causes the disease - Mod.RNA],

[History repeats itself once again. The same scenario: capybaras, banks of rivers and ticks. The same flaws: not suspected, not treated [correctly].

The news brings up a summary of what is known and what makes Brazilian spotted fever [aka Rocky Mountain spotted fever - Mod.JW], caused by [the bacterium] _Rickettsia rickettsii_ a big challenge as a public health problem:
- A disease which, although of low incidence, is associated with high lethality;
- A multisystemic disease with rapid progression to multiple organ dysfunction, rarely considered
diagnosis and often confused with several other conditions.

Consequence: specific treatment too late -- or worse, cases not investigated and treated appropriately;
- The risk of infection is classically associated with rural areas, peri-urban and wild, but with a growing importance of transmission in urban areas (public parks, for example);
- Risk of infection associated with both leisure activities (mainly fishing) as well as those of occupational character;
- The role of the capybara as an element in the chain of transmission disease where the incriminated vector is _Amblyomma cajennense_ (the "star tick").

To see the number of cases of spotted fever in Brazil, by state, for the period 1997 to 2013, [10 so far in 2013] go to:

I recently saw a capybara in daylight in a drainage ditch on a golf course in Rio de Janeiro.
