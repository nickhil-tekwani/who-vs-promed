The Federal Health Minister, Bahr Abu Garda, announced the start of the vaccination campaign against the yellow fever epidemic in Darfur on Tue 20 Nov 2012, targeting 2.4 million people in Central, West, and South Darfur, Radio Dabanga has learned.

Bahr Abu Garda, who arrived in El-Geneina on Saturday [17 Nov 2012] to visit the affected areas, announced to Radio Dabanga in an interview that the vaccination campaign will begin on Tuesday [20 Nov 2012] after arrival of the vaccines to Darfur.

The minister appeals to citizens in the states of Central and West Darfur, where the campaign will be started, to go to the vaccination centers and follow the necessary health instructions, he added to Radio Dabanga from El-Geneina.

On the other hand, he disclosed that the number of deaths as a result of the yellow fever epidemic has reached 110 on Saturday [17 Nov 2012], adding that the total number of cases in West and South Darfur is now 358.

Abu Garda stated that all preparations were done in cooperation with the World Health Organization, including the preparation and equipment of blood banks in Nyala, El-Fasher, Zalingei, and El-Geneina.

The minister noted that the disease seemed to be declining and appealed to citizens to go to the nearest health center as soon as any symptom of the disease emerges, he added to Radio Dabanga.

[It is good learn that the yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign will start tomorrow (20 Nov 2012). One presumes that the densely populated refugee camps will be reached quickly, reducing that considerable risk. Reaching more remote villages for public health education and vaccination will be a logistical challenge, since the vaccine requires maintenance of a cold chain. It remains to be seen if the outbreak is declining or not, since distribution of the vaccine will take time and over a week is required to achieve solid immunity following administration of the vaccine. But the presence of the vaccine in Darfur is very good news indeed, and the results of the campaign are awaited with interest.

A recent AlertNet report (http://www.trust.org/alertnet/multimedia/pictures/detail.dot?mediaInode=6ed119c2-441a-4bb6-b62c-1136ab065ca0) indicated that as of 14 Nov 2012 the Sudan Red Crescent has conducted workshops on health care and prevention of yellow fever at a community center in Al Riad camp for Internally Displaced Persons, West Darfur. It is encouraging to see the Red Crescent taking proactive measures to deal with the YF outbreak.

Fortunately, there are no reports of additional YF cases in Khartoum.
