Situation update
----------------
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, a total of 98 ASF outbreaks [see comment] have been detected in 23 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities. More than 706 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

Guangdong Province: ASF outbreaks occurred in one farm with 6027 pigs in Jingxia Village, Jiulong Township, Huangpu District, Guangzhou City, and a backyard farming in Hutou Village, Longxi Township, Boluo County, Huizhou City [1*].

Fujian Province: ASF outbreak occurred in one farming cooperative with 5776 pigs in Yangkeng Village, Wangtai Township, Yanping District, Nanping City [2*].

Actions taken by China [new, since previous weekly FAO update]
---------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Dec 2018, Tianjin Customs reported detection of ASF virus nucleic acid in 2 batches of pig blood globulin powder produced by one company registered for export, tested by Tianjin CADC. The raw materials of the batches were from 12 slaughter and processing plants in Tianjin. Customs have reminded registered farms for live animal export for Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR on the safety requirement of feed ingredients [3*]. Taiwan suspended importation of pig blood globulin powder from the mainland [4*] and prohibited export of cloven-hoofed animals and their products from Kinmen area to Taiwan Island and outlying islands through 31 Dec 2019 [5*].

On 27 Dec 2018, MARA released the "notice on specifications for live pigs and pig products transportation" including requirements to transport pigs and pig products from a county (including county-level cities, districts) or a province (including autonomous regions, municipalities) where an epidemic zone is located. A "point-to-point" transportation of pigs between a farm and a farm or slaughterhouse is allowed if the farms and slaughterhouses meet specific conditions.

From a county with an epidemic zone, the transport is limited within the province; from a county without an epidemic zone, breeding pigs and piglets can be transported only to other provinces.

The requirements for pig farms: registered as an independent corporation, has a "Certificate of Animal Epidemic Prevention Conditions," with a sound disease management system, full-time veterinary support, no history of animal disease outbreaks for the past 3 years, no serological evidence of important diseases, and ASF tested negative.

The requirements for slaughter plants: with a "Slaughter licence for live pigs," the performance in 2017 was (more than) 150 000 pigs, no history of failure in products and no prohibited drugs or additives detected for the past 3 years. It also defines ASF sampling and testing protocol as well as requirements for transport, e.g., by registered vehicles only, not allowed to offload sick or dead pigs in route [6*].

Following assessment, epidemic zones were lifted in Fengdu County, Chongqing Municipality on 21 Dec 2018 [7*], Chengxiang District, Putian City, Fujian Province on 22 Dec 2018 [8*], Qingyang County, Chizhou City, Anhui Province; Wannian County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province; and Lianyuan City of Loudi City, Hunan Province on 23 Dec 2018 [9*], Luotian County, Huanggang City, Hubei Province on 26 Dec 2018 [10*], and in Zhenxiong County on 27 Dec 2018 and Weixin County on 28 Dec 2018 in Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province [11*, 12*], as there was no further detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within an affected zone. As of 28 Dec 2018, a total of 53 epidemic zones have been lifted.

[The above weekly update of the ASF situation in China includes, in addition to the presented excerpts, additional ASF-related information from China and FAO's recommendations regarding countries of the region, national considerations, interregional collaboration and solidarity, and a summary of FAO's actions so far. It also includes a table presenting a list of affected cities in each infected province since 3 Aug 2018, a figure illustrating the number of ASF reported village by region by onset month, and a map presenting all outbreaks since the start of the event, with the ones added during the week colored red.

During the current week, ending 28 Dec 2018, 3 new outbreaks, in 2 provinces, have been reported, compared with 6 new outbreaks/provinces in the previous week (ending 21 Dec 2018).

The FAO weekly report gives 98 as the total number of ASF outbreaks in China since 2 Aug 2018, as of 28 Dec 2018. OIE's figures somewhat differ: a total of 102 outbreaks is quoted for the said period (15 in August 2018, 15 in September 2018, 30 in October 2018, 26 in November 2018 and 16 in December 2018). - Mod.AS
