Parents urged to get children vaccinated after measles outbreak strikes in North Devon
-----------------------------------------
Public health doctors in Devon are warning parents that failing to vaccinate their children with the triple measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could leave them exposed following an outbreak in the north of the county. Measles is currently circulating in primary schools in North Devon with Park Community School having a confirmed case and a further eight suspected cases. Another 2 suspected cases are being monitored at Yeo Valley Primary School and Braunton Academy.

Doctors have sent parents letters via the schools, advising immunisation as the most effective way of reducing their risk of contracting the disease. Dr Virginia Pearson, director of public health for Devon, said, "We know that the measles virus is circulating in North Devon and so far the people affected have not been immunised or only partially immunised with the MMR vaccine. "Measles can spread quickly and easily, especially in close knit communities such as schools and community facilities which is why it is so important that children are properly immunised."

Dr. Mark Kealy, of Health Protection Agency South West added: "Measles is potentially a very serious illness which can be fatal in certain groups with suppressed immunity, such as newborn babies, pregnant women, people with leukaemia, HIV/AIDS or patients on cancer and organ transplant drugs." "By getting your children immunised you will protect them and other more vulnerable people in the community who could become seriously ill if they catch the disease." "Measles should not be taken lightly, as you can never tell when you have passed it on to someone in whom it would cause serious, maybe fatal, disease." "It is never too late to get your child vaccinated." "If they've missed out on MMR in the past it's always possible for them to catch-up - just contact your GP."

Parents are being advised to keep their children away from school and people who may be susceptible to infection for at least 5 [?days] after the 1st signs of the illness begin to appear. It is also important not to visit a GP practice with a child who has measles but to telephone ahead in the 1st instance to minimise the risk of spreading the infection.

Outbreak of measles in Kunda territory of Maniema province
---------------------------------------------------
Vice Governor Jerome Bikenge Musimbi announced on Mon 7 Jan 2013 that 5 of 6 clinical samples from Bikenge, analyzed in the laboratory of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), had tested positive for measles virus. The vice governor of Maniema invited parents in the vicinity of the Bikenge Health Area to have their children vaccinated in the fight to contain the speed of measles virus infection.

According to official statistics, 75 cases have been identified now, including one death in the Kunda Health Area, which is located located Bikenge district in the southern province of Maniema. Jerome Bikenge Musimbi asked everyone to participate actively in identifying additional cases and requested parents to take their children for immunisation.

Previously Director of the Bikenge Health Center had reported more than 50 cases of measles, including 2 deaths, in one week [see Measles update (01): Africa, Asia 20130106.1484307]. This disease attacks particularly unvaccinated children from zero to 5 years.

Measles death toll hits three
------------------------
The death toll from a measles outbreak in Hoima District has reached 3, although local leaders reported that 2 other people died from symptoms similar to those of the disease. Two of the victims aged 6 and 10, died on Saturday [5 Jan 2013] at Nyairongo Village in Kabwooya Sub County, a day after developing severe diarrhoea, Mr Vincent Opio, the area councillor, said.

The district health officer, Mr Fredrick Byenume, said the 3rd victim was a 2-year-old Congolese child who succumbed to the disease after admission at Kaseeta Health Centre on Monday [7 Jan 2013]. Mr Byenume, however, said all the victims had not been medically confirmed to have the disease. [Sever diarrhoea would not normally be indicative of measles virus infection].

Although the disease started as a strange illness in the area, tests conducted at the Uganda Virus Rsearch Institute in Entebbe last week confirmed an outbreak of the killer disease. Medical officials said those affected by the disease had either never been immunised or did not completed their immunisation schedules.

Mr Byenume said a mass Immunisation and sensitisation campaign had commenced in the affected communities. By press time, [another?] 5 patients had been hospitalised and were receiving treatment at Kaseeta Health Centre III. The district health officer said 30 other patients in Kaseeta Parish had active signs of the disease and had received treatment. He said those who had sought medication at the health facility were showing signs of recovery.

Measles claims 10 more lives in rural Sindh
------------------------------------
As the measles outbreak slithers on, the epidemic took lives of 10 more children in rural Sindh on Sunday [6 Jan 2013], taking the death toll to at least 50 since the beginning of January [2013].

Four children passed away in Badin and Thatta districts. A 4-year-old child from Pir Sikandar Shah village in Badin's Tando Bhago taluka died after suffering from the disease for over a week. The child's father, told The Express Tribune that he also lost his 2-year-old daughter a week ago due to the illness. "A local doctor was treating my children. I brought my children late for treatment," their father said, adding that his children had not been inoculated [previously]. A 2-year-old child died in Tando Bhago's Ward No 2 area, another 2-year-old died in Badin's Nindo town, and a 4-year-old died in Adam Lashari village of Thatta.

Six children have died of measles in different parts of upper Sindh. A 3-year-old and a 4-year-old died in Hafiz Suleman Dahar village near taluka Daharki of Ghotki. A 4-year-old Sudheer Sundarni died in Jurio Sundrani village near taluka Qadirpur in Ghotki, while a 3-year-old died in Akbar Khan Lashari village near taluka Thull in Jacobabad district.

In Kashmore district, a 2-year-old died in Mohammad Ali Samejo village near taluka Ghouspur and a 5-year old died in village Nasrullah Nandvani near taluka Tanrwani.

In Dadu, a district-wide measles immunisation campaign was supposed to start, after Deputy Commissioner Nasir Abbass Soomro issued directives to the health department. However, despite the passage of 4 days, the campaign has not yet begun. Soomro had asked the health team to vaccinate children in the district's schools besides initiating a door-to-door campaign.

While the death toll climbs in parts of southern Sindh, the health department appears to be oblivious to this development. Dr Aqeel Qureshi, the focal person for measles, refused to officially confirm any deaths in Hyderabad division. He said only a few dozen children had been brought to public sector hospitals and they had all been cured. "Health teams are carrying out [a] vaccination drive in villages in rural Sindh where measles cases have been reported," he added.

Curbing measles: Strategies adopted to combat outbreak
------------------------------------------------
Health experts and officials of the capital administration at a meeting held at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMA) on Tuesday [8 Jan 2013] devised short and long term strategies to prevent blowing up of measles into an epidemic.

So far, in January this year [2013], 21 cases of measles have been confirmed in the capital, the majority of which are reported from katchi abadis and rural areas where the coverage of routine immunisation is low, according to the officials affiliated with Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). [Mass migration from rural areas to cities has resulted in the proliferation of 'katchi abadis' or unplanned settlements in all of Pakistan's cities. - Mod.CP]. Tabish Hazir, head of Paediatrics Department at Children Hospital, told The Express Tribune that 2 strategies were chalked out, one for the short term to tackle the outbreak before it attains epidemic proportions and the other for the long term.

Under a short-term strategy, a liaison through a hotline service will be established between hospitals and the EPI for ensuring a quick response to a case reported from the twin cities. CDA and ICT have been asked to identify high-risk zones in their jurisdiction so that mop-up campaigns can be carried out under which all the children below the age of 15 will be vaccinated against measles, he said. All the hospitals will be given a reminder to strictly follow the guidelines meant for the treatment of patients suffering from measles.

CDA Health Services Director Dr Hassan Urooj expressed concern of a vaccine shortage in the capital if every child under the age of 15 [were to be] be vaccinated against the disease. He also said there was an acute shortage of vaccinators in his directorate. There are only 12 vaccinators in the capital which means one for 10 000 to 12 000 children which is insufficient especially during a crisis. When contacted, EPI National Programme Manager Dr Zahid Larik said at present there was no vaccine shortage in the country. "Currently, there is no vaccine shortage in any of the provinces or in the capital. There is a misconception about the measles outbreak in the country that is caused due to the shortage of vaccines which is completely wrong. It happens due to low coverage of routine immunisation and underreporting of cases," he said.

A core group comprising officials from all concerned departments will plan a mass awareness media campaign on measles and will ensure 100% coverage of routine immunisation in their areas under the long-term strategy.

The meeting was attended by the heads of the public and private hospitals, officials of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), CDA and EPI.

Measles epidemic: Officials play blame game over outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
As another 6 children died from measles during the last 24 hours, the Pakistan Medical Association (Sindh chapter) demanded that an inquiry commission be set up to fix responsibility for the unabated spread of the disease in the province. A total of 2475 cases were detected in Sindh [provnce] in December [2012] alone, according to Health Minister Dr Sagheer Ahmed. At a press conference on Tuesday [8 Jan 2013] night, Dr Sagheer said district health officers and vaccinators, the key players in the Expanded Program for Immunisation (EPI) and Peoples Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI), were responsible for the measles outbreak in upper Sindh. "They are accusing each other but they are all responsible for the situation," said Dr Sagheer, while avoiding to say what official action will be taken against them. While one of the reasons that routine immunisation has been weakened is a dispute over jurisdiction between the EPI and PPHI, district health departments are also blamed for not responding immediately to the health crisis while it was developing.

Dr Sagheer said that the virus has spread to Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions, where health departments have been ordered to set up centres for vaccination and to send teams to affected areas. The minister said 1.5 million more doses [of vaccine] have been procured from Islamabad. According to him, measles claimed 210 lives in 2012, including 93 in December [2012]. However, these figures are considered to be an underestimation by many. "If the health officials are putting the total at 300, the actual figure will be more than double of what they tell," said the chief minister's relief adviser, Haleem Adil Shaikh. The adviser asserted at a press conference that the health departments are not even maintaining a proper record of the cases and deaths reported. He pointed out that, "A belated response came after improper routine immunisation, and it let the virus [disease] exacerbate". "Shifting accusations from one department to another will not do. We demand official action against those responsible," said PMA Sindh General Secretary Dr Pir Manzoor Ali.

Karachi: 11 measles deaths in 2013, admits Health Minister
--------------------------------------------------
Sindh Health Minister Dr. Sagheer Ahmed on Friday [11 Jan 2013] admitted that at least 11 children had died so far due to measles in Sindh since 1 Jan 2013, while around 1537 new positive cases were reported over the last 10 days. "As many as 2.9 [?] children in 8 of the worst affected districts of Sindh were vaccinated. There were 425 fixed vaccination centers and 997 mobile teams working round-the-clock in these areas," the Minister told a meeting that was convened to review the measles outbreak. Dr. Sagheer Ahmed said that since the outbreak in the province during 2012, over 15 000 measles cases were reported, while deaths related to the disease were 11 in 2013. He maintained that the large-scale campaign was causing a vaccine shortage and said that the federal government, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF had been requested to provide more vials. The minister told the meeting that federal health authorities and international organisations were informed that in order to achieve the 95 percent vaccination ratio, an adequate quantity of the measles vaccine was required.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that more than 300 children have died from measles in Pakistan in 2012, a 5-fold increase from 2011. More than three quarters of death reported were in the province of Sindh. One hundred children died in the month of December [2012] alone, a SPCDPM statement said here Friday [11 Jan 2013].

The routine immunisation exercise across Pakistan reflects uneven coverage among provinces, districts and cities, with only certain important cities of Punjab recording a decent performance. The low coverage of the routine immunisation was an easily avoidable condition that has led to a measles outbreak in the northern Sindh and risks spreading in other parts of Pakistan. The figures for coverage are dismal; interior Sindh's coverage stood at 22-25 percent, while Karachi's coverage also remained at a low of 55 percent.

Official figures place coverage for Sindh at 80 percent, a blatant case of exaggeration and misleading reporting. Just recently, newspapers reported the discovery of 800 previously unreported cases of measles in Punjab.

There is strong interlink between the rain affected areas and the outbreak of measles as majority of the measles cases have been reported from the flood-affected areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Khairpur and Kashmore-Kandhkot that still have rain water standing since the devastating monsoon rains in September 2012 which caused floods. SPCDPM has urged the provincial and federal governments to take an urgent, serious and concerted effort to enhance the administration of anti-measles vaccination, and in preventing malnourishment, which currently affects children across Sindh and the rest of the country and makes them susceptible to contracting measles.

Pakistan Pediatricians Association has claimed the measles had taken lives of over 300 children in the province. Huge difference of routine Immunisation coverage between provinces, districts and cities is at the root of the current measles outbreaks.
