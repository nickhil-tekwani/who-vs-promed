A Japanese man in his 30s has been infected with West Nile fever, the
1st confirmed case of the disease in Japan, health ministry officials
said Monday.
It is suspected that the man, a resident of Kawasaki, Kanagawa
Prefecture, was infected with the disease in the United States, where
he was from late August to early September 2005, the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Welfare officials said.
He came down with a fever on returning to Japan and initially
received treatment at Kawasaki hospitals, the officials said. The man
has recovered from the fever and other symptoms, they said.
The National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other institutions
conducted tests on the man on the suspicion that he was infected with
West Nile, they said.
The man was diagnosed Monday as having been infected with the disease
as an antibody to the West Nile fever virus has been detected, the
officials said.
The man, who stayed in Los Angeles from 28 Aug to 4 Sep 2005, has
said that he was bitten by a mosquito, according to the officials.
West Nile virus can be carried by mosquitoes or birds, and humans can be
infected with it if bitten by a mosquito with the virus, according to medical
experts. The virus is not usually transmitted directly person-to-person. About
80 percent of infected patients show no symptoms, and less than 1 percent feel
seriously ill, they said. In the most serious cases, some people may die of
high fever caused by the disease and encephalitis.
West Nile fever was long believed endemic to areas in mainly African
and Middle Eastern areas. But it broke out in Europe and Russia in
the late 1990s. The 1st patient in the United States was discovered
in 1999, and the disease spread throughout the country within about 3
years. Last year [2004] the disease killed about 100 of at least 2500
people in the United States stricken with it.

[This is the 1st serologically confirmed human case of West Nile virus
infection in Japan, probably contracted in the United States during his 7-day
stay in Los Angeles. As of 27 Sep 2005, California shared 38 percent of the
national cumulative cases of West Nile fever in the USA for 2005 (681 of
1804). The index patient recalled having been bitten by "a mosquito" while
visiting LA. The odds of getting WNV are normally low, given that only 20
percent will develop symptoms. - Mod.RY]
[We thank Dr Akira Goto for sending us this report. This importation did not
pose any serious health risk in Japan, as humans are regarded as dead-end
hosts -- the level of virus in the blood stream is too low to infect
mosquitoes feeding on a patient. - Mod.JW]
[However, if a bird were to be found infected with WNV in Japan, this would be
of some concern, as it could lead to active transmission [to humans as well as
other birds]. Presently West Nile virus in Asia seems to be restricted to
Western Asia, such as the Indian subcontinent.
Japan has over 100 mosquito species in some 18 genera including species that
have been shown to be vectors elsewhere, or potential vectors, such as _Culex
pipiens_, _C. tritaeniorhynchus_, _C. vishnui_, _Aedes albopictus_, _Ae.
dorsalis_ & _Ae. japonicus_. It seems ironic that _Ae. japonicus_ an Asian
species common in Japan, that only invaded the USA in 1998, was subsequently
shown to be an efficient vector of West Nile virus in the USA.
I do not know whether _Ae. japonicus_, a daytime biting mosquito that feeds on
humans, and whose larvae occur mostly in artificial container habitats,
including tires, occurs in Kawasaki. - Mod.MS]
