About 50 basic school students in Jebel Eisa, north of El Malha in North Darfur, have been stricken by an unknown disease. Multiple sources told Radio Dabanga that the people are scared and in panic because of the "mysterious disease". The 1st symptoms appeared in the region on 25 Dec [2013].

The symptoms of the disease are pain, and spasms, or "tightened nerves", in various parts of the body, in particular the hands, legs, neck, and the mouth. The patients are not able to walk, talk, eat or drink.

The sources appealed to the authorities and UN health care organisations to visit the area, and examine the patients to diagnose the disease and define its treatment.

About 145 school students in the area of Um Jerhaman, El Taweisha locality in North Darfur, are suffering from an unknown disease that makes them faint.

The director of the Um Jerhaman basic school for girls, Ali Mohamed Ali, told reporters that 75 of the 240 pupils at the school are suffering from the disease, as well as 70 pupils of the neighbouring basic school for boys. He said that the symptoms of the disease are headaches, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, causing the students to faint. A medical team from El Taweisha that visited the area diagnosed the cases as malaria.

[The news reports above describe 2 outbreaks among school children in 2 different towns in North Darfur. The distance between the towns is unknown. One outbreak started on 25 Dec 2013 and is ongoing, involving 50 schoolchildren with an incapacitating illness characterized by pain and spasms in various parts of the body. The other outbreak of fainting, with headaches, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain involves 145 children, 75 of 240 at a girls' school and 70 at a nearby boys' school. A diagnosis of malaria had been made in the 2nd outbreak, but no mention was made of the students having fever or chills.

The outbreaks could possibly be due to an exposure to a toxin, perhaps in food or water, or the outbreaks could be due to epidemic hysteria, also called mass psychogenic illness, in which a constellation of symptoms suggestive of organic illness occurs without an identifiable cause (http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/2/233.full.pdf). Schools are frequent settings for outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness and symptoms commonly reported are nausea or vomiting, headache, and dizziness or light-headedness. A more detailed description of the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and laboratory data is clearly needed. More information on the North Darfur school outbreaks would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

North Darfur, with an estimated population of about 1.6 million (2006) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Darfur#cite_note-3), is one of the 18 wilayat or states of Sudan and it is the largest of the 5 states composing the Darfur region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan).
