New cases of bacterial infection named "scrub typhus" are being reported in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to reports, 4 cases of scrub typhus have been found in Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital Shimla [Himachal Pradesh state] on [Tue 27 Jul 2021]. The medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Janak Raj said that this infection spreads through the bites of infected chiggers.


Most patients of scrub typhus are found in mountainous areas. It is a bacterial infection, which leads to the death of people. Some of its symptoms are similar to chikungunya.

According to health experts, permethrin and benzyl benzoate should be sprayed on clothes and bedding to avoid [mites]. Along with this, if someone is found to have symptoms of scrub typhus, the person should be admitted to hospital immediately so that the treatment could be started at the earliest.

This disease occurs mainly in villages and animal contact is said to be the main reason for this bacterial infection. Scrub typhus spreads more in village areas that have a high number of livestock and wild bushes.

In scrub typhus, the patient experiences fever with difficulty in breathing, jaundice, vomiting, nausea, joint pain, or shivering. But in cases of severe infection, lumps are seen to develop on the neck, under the arms, and above the hips. Apart from this, the area or body part where the insect has bitten turns red.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792/) and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in the patients above is not stated.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Himachal Pradesh is a state in the mountainous northern part of India, situated in the Western Himalayas, abutting the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh). A map of India showing the location of Himachal Pradesh can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Himachal+Pradesh,+India. Shimla, with a population of 171 817 residents, is the capital and largest city of Himachal Pradesh. - Mod.ML
