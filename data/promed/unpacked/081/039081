A fourth central Alberta farm has been quarantined after anthrax was
confirmed there last week.
Two animals died at the Rocky Mountain House ranch, bringing the number of
dead livestock to 23, said Doug Scott of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
So far the agency has vaccinated about 650 head in the area and another
25,000 have been treated by private veterinarians.
The Clearwater Veterinary Clinic at Rocky Mountain House has run out of
vaccine and producers are on a waiting list to receive it. The producer
pays about $1 per head for the vaccine. [Very cheap protection compared to
the problems of not vaccinating.
The vaccine provides protection for 1 year from the fatal disease. Animals
vaccinated for the first time will receive a booster shot about a month
later.
Anthrax is characterized by sudden death in animals. Unclotted blood leaks
from body orifices. Any instances must be reported.
The disease is spread by spores from bacteria, which can remain dormant in
the soil for years.
All dead animals are buried in pits and incinerated on site.
