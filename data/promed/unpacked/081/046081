1. Short #Ebola thread: The case count in the Equateur outbreak in western DRC is up to 113, with 48 deaths. This outbreak is occurring in very difficult terrain; lots of distance between cases, no roads or barely passable roads in some cases.

2. DRC's legendary #Ebola expert, J.J. Muyembe, head of the country's national lab, INRB, has recently been put in charge of this outbreak. Not sure why that wasn't done from the start but Muyembe knows Ebola. Said today Ebola is now preventable (vaccine) & treatable (drugs).

3. @MTamfum is correct; #Ebola is preventable & treatable now. But I'm hearing that not that many of the patients in this outbreak have received the new therapies, which undercuts that message. Hopefully now that he's in charge, that will change & the outbreak will wind down.

MSF's approach to 11th outbreak of Ebola virus disease DR Congo in area where there is little infrastructure and villages have to be reached by canoe. Ebola outbreak in DRC has already spread to 11 health zones in the province, in a very hard-to-reach region where some villages are only accessible by river.

While the response to this new Ebola epidemic does not face the kind of security challenges that affected the response to the 10th Ebola outbreak between August 2018 and June 2020, the area nevertheless poses significant logistical challenges.

Equateur province is the same size as Iceland, with some health areas only accessible by river using canoes or after hours of difficult transport by rough roads through the forest. Only one helicopter is available to humanitarian organisations to move around the region.

Following the declaration of this 11th Ebola epidemic in DRC, MSF deployed teams to the health zones of Bolomba, Bikoro, Monieka, Ingende and Lotombe in order to curb the spread of the disease, support community surveillance and provide rapid treatment to patients living in hard-to-reach areas.

"The epidemic is moving with people by land and river, to remote areas, in a province where infrastructure is scarce and villages far from each other," said Dr Maria Mashako, MSF medical coordinator. "That's why MSF is setting up a decentralised response and deploys our teams in the most remote, affected health areas, with small structures easily accessible to the communities."

As of 1 Sep 2020, MSF teams are supporting 9 treatment and isolation centres in 5 health zones to provide care as close as possible to the active hotspots of the disease.

In Bolomba health zone, in addition to the support provided to the Ebola treatment centre at the general hospital, we set up 2 small treatment and isolation centres in the remote health areas of Boso Mondomba and Yuli.

The same decentralised approach has been adopted in the health zones of Monieka and Bikoro, where MSF is supporting 4 small care and isolation structures in difficult-to-access health areas.

These decentralised and community-based approaches to responding to the outbreak are also complemented by a vaccination programme supported by other partners in the response. Since the start of the vaccination on 5 Jun 2020, the vaccine (the ZEBOV-GP vaccine, already used in the northeastern provinces during the 10th epidemic) has been administered to approximately 26 500 people, according to official data.

[The remoteness of the area is one of the major problems exacerbating control efforts. In such remote settings, it is a challenge to totally stop transmission, and 1 case if not handled safely with all necessary precautions, will lead to others. But the approach being taken of vaccination on top of a community-based approach carries the greatest hope. - Mod.LK]

Ebola sickens 2 more in DRC outbreak; 112 total, 48 fatal [now 113]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Two more Ebola cases were confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 112, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [Tue 8 Sep 2020] in a Twitter update.

One more death was recorded, lifting the fatality count to 48. The outbreak in the country's northwest began in early June [2020], just as a large outbreak centered in North Kivu province in eastern DRC was declared over. The latest event affects the same province where a small outbreak in the summer of 2018 occurred, sickening 54 people and killing 33.

The WHO's African regional office said today [Tue 8 Sep 2020] in its weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report that the developments are worrisome, given the continued increase in cases with spread to new health areas and health zones. Responders are struggling with inadequate resources for risk communication and community engagement in hot spots, and lack of funding requires urgent attention. So far, about 27 300 people have been vaccinated, and 3 health workers have been infected.

In a related development, yesterday [Mon 7 Sep 2020] the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced more than USD 15 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help end the outbreak. The funds will help with actions such as disease surveillance, patient transportation, the promotion of safe and dignified burials, and community engagement.

Weekly Bulletin on outbreaks and Other Emergencies

Event Description. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continues to see rising numbers of confirmed cases and geographical spread, with 37 health areas in 12 health zones affected. Since our last report (Weekly Bulletin 35), another 3 additional confirmed EVD cases have been reported, and 1 new death.

As of 5 Sep 2020, there are a total of 112 cases (106 confirmed and 6 probable) including 48 deaths (case fatality ratio 42.9%). The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 39.6% (42 deaths/106 confirmed cases). The number of health workers affected remains at 3, making up 2.7% of all cases. The number of health areas that have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of this outbreak has risen to 37, in 12 of the 18 health zones in the province. In the past 21 days (16 Aug -- 5 Sep 2020), 22 confirmed cases have been reported in 14 health areas across 9 health zones.

A total of 6 out of 9 health zones with active contacts transmitted reports on 5 Sep 2020, with 89 new contacts reported. Out of 2978 active contacts, 2056 (74%) have been followed-up. Of the 113 contacts who were not seen, 44 (38.9%) have never been seen, 7(6.2%) were lost to follow-up and 62 (54.9%) were not seen in the previous 24 hours. So far, 64 contacts have left follow-up in Mbandaka and 6 others in Bikoro have become symptomatic. A total of 374 new alerts were detected on 5 Sep 2020, of which 343 were validated and 58 samples were collected.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The EV outbreak in Equateur Province continues to show rising case numbers and to spread to new health areas within new health zones. There are still insufficient funds for the response, with inadequate human resources in community engagement and risk communication, particularly in hotspot areas, while strike action by responders continues. Community resistance to sampling and safe and dignified burials also threatens the response. Continued advocacy with funders and donors for mobilization of financial resources is required, along with strengthening of surveillance at points of entry and cross border collaboration with Republic of Congo. Partners need urgently to address the issue of insufficient funds and human resources being available for response, particularly with the concentration of response efforts
