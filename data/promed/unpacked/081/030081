Hepatitis-B cases on the rise in Pathanamthitta villages
--------------------------------------------------------
The growing number of cases of Hepatitis-B infection at Pramadom, Mallasserry, Thengumkavu and surrounding villages, near here, is causing concern for the district administration and the Health Department. L. Anithakumari, Deputy District Medical Officer for Communicable Disease Control, told The Hindu here on Monday that 9 cases had been confirmed through ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test in the past 3 months. 30 more cases tested positive in the antigen card test. However, unofficial reports say the number is much higher. When the official data show that only 2 died of the infection in the past 4 months, the unofficial figure puts it at 5 at least.

Dr. Anithakumari said Hepatitis-B infection had been a major health problem at Pramadom and surrounding villages from 2003. The graph rose in 2011, with 14 patients testing positive in the ELISA test and 50 others in the card test. She said an expert team from the Government Medical College, Alappuzha, would visit the affected areas on Wednesday [2 May 2012] to study the cause of infection. She said a policy should be evolved to extend psychological support to the affected people and others. The Health Department had launched public awareness programmes and disease prevention measures. The doctor said the infection resolved itself in most people. But 5 to 10 per cent of the people developed chronic infection.

Kurien Oommen, former District TB Officer, says about two-thirds of the people with chronic Hepatitis-B infection are carriers of the virus who do not develop symptoms, but can transmit it to others. Children are at a much higher risk for chronic infection. The Health Department organised a public awareness camp at the indoor stadium at Pramadom on Monday [30 Apr 2012]. Leela Rajan, block panchayat president, inaugurated the camp. H. Salimraj, Additional District Magistrate, delivered the keynote address. P.N. Vidyadharan, District Programme Manager, National Rural Health Mission, who were among the doctors who took classes at the camp, said Rs. 119 000 lakh [USD 3 602 834] had been allocated for the ward-level health care committees in the Pramadom panchayat for disease-prevention activities.

[Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person, not through casual contact. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with the virus, and about 350 million live with chronic infection. An estimated 600 000 persons die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B. About 25 percent of adults who become chronically infected during childhood later die from liver cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by the chronic infection. The hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.

Hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine that has been available since 1982. This vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing hepatitis B virus infection and its chronic consequences. Hepatitis B is endemic in many parts of India. Most people in the region become infected with hepatitis B virus during childhood. In these regions, 8-10 percent of the adult population are chronically infected.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e., semen and vaginal fluid) of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Common modes of transmission in developing countries are: perinatal; early childhood infections, inapparent infection through close interpersonal contact with infected household contacts, unsafe injections practices; blood transfusions and sexual contact.
