[The 74 new confirmed and 377 suspected cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is increasing fairly rapidly as Nigeria enters the new period of the year when more cases usually occur. Unfortunately, one healthcare worker in Ebonyi state was infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 9 states and 29 LGAs.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts of their excreta or within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY

Plateau has recorded 17 confirmed cases of Lassa fever with 5 persons killed, according to Dr Kunden Deyin, the state's health commissioner. Deyin said on Sunday [27 Jan 2019] in Jos that 33 cases were taken to the laboratory for confirmation, and the 17 were confirmed to be cases of Lassa fever.

According to Deyin, 13 persons on admission are responding to treatment, while others have been discharged. However, he could not ascertain the number of persons discharged.

The commissioner said that 73 persons who had primary and secondary contacts with the patients were being monitored.

"The 73 persons are currently being monitored. We shall do that for 21 days, because the incubation period is from 6-21 days. After the 21 days, those not affected by the disease will be discharged from the contact tracing list and certified free of Lassa fever."

Deyin advised people with symptoms such as headache, body pain, and general feeling of being unwell to promptly report for checks, noting that prompt checks were key to reducing the mortality rates associated with the disease.

He regretted that patients usually report the matter when it was too late and called on health workers to quickly make referrals to higher health facilities when they can't handle cases presented to them. He also advised people to keep environments clean to ward off rodents and to seal grain stores.

[Some of the 17 Plateau state cases likely occurred after the 20 Jan 2019 national report above, but it is difficult to determine how many. The state has Lassa fever cases every year. Public education is essential to avoid infection from rodent sources. - Mod.TY

Ebonyi state government has confirmed the death of 2 persons in the recent Lassa fever outbreak in the state this year [2019]. The state's commissioner for health, Daniel Umezuruike, gave the confirmation in Abakaliki on Saturday [26 Jan 2019].

According to Umezuruike, 10 other cases have been recorded in the state, 5 of which have been treated and discharged. The other 5 are still receiving treatment at the Virology Centre built by the state government at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki. They are said to be in stable condition. The commissioner said the 2 deaths were a result of late presentation.

"One (of the victims) came from Enugu state. The deaths were due to late presentation; in fact, by the time the child came, he was already very bad, bleeding from different orifices, which is the terminal stage. But the medical workers tried all they could but could not save the patient. The 2nd one actually died before presentation," he said. "The confirmed cases are 12; 5 have been treated and discharged, while 5 are on admission now and doing very well."

Umezuruike said the Virology Centre, which is the only centre for such in the entire southeast, has all the facilities to treat such diseases.

"The truth is that our management in the virology centre has an almost 100% success rate because we have the dialysis machines; we have all the facilities to test immediately and confirm whether the person has Lassa fever or not."

However, he admonished residents and people of the region to always bring the suspected infected patients to the hospital on time so as to be able to save their lives. "And once you confirm and commence treatment, the prognosis is always very good. Lassa fever is preventable and curable," he said.
