On 26 Jun 2006 the Office International des Epizooties (O.I.E.) Reference
Laboratory for Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA) at the University of Kentucky
College of Agriculture's Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center confirmed
an outbreak of equine arteritis virus infection involving fetal losses
among mares on a Quarter Horse breeding farm in New Mexico.
This was based on the widespread prevalence of high antibody levels to the
virus in both mares and stallions, plus virus isolation from the semen of 2
stallions. On the same day, the outbreak was reported to the New Mexico
Livestock Board in Albuquerque, N.M., which is now investigating the
potential for spread of the infection to other premises.
The EVA Reference Laboratory is interested in receiving samples from
suspected clinical cases of EVA or from animals very recently exposed to
semen from either of the virus-shedding stallions. Veterinarians are
requested to contact the Gluck Center at (859) 257-4757 before submitting
samples.
For more information about this outbreak or about EVA, the following
resources are available: The New Mexico Livestock Board has information
regarding this outbreak on its website, which can be accessed at
<http://www.newmexicolivestockboard.com> under "critical events."
Detailed information about EVA from the USDA, including history,
transmission, symptoms, clinical signs, treatment, prevention and control
is available at

[Both the USDA-APHIS reference above and Iowa State's Center for Food
Security and Public Health provide a nice summary of Equine Viral Arteritis.
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_viral_arteritis.pdf>
Below are edited excerpts from the Iowa State summary:
The disease was first recognized in the United States in an outbreak in
Kentucky in 1984. Equine viral arteritis is characterized by fever,
depression, edema, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, and abortions.
Mortality is rare but economic losses can be significant. The economic
impact includes decreased demand for carrier stallions as breeders, deaths
in young foals, and abortions in 10-50 percent of susceptible mares.
Equine viral arteritis is caused by equine arteritis virus, a RNA virus in
the genus Arterivirus (family Arteriviridae).
Equine arteritis virus is restricted to the Equidae. The prevalence of the
virus can vary significantly among horse breeds; Standardbreds are
particularly susceptible.
Antibodies to equine viral arteritis have been found in most countries
where testing has been done. Disease outbreaks are infrequent, but have
been reported in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Austria, the
United Kingdom, and Poland.
Equine arteritis virus can be transmitted by both the respiratory and the
venereal route.
