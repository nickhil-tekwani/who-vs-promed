More than 60 students from a primary school in Taman Medan, Petaling Jaya, got food poisoning and had to be admitted to Hospital Shah Alam last Thursday [20 Jan 2022]. It is believed that the food provided by the school under the supplementary meal plan (RMT) is the cause of the food poisoning.

Allegedly, all the students had eaten the food provided, and many later showed signs of food poisoning such as vomiting. Students from Year 1 to Year 6, including those in the Special Education Integration Program (PPKI), who are part of the supplementary meal plan program were affected.

Many parents brought their children to hospitals and clinics on their own for check-up.

The District Health Office and the Ministry of Education (KPM) has been notified of the issue, and an investigation will be made.

[The time between the ingestion of the meal and the development of illness is not stated, but if it were short (generally less than a few hours), without significant fever, the cluster is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness, where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc, vomiting and diarrhea for tin, and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness.

"Petaling Jaya, commonly called 'PJ' by the locals, is a city in Petaling District, in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Originally developed as a satellite township for Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, it is part of the Greater Kuala Lumpur area."
