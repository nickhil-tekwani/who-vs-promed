According to incomplete statistics, between 11 and 22 Jun 2006 over
130 students and employees of Guangzhou University in University City
contracted influenza [i.e. an influenza-type illness - Mod.CP]. Some
patients have completely recovered but new cases are still appearing.
Guangzhou University has taken measures to prevent the further spread
of [the influenza-type illness]. According to sources [influenza-type
illness] cases have also occurred in other schools in University City.
Last night, Southern Metropolitan News obtained a copy of a document
called "Roster of Guangzhou University Influenza-type Cases" released
by the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine
University City Branch. This roster shows that from 11 to 21 Jun
2006 a total of 136 cases of [influenza-type illness] had been
identified at Guangzhou University. The vast majority of patients
were students who reside in dorms, as well as a smaller number of
employees. Knowledgeable sources say the roster does not include all
patients. Among known patients there are 2 names that do not appear
on the list. The list reveals that the earliest 2 cases occurred on
11 Jun 2006. Starting on 17 Jun 2006 the number of new cases quickly
increased. Forty-two new cases were noted to have occurred on 20 Jun 2006.
The Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine
University City Branch says that students have recently been coming
for treatment. The main symptoms are fever, suspected [of being
related to] colds. Knowledgeable sources told Southern Metropolitan
News that symptoms are not severe among the vast majority of patients
and [many] have already fully recovered. Those who have not
recovered are basically able to attend class as normal, so students
have reacted calmly to the situation.
Guangzhou University convened relevant departments yesterday to
discuss countermeasures, and requested that dormitory management
strengthen supervision over students, to report influenza cases
immediately, and to clean the dorms. Personnel responsible for
student management in each department were also informed that
students should increase ventilation in dormitories and pay special
attention to routine hygiene.
Afterward the school confirmed to reporters that there were some
students with [influenza-type illness] and that the matter had
attracted serious concern from relevant provincial and city departments.
In addition, there are other schools in University City where
[influenza-type] cases have occurred. But the detailed situation is unclear.

[ProMED-mail would welcome precise information on the cause of this
outbreak. The signs and symptoms of the illness appear to be mild and
any of a variety of human respiratory pathogens could be responsible.
It is late in the season for outbreaks of human influenza A virus
infection and the contagiousness and mild nature of the infection
eliminates bird flu from consideration.
Information from a reliable source in China, on the other hand,
indicates that the Guangzhou outbreak may be one among many influenza
outbreaks in the southern part of mainland China. In fact Guangdong
province usually has an influenza peak in the summer. Outbreaks of
this size are common. The reason for reporting of this particular
outbreak may be the recent occurrence of a human case of H5N1 avian
influenza in Shenzhen.
The city of Guangzhou is located in the southern province of
Guangdong close to the border with the Hong Kong SAR
