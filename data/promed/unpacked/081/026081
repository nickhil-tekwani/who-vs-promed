Hantavirus is also starting to crop up around the state, said Terry
Yates, an expert on the disease at the University of New Mexico
[UNM]. "We had a case at UNM Hospital just this past weekend," [16-17
Jun 2007] Yates said. "The rodent numbers last month [May 2007] when
we sampled were extremely high -- and virtually all the deer mice we
caught were pregnant."
Hantavirus is carried mainly by deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]
and a handful of other rodents. It spreads to humans through contact
with infected urine, droppings, and saliva. Symptoms include fatigue,
fever, muscle aches, chills, abdominal problems, and eventually
shortness of breath as the lungs fill with fluid.
The number of cases of the disease will likely grow in coming months
and appear in a broader range of counties, Yates said. "Plague and
hantavirus are still in the moderate range, but we're seeing it in a
larger geographic area. But next year [2008], unless something
dramatic happens with the weather, we could see the situation get
much worse. We think it's going to escalate substantially," Yates
said. "It's likely to be a much higher risk next year."
That's true with all the rodent-borne diseases -- as rodents continue
to grow fat on plants brought out by the wet spring, DiMenna
[Albuquerque environmental health supervisor] said.

[Although not mentioned specifically, the hantavirus mentioned here
is probably Sin Nombre virus. This report provides another good
example of weather effects on populations of medically important
reservoir hosts of zoonotic diseases, and how climate changes might
influence the risk of exposure to pathogens long-term. This example
is a vivid illustration that human populations are part of, not apart
from, the ecosystems in which they live. For background information
