WHO Responds To Meningitis Outbreak In Burkina Faso
---------------------------------------------------
Burkina Faso announced Tue 6 Apr 2004 that an outbreak of meningitis
had killed 45 people among 437 known cases [Panafrican News Agency, 6 Apr
2004]. Yet the strain -- which killed 1500 people 2 years ago in Burkina
Faso -- is now being controlled, the World Health Organization said on Mon
5 Apr, with a coordinated strategy to produce a suitable vaccine in record
time.
"At last, we have the tools to contain small outbreaks like this one, before
they cripple an entire region," said the coordinator of WHO's Global Alert
and Response unit, Michael J. Ryan. "Every part of the public health network
pulled together to build this system," he added. "Humanitarian organizations,
industry, international agencies, lab trainers, and private contributors have
all worked together, and through their combined efforts an enormous tragedy
in Africa may have been averted."
Meningitis outbreaks hit Sub-Saharan Africa every year, sometimes sickening
more than 100 000 people. Such outbreaks, however, had in the past been
controlled through mass-response plans. However, 2 years ago, the
W135-strain emerged in Burkina Faso, infecting 13 000 people and killing
1500 before the outbreak subsided.
WHO immediately organized partnerships to build a "mass-intervention
delivery system" to fight W135, and laboratory workers and field
epidemiologists were trained and supplied with materials to rapidly detect
and track the strain. Simultaneously, pharmaceutical partner
GlaxoSmithKline developed a new vaccine that was tested and approved in
record time and supplied it for USD 1.20 a dose after negotiating with WHO
[U.N. release, 8 Apr 2004].
The agency was able to purchase an emergency stockpile of the vaccine with
funds donated by Ireland, Italy, Monaco, the United Kingdom, Medecins
sans Frontieres, the Norwegian Red Cross, UNICEF, and private individuals
[WHO release, 8 Apr 2004].

Meningitis outbreak kills 32 in northwestern Ethiopia
-----------------------------------------------------
The Amhara Regional State's [northwestern Ethiopia] health bureau has
reported an outbreak of meningitis in 28 districts of the state's 11 zones.
The head of the disease control and prevention department, Dr Alemayehu
Seifu, told Walta Information Center on Sat 3 Apr 2004 that the outbreak
started in early January 2004 [Ethiopian calendar, mid-January] and spread to
136 neighborhoods because of the current hot and dry weather in the areas.
According to reports received from all districts, 431 people have been
infected and treated, while 32 others died while receiving treatment.
Indicating that, since mid December 2003, vaccinations were being carried out
in most affected areas -- such as Saint, Mekane Selam, Sekota, Dera, Zikwala,
[name indistinct], Ibnat, Fogera, Esete, and Lemo Kemkem districts -- the
head said that the Ministry of Health had provided enough drugs to
vaccinate 400 people.
He said there were enough drugs to deal with the disease if it developed
into a pandemic in the next few months, adding that the disease was not out
of control at the moment, and health professionals were observing the
situation.
