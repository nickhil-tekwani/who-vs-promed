Influenza Update N. 241
----------------------
Summary
Globally, influenza activity increased or remained at elevated levels in the Southern hemisphere, whereas it continued at low levels in the Northern hemisphere.

- In North America, Europe and temperate countries in Asia, influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in all regions with sporadic detections of mainly influenza B virus.

- With the exception of southern Africa, only a few countries reported influenza data. Levels of influenza activity were low or decreasing in these countries.

- In tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity was reported to be at inter-seasonal levels, whereas RSV activity had increased.

- In western and temperate countries of Asia, low levels of influenza activity were reported where influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B predominated in recent weeks.

- In tropical Asia, influenza activity remained at elevated levels. Both influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were equally dominant during the last few weeks.

- In temperate South America, influenza activity was low while RSV detections increased. However, Paraguay had decreasing RSV detections.

- Influenza activity remained elevated in South Africa with influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B co-circulating.

- In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity continued to increase and surpassed the seasonal threshold in Australia.

- National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 75 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 14 Jun 2015 to 27 Jun 2015 (data as of 9 Jul 2015 14:00 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 26 786 specimens during that time. 1476 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1084 (73.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 392 (26.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 230 (39.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 348 (60.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 62 (96.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2 (3.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Note: Global epidemiology and surveillance updates are periodically collected from data reported by national authorities or organizations responsible for reporting this data.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
------------------------------
North America
Overall, influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in all countries in North America. Both the United States and Mexico reported decreasing influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity, respectively. However, pneumonia activity in Mexico was above expected levels but was decreasing. Canada also reported decreasing influenza activity.

Europe
All regions in Europe reported low influenza activity with some sporadic influenza detections. The majority of countries have ceased or reduced reporting for the season.

Northern Africa
Northern African countries did not report in the last few weeks with only a few countries reporting up to May 2015. Influenza type A (H1N1)pdm09 was reported as the predominating strain since the peak of the season around the end of March 2015. Influenza type B co-circulated late in the season.

Western Asia
Countries in Western Asia reported low levels of influenza positivity and ILI cases. Influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 was the dominant virus detected with low co-circulation of influenza type A(H3N2) and B late in the season.

Central Asia
Influenza detections as well as ILI cases were at low levels in reporting countries in the Central Asia region. Influenza type B was the predominant virus during the last few weeks of the season.

Eastern Asia
In Eastern Asia, influenza activity remained at low levels. Japan, northern China and the Republic of Korea reported influenza type B predominating in recent weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
----------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Respiratory virus activity was low in the Andean Sub-region, Caribbean and Central America. ARI and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) activity remained low and within expected levels throughout the region. Guatemala had increased detections of influenza type A (not subtyped). However, the levels still remained low. Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru reported increasing influenza detections, but at low levels.

Central African tropical region
Influenza levels were low in both Eastern and Middle Africa, whereas levels were decreasing or remained elevated in countries in Western Africa. Influenza detections and ILI cases have decreased in Nigeria with influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 being the predominant virus during the season. Ghana reported elevated but stable levels of influenza activity with influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) predominating in recent weeks.

Tropical Asia
In South Asia, a few countries reported high influenza levels, whereas a few reported decreasing or low levels during the last few weeks.

Southern China reported high influenza positivity with influenza type A(H3N2) predominating during the last few weeks with low levels of co-circulation of influenza type B. This year's [2015] summer influenza season started earlier compared to last year's summer season. In addition, the proportion of visits to sentinel hospitals for ILI was higher than in previous years at this time of the year.

Influenza activity remained at high levels in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of China) where a high influenza positivity rate was reported. Influenza type A(H3N2) is the main circulating virus; however, low levels of influenza type B were also detected.

Sri Lanka reported high but stable levels of influenza activity. It appeared to have passed its seasonal peak. The main virus in circulation was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Bhutan and the rest of the countries in the region reported low or decreasing levels of influenza activity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant circulating virus in these countries.

The majority of the countries in the South East Asia region reported low or decreasing levels of influenza activity, with the exception of Singapore, which reported elevated levels of influenza activity. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated during the season with low levels of co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B. However, ILI rates in Singapore have recently decreased.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
--------------------------------
Overall, the Southern hemisphere reported increasing influenza activity. However, countries in temperate South America reported low influenza activity.

Southern Africa
In South Africa, influenza activity remained at elevated levels, while RSV detections increased. There was a equal predominance of both influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) in circulation, with low circulation of influenza type B virus.

Oceania Melanesia and Polynesia
Influenza activity continued to increase in Australia with influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) being the predominant strain in circulation. Influenza activity mainly increased in the southern states and territories. In New Zealand, influenza activity remained below the seasonal threshold but continued to increase. Both influenza type A(H3N2) and B viruses predominated equally in recent weeks. In the Pacific Islands as well as French Polynesia, ILI activity remained low.

Temperate South America
Data from the temperate South America region indicated that influenza activity was at low levels in the majority of reporting countries. Some countries reported increasing ILI activity due to increasing levels of RSV activity. Paraguay had increasing ILI activity, but overall activity remained at low levels. RSV detections decreased in Paraguay.

Source of data
-----------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
