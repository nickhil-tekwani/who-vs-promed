Wheat farmers in parts of the Upper Midwest, especially south-central North Dakota, are reporting above-average incidence of ergot this [2018] harvest. That, in turn, has led some grain elevators to impose discounts on, or even reject, some newly harvested wheat infected with the disease.

It's too early to say how widespread the problem [is]. Ergot-infected grain can be cleaned by grain elevators or farmers with the proper equipment. Because of its health risks, there are strict thresholds -- 0.05 per cent by weight for wheat in food. Cleaning infected grain can bring it below those thresholds.

"This (ergot) is frustrating," especially when it wasn't expected to be a problem, says Jim Peterson, North Dakota Wheat Commission. Ergot generally is associated with cool, wet weather, and the region's 2018 crop season has been mostly hot and dry overall.

Fungicides aren't thought to be effective in managing the disease, and there aren't any wheat varieties with known resistance to it, says North Dakota State University.

[The parasitic ergot fungus _Claviceps purpurea_ has a wide host range including about 60 genera of grasses (family of Gramineae). Rye and triticale are the most frequently affected crops, but wheat, barley and pasture grasses can also be affected. Sclerotia ("ergots") left behind in the field or pasture serve as sources of infection for the next season's crop.

Infection reduces grain yield and the fungus also produces mycotoxins contaminating the harvested grain. The ergots are highly poisonous and can cause serious effects in humans and animals (see links below). Ergot contamination detected in grain samples may also be due to ergot in grasses which are growing as weeds amongst the crop. Ergot alkaloids are also used for pharmaceutical applications and ergots are grown commercially for this purpose. The species has variable morphology and can be separated into 3 discrete groups based on host species and toxins produced.

Disease management mainly relies on prevention and may include the use of certified seed, cultural practices, phytosanitary measures (to reduce inoculum levels), crop rotation and fungicide treatments of seed and planted fields. Barley varieties with reduced levels of ergot sensitivity exist, research to develop resistant varieties of all affected grain crops is ongoing.

A related fungus, _C. africana_, causes ergot of sorghum.
