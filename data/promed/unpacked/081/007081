years; range: 17 to 73 years) subsequently had West Nile fever.
Dead Birds
----------
In addition, during 2004, a total of 4400 dead corvids and 1054 other dead
birds with WNV infection have been reported in 45 states and New York City.
Equines
-------
WNV infections have been reported in horses in 35 states.
[Details of the numbers and distribution of equine cases can be obtained by
accessing the APHIS-USDA map
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/wnv/map2004.html>.
As of Wed 22 Sep 2004 (the last date of update), the total number of equine

<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>.
[The above report is supplemented by a figure showing the location of the
40 states reporting cases of human WNV infection in relation to the states
reporting non-human cases of WNV infection only and the 3 remaining states
still to report human cases of WNV this year.
During the past 7 days, the number of human cases has increased by 180 from
1604 to 1784, and the total number of WNV-related deaths has increased by 8
from 48 to 56. The District of Columbia has been added to the list of
states reporting human cases of WNV infection in 2004. - Mod.CP]

Oregon: West Nile Virus Detected in Blood Donor
-----------------------------------------------
A Jackson County blood donor is the 2nd person in Oregon to test positive
for West Nile virus, according to public health and American Red Cross
officials. "The test indicates this person, who was not ill, was infected
with West Nile virus," said Emilio De Bess, D.V.M., epidemiologist in the
Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS). "This person's blood donation
will not be used," said DeBess. "The test was done as part of routine Red
Cross screening of blood donation. The nation's blood supply has been
tested for West Nile since July 2003."
The blood supply is routinely tested for West Nile virus because recipients
of blood and blood products can acquire the illness from an infected donor.
"This shows that the processes in place to assure safety of the nation's
blood supply are working," said Mel Kohn, M.D., state epidemiologist. "It
does not in any way signify there is a risk of acquiring West Nile from
giving blood. We continue to advise people to give blood, as there is
always a need for it." Any blood that tests positive is eliminated from the
supply, according to Kohn.
"This case is a reminder to residents that they should get the habit of
protecting themselves from mosquito bites," said Jim Shames, M.D., Jackson
County Health Officer. "Many _Culex_ species mosquitoes, which are the
primary carriers of West Nile virus, will survive over winter as adults,"
said Shames. "It's very important to eliminate breeding sites this fall and
especially next spring."
DeBess said that in 2003, of those individuals identified as having an
exposure to West Nile in blood screening -- 89 percent -- reported no symptoms.

Connecticut: Figures Show Dramatic Drop in Virus Presence
---------------------------------------------------------
West Nile Virus appears to be on the decline in Connecticut and across the
northeast, say experts. Figures show that the number of infected
mosquitoes, birds and humans in the state has fallen this year, Theodore
Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station, said on Wed 22 Sep 2004. "The question that we're all
going to be trying to deal with here is: Is this decline we're seeing
real?" Andreadis said.
"I don't think the virus is going to disappear. What we may see on an
annual basis is low levels of activity." It is possible that birds, which
carry the virus, are developing an immunity to it and so fewer mosquitoes
develop [transmit] the disease, Andreadis said.
In 2002 and 2003, there were 17 human cases of West Nile each year in
Connecticut. This year [2004] there has been one, and the person likely
contracted the virus in the western part of the country, health officials
have said. In Connecticut, the number of birds with the virus is down by
more than 500 from 2003 to 18 birds. The high point came in 2000 when 1039
sick birds were found. The state's mosquito-trapping program has also
turned up fewer insects [mosquitoes] with West Nile virus infection, down
from 71 in 2003 to 41 so far in 2004, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Thu 23 Sep 2004

[The following figures have been extracted from the Resumen Epidemiologico file
(<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls>)
accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico. -
Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 23 Sep 2004, the figures remain unchanged from those reported on
Tue 9 Sep 2004; i.e. a total of 210 individuals resident in 25 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 209 were
seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of Sonora
exhibited signs of disease. [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486]
Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 23 Sep 2004, a total of 2706 (an increase of 307) horses from 30
of the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection. Of these animals 2040 (an increase of 277) were seronegative and
666 (an increase of 30) were seropositive. All these animals were
asymptomatic.
Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 23 Sep 2004, a total of 738 birds from 7 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 685
were seronegative and 51 were seropositive (and considered to be
asymptomatic), and one case in the state of Sonora and one case in the
state of Baja California exhibited signs of disease. (Previously both birds
appear to have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive
birds were detected in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro and
Yucatan.
[Sonora state, where the single human case and one of the 2 avian cases
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA. The majority (35 percent) of the seropositive equines were reported
from Sonora state. - Mod.CP]
