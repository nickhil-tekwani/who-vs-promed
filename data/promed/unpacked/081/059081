BLASTOMYCOSIS - ILLINOIS, USA (2)

From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>

According to the Communicable Diseases Manual, the fungus is found in moist
soil, particularly wooded areas along waterways and undisturbed places such
as under porches or sheds.
The disease has an indefinite incubation period,
from a few weeks to months: the median is 45 days.
The acute form of the disease may present with a sudden onset of fever or
cough. It can spontaneously resolve afer 1-3 weeks of illness. But, more
commonly, the onset is "indolent" and the disease evolves into a chronic
form in which the disease spreads from its pulmonary site, causing skin
lesions, usually on the face and fingers, and may be accompanied by weight
loss, weakness and low-grade fever. Untreated, it usually results in death.
Occurence of the disease is sporadic and uncommon. It has been seen in
central and southeast U.S., Canada, Zaire, Tanzania, South Africa, Israel,
India and Saudi Arabia. It is rarely found in children and is more frequent
in males.
The disease commonly occurs in dogs and has been reported in
cats, a horse, a captive African lion and a sea lion.
It is not directly
transmitted from animal to person, or person to person: transmission is by
breathing in spore-laden dust.
Treatment of choice is Ketoconazole or
Itraconazole, except in very seriously ill persons with brain lesions, in
which case amphotericin B (Fungizone) is indicated.
