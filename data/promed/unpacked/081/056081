The presence of melamine hazardous to health has been confirmed on
reexamination in China-made Yashili-1, Yashili-2, and Sweet Baby-2 powdered
milk, advisers said on Monday [3 Nov 2008].

Health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman
said at a press briefing further examinations were carried out in Thailand
on samples, which tested positive.

Samples of powdered milk of 8 brands were sent to 3 laboratories of the UN
Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) Bangkok regional office for
reexamination. The results of the tests reached authorities on Sunday [2
Nov 2008]. The FAO tests did not find melamine in the 5 other brands.

Before the FAO tests, a test at Dhaka University had found melamine in
those 8 brands. Two other laboratory tests found melamine in only one
brand, Yashili-1.

The High Court on 23 Oct [2008] ordered the government to immediately stop
the sale, marketing, and display of 8 foreign brands of powdered milk --
Australia's Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, China's
Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2, and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified
Instant and Anlene. The government, accordingly, banned sales and marketing
of those powdered milks.

A high level meeting at the health ministry decided on Monday [3 Nov 2008]
to review the tests results. After the meeting the health adviser said, "As
the results of the 3 tests conducted in the country laboratories varied,
the samples of those 8 brands were sent to FAO for reexamination. Three
more tests were conducted at the Bureau of Quality and Safety of Food,
Department of Medical Science and Department of Public Health, Thailand."

"Four out of 6 tests provided identical results -- 67.33 milligrams
melamine per kilogram in Yashili-1, 0.02 mg per kg in Yashili-2, and 0.28
gm per kg in Sweet Baby-2 powdered milk." [Another site

has slightly different figures: 0.28 mg/kg in Yashili-2 and 0.20 mg/kg in
Sweet Baby-2. - Mod.SH]

Shawkat Ali said melamine was not found in the 5 other Australia, New
Zealand, and Denmark-made brands. The governments of Australia, New
Zealand, and the European Union sent a letter to the Bangladesh government
assuring it of no possibility of melamine presence in their brands, the
health adviser said. The next step will be taken in line with the court
directive and the government is preparing to submit a report through the
attorney general in a day or 2, the adviser added.

About the rumour of [the presence of] melamine in raw milk, the health
adviser said, "The government has been keeping an eye on the issue. The
government is putting more emphasis on local production of child food
instead of import." Asked about the acceptable level of melamine in human
body, he said there was no internationally determined level. Some countries
fix the acceptable level of melamine on the basis of body's weight.
"However, Bangladesh government wants to ensure zero level of melamine in
child food." About the test conducted at the Dhaka University, Shawkat Ali
said the equipment there was not capable enough to test the presence of
melamine.

The commerce adviser said the court would be informed of the presence of
melamine in the 3 China-made powdered milks. "After the next directive of
the court, import of these milks will be totally banned."

Presided over by Shawkat Ali, chief adviser's special assistant Mahbub
Jamil, health secretary AMM Nasiruddin, director general of health
department SM Faiz, and others were present at the meeting.

Melamine is not soluble, but if it is very concentrated it forms into
crystals. Permanent liver damage can be caused when crystals suddenly form
into large numbers of tubules in the kidneys of children that have consumed
melamine, causing chronic kidney failure and requiring dialysis and even
kidney transplants later on in life.

Melamine-contaminated biscuits still for sale
---------------------------------------------
A product contaminated with melamine is still being sold in the US. Crispy
Jacobina Biscuits in 3.88 oz packages tested positive for melamine by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The biscuits are sold through
Everlasting Distributors Inc. of Bayonne, New Jersey, a major distributor
of Chinese food products in the US. The company issued a press release
through the FDA dated [29 Oct 2008] about the contaminated biscuits.

However, as of 2 Nov [2008], no notice was posted on the company's website
about the contaminated biscuits and the product was still for sale.

No illnesses associated with the biscuits have been reported yet.

Melamine is an industrial chemical that is not intended for human
consumption and has caused over 50 000 illnesses in China. It can cause
kidney crystals, kidney stones, and death in high enough doses when
consumed over a prolonged period of time.
