A Bahraini has died in hospital nearly a week after eating spoiled pre-made
sandwiches at a wedding in Safala village, near Sitra. But Sulmaniya
Medical Complex officials said the 23 [year old man], might still be alive
if he had not refused to be admitted to the hospital with a fever on
Thursday. He returned later the same day when the fever was worse but
hospital staff were unable to save him. Accidents and Emergency Unit
chairman Dr Aziz Hassan said it was still not certain whether [he] died
from the effects of food poisoning or from complications related to his
sickle cell anaemia.
Dr Hassan said [the patient] was first treated at the hospital for mild
food poisoning symptoms after eating the sandwiches on June 28, 2002. He
was discharged on the same day. However, [the patient] returned to the
hospital at 1 AM on Thursday morning with a high fever. [He] was sweating
profusely and the emergency staff saw him and immediately referred him to
an internal medical specialist.
"He was then advised by the doctors to be admitted to the hospital but he
refused," said Dr Hassan. At 8 PM that evening, [he] returned to the
hospital in a worse condition. "The emergency staff gave him all the
necessary treatment," said Dr Hassan."He was very sick and as they were
taking him to the Intensive Care Unit, he died." Dr Hassan said that
because [the patient] had earlier refused treatment and gone home, hospital
officials did not yet know whether his fever had been caused by food
poisoning or whether the food poisoning had aggravated his sickle cell
anaemia condition.
Doctors are currently testing [the patient's] blood to determine the cause
of death. "We will need to wait until we get the full results to determine
what really happened and why he died," said Dr Hassan. More than 700 cases
were reported to the Health Ministry following the wedding on June 28,
2002. A hospital spokesman said that all of the other food poisoning
patients had been treated and released.
The sandwiches served at the wedding were reported to have been
contaminated with salmonella. Investigations are continuing into the cause
of the contamination. The sandwiches served contained eggs, cheese, and
mayonnaise. The Health Ministry has warned the public that moist food, such
as the sandwiches served at the party, is more likely to become
contaminated than dry food.

[This death associated with an outbreak of probable salmonellosis could
possibly have been prevented had the patient received adequate rehydration
early on in the course of his illness. His pre-existing sickle cell anemia
would have made him more vulnerable to the lack of early fluid and
electrolyte replacement. Further information from official sources about
this outbreak, such as the type of salmonella, would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
