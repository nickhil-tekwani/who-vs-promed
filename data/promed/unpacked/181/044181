In all, 37 severe cases of encephalitis--meningitis are being treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases of Viet Nam National Children's Hospital, reported Phu Nu Viet Nam (Viet Nam Women) newspaper. Of all these cases, 2 children were diagnosed with the deadly Japanese encephalitis, a contagious [infectious] disease carried by mosquitoes. Both were not vaccinated properly, or possibly not at all.

A 13 year old from Hai Duong Province was hospitalised after suffering from acute fever and convulsions. The child was reported to be nauseous, unresponsive to antipyretics and experiencing headaches. She then had doctors at a provincial hospital test her condition, and perform a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) puncture before diagnosing her with the disease and moving her to the Viet Nam National Children's Hospital. Even while receiving respiratory help and being treated with anti-edema drugs for 10 days, the child's condition remained unstable.

Another child suffering from Japanese encephalitis, a 15 month old child from Bac Ninh Province, was luckier, acquiring a stable state of health after just 4 days of similar treatment.

Japanese encephalitis is a malicious disease with a high risk of fatality (25--35 per cent [of encephalitis cases]), according to Do Thien Hai, vice chairman of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the National Paediatrics Hospital. He warned that the disease is difficult to diagnose in its early stages since the symptoms resemble common infections, but after 2 or 3 days discernible signs begin to emerge, such as sudden high fever, nausea, dry vomit and dull reactions.

The disease advances so quickly and severely that children may experience tremors, fall into a coma, or even die after just a day or 2, Hai said. What's more, complications that follow may impair patients' capabilities to communicate or work, he added.

The most efficient preventive step against Japanese encephalitis is through a proper vaccination process of 3 shots: the 1st shot being given while the child is one year old, followed by the 2nd after a week or 2, and the 3rd a year later. Hai suggested that 5-7 years after that, the child will become vulnerable to the infection again, so the process must be repeated until the child turns 15.

Experts suggest sleeping with a mosquito net to refrain from being bitten [by mosquitoes]. When children are feverish or show signs of central nervous system damage, they should be hospitalised promptly for timely diagnosis and treatment.

[The transmission season for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in Viet Nam is under way for this year [2018]. Occurrence of sporadic cases of JE in Viet Nam at this time of year is not surprising and more cases are likely to occur over the next several months. Viet Nam is endemic for the virus, which has birds (especially herons and their relatives) as reservoirs and pigs as amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes in the _Culex_ genus are virus vectors, and are abundant in wetlands such as rice paddies. Vaccination is the best way to prevent infection with the virus.
