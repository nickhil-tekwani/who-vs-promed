Three points of clarification with this recent posting, and a question.
1. Bluetongue viruses are transmitted by biting midges (biting flies) of
the genus Culicoides, not by mosquitoes. In southern Europe, the vector
would most likely be _C. imicola_.
2. In addition to sheep, bluetongue is lethal for certain species of
wildlife, especially white-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_.
3. "The bluetongue virus" is not correct nomenclature since there is more
than one serotype. As stated, there are 24 serotypes of bluetongue virus
worldwide. Each serotype is distinct. For those interested in issues
related to precise viral nomenclature, see:
Calisher CH. A suggested simplified system of nomenclature. In: Walton TE,
Osburn BI (editors). Bluetongue, African horse sickness, and related
orbiviruses. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 1991.
Do we have any indication of the serotype of bluetongue virus responsible
for this activity? It would not be surprising if this activity were an
extension from recent activity in Sicily and southern Italy.

[There was a question as to which vector was actually responsible for the
virus in France. The article indicated mosquitoes and although we are aware
that orbiviruses are transmitted by the midge, there was the question of an
exact vector. As to the serotype responsible for this outbreak, we do not
yet know. ­ Mod.TG
