Cameroon fears imminent hunger
------------------------------
There are fears of imminent and unprecedented hunger and reduced
farmers' income in most parts of Cameroon, particularly in the North
West and South West regions, as a disease of cocoyam [taro] is
spreading. The yet to be identified disease attacks colocasia leaves
turning them a brownish and/or reddish colour, which makes
photosynthesis impossible. The colocasia plant is an important staple
food and income-earner for many ethnic peoples in the South West and
North West regions and many other regions in Cameroon.

"The disease is already causing hunger that is hitherto unknown in
the area, and farmers' income is already seriously affected. We can
no longer produce enough to eat and sell. [It should be noted that]
our area is the main breadbasket for the local population [as well
as] neighbouring countries like Nigeria, Gabon, and Equatorial
Guinea, for colocasia and other food crops," a chief from the South
West region said.

The worries if something is not done urgently to control the disease,
were also underscored by the Institute of Agricultural Research for
Development, IRAD, and the South West Regional Delegation of
Agriculture and Rural Development [SW-DARD]. Dr Amayana Adiobo, IRAD,
described the outbreak as serious. He, however, regretted that they
do not yet have the means at their disposal to immediately follow up
on the disease outbreak.

SW-DARD added that the disease is very serious. However, they called
on farmers not to panic because the situation has already been
reported to the Vice Prime Minister who is taking steps to check the
outbreak that is a serious concern for the government. They also
said, it is yet to be identified whether the disease is of fungal or
bacterial origin, but steps shall be taken both for its short term
and long term control and possible eradication.

[Cultivated taro is classified as _Colocasia esculenta_ (family
_Araceae_), but the species is considered to be polymorphic with
several variants grown in different regions. It is an important
tropical crop worldwide and a staple food in many poor areas. Corms
are used for starch, but processing is required due to the presence
of oxalates, and leaves can be eaten as a vegetable. Other crops in
the family include giant swamp taro (_Cyrtosperma_ species) in the
Pacific and dasheen (_Xanthosoma_ species) in southern America. These
crops are often regarded as a food "bank" since they can continue to
grow in the ground for many years and be available when other crops
may have failed.

Serious problems of taro due to several fungal, viral, and bacterial
pathogens have been reported from Oceania, Asia, and Africa. An
undiagnosed disease with suggested fungal cause has been reported as
emerging in Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo
since 2000 (see link below), but it is not clear whether this is the
disease referred to above. The photograph of affected taro in
Cameroon supplied with the news story above resembles symptoms of
taro leaf blight caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora
colocasiae_ which is one of the most important diseases of the crop
in the Pacific region. However, this is not sufficient for disease
identification and molecular techniques are needed for a reliable
diagnosis of the problem in Cameroon.
