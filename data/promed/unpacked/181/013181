The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) today [4 Sep 2014] announced that the harvesting of oysters and hard clams from particular areas in the Town of Huntington [Suffolk County, New York] is temporarily prohibited, effective at sunrise on Friday, 5 Sep 2014. The closures are due to reports of foodborne illnesses associated with consumption of shellfish from harvest area NS-3. DEC is taking precautionary measures necessary to protect public health until a determination is made that shellfish do not pose a threat to shellfish consumers.

The ban on the harvest of oysters affects approximately 4400 acres. It includes all of Long Island's Centerport Harbor, Duck Island Harbor, Northport Bay, Lloyd Harbor and that portion of Huntington Bay lying south of a line extending easterly from Target Rock, near Lloyd Neck, to the north side of the beach pavilion at the Town of Huntington's Hobart Beach, on Eatons Neck. The ban on the harvest of hard clams affects approximately 2300 acres. It includes all of Centerport Harbor, Duck Island Harbor and Northport Bay.

Laboratory tests have determined that a number of the illnesses were caused by the marine bacterium, _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a naturally occurring marine bacterium generally associated with warm water conditions. _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ (Vp) is not associated with sewage or stormwater contamination of harvest areas.

When ingested, Vp may cause diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by abdominal cramps, fever and chills. Symptoms usually occur within 24 hours of ingestion and full recovery may take up to a week. More severe illness may occur in people with compromised immune systems or underlying chronic diseases.

This is the 1st time that DEC has implemented closures in these areas in Huntington due to Vp illnesses. Closures due to Vp illnesses were implemented in Oyster Bay Harbor [Nassau County, New York] in 2012 and in Oyster Bay Harbor and Cold Spring Harbor [Suffolk County, New York] in 2013.

DEC reminds all shellfish harvesters to shade their shellfish catch from the sun. Commercial harvesters should use ice or other means of chilling their catch onboard their harvest boats. Shellfish should be stored in self-draining containers, never in standing or stagnant water.

[Eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the Northern Hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore.

Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism, as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _E. coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aid to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). - Mod.LL]
