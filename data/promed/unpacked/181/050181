Stranded whales show species is recovering.
The large number of sperm whales becoming marooned around the British coast
could be a sign that the species is recovering after the end of hunting in
the 1970s. Findings by British and Dutch scientists challenge
environmentalists' claims that the many strandings in recent years are
linked to man-made ills such as overfishing, global warming and pollution.
It seems that there are more sperm whales than before in the North Sea and
that they occasionally get stuck in coastal waters. The researchers analysed
records of beached whales going back to the 16th century. Chris Smeenk, of
the Natural History Museum in Leiden, found that in certain years there were
an unusually large number of strandings. Peter Evans, of Oxford University,
said that periods when there were few strandings were those when hunting had
curbed whale numbers. Dr Evans co-ordinates the Sea Watch Foundation, whose
volunteers record whale sightings. He said there was no evidence that dead
whales had absorbed high levels of pollution. The end of hunting had led to
more competition between male whales, with those who headed north finding
food scarce in winter. He and Dr Smeenk suspect that young males swim into
coastal waters in search of food.
