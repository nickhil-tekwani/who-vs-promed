The laboratory-confirmed SARS case-patient in North Carolina (NC) is out of
isolation and recovering well at home. No secondary cases have been
detected but 2 cases of special interest were investigated. Both special
cases had weak epidemiological links at the workplace to the case-patient,
but the case-patient was asymptomatic on his last day at work. One special
case was released from investigation when the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) test on oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens was positive for
mycoplasma. The second special case was a man who died of pneumonia and
adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on Friday 13 June. Antemortem
PCR and serological tests were negative for SARS-related coronavirus. An
autopsy was performed on Saturday and lung tissue was sent to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention for histopathology, immunocytochemistry
(ICC), and PCR. 39 people (38 health care workers and 1 patient) who were
exposed to the deceased and who did not have proper personal protective
equipment remain in quarantine.
NC public health officials would appreciate any international assistance
with experience with autopsies of SARS patients. Does a negative assay for
SARS-CoV nucleic acid and antigen in lung (PCR, ICC) absolutely rule out
SARS as a cause of death?

[ProMED-mail would appreciate any information regarding Dr Engel's query.
Replies may be sent directly to Dr Engel as well as to us. Since no
diagnostic test provides 100 per cent sensitivity, negative assays are
unlikely to completely rule out the diagnosis of SARS in this second case.
The specific histopathological findings may be helpful as well as the
identification of any alternative diagnoses as in the first "special case".
