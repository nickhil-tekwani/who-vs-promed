Iquitos [Loreto Region] is suffering the ravages of the highest river water levels in the past 25 years and some predictable consequences, such as the current outbreak of leptospirosis, are already occurring.

It is important to call attention to this issue because, while the population is concerned about dengue fever and authorities are focusing their efforts on fumigation, not enough attention is being paid [to the outbreak of leptospirosis].

Doctors at the health posts and centers in the region of course continue to regard any fever with thrombocytopenia as probable dengue fever, which is not wrong, but this is delaying the suspicion of leptospirosis and severe cases are already arriving at health centers (if there is no alert, health care workers will not consider the diagnosis of leptospirosis in a timely fashion.)

So far this year [2012], in the Loreto Regional Hospital [HRL] alone we have treated 5 patient of severe pulmonary leptospirosis (with pulmonary hemorrhage) who recovered in the intensive care unit [ICU]; a probable fatal case referred from a private clinic, awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis; and a current patient who is in critical condition in the ICU-HRL (22 Apr 2012). In addition, a man from Nauta with febrile icteric syndrome (confirmed by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]) died today [22 Apr 2012] with a diagnosis of severe leptospirosis and renal failure, and 2 young men with lung injury remain in hospital but they are in stable condition thanks to the timely suspicion and medical attention.

According to information from infectious diseases colleagues there is a similar case in HAI [Iquitos Support Hospital] and a case from Yurimaguas with acute renal failure treated in Tarapoto, who recovered satisfactorily.

Regional statistics
-------------------
According to the EW9-Loreto [epidemiological week 9, ending 3 Mar 2012] report from DIRESA [Regional Health Directorate], cases of leptospirosis have increased by 427 per cent compared with 2011. [The report table can be seen at the source URL above.] (There are no data after EW9 and the report is no longer available from the DIRESA website.)

National statistics
-------------------
The DGE [General Directorate of Epidemiology] epidemiological bulletin for EW14 [week ending 7 Apr 2012; figure available at the source URL above] shows that as of 7 Apr 2012, 306 cases of leptospirosis have been reported (there were 404 cases in all of 2011.)

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic, but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira.

Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals -- for example, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy farmers, rice and sugarcane field workers, and military personnel. It is a recreational hazard for those who participate in outdoor water sports such as swimming, rowing, or whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a disaster. The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

A new leptospire, provisionally named _Leptospira licerasiae_ serovar Varillal strain VAR 010T has been found to be a significant cause of acute leptospirosis in the Peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos; about 60 per cent of patients with an undifferentiated febrile illness of 2 weeks or less duration and a negative malaria smear in the Iquitos region developed high titers of MAT antibodies only against this new serovars, or had mixed reactions with the new serovar and other serovars with diagnostic titers highest against the new serovar (Matthias MA, Ricaldi JN, Cespedes M, et al. Human leptospirosis caused by a new, antigenically unique _Leptospira_ associated with a _Rattus_ species reservoir in the Peruvian Amazon. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2008; 2(4): e213. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000213. Available at http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000213). To assess the incidence of leptospirosis in the Iquitos region therefore would likely require incorporation of this new serovar into serological testing of patients presenting with acute febrile illness in this region.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotic may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is doxycycline 200 mg, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

The Peruvian Selva, which makes up almost 60 per cent of the country (http://www.virtualperu.net/selva.html), is the rainforest region in the north and eastern part of Peru, and in which 2 big rivers, the Maranon and the Ucayali, flow together to form the Amazon River (http://www.amazonrivercruise.com/map.cfm). Loreto, one of Peru's 25 regions (formerly departments), covers most of the north eastern portion of Peru; for a map of the regions of Peru see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Peru.

Loreto has wide river flood plains, which are covered with rainwater and usually are swamped (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreto_Region). Most of the rain occurs between January and June; monthly rainfall is greatest in March (http://pdacrsp.oregonstate.edu/pubs/peru.pdf). Iquitos, the capital of Loreto, is located on the Amazon River, but is unreachable by road. Nauta is a small river town located near the confluence of the Ucayali and Maranon Rivers, about 100 km (62 mi) south of Iquitos. Yurimaguas is a port located at the confluence of the Huallaga and Paranapura Rivers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Huallagarivermap.png), with river traffic arriving from Iquitos. Tarapoto, the largest city in San Martin Region, is located on the high jungle plateau in the valley to the south east of Loreto, where the 2 rivers, the Cumbaza and Shilcayo, meet. - Mod.ML
