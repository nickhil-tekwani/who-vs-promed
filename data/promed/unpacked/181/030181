Agriculture Minister confirms banana and papaya plague
-------------------------------------------------------

Both farmers and Minister of Rural Development Eva Ortet confirmed the existence of an unknown disease attacking banana and papaya tress on the island of Santiago [Sao Tiago]. The area of greatest concern is Ribeira dos Picos Engenhos, in the municipality [county] of Santa Cruz.

According to the Ministry of Rural Development, the disease is attacking banana and papaya plants in various parts of Santiago. It causes black blemishes to appear on both banana and papaya trees.

According to Ortet, Ministry officials and the National Institute of Agrarian Research and Development are working to discover the identity of the disease.

[Similar symptoms are reported on both banana and papaya, and some fungal and bacterial pathogens exist that may affect both hosts. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the possibility that the crops could be affected by different pathogens. Reliable diagnosis on both hosts will be essential for disease management.
