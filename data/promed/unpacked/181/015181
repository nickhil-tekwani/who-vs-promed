The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been advised by the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) of an outbreak of the mosquito borne viral disease, chikungunya fever, in the State of Yap.

According to health officials, more than 340 suspected cases have been identified on the main island of Yap and several of the smaller islands.

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet, chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya [virus infections].

The disease occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In recent decades mosquito vectors of chikungunya have spread to Europe and the Americas. In 2007, disease transmission was reported for the 1st time in Europe, in a localized outbreak in north-eastern Italy.

The CDC notes there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya [disease]. People can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.
