Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ Infections Among
Competitive Sports Participants - Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
& Los Angeles County, 2000-2003
------------------------------
Although outbreaks of methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA)
usually have been associated with health-care institutions, MRSA is
emerging as a cause of skin infections in the community. This report
summarizes several reported clusters of skin and soft tissue
infections associated with MRSA among participants in competitive
sports and identifies possible risk factors for infection (e.g.,
physical contact, skin damage, and sharing of equipment or clothing).
The findings underscore 1) the potential for MRSA infections among
sports participants; 2) the need for health-care providers to be
aware that skin and soft tissue infections occurring in these
settings might be caused by MRSA; and 3) the importance of
implementing prevention measures by players, coaches, parents, and
school and team administrators.
Fencers
------
In Feb 2003, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
was notified by a local health department about a cluster of MRSA
infections among members of a Colorado fencing club and their
household contacts. After club leaders reported 5 cases of infection
to the local health department, all members (n=70) of the fencing
club were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions
about infections and possible risk behaviors such as sharing of
clothing or equipment. A total of 62 (89 percent) fencers responded
to the survey. No additional cases were identified from the survey.
A confirmed case of MRSA infection was defined as signs and symptoms
of an infection (e.g., fever, pus, swelling, or pain) during Jul
2002-Feb 2003 in a fencer or household contact of a fencer from whom
MRSA was cultured from a clinical isolate. A probable case was
defined as skin or soft tissue infection during the outbreak period
in a fencer or household contact of a fencer from whom no clinical
culture was obtained. 3 confirmed and 2 probable cases were
identified; 1 patient was a household contact. Median age of patients
was 31 years (range: 11-51 yrs); 3 (60 percent) were female. 1
patient had paraspinal myositis with bacteremia and was hospitalized
for 11 days. The other 4 patients reported 1 to 6 abscesses each,
located on the legs or thighs (n=4), abdomen (n=3), axilla (n=1),
buttocks (n=1), hand (n=1), and behind the knee (n=1). 3 (60 percent)
patients were hospitalized and received intravenous antimicrobial
therapy. 2 of the patients with confirmed cases reported recurrent
infections for which they received antimicrobial therapy and made
multiple health-care visits before their wounds were cultured. All
patients have recovered.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing was performed on
isolates from 2 patients; an isolate from one of the patients with a
confirmed case was not available. The PFGE patterns from both were
indistinguishable. Facilities at the fencing club included changing
rooms and practice areas. No showers were available. Although none of
the fencers with infections reported sharing clothing, masks, or
weapons, such sharing was common among team members. In addition,
fencers wear a sensor wire under their clothes to record when they
have been touched by an opponent's weapon. Interviews with club
members indicated that these wires were shared routinely and had no
routine schedule for cleaning. No other common sources of exposure
outside of the fencing club were identified.
Club members, coaches, and administrators were instructed in MRSA
transmission control measures. These included 1) increased hand
hygiene, 2) showering with soap after every practice or tournament,
3) covering cuts and abrasions with a bandage until healed, 4)
laundering personal items such as towels and supporters after each
use, 5) cleaning or laundering shared athletic equipment such as pads
or helmets at least once a week but ideally after each use, 6)
establishing a routine cleaning schedule for the sensor wires, and 7)
consulting a health-care provider for wounds that do not heal or
appear infected. No further infections have been reported.
Football Players & Wrestlers
-----------------------
Clusters of MRSA infection among sports team participants were
identified during September 2000 in Pennsylvania and during the fall
and winter of 2002-2003 in Indiana and Los Angeles County,
California. Affected persons included college and high school-aged
football players and wrestlers; the numbers of infected members per
team ranged from 2 to 10 players. During September-October 2000, CDC
assisted the Pennsylvania Department of Health in an investigation of
an outbreak of MRSA culture-positive skin and soft tissue infections
among 10 members of a Pennsylvania college football team, 7 (70
percent) of whom were hospitalized. All isolates from the
Pennsylvania athletes had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. Several
possible risk factors for infection were identified, including skin
trauma from turf burns and shaving and sharing of unwashed bath
towels.
In September 2002, the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services investigated two cases of MRSA skin infection among members
of a college football team. Both patients were hospitalized; one
received surgical debridement and skin grafts. Isolates from the 2
players had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. Team players reported
frequent skin trauma and reported covering wounds approximately half
of the time. In addition, health department staff identified the
potential for spread through shared items such as balms and
lubricants.
In January 2003, the Indiana Department of Health was notified of 2
wrestlers on a high school team who had MRSA skin infections
diagnosed. Neither patient was hospitalized, and isolates were not
available for PFGE testing. The 2 players were in different weight
groups and had never wrestled each other, suggesting that
transmission could have occurred through sharing items rather than
direct contact. No other common exposures were identified.

MMWR Editorial Note:
-------------------
Outbreaks of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) occur in various
populations, including children attending child care, prison inmates,
and men who have sex with men (1-3). This report demonstrates that
CA-MRSA has the potential to spread and cause outbreaks among players
of competitive sports, including those sports that involve little
skin-to-skin contact among players, such as fencing. Physicians
should be aware of the potential for MRSA infections in sports
participants when evaluating patients and making treatment decisions.
As demonstrated by this cluster of MRSA infections among fencers,
patients with recurrent MRSA infections might make multiple
health-care visits before a wound culture is obtained. Recurrence of
infections might be avoided if physicians obtain cultures more
routinely when athletes have infected wounds.
Transmission of _S. aureus_, for both susceptible and
antimicrobial-resistant strains, usually occurs through close contact
with a person who has either a draining lesion or asymptomatic
carriage of _S. aureus_. Although the investigations described in
this report did not determine the roots of MRSA transmission
definitively, 3 factors might have contributed to transmission in
these outbreaks. First, competitive sports participants might develop
abrasions and other skin trauma, which could facilitate entry of
pathogens. Even in sports with less direct contact, protective
clothing can be hot and might chafe skin, resulting in abrasions and
lacerations.
Fencers reported developing skin rashes frequently under protective
clothing. Second, some sports for which MRSA infections have been
reported involve frequent physical contact among players (e.g.,
football and wrestling). _S. aureus_ and other skin flora can be
transmitted easily from person to person with direct contact. Third,
sports such as fencing have limited skin-to-skin contact but require
multiple pieces of protective clothing and equipment, which often
might be shared. The use of shared equipment or other personal items
that are not cleaned or laundered between uses could be a vehicle for
_S. aureus_ transmission.
Previous outbreaks of staphylococcal skin infection have been
reported among wrestlers and rugby and football players (4-7). In
these outbreaks, risk factors have included skin trauma (4,7) and
contact with lesions of other players (7). The findings in this
report, particularly the cluster of MRSA infections among
participants in a sport with little skin-to-skin contact, suggest
that sharing equipment or personal items also might facilitate MRSA
transmission. Although none of the fencers reported sharing equipment
or clothing items, their use of shared sensor wires was not assessed
specifically.
Maintaining good hygiene and avoiding contact with drainage from skin
lesions of other players are the best methods for preventing spread
of staphylococcal skin infections. Guidelines for preventing skin
infections among sports team participants should be followed (6-10).
All persons associated with competitive sports teams, including
players, coaches, teachers, parents, and administrators, can help
prevent sports-related skin infections and should be aware of
prevention measures (For box, see MMWR web site). Sports team
administrators should be encouraged to provide facilities and
equipment necessary to promote good hygiene, such as clean facilities
and adequate supplies of soap and towels. Coaches and parents should
encourage good hygiene among players, and they should be taught to
administer proper first aid, practice appropriate hand hygiene, and
implement a system to ensure adequate wound care and to cover skin
lesions appropriately before play. Players should be encouraged to
practice good hygiene, avoid sharing towels or other personal items,
and inform coaches about active skin infections. Additional

[This CDC report further reflects the increase in community-acquired
MRSA infections. The recent CA-MRSA isolates do not have connections
to health care, where hospital MRSA strains could have been acquired
and are genetically different. IN CA-MRSA strains, the _mec_ gene
-- which causes resistance to all beta-lactams by a change in
penicillin binding proteins -- is contained in a gene cassette
substantially smaller than any of the 3 associated with hospital
strains. Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) appears to be frequently
if not uniformly associated with CA-MRSA strains, as compared with
hospital strains, which could produce increased virulence in CA-MRSA.
In addition, unlike hospital strains, CA-MRSA isolates are often
resistant only to monobactam antimicrobials and retain sensitivity to
other agents including clindamycin.
No information is given in the CDC report as to whether these strains
are clonally identical (by PFGE or spa typing) to any of the
well-characterized strains of CA-MRSA. - Mod.LL]
