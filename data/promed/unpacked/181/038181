13 Cases of Meningitis Prompts Closure of Private Clinic in Algeria
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities said the Amina clinic in the town of Chiffa was closed by authorities as a precautionary measure following the detection of 13 meningitis cases. According to Dr. Zenati Ahmed, the director of health in the city of Blida, the cases of meningitis have been reported in patients who sought treatment at the clinic.

Based on health records, the 1st patient came in on 6 Dec 2012, although the alert was issued on 24 Dec 2012 following the diagnosis of additional cases. The patients were then transferred to a hospital in the town of Boufarik. Since then, 2 patients died including a 57-year-old woman and a 27-year-old man. Ahmed said that an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the outbreak or potential contamination in the clinic. He added that the investigation was initiated by the specialized services of the Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform, aside from investigations by other relevant authorities.

It is worth mentioning that this is not the 1st time that health authorities are shutting down a private clinic due to a possible disease outbreak. In 2008, the clinic Rosiers Blida was also closed down.

[The news report above does not indicate the microbial etiology in the 13 meningitis cases in the Algerian town of Chiffa. Algeria is not one of the countries in the African meningitis belt. The African meningitis belt, which is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis, lies in the sub-Saharan region of Africa (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm).

The news report above also does not clearly state if the 13 cases were admitted with meningitis that was acquired in the community or were admitted to the hospital for some other diagnosis and acquired meningitis only after admission to the hospital. From the news article, there seems to be some implication of "potential contamination in the clinic" that prompted closure of the clinic as a "preventive" measure. (See ProMed-mail posts of the nosocomial fungal meningitis outbreak in the United States this past year.) A clarification of these issues would be appreciated.

Blida, with a population of 265 000, is a city in Algeria, located at the base of the Tell Atlas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blida). It is the capital of Blida Province, and it is located about 45 km (28 miles) southwest of Algiers, the national capital. Chiffa is a town in the Tell Atlas Mountains of northern Algeria, about 9 km (5.6 miles) west of Blida (For a map of this area, see http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/algeria_Distance_Result.asp?state=20&statename=Blida&fromplace=Chiffa&toplace=Blida&fromlat=36.4619444&tolat=36.4686111&fromlng=2.7419444&tolng=2.8288889).
