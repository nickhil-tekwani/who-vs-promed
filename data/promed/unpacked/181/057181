'Freak' factors in anthrax death
-------------------------------
A "freak" set of circumstances led to the death of a Borders man who
inhaled anthrax [spores], a sheriff has found. Sheriff Edward Bowen
QC said 50-year-old Christopher "Pascal" Norris had been "the wrong
person in the wrong place at the wrong time."

A fatal accident inquiry was held after Mr Norris, of Stobs near
Hawick, died after inhaling anthrax in July 2006. Instruments from a
drumming class, which he had recently attended later tested positive
for spores. Mr Norris was the 1st person to die of anthrax in the UK
in more than 30 years, and the 1st death by inhaling the spores in
more than 100 years. His death was the subject of a fatal accident
inquiry in Edinburgh in November [2008].

Sheriff Bowen has now delivered his findings, in which he decided not
to recommend tighter rules on importing African drums to the UK. He
said anthrax was "not a major public health problem" and added that
African drum users should not be overly concerned about the risks.
"The circumstances in which Mr Norris came to be infected themselves
demonstrate the 'freak' nature of the event," he said. "Many other
people were exposed to the risk of anthrax infection from the same
source without coming to harm." The sheriff said the acquisition of
anthrax infection by inhalation was "an extremely unlikely
occurrence" and should not cause concern among people using African drums.

The inquiry heard how traces of anthrax were found on drums used in
classes held in the Borders. It sought to establish why Mr Norris was
the only person out of dozens who attended events in Kelso and
Smailholm to be infected. "It is not possible to say how Mr Norris
came to be infected -- it is quite conceivable that he could have
been infected if he had swept the floor in Smailholm village hall,"
said the sheriff. "He did not need to be playing any particular drum
for infection to have occurred."

Sheriff Bowen said Mr Norris's earlier bout of leukaemia in 2002,
from which he was in remission, could have made him more susceptible
to the bacteria. "Overall, putting the matter in simple terms, not
only was Mr Norris in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he was
probably the wrong person to be there," he said.

The sheriff said banning the importation of drums was not the answer.
"Short of an outright ban on the importation of animal skin products
into the UK it is difficult to see what steps could be taken to
eliminate the risk of repetition," he said. "Having regard to the
level of risk, such a step would be wholly disproportionate."

Mr Norris's brother, Michael Norris, said he hoped the case would
encourage other drummers to take steps to have their drums tested for
anthrax. "I would agree that you wouldn't get very far trying to
limit the importation of skins because they would still come in," he said.

Investigations are currently ongoing into the death of drum maker
Fernando Gomez from anthrax in London last year [2007].

[There is a very similar report in The Telegraph. I suspect that they
copied from the same court news release
(<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4527107/First-British-anthrax-death-in-30-years-due-to-freak-circumstances.html>.)

A not unexpected finding in the light of Norris being the only person
affected among dozens attending drumming classes in Kelso and
Smailholm. There is no information on whether the authorities bled
his classmates for the presence of antibodies, and thus of a
subclinical exposure. If there is another of these events, this
should be something the investigators might want to keep in mind to
do. It is not unlikely that the HPA authorities will come up with a
similar decision in regard to Gomez where the exposure, from all
accounts, was also minimal.

Making the importation of goat hides from West Africa illegal would
merely drive them underground. It would do nothing to stop this
trade. Also it would put a brake on the ability to trace sources in
another outbreak, as folk would not want to be fined for importing
such hides by revealing such an action.

While I am disappointed by the Scots' inability after 2 years to
provide any medical insights as to how this came to be a singular
case when many were exposed, it does make the point that with
pneumonic anthrax many are called but few are chosen, either because
they had a massive exposure or, contrariwise, it was minimal and
these had some inherent disabilities that prevented them clearing
their lungs of the spores and or handling the germination of the few
spores inhaled. Put another way, the latter are valuable but tragic
human canaries for risk but should be regarded in a balanced manner,
as done by Sheriff Bowen. We need more Sheriff Bowens. - Mod.MHJ]
