Henrico County police said today [17 Sep 2009] a rabid raccoon was
confirmed in the Varina area. Officers from the animal protection unit
were called on Monday after a resident shot what appeared to be a sick
raccoon and placed it in a plastic bag. The carcass was tested because
it had been handled, and was confirmed positive for rabies yesterday.

Police said the county Health Department was notified so it could
contact the resident and determine medical treatment.

Authorities said this was the 14th confirmed rabies case [in an
animal] in Henrico this year [2009].

Henrico [County police] reminded residents that if they must handle a
carcass to use rubber gloves or a plastic bag to prevent exposure to
rabies.

There are various strains of rabies, and while this is likely a
raccoon strain of rabies, it is always important to identify the
strain of the rabies affecting the animal. It may well help the
community to understand where the reservoir for the disease is. Some
strains such as raccoon rabies will spill over into dogs. There is
also a bat strain which can spill into companion animals and other
animals.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is helpful with
strain typing the virus. - Mod.TG]
