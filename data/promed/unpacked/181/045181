Details of the diagnosis of Q fever, in recent cases from Wyoming.
---------------------------
The diagnosis was made at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory based
upon the history and gross and histological lesions observed, namely
necrotizing placentitis in several goats with intralesional (intracellular)
organisms within trophoblasts. Immunohistochemistry for _Coxiella burnetii_
was strongly positive on the organisms within trophoblasts, while
fluorescent antibody tests and isolation attempts for _Chlamydia psittaci_
were negative. Bacterial culture and virus isolation yielded no other
infectious agents commonly associated with abortion in goats. Serology was
not used to make the diagnosis of Q fever, as a positive serologic test in
and of itself does not definitively support Q fever as the cause of
abortions. Serological testing on the goats is still in progress.
