New mold attacks corn and soybeans
----------------------------------
A new species of _Pythium_, a water mold that attacks soybeans and corn in
saturated soils, has been identified in Ohio. Anne Dorrance, Ohio State
University, says _Pythium delawarii_ was labeled as a new species when its
characteristics didn't match any of the more than 200 described _Pythium_
species. There are at least 24 species found in Ohio that affect corn and
soybeans.

"_Pythium_ species have different shapes of mycelium and fruiting
structures. This new species didn't fit any of the known _Pythium_
descriptions," says Dorrance. "The final evidence was the DNA sequencing,
which didn't match any of the described species. It was proof that we
indeed did have something that wasn't in any of the data banks."

_Pythium_ pathogens attack via the plant roots. They are one of the major
causes of crop replants, and are becoming more economically important
because of the continued rise in seed costs. "Producers can't afford to be
replanting their crop due to disease issues," says Dorrance.

The new _Pythium_ species was isolated from an Ohio field that experienced
persistent stand establishment problems. So far the new species has been
identified in a small number of locations across the state and doesn't
appear to be very aggressive. "But it is an unusual species in that it
thrives in warmer temperatures later in the season on older plants," says
Dorrance.

The discovery would aid in future management of _Pythium_ diseases and help
in the breeding of new cultivars for resistance and new chemistries for
seed treatment compounds. "Right now we are looking at how fungicides
affect it and studying the current germplasm for resistance," says Dorrance.

[_Pythium_ fungi cause damping off, root rots, and blights leading to
serious problems in a wide variety of agricultural and horticultural crops.
On maize and soybean seedlings, _Pythium_ species can cause pre- and
post-emergence damping off during cold and wet weather in spring. The fungi
are soilborne and can also be dispersed by water and mechanical means. Crop
rotation is not always effective in controlling _Pythium_ diseases because
its effect on pathogen populations can vary. Fungicides, seed treatments,
biocontrol agents, and use of resistant crop varieties may also be useful
for disease management.
