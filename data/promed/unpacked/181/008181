Potato cyst nematodes (_Globodera rostochiensis_) Kurgan oblast, Russia
----------------------------------------------
According to Maxim Plotnikov, the deputy chief supervisor of plant
quarantine, Regional Management of Russian Supervision, 2 settlements
in the Katajskiy region (Ushakovskoe and Ilinskoe) are under
quarantine due to the presence of potato cyst nematodes
Potato cyst nematodes are also present in Kargapolsky, Belozersky and
Shadrinsky districts of the region. In the village of Olhovka in the
Shadrinskiy district, experts have recorded the presence of potato
cyst nematodes for about 10 years. A quarantine has been imposed on
18 areas.
The 1st time agronomists tried to control the nematodes with
chemicals did not bring appreciable results. Then experts located
foci of infection and distributed nematode-resistant cultivars at no
charge to residents.
Crop losses were estimated to be from 30-80 percent due to the
nematode infestation. [There has been?] introduction of specific
potato varieties that contain substances that ward off the pathogen.

[The Kurgan region is located in the southwest of the West Siberian
plain. It borders the Sverdlovsk Region in the north and northwest,
the Chelyabinsk region in the west and southwest, Kazakhstan in the
south and southeast, and the Tjumen region in the east and northeast.

[Potato cyst nematodes [PCNs] are major pests of the potato crop in
cool-temperate areas. Because of the present pathotypes, no resistant
cultivars are available for planting. This is more serious in the
case of _G. pallida_. The amount of damage, particularly in relation
to the weight of tubers produced, is closely related to the number of
nematode eggs per unit of soil. It has been estimated that
approximately 2 t/ha of potatoes are lost for every 20 eggs/g soil.
Up to 80 percent of the crop can be lost when nematode populations
are raised to very high levels by continual potato cultivation.
Control is traditionally by crop rotation, which in the absence of
potato cultivation will reduce nematode populations significantly. 7
years without potatoes is a common recommendation.
More recently, crop rotation has been supplemented by use of
nematicides (fumigants or granular systemic compounds). Integration
of these methods can be used to keep the nematode population levels
below economic thresholds. Control on tomatoes is chiefly by soil
fumigants.
Both PCN species are A2 quarantine pests for EPPO (OEPP/EPPO, 1978;
1981). They are also of quarantine significance for APPPC and NAPPO.
In addition, _G. rostochiensis_ is a quarantine pest for CPPC and
IAPSC.
PCN are already established in most or all areas in the EPPO region
that are important for the cultivation of potatoes for consumption or
the production of starch; therefore, regular attention to control is
needed in such areas. Where domestic legislative measures are in
force, import regulations are justified to ensure comparable
standards for imported material. It is essential that seed production
areas be kept as free as possible from these nematodes.
_G. pallida_ is generally less common than _G. rostochiensis_ in most
of the EPPO region (with the exception of the southern part of the
UK) and is absent from some countries. It therefore merits greater
attention from the phytosanitary standpoint. At some time in the
future, it may be worthwhile to consider the individual pathotypes as
being the quarantine organisms, rather than the 2 species themselves.
It is obvious that some pathotypes are very widely distributed, and
furthermore some are more economically important than others.
Unfortunately, information is still limited on the precise
distribution of the pathotypes.
