The Health Department is on high alert in the district after the death of 3 members of a family at Perambra [Kozhikode district, Kerala] due to fever over the past fortnight.

Excise Minister TP Ramakrishnan, who is the Minister in charge of the district, held meetings with senior officials on [Sat 19 May 2018] to take stock of the situation.

Sources in the department said that a man, 26, another, 28, who are brothers, and a woman, 50, their paternal aunt, of Panthirikkara Sooppikkada in Changaroth grama panchayat, near Perambra, died on 5, 18, and 19 May [2018], due to viral encephalitis with myocarditis. A man, 55, father of the men, and one of the men's fianc√©e, 19, are undergoing treatment at private hospitals in Kozhikode and Kochi.

A staff nurse at a cooperative hospital at Perambra and another relative who participated in the funeral ceremonies too are undergoing treatment.

Blood samples of the deceased have been sent to the virology lab at the Kasturba Medical College, Manipal [Karnataka], and results are awaited.

The medical officer in the local health care unit has been asked to prepare a list of those who closely interacted with the deceased and keep them under observation. Local residents have been asked not to consume fruits half consumed by birds. Acute encephalitis cases should be referred to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

Screening of migrant labourers, reduction of sources causing viral diseases, and awareness programmes would be intensified, the sources said.

Meanwhile, the Health Minister's office urged people not to get carried away by the rumours flying thick and fast in the social media that the dead were suspected to have been infected with Nipah virus.

The messages being spread claim that the presence of the virus had been observed in areas such as Kuttiyadi, Kadiyangadu, and Perambra.

Some people are also circulating the description of Nipah virus infection from the website of the World Health Organisation. Sources in the Health Minister's office told The Hindu that there was no reason to panic and the officials were keeping a vigil.

The Kerala government on [Sun 20 May 2018] urged the Centre to rush a team of experts after panic gripped many areas of the northern part of the state following the death of 8 people in Perambra in Kozhikode district in the last 2 weeks after they were infected with an unknown virus.

An official of the health department said 8 people are critical while 25 others are under observation. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja on [Sun 20 May 2018] said the cause of death remains to be ascertained, and urged people not to spread false news about a rare virus being responsible.

"The samples of the infected have been collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology (in Pune) [national reference laboratory]. We are expecting results in a couple of days."

Among those undergoing treatment are a nurse who attended to one of the deceased and 4 other family members. Of the dead, 3 belong to a family [mentioned in the report above] and 3 others of a family, who were on ventilators and who have not been identified yet, died on [Sun 20 May 2018], officials said.

[These cases could be caused by a variety of pathogens. Laboratory confirmation (or exclusion) is necessary to determine if these cases are due to Nipah virus infection or something else. In the past, Nipah virus infection has been confirmed as the cause of 5 previously undiagnosed cases of illness in the Nadia district of West Bengal. Should Nipah virus infection be confirmed, source of the current outbreak and the involvement of bats, pigs, and domestic cats and dogs have still to be established. Giant fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_) are reservoirs of Nipah virus in Bangladesh and Malaysia, and are likely to be in India as well. Further laboratory information is awaited. - Mod.TY
