You seem to have misunderstood the news item published in Devdiscourse, Asian News International.

The 9 deaths reported is the season's total (compared with more than 200 last year, 2019). This 9 includes the 6 and 2 cases that you refer to in the text, with appropriate news media references. Of these 9, 2 were from neighboring districts (Vaishali and East Champaran) and 7 from Muzaffarpur district, within which is the city with the same name, where the SKMS Medical College Hospital is located.

It is clearly mentioned in one newspaper report that for one child the doctor did not give the recommended correct treatment of 10% dextrose, and later the child died. Now, the recommended treatment of 10% dextrose is for "hypoglycemic encephalopathy," which is the annually recurring "AES" in Muzaffarpur district (see Sarkar A, Datta D, Datta SK, John TJ. Acute encephalopathy in children in Muzaffarpur, India: a review of aetiopathogenesis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2020; 114: 704-11. https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/traa036).

Hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar.

These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts.

[ProMED appreciates Dr. John's correction of the misinterpretation of the previous report in ProMED post Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and regrets any confusion that the post may have caused.

Especially noteworthy in Dr. John's comments is identification of hypoglycemic encephalopathy as the etiology of cases often referred to as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The article that Dr. John cites provides useful information about the occurrence of hypoglycemic encephalopathy and the mechanism involved in the pathophysiology. The abstract from that reference by Sarkar et al., cited above, follows:

Abstract
--------
The acute encephalopathy occurring in children in Muzaffarpur, India, also recognised in other litchi-cultivating areas of India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and China, had previously been linked to litchi consumption. Recently, it has been identified as hypoglycaemic encephalopathy of an unusual aetiology with 3 key factors: undernutrition, prolonged fasting and litchi consumption. A 2nd set of investigators has independently reconfirmed the diagnosis and the 3-factor aetiology. Skipping the evening meal with an intake of large amounts of litchi in undernourished children is causative. Early-morning hypoglycaemia with an inadequate glycogen store leads to initiation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation, but methylene cyclopropyl alanine and glycine present in the litchi aril block the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. The outcomes are uncorrected hypoglycaemia and encephalopathy due to the entry of metabolic intermediates that cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal function. Suggested measures include early 10% dextrose infusion. Awareness about the disease is of prime importance. The diagnosis and aetiopathogenesis are still under question from a part of the scientific community. This review was undertaken to present a comprehensive view of hypoglycaemic encephalopathy and to remove some of the lingering doubts.

One hopes that this publication will lead to prompt diagnosis of litchi-related hypoglycemic encephalopathy and the recommended treatment. It would be helpful if this term is used for the disease rather than acute encephalitis syndrome/AES, which does not indicate the etiology involved in these cases. In areas in northeastern India where Japanese encephalitis is endemic, laboratory diagnosis will be important for establishing the correct diagnosis, provision of appropriate treatment and implementation of appropriate preventive measures. - Mod.TY
