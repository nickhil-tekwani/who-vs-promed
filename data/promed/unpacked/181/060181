Maize Dwarf Disease hits Kenya-Uganda border towns
--------------------------------------------------
Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) has raised an alarm
over the outbreak of Dwarf maize disease in towns bordering eastern
Uganda and called for concerted efforts to contain the scourge.

KEPHIS Managing Director, Dr. James Onsando, said the disease that
has hit parts of Busia County could spread to other parts of Western
Province if no urgent effort was instituted to ensure maize products
from Uganda were scrutinized before they were allowed into the country.

Dr. Onsando sounded the warning after touring [eastern] Uganda. He
said they had informed the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute and
Uganda National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) to ensure
the disease was contained early to avoid it spreading in Uganda and Kenya.

[In 2010, _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV; genus _Fijivirus_) was
reported for the 1st time in Africa from western Uganda (ProMED-mail
post 20100730.2552) with yield losses of 20-30 percent (see link
below). Besides maize, MRDV can also affect oats, rye, barley, wheat,
rice, and several grassy weeds. It is spreading in parts of Europe
and Israel and as Mal de Rio Cuarto strain in Argentina and Uruguay,
while maize crops in China are suspected to be affected by the
closely related _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV). MRDV
symptoms on maize include thickening and chlorosis of leaf veins,
leaf roll and enations (distortions) of younger leaves, stunting and
reddening of plants, and malformation of ears or no ears at all.

MRDV is transmitted by several planthoppers (family _Delphacidae_)
including the small brown planthopper _Laodelphax striatellus_ (which
is also a vector of other important cereal viruses). Insects remain
infectious for life and can be spread with plant material or on air
currents over long distances. The virus can also be transmitted by
mechanical inoculation, but not by grafting, seed, or contact of
plants in the field. Disease management may include phytosanitation
and quarantine measures (as suggested above), vector control and use
of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Since
cultivars resistant to MRDV are not yet available for Africa,
insecticide sprays against the vectors would currently appear the
best option but may be difficult to implement under the local conditions.
