[3] USA (Ohio): food plant outbreaks
Date: Wed 20 May 2020
Source: The Courier [edited]
https://thecourier.com/coronavirus/2020/05/20/outbreak-reported-at-mccomb-food-plant/


Health authorities are investigating 2 separate COVID-19 outbreaks at Ohio food plants, including Hearthside Food Solutions in McComb.

The Ohio Capital Journal cited a Tuesday [19 May 2020] morning health alert regarding the Hancock County food plant that manufactures brand-name cookies and crackers.

Hancock Public Health declined to provide the Ohio Capital Journal any information regarding the scale and timing of the outbreak.

"We are currently working with the company to prevent further spread in the community," Chad Masters, director of health promotion and planning for HCPH, told the news outlet.

The Clark County Combined Health District has identified 20 cases of COVID-19 associated with Dole Food Company's Springfield salad plant, a department spokeswoman told the Ohio Capital Journal Tuesday [19 May 2020]. Of the 20, 12 are Dole employees and 8 are contacts of employees. The 1st case was detected on 22 Apr [2020].

Nationally, the food industry has proven especially vulnerable to the virus's spread, according to a database from the Food and Environment Reporting Network, updated 19 May [2020]. At least 16 485 workers (14 839 meatpackers, 1074 food processors, and 572 farmers) have tested positive. At least 66 have died.

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200520-covid-19-sitrep-121.pdf?sfvrsn=c4be2ec6_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 20 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr Carissa F. Etienne highlighted that addressing COVID-19 will require protecting vulnerable groups including women, underprivileged populations, indigenous populations, and migrants, by addressing health, social, and economic inequalities.
- WHO has published a new Case Report Form for "suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19" intended for use by public health professionals for collecting standardized data on clinical presentations, severity, and outcomes.
- Uganda commissioned the 1st Port Health COVID-19 laboratory at the main Uganda-Tanzania border in light of potential COVID-19 importation by truck drivers. Two GeneXpert machines will be used to test all truck drivers arriving at the Mutukula point of entry, where results will become available within 45 minutes.
- A doctor from Cairo, Egypt, describes how he became infected with and recovered from COVID-19 and highlights the need for healthcare workers to practice basic infection, prevention, and control measures when interacting with patients.
- Evidence from social science can help officials develop and implement policies in ways that are more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs.
- In the 'Subject in Focus' below, we look at how WHO is implementing the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda to translate evidence from the social sciences into action:

Subject in Focus: Infodemics Management - Social science evidence in outbreak response

To tackle the health, social, and economic challenges of COVID-19, decision-makers need data and research from many different disciplines. At the Global Research and Innovation meeting held in Geneva on 11-12 Feb 2020, over 400 scientists, member state representatives, public health professionals, donors, and private sector representatives came together to agree on priorities to accelerate research for the COVID-19 response.

Social science was one of the 9 research areas that featured on the meeting's agenda. Social science is a broad disciplinary field that includes anthropology, psychology, behavioural science, political science, and social epidemiology. Evidence from social science can help officials develop and implement policies in ways that are more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs and to the realities of where and how people live, think, and act, as individuals and as a group.

A technical working group of social scientists across the world's regions was convened to guide and support further development of the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda. The aim of this group is to translate evidence from the social sciences into action that can inform response strategies by developing and sharing protocols, tools, and technical expertise, for example on key considerations from social science on public use of face masks, immunity passports, homecare, routine immunization programmes, and vaccine implementation.

The group achieves its objectives through collaboration and by coordinating action with other initiatives, including with the research arm of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The COVID-19 Research Roadmap highlighted the need for social science research in 3 priority areas: 1st, research about the impacts of COVID-19 and the public health response, including secondary impacts, will help countries at different phases of the response to learn from others. This is key to informing and tailoring local and national responses. For example, research on how public health lock-down measures have affected mental health and household incomes can help officials plan how best to support communities once these measures are lifted. Under the COVID-19 Research Roadmap, a research group in China is studying the lessons learned following the public health measures taken in that country.

2nd, research on health systems and models of care in different regions will enable adaptation and efficiencies specific to the COVID-19 healthcare response. Research in this area can help officials plan best approaches for managing patient flows and also provide the right support to those providing care in formal and informal community settings. A review of different models of homecare is currently underway to identify and share best methods for low-resource settings. Working with infection prevention and control experts, a research protocol guidance document and data collection tools have also been developed to study the views of health workers on infection prevention and control procedures and on their well-being. Research groups in different regions are implementing this study and are meeting regularly to share experiences, results, and learning.

3rd, research on the flows of information, misinformation, and disinformation, and on effective approaches for addressing stigma, will help science-based information and recommendations reach intended audiences. Data-driven insights can help officials tackle the infodemic and implement strategies to build trust.

Across all these areas, there is an essential need to define and prioritize vulnerable populations so that evidence can inform policy development which accounts for and meets their needs.

The working group continues to collaborate with colleagues working on different technical areas and groups -- immunization, ethics, gender, maternal and child health, and sexual and reproductive health, to name a few -- informing social science evidence in the work of WHO. A toolbox on good participatory practice for COVID-19 clinical trials and on working with community advisory boards for COVID-19-related clinical studies is also now available.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 20 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA]
