[According to China's official reports to the OIE, the epizootic of FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, genotype/strain SEA 97 started in pigs in Guangdong on 18 Feb 2013. In view of the data accumulated since -- including detection of outbreaks in several provinces throughout China, as well as the penetration of this strain into Russia (Zabajkal'skij Kray) at the beginning of March 2013 -- it may be plausible to assume that the Chinese epizootic may have started earlier and that its spread is of wide dimensions. Stamping out of some outbreaks, in the absence of vaccine, may not be sufficient to control this strain from continuing and intensifying its spread within the susceptible ruminant and porcine populations. Its continued spread in Tibet may threaten neighbouring countries. Hopefully, a potent vaccine will become available very soon and consequently be widely applied. - Mod.AS
