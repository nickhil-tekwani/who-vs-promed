A virus partially blamed for a worldwide amphibian decline has made its way to Delaware and the region, killing tadpoles and raising fears it will spread to reptile species.

The ranavirus, a type of virus that affects cold-blooded species, has been found in wood frog tadpoles in all of Delaware's counties and 8 in Maryland. And there is concern it could impact iconic reptile species like the Eastern box turtle or endangered species like the bog turtle.

"Of 23 Delaware ponds tested in 2013, ranavirus was detected in 14-61 percent -- and amphibian die-offs were recorded for 2 of those during the sampling period," said Holly Niederriter, wildlife biologist with the state's Species Conservation and Research Program.

In addition, a dead bog turtle found 3 years ago in Delaware likely died from a predator attack but it was infected with ranavirus, herpes, and mycoplasma, she said.

Tracking the potential impact on relatively secretive turtle species is difficult, she said. That is why she is out again this year [2014] resampling ponds and is finding similar signs of the virus.

She said that infectious diseases such as ranavirus -- which is likely spread by contact with contaminated water or sick or dead tadpoles -- are a large cause of the worldwide amphibian decline.

The disease is found throughout the United States in both frogs and turtles but it has not been found in birds or mammals. With some tadpole frog species, the mortality rate is as high as 99 percent.

"The virus can also be spread via water, in soil and on the boots, nets, and gear of humans," Niederriter said.

The ranavirus was identified in Maryland in 2001, after a die-off in Prince George's County, said Scott Smith, a wildlife ecologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

Delaware officials began looking for the disease in wooded ponds last year [2013] as part of a regional effort.

The study was prompted by a turtle die-off discovered as part of a study on the impact of a proposed new highway in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.

A researcher at Towson University put radio transmitters on Eastern box turtles to see how they would fair if they were moved to new locations as part of a road construction mitigation project. But the transmitters turned up something unexpected. "They'd be sick one day and dead the next," Niederriter said.

Smith said the researcher lost both his control site and his 2 test plots to ranavirus in the study that took place from 2008 to 2011.

One reason for the concern, Smith said, is that box turtles are long-lived and have reproductive strategy that differs from frogs. Frogs typically lay eggs in woodland ponds by the hundreds.

But box turtles, while laying several clutches of eggs, may only lay 3 to 8 at a time.

Smith said with frogs, especially wood frogs, the disease seems to have highest impact on the tadpoles but doesn't kill adults. That means the adults, which typically live 5 to 8 years, can return to breed again the following year.

There are species, like bullfrogs, that appear more resistant to the disease, he said.

So far, researchers believe the disease in our area has the greatest impact on wood frogs and spotted salamanders. No one is certain how it spreads from pond to pond, though there is some thought that other wildlife may spread it, including bullfrogs, which can travel 3 miles [4.8 km] to breeding pools.

Over several days last week [25-31 May 2014], Niederriter and research assistant Christine Tilton set out to sample wood frog tadpoles.

The 2 scientists waded into slightly less than knee deep water at Blackbird State Forest. In March [2014], they marked the areas where wood frogs laid their egg masses. On this day, they looked for the orange strips of survey tape that mark the area. The area is remote and the water is tea colored from the tannins in the forest canopy.

Then, they take long-handled nets, look for motion in the water, and sweep through the leaves and water searching for 1.5 in [3.8 cm] long tadpoles. For each survey area, they need 30 animals, which they take back to a test site on a cleared area in the woods. "They have to be a certain age," Niederriter explained. The telltale sign is that the tadpoles are starting to develop legs.

At this stage of development, the tadpoles may even show signs of the disease -- red splotches. "It's harder to detect at younger ages," Niederriter said.

With a bucket full of tadpoles in hand, Niederriter and Tilton make their way across the pond past the just-forming blueberries and back to the high ground. They set up a table and pull out sample bags and a collection of 30 nets -- one net for each tadpole -- because they don't want to contaminate their samples.

The tadpoles are killed as a part of this study because they must be sent out to a lab for positive confirmation of the disease.

"This year [2014] we're finding die-offs in more of the ponds," Niederriter said.

Researchers have found that one day a pond can seem fine and then the entire wood frog tadpole population can be wiped out in as little as 5 days.

Tilton nets the 1st of the tadpoles, rinses it with clean, purified water and then uses a numbing agent to kill the animal. She sets up 5 samples at a time and then she and Niederriter begin to work through the collection -- jotting down whether the specimen showed signs of the disease and where each is in the progression from a tadpole to a frog.

"I think we're going to find some really interesting information," Niederriter said. "We have found positives for ranavirus in every county and in every site in Blackbird State Forest and in every state park," among the state's most pristine areas.

[It becomes increasingly apparent that some infectious diseases are a very important threat to wildlife populations and a growing conservation concern. Amphibians are already being hit by other emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis. Also, there is evidence that these pathogens interact with environmental factors (climate change, pollution, etc.) resulting in greater impact.

Ranaviruses are a group of pathogens belonging to the genus _Ranavirus_ (Family Iridoviridae) that have been linked to catastrophic die-offs of larval amphibians in North America and elsewhere. In the United States, ranaviruses are responsible for the majority of disease-related mortality events in amphibians. This virus became an emerging infectious disease possibly due to a novel strain introduction or increased occurrence of anthropogenic stressors on the landscape. A few years ago, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed this pathogen as a notiÔ¨Åable disease.

Although ranaviruses were known to infect reptiles, here and in recent episodes turtles appear to be the main host species involved. This host preference jump across taxonomic classes (from amphibians to reptiles) merits concern and a molecular investigation. - Mod. PMB
