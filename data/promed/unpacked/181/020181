I was speaking with Martin Gilbert, WCS [Wildlife Conservation
Society] Field Vet that has worked in this part of Australia
previously and he noted that the reported affected species do not
come from a very wide range of ecological niches, all either being
nectar feeders or potential scavengers of dead birds.

[That is an interesting point that makes me wonder what
pesticides/insecticides are being used on nearby nectar sources, or
what is being used to eliminate other birds that become a source of
food for scavengers. I wonder if these dead birds have been tested
for rodenticides. - Mod.TG]
