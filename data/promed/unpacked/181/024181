[Helen Branswell on Twitter: "#Ebola: +1 case, +1 death in the Equateur outbreak in western DRC. Looks like this new case was a person who died in the community, which likely means more cases to come (https://t.co/lLzwDJB5By) / Twitter]

[The cases continue to inch upwards gradually. Community deaths have the potential to change that to a much larger scale outbreak in the absence of enough vaccination. There have been 10 916 people vaccinated in this current outbreak in Equateur province. - Mod.LK]

More Ebola cases reported in DRC's latest outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ebola outbreak in Equateur province has risen to 51 cases, 48 confirmed, and 3 probable, reflecting an increase of 5 since 9 Jul 2020.

At a World Health Organization (WHO) media briefing today [13 Jul 2020], Mike Ryan, who leads the group's health emergencies program, said as of 12 Jul 2020, 20 deaths have been reported, 17 in confirmed and 3 in probable cases. In Equateur province, the cases are spread across 21 health areas in 6 health zones, which means they are broadly distributed and concerning. Ryan said some areas are remote and hard to access, and some are located near the Congo River, posing a risk of spread to Kinshasa and bordering countries. "It's still a very active outbreak," he said.

In an update today, the DRC's multisectoral Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said as of 10 Jul 2020, 10 916 people in the outbreak region have been vaccinated with VSV-EBOV.

The DRC's latest outbreak, its 11th, is occurring in the same area where its 9th outbreak unfolded in 2018, which resulted in 54 cases, 33 of them fatal.

[Note that the CIDRAP report adds 2 additional cases one day later than the CMRE report, bringing the total to 51. Since the outbreak is in a remote area, it is less likely to spread rapidly, except in locations close to the Congo River which could facilitate spread. - Mod.LK
