At least 60 children, ages 3-6, suffered food poisoning at a child care
center in the Nicaraguan Southern Caribbean, the Ministry of Health
disclosed yesterday.
According to the sources, the children had rice, beans, a corn drink and
cheese for lunch on Monday. Shortly after, they began complaining of
stomach ache and dizziness and began to vomit.
A source close to the center said they suspected that the cheese, bought at
the local market in the port of Bluefields, was the cause of the poisoning.
The children were recovering at health care centers in the Caribbean town.
