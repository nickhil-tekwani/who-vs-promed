A salmonella outbreak at Kirkby [Liverpool, Cheshire and Merseyside] takeÂ­away Woks Cooking has been linked to German eggs and poor hygiene. Health bosses have completed their final investigations into the fast food outlet which was shut down by Knowsley council last July 2014 but opened again in August 2014 and is now under new management.

The report by Public Health England (PHE) confirms food safety experts have found signs that the salmonella illnesses at Woks Cooking, as well as a series of other cases across Europe, were linked to eggs from a German supplier.

Dr Alex Stewart, from PHE's Cheshire and Merseyside centre, said: "There is now evidence to indicate that a series of cases in Europe caused by the same strains of _Salmonella_ were associated with consumption of eggs from a single source. The eggs from this supplier also reached distributors and food outlets in England and there is evidence to support the hypothesis that this was the same source of infection for Woks Cooking.

"Nevertheless, good practice in any food outlet accounts for the possibility of contaminated food sources; in this outbreak it is clear that poor hygiene practices with cross-contamination were the ultimate cause of the outbreak."

It had previously been thought 25 people were struck by the salmonella in Kirkby last July 2014 but food safety experts have now confirmed 54 cases were identified which were linked to Woks Cooking, which is in Westvale. Of these, 33 cases were microbiologically confirmed _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis PT14b and 21 were classified as probable cases. There were 9 people hospitalized during the outbreak.

A spokeswoman for PHE said they were unable to name the company which supplied the eggs from but confirmed it was German.

[Serotype Enteritidis is often associated with undercooked eggs or egg products. The posting seems to imply that the food is not at fault but rather the sanitary practices of the food handler. Given the serotype, it is likely that the reservoir was uncooked eggs or sauce made from raw eggs, and the food handler was implicated for inadequate cooking or poor kitchen hygiene techniques rather than for being infected and, by poor hand washing, contaminating the eggs and/or sauce.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. However, most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and are contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell is formed. - Mod.LL
