On Sunday [11 Nov 2001], 6 suspects who were accused of producing or
selling poisonous pork in Heyuan, South China's Guangdong Province, were
arrested and are being questioned by local police. Of the 500 victims who
suffered from pork poisoning on 7 Nov 2001, some 480 have recovered and
returned home.
The remaining 20 are still hospitalized and receiving further treatment. Of
the 6 suspects, 3 were owners of private pig-raising companies. They were
found to have fed their pigs with poisonous feedstuff, which increased the
percentage of muscle in the pigs. The feedstuff was dangerous to human
health. The other 3 suspects were accused of knowingly selling pork raised
on such feedstuff.

[If anyone knows what the substance was in the feedstuffs and what the
clinical signs were in the pigs and in the people, ProMED-mail would
appreciate an update. ­ Mod.TG]
