Precautions against avian flu intensified
-----------------------------------------
The National Steering Board for Avian Flu Control on Tuesday [11 Jan 2005]
called upon provinces and cities nationwide, and relevant ministries, to
take immediate measures to prevent and control the spread of bird flu.
According to the Veterinary Department, 54 bird flu outbreaks were found in
51 communes belonging to 29 districts of 9 provinces between 1 and 10 Jan
2005. The Central Highlands province of Lam Dong, the southern provinces of
Binh Phuoc, Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An, Dong Thap, Bac Lieu and Ca Mau,
and the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho have culled more than 103 000 infected
poultry.

the Vietnamese authorities mentioned outbreaks in 20 communes and 15
districts of 7 cities and provinces, while the current posting refers to 51
communes belonging to 29 districts of 9 provinces. The 2 added (southern)
provinces are Bac Lieu and Ca Mau. An administrative map of Viet Nam can be
