Massive honey bee die-off in Montecito
--------------------------------------
Last October [2012], Santa Barbara Bee Keeper's association [SBBA] was called out to several backyard beekeepers' properties in response to massive honey bee die-offs. Local amateur beekeeper, Carrie Kappel, called SBBA when she noticed hundreds of dead and dying bees outside her backyard beehive. "It was devastating to see the number of dead bees outside the hive, and watch those in their death throes, twitching and stumbling around in front of the hive, unable to fly. I watched the whole hive go from healthy and vigorous to empty over a few short weeks."

A total of 16 formerly healthy hives, with an average population of 30-60 000 bees each were lost. SBBA estimates about 750 000 bees died, all within a 1.5 mile [2.4 km] radius. The Association submitted 4 test samples to Penn State University for a comprehensive pesticide screening and just received the reports back from the USDA labs.

As SBBA leaders suspected, there were several commonly used pesticides found in bee food stores, brood cells, and wax. These include bifenthrin (found in hundreds of agricultural and household pesticide products), chlorpyrifos (used on orchards, golf courses, and crops, and banned from residential use), cyhalothrin (found in household and commercial), and fipronil (used in over 50 products to control ants, termites, fleas, and other insects). All of these chemicals are known to be highly toxic to bees. Also found at low levels were 2 legal miticides used by beekeepers to control mites. While this does not prove that pesticides were behind the die-offs, it does point to them as a possible factor.

According to Penn State Senior Extension Associate, Maryann Frazier, "Honey bees across the country are being exposed to a great diversity and sometimes high levels of pesticides. While the evidence associated with the Montecito die-off is not conclusive, the symptoms of colony deaths and detections of low levels of pesticides toxic to honey bees are suspicious and cause for concern."

While SBBA is very upset about this loss, its leaders hope that by spreading the word about the die-off, community members will become more aware of the potential dangers of pesticides for honeybees and other pollinators. The organization encourages pest control companies, horticulturalists, landscape contractors, and homeowners to evaluate the products that they are using and how they are being applied and work to reduce risks to honey bees and other beneficial insects.

Honey bees have been in decline worldwide. Frazier notes, "We believe that pesticide exposure is an important factor contributing to pollinator decline and possibly colony collapse disorder (CCD)." Colony collapse disorder has wiped out honey bee hives in the US and elsewhere, threatening both the viability of commercial beekeeping and the sustainability of the pollination services that honey bees provide to agricultural crops, domestic gardens, and wild plants. Whatever the cause of the Montecito die-off -- whether acute pesticide poisoning, CCD, or other stresses -- it may be symptomatic of a general decline in the quality of our environment for honey bees. "Honey bees and other pollinators are getting hit hard, but there are things we can do to reduce the threats to them," said SBBA president, Paul Cronshaw.

Pesticides applied to plants that are in bloom can be transferred to the hive by bees foraging for nectar and pollen, and thus the pesticides can impact the entire colony. SBBA urges Santa Barbara community members to please speak with their gardener, pest control company, and anyone else that may use these products to make sure that they are being used properly. Commercial pesticides should only be applied by registered, licensed pesticide applicators. They should be applied carefully, according to the instructions on the label, and only as needed, avoiding applying them to blooming plants and at times when pollinators are active. "Working together, we can reduce both our own exposures to pesticides, and also the honey bee's, so that she may continue to help us feed the planet," says SBBA vice president, Todd Bebb.

[Recent research (see ProMED-mail posting no 20120330.1085129) has suggested that pesticides were linked to the bee's colony collapse disorder. Another interesting finding incriminates a virus (see posting no 20120611.1164105), and a virulent strain in particular, which is associated with the mite _Varroa destructor_. The whole scenario appears complex and it is very likely that several factors interact to cause colony collapse disorder.
