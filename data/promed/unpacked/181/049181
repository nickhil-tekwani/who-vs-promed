Additional FMD case found in South Korea's largest port city
------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea confirmed an additional case of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) in its largest port city on Monday [7 Feb 2011] as quarantine
authorities start the 2nd stage of its nationwide vaccination process,
the government said Monday.

The case at the pig and goat farm in Busan, which raised 568 animals,
brings the total number of officially confirmed FMD outbreaks to 146,
after livestock started showing symptoms in late November [2010], the
Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. It is also
the 1st confirmed case in the city located 450 km southeast of Seoul
[map <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KS/10/Pusan.html>].

The latest outbreak comes after all 13 million heads of cattle and
pigs in the country were inoculated as of January, but have not been
given a 2nd vaccine shot that can enhance resistance to the virus.

"Since the pigs at the farm have only recently received shots, while
the goats are not included in the ongoing vaccination program, all the
livestock have been ordered culled," the farm ministry said.
Authorities plan to complete giving 2nd vaccine shots of local
livestock by the middle of March that should help stem further
outbreaks.

Since the 1st FMD outbreak was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010, Seoul has
destroyed more than 3.16 million heads of cattle, pigs, goats, sheep
and deer. Losses are estimated at more than 2 trillion won (USD 1.8
billion).

A senior quarantine official, meanwhile, said that inspections will be
carried out on more than 4000 animal burial sites across the country
for possible environmental contamination. The animals were usually
buried at their farms after they were culled to prevent further spread
of FMD.

"Detailed on-site inspections will start this week with all sites to
be checked by early March," said Deputy Farm Minister Lee Sang-kil.

Although the burial sites were created according to set rules,
emergency remedial actions can be ordered, while more permanent
measures will be taken for any shortcomings found, he said.

There have been complaints of the stench caused by rotting animal
corpses and worries that local aquifers may be contaminated. [See also

The official added that experts are trying to determine why a national
animal science center in Cheonan, 92 km south of the capital city,
tested positive for FMD over the weekend [see item 2, below]. He said
that preliminary tests showed little possibility of the virus
spreading by air, with attention being focused on support workers who
may have brought the virus in from neighboring animal farms.

FMD found at nation's largest breeding farm
-------------------------------------------
A total of 13 pigs were confirmed Saturday [5 Feb 2011] to have FMD at
Korea's largest breeding farm -- the Department of Animal Resources
Development in Cheonan, South Chungcheong -- which provides sperm from
high-quality livestock to farms nationwide, the Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said yesterday [6 Feb 2011].

There are currently 350 cows, 1650 pigs and 13 430 poultry (chicken
and ducks) at the facility, the ministry said. The ministry said
yesterday that the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service
conducted an inspection Saturday on 13 pigs that showed signs of FMD
at the breeding farm. All 13 tested positive.

The South Chungcheong Provincial Office shut down the facility
immediately after being told of the outbreak on Saturday [5 Feb 2011]
and culled the pigs that day. The department said it vaccinated all of
its animals in January. [Date of vaccination will help in the
assessment of this event. Pigs vaccinated with homologous or
heterologous FMD vaccines have been shown to be protected at 2 weeks
after vaccination. Homologous vaccine may confer earlier protection;
see further commentary at the bottom of this item. - Mod. AS]

An official at the Rural Development Administration, which runs the
breeding farm, said, "We did our best to block the FMD virus by
spraying disinfectant around the farm twice or 3 times every day and
by thoroughly shutting off the farm from the outside world, so now we
feel frustrated."

The official added: "Although some pigs were infected with the FMD, we
have completely vaccinated all animals. So we assume that roughly 80
percent of livestock in the breeding farm have formed antibodies to
combat the disease by now." [See comment at bottom of this item].

Established in 1915, the facility provides farmers with high-quality
livestock sperm and poultry to help produce the quality meat for
consumers. The department has played a pivotal role in improving the
country's livestock breeds, according to department officials.

Each year, the department gives sperm from top-graded cows to the
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, which distributes it to
farms nationwide. The facility also gives sperm from pigs to a
national insemination center and provides about 35 000 poultry to
farms on an annual basis. Each year, the department aids in the
production of 500 000 pigs and 7 million poultry.

The department has kept all of its 115 staff members on campus since
the 1st outbreak of FMD was reported in Andong, South Gyeongsang, on
29 Nov 2010. It also has operated an emergency team around the clock
and blocked all vehicles from entering the facility. All communication
with outsiders has been done remotely and outside food has been
prohibited.

Up until now, the highly contagious virus has swept all regions
nationwide except South Jeolla and Jeju Island. Roughly 3.1 million
animals have been slaughtered so far.

[The fact that clinical FMD has been seen in pigs at the Cheonan
breeding centre and not reported from the (350) cattle is interesting.
Cattle are generally regarded as "indicators" of FMD due to their
underlined susceptibility; absence of clinical disease may be
indicative of a relatively higher level of protection conferred to
them by the January vaccination, compared to the pigs. Updated
information on the protection level conferred in various species by
the vaccine applied in South Korea (serotype O, Manisa vaccine
strain?) against the virus strain circulating there, namely FMDV O SEA
topotype, Mya-98 lineage, will be helpful.

From the given information it seems that the authorities decided to
cull the (13?) clinically affected pigs, while re-vaccinate all
remaining pigs (and cattle?) on the farm ("Vaccinate-to-live").
Confirmation will help. In case confirmed, this strategy has become
feasible by South Korea's decision to move into mass vaccination
policy, enabling selective culling ('modified stamping out'). Such
policy may enable the preservation of breeding animals of high genetic
value.

As reported in item 1, preliminary tests showed little possibility of
the virus spreading into the breeding centre by air, while attention
has been focused on support workers who may have brought the virus in
from neighboring animal farms. Final conclusions -- in case available
-- are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]

Gov't considers delaying back-to-school day to curb animal diseases
-------------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea is considering an extension of winter break for most
schools to reduce the continuing spread of animal diseases that have
already led to the culling of millions of livestock, the government
said Sunday [6 Feb 2011].

The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said it has issued a
special dispatch to all regional education offices to consider
delaying the reopening of schools, especially in areas where the
animal diseases are most rampant.

"The move follows a request from the Ministry of Public Administration
and Security on Saturday to help curb the spread of FMD and avian
influenza," a ministry official told reporters.

Most public schools, including high schools, are set to reopen Monday
[7 Feb 2011].

"The dispatch advises education offices to reopen schools but allow
their students to study at home in areas where the animal diseases are
not a large problem, and to consider delaying reopening of schools
altogether in areas where they are a problem," the ministry official
said.

[FMD] has spread to hundreds of farms in 63 different cities and
districts throughout the nation with over 3.1 million animals
destroyed as of Sunday.
