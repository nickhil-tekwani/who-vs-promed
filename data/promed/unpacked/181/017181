Sierra Leone: WHO--Sierra Leone is free of Ebola
--------------------------------------------

[Sierra Leone is now officially free of Ebola.

After 42 days without Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, Sierra Leone has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), on 7 Nov 2015, as being free of EVD, which has plagued the country for the last 18 months. According to President Ernest Bai Koroma, being free of EVD represents a "difficult and turbulent journey." However, lurking in the background is the reality of a continuing EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone's neighboring country, Guinea. While measures have been put into place to restrict the unmonitored crossing of borders, the reality is the border between Guinea and Sierra Leone is still very porous and open to clandestine crossings, leaving open the possibility of a new outbreak.]

Today (7 Nov 2015), the World Health Organization declares that Ebola virus transmission has been stopped in Sierra Leone. 42 days, that is 2 Ebola virus incubation cycles, have now passed since the last person confirmed to have Ebola virus disease had a 2nd negative blood test.
Since Sierra Leone recorded the 1st Ebola case in May 2014, a total number of 8704 people were infected and 3589 have died, 221 of them healthcare workers, all of whom we remember on this day" said Dr Anders Nordström, WHO Representative in Sierra Leone.
The country now enters a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance which will run until 5 Feb 2016 and WHO will continue to support Sierra Leone during this period. This new phase is critical for ensuring early detection of any possible new cases of Ebola virus disease. ...-more]

[This is a celebratory time for Sierra Leone, and the world. We hope Guinea will also be Ebola-free soon. It is critical that strict attention to public health precautions be maintained in Sierra Leone and Liberia to retain an Ebola-free status, and Guinea to achieve it. - Mod.LK]

[Sierra Leone deserves to celebrate after all the death and hardship. But unfortunately, the finding of transmission by infected sperm in male survivors and the relapse into Ebola meningitis of the Scottish nurse, both months after they were declared Ebola-free, mean that surveillance and contact tracing need to be redoubled now. There will be tremendous reluctance to report suspect cases, because nobody will want to spoil the party, and by allowing patients to die at home they can be assured of a traditional burial, so opportunities for new infection chains will continue. - Mod.JW]

Ebola: Europe-Africa research collaborations
---------------------------------------------------
The Europe-Africa clinical research response to Ebola has been impressive, and includes vaccine safety studies in west Africa(2, 3) the encouraging results of the ring vaccination trial in Guinea coordinated by WHO(4), the first ever drug trial in Ebola undertaken by the favipiravir (JIKI) trial consortium (NCT02329054)(5), the RAPIDE consortium trials of brincidofovir (PACTR201411000939962) and TKM-130803 (PACTR201501000997429), and the Ebola-Tx (NCT02342171) and Ebola-CP (ISRCTN13990511) trials of convalescent plasma... - more

What might post-Ebola health services look like in West Africa?
-------------------------------------------------
The article by Horby et al.(1) provides a concise summary of the impressive amount of research already done on prevention and control of EVD. Available data on latent infections in recovered patients, coupled with new estimates of the number of undetected or unreported cases(2), indicate that EVD should be considered endemic at low frequencies in human populations in West Africa.

What has not been discussed are the precautions to be taken to prevent transmission from emergency trauma victims, obstetric procedures, and other cases of individuals with unknown infection status. It is impractical from economic and logistical perspectives to require all HWs in contact with cases involving haemorrhage or body fluid exposures, to wear full-body PPE routinely.

Assuming that vaccination for HWs and rapid bedside tests for Ebola with laboratory confirmation will soon be available in the 3 countries, and that international aid for strengthened health services will continue to reach hospitals and health centres, it might be prudent to plan along the following lines. Maternity hospitals: routine serology for ebolavirus; if positive, isolate. Closed area with 2 HWs in PPE to decontaminate anyone exposed. If exposure begins before serology result available, treat as a suspect case. Emergency department: install a decontamination area as above to deal with anyone exposed to suspect cases. All: Perform serology asap. Safe burial teams: on standby for suspect cases, rapid confirmatory test essential. Contact tracing for positive cases: vaccination for household members & visitors (not fully effective for 10 days), ring vaccination around index house (early ring vaccination not fully effective)(3); follow-up house visits for fever. Financial & manpower needs: shift staffing and hazard pay. Offer survivors without debilitating sequelae, training & employment as decontamination & burial staff, saving expensive PPE and short shifts. Those on the ground in West Africa will know if there is any interest in this idea among survivors. Level of immunity to be tested monthly, vaccination or reassignment if declining.

Hopefully, these ideas will promote discussion.

I declare no competing interests.

4 Nov 2015 Guinea: Newborn's Ebola infection adds to Guinea's total
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/11/newborns-ebola-infection-adds-guineas-total
[In its weekly update today the WHO said the baby was delivered in an Ebola treatment center in Conakry and is being treated. The child's infection is the 4th reported from the same family in the village of Kondeyah, in Forecariah district.
The newborn's 25-year-old mother, whose Ebola infection was confirmed the previous week, died after giving birth. Ebola infections had also been confirmed in 2 of the woman's other young children whose illnesses were also announced the week before. The WHO warned that those family cases generated a large number of high-risk contacts who are now in their 2nd week of 21-day monitoring.
According to the WHO, the baby's illness is the tenth in the Forecariah branch of a transmission chain that began in Conakry's Ratoma area.
Guinea is monitoring a total of 382 contacts, which include 43 in Conakry and 339 in Forecariah district. Among that group are 141 high-risk contacts, 7 from the capital and the rest from Forecariah.

In Sierra Leone, all contacts linked to the country's last 2 known transmission chains have completed follow-up. Its last patient tested negative for a 2nd time on 25 Sep 2015, and if no further cases are reported, Sierra Leone will reach Ebola-free status on 7 Nov 2015.
The WHO noted that the outbreak region has now reported 5 or fewer cases for 14 consecutive weeks. The overall outbreak number for the 3 affected West African countries is at 28 571 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases, with the number of deaths reaching 11 299."]

[Sierra Leone has now been declared Ebola-free -- see above -- leaving Guinea as the last holdout of cases. Bordering countries must be on guard for re-introduction of virus. -Mod LK]]

6 Nov 2015 Guinea: Ebola mobile suitcase laboratory successfully tested in Guinea
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151106062718.htm
[Field testing has been completed for a new method of rapid diagnosis of Ebola virus disease (EVD) involving a portable field laboratory, which is operated with solar power, and provides remote areas with on-site diagnoses. The detection method is based on rapid identification of viral RNA in oral swabs of suspected infected patients. In trials, an EVD case was detected after 30 minutes.]

5 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: Headmaster: I feared Ebola would kill blind pupils
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0376fkd
[According to Didymus Thaimu Kargbo, of Milton Margai School for the Blind, because his students cannot get around without touching people and/or objects, they are particularly at risk. In addition, it is difficult to stop children from playing which often involves touching. (2-minute video on website)]

5 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: How traditional healers helped defeat Ebola
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511051709.html
[In the beginning of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in May 2014, many residents refused to accept the disease could be treated through Western medicine, and instead sought traditional treatments with herbs, potions and spells provided by the country's estimated 45 000 traditional healers.
According to Richard Mallett of the Overseas Development Institute's Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium (SLRC), "Traditional healers were largely ignored by the state and the international community throughout the early to mid-stages of the Ebola response." Mallett also said the failure to include healers at an earlier stage may have prolonged the outbreak and increased the death toll.
Healers are a significant part of health care for many residents, and excluding them from the delivery of health care alienated not only alienated the healers but also their traditional patients. When Western medicine did not end the outbreak, officials decided to align with the traditional healers and make them part of the social support and publication services providers.]

5 Nov 2015: Sierra Leone beds in against Ebola repeat with UK military's 'hospital in a box'
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/05/sierra-leone-ebola-uk-military-magazine-wharf-freetown
[Sierra Leone's cross-government response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak led to the creation of a 36-bed "field hospital in a box." The hospital, which will serve as then new frontline response to any future outbreaks, can be deployed and operational anywhere in Sierra Leone within 48 hours.]

4 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: Doctor once infected with Ebola discusses recovery and 'uncommon heroism'

[Dr. Crozier has suffered permanent damage from his Ebola virus disease (EVD) infection, including joint pain, hearing loss, short-term memory deficits and an infection in one of his eyes. Since his illness, he has taken an interest in post-EVD effects in survivors, especially the West African survivors. According to Crozier, ""You don't put out 99 percent of a fire. We need a resilient zero, and we need to stay at zero, which is not going to be easy."]

7 Nov 2015 How the Ebola scare stigmatized African immigrants In the USA
http://www.science20.com/news_articles/how_the_ebola_scare_stigmatized_african_immigrants_in_the_us-158789
[The latest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa also took its toll socially on one of the fastest growing populations in the United States - African immigrants.
Guy-Lucien Whembolua, a University of Cincinnati assistant professor of Africana studies, reviewed reports in mainstream U.S. media related to African immigrants and the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The search turned up 21 news articles that matched the criteria for the study - articles focusing on African immigrants in the U.S. and the Ebola virus.
The researchers found that these African immigrants experienced stigma similar to communities stigmatized by the AIDS epidemic in the '80s. "There was strong discrimination against homosexual men during the AIDS epidemic and laying blame on that population for the spread of the virus," says Whembolua. "Similarly, in the early stages of the Ebola Virus outbreak in West Africa and amid sensationalized reports, we found a fear linked with African immigrants around spreading the disease in the U.S. Some of these populations felt they had to hide their ethnicity in an effort to avoid the stigma."]
8 Nov 2015 USA/West Africa: West Africans allowed to stay in U.S. during Ebola epidemic argue for more time [In 2014, President Obama extended the Temporary Protected Status (originally granted in 2014), to possibly 2016--depending on review of by the US Immigration Service (IMS)--for the native residents of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone who are already in the US (United States of America].

4 Nov 2015: Ring vaccination efficacy questioned in Ebola containment
http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/stories/510646577-ring-vaccination-efficacy-questioned-in-ebola-containment
[In a recent study of the efficacy of ring vaccination in West Africa's Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, conducted by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, they found using ring vaccination at the beginning of the outbreak did not help to contain the virus. However, when the outbreak had decreased to a less-intense transmission rate, it helped eliminate the disease.]

5 Nov 2015: NIBSC Ebola reference reagents endorsed as global standards by WHO
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nibsc-ebola-reference-reagents-endorsed-as-global-standards-by-who
[Ebola reference reagents produced by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) have been endorsed as the global standards for use in laboratory tests by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, and are now available to the scientific community. NIBSC was asked by WHO to produce 2 types of Ebola virus reference reagents. The first reagent is run alongside patient samples to detect Ebola virus disease (EVD) infection. The second measures EVD antibody levels following infection, or following immunization with candidate vaccines. The Ebola antibody standard will be used around the world in the testing of Ebola vaccines in development, and is expected to help accelerate the availability of new vaccines for EVD.]

5 Nov 2015 Canada: Medicago to develop Sudan strain Ebola antibodies
http://globalbiodefense.com/2015/11/05/medicago-to-develop-sudan-strain-ebola-antibodies/
[Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has awarded new funding to Medicago, a plant-based biopharmaceutical company, to develop two antibodies to fight the Sudan strain of the Ebola virus. The Ebola Sudan strain has been previously associated with large outbreaks in Africa.]

6 Nov 2015: Grantees selected to build Ebola research capacity
http://www.edctp.org/news/grantees-selected-build-ebola-research-capacity/
[6 institutions in Africa and Europe have been awarded funding to strengthen capacity in sub-Saharan Africa to conduct high-quality health research during health emergencies and/or epidemic outbreaks. The grants were developed in response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, and they address individual, institutional, national and regional capacity.
3 recipients are based in Africa and 3 are in Europe, working in Africa and with African partners. The scope of the projects ranges from improving capacity for clinical trials to health system rebuilding. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) and TDR are providing the EUR 1.49 million (USD 1.61 million) funding.]
