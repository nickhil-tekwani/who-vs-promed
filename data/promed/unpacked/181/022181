The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) announced 15 May 2020 that they have seen an increase in fever tick confirmations outside of established quarantined areas in south Texas.

"Fever ticks have been found on cattle outside of the established quarantine areas in Cameron, Hidalgo, Jim Wells, Jim Hogg, and Willacy counties" in Texas, TAHC executive director Dr. Andy Schwartz said. "Many of these counties had pre-existing fever tick quarantine areas, but these newly identified premises are outside of those."

All of the infested premises have been quarantined, and TAHC staff are working alongside CFTEP to systematically inspect the premises and the surrounding areas to identify the potential span of the infestation, the agency said in an announcement.

"When we find new premises infested with fever ticks, we always conduct an investigation to determine the source of the ticks and if there has been additional spread," Texas state epidemiologist Dr. Susan Rollo said. "We are still in the beginning stages of the investigation process; however, initial indications suggest the investigation will be extensive."

When fever ticks are discovered on a premise, the location is quarantined. Once quarantined, the cattle and other susceptible livestock are prescribed a treatment program until fever ticks are eradicated from the land. Livestock on the infested premises can still be sold and moved off the premises as long as they are inspected and treated before movement, TAHC said.

"We ask that livestock producers help us in protecting the nation from fever ticks by being proactive when purchasing cattle from counties with known fever tick infestations," Schwartz said. "TAHC and USDA-CFTEP operate public dipping vats along the Texas-Mexico border and in a few south Texas counties where producers can voluntarily take their cattle to be treated before returning home."

Voluntary treatment and inspection of cattle purchased in south Texas will both increase surveillance for cattle fever ticks and eliminate the need for tracing exposed animals, TAHC said.

At present, TAHC said approximately 1 million acres are under various types of fever tick quarantine outside of the permanent quarantine zone. To learn more about the quarantine areas, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/animal_health/cattle/#ticks.

"When producers observe ticks on their livestock, it is imperative they contact their local TAHC livestock inspector or region office, USDA inspector, private veterinarian, or local Texas A&M AgriLife Extension office to arrange for collection and submission of tick samples to the TAHC laboratory in Austin," Schwartz said. "This extra surveillance protects the Texas cattle industry."

Cattle fever ticks, known scientifically as _Rhipicephalus annulatus_ and _Rhipicephalus microplus_, are a significant threat to the U.S. cattle industry, TAHC said, explaining these ticks are capable of carrying the protozoa _Babesia bovis_ or _Babesia bigemina_, which cause the disease commonly known as cattle fever. The babesia organism attacks and destroys red blood cells, causing acute anemia, high fever, and enlargement of the spleen and liver, ultimately resulting in death for up to 90% of susceptible naive cattle.

[This tick is a huge economic concern for all the South Texas counties. It represents suffering for the affected animals as well as a tremendous economic loss for the producers. The counties affected in Texas are large counties and represent a sizable amount of territory.

The fact that ticks were found outside the quarantine zone is disturbing. It means the tick range has expanded, which brings more worry to producers and suffering to animals and producers, who undergo loss of production and sick animals.

The recent spread of these ticks is concerning because of disease spread, quarantines, and loss of animals and finances to the owner. This particular fever tick has plagued Texas for some time and was part of the history of Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/about-us/history). Great strides were made against this pest, but it rallied against the efforts to eliminate it from Texas.

It is a very expensive and time-consuming task to eradicate the carrier of this disease. In the 1940s, cattle were dipped in large vats with an arsenic-containing dip. Co-Ral, the current treatment, is not an arsenic dip, but rather an organophosphate, which can inhibit cholinesterase. This chemical is a restricted-use pesticide, meaning special training and handling are required to use it.
