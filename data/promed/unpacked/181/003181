Due to absence of FMD's outbreaks and clinical signs during 12 months,
the zone is now considered by the Kazakhstan's Veterinary Authority as
an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised. The restrictive
measures imposed earlier on the livestock of Novodolinka village in
Ereymentau Raion due to outbreak of FMD are lifted on the grounds of:

outbreak of FMD" as of 16 Jul 2010 by order No. a-7/290.

in Akmola Oblast as of 29 Jun 2011 N. 10-08-1017.
3. Act of Commission on the lifting of the restriction measures
imposed on the livestock of the Novodolinka village in the Novodolinka
rural district Ereymentau Raion due to outbreak of FMD as of 29 Jun

[Achieving a status of a zone free of FMD without vaccination is an
ambitious undertaking of the Kazakh authorities. According to 2010 OIE
data, there are about 17.92 million sheep/goats, 6.3 million cattle,
1.37 million pigs, and 170 000 camels in Kazakhstan, as well as 2
considerable populations of susceptible wild antelopes (Saigaks) with
seasonal migration pattern over large distances, including
transboundary movements. Saigaks are known to have been FMD-infected
several times in the past.

Kazakjhstan borders Western China, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
and Turkmenistan. The FMD situation in these countries is the
following:

China (latest available annual OIE report -- 2010): FMD is notifiable
and reportedly present.
Kyrgyzstan (latest available annual OIE report -- 2008): FMD is not
notifiable. Reportedly, last outbreak 1991; the 2006 suspected
outbreaks remained unnotified to the OIE (see 20060711.1899, 20060712.1917).
Tajikistan (latest available annual OIE report -- 2010): FMD is
notifiable. Reportedly, last outbreak 2003.
Uzbekistan (latest available annual OIE report -- 2008): FMD is not
notifiable. Reportedly, last outbreak 1991.
Turkmenistan (no annual reporting 2004 -- 2009; 2010 report does not
include information on the FMD situation).

It would be interesting to obtain details on the size and composition
of the animal population within the declared Zone. In addition, data
on the surveillance plan operated within the zone and the entire
country to safeguard early detection and immediate eradication of FMD
cases, particularly in small ruminants (sheep/goats) and antelopes,
would be helpful.

Kazakhstan, reported to the OIE on 23 Jun 2011. - Mod.AS]
