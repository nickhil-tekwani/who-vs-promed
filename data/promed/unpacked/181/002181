Animal rabies is spreading in Chelyabinsk
-------------------------------------------
An emergency situation has been announced in Chelyabinsk. The number of
animals with rabies is rapidly on the rise. The main animals involved in
the dissemination of rabies in this outbreak are foxes. Their population is
scattered throughout the Nagabskiy rayon.
Rabid animals attack domestic livestock and dogs. According to hunter
Vladimir Baykin, who goes to the forest at noon when foxes go out for food,
it is not hard to hunt down the foxes, as these animals are not afraid of
people anymore.
Rabid foxes are said to come to Chelyabinsk from Kazakhstan. Currently,
Southern Ural is considered to be a natural focus of rabies, with one out
of every 10 foxes affected. Hunters kill foxes to stop the spread of the
disease. No human cases of rabies have been registered there so far. An
epidemic of rabies among foxes has been registered in many areas bordering
Kazakhstan.
