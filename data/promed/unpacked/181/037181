Situation on bird flu pandemic improves in Thailand
---------------------------------------------------
The situation on the avian influenza pandemic in Thailand has improved in
terms of the spread of the disease and the number of patients, a senior
public health official said.
Dr. Charal Trinvuthipong, director of the government's command center on
bird flu, was quoted by the Thai News Agency as saying Thursday [11 Nov
2004] that he had monitored and assessed the situation on the avian flu
during 1-9 Nov 2004.
He found that the situation had improved since state agencies concerned
were instructed to take strict measures to curb the bird flu outbreak. The
Public Health Ministry had increased inspection activities in surveillance
areas by a factor of 6 since 10 Oct 2004, and had not found any victim of
the disease.
Dr. Charal disclosed that the number of poultry found infected with the
bird flu had appeared to decline.
Last week, the disease was found spread in 91 spots. One more spot was
found Tuesday [9 Nov 2004] in the country's central province of Chai Nat,
where the bird flu had previously broken out.
No birds dwelling naturally [wild birds?] had been reported ill or died
unusually in recent weeks, he said.

[In his most recent follow-up report (No 31), sent 5 Nov 2004 to the OIE,
the Director General of the Thai Department of Livestock Development
provided details on 71 new outbreaks in 22 provinces (50 districts). The
report further specifies that 525 out of a total of 28 333 susceptible
birds in the affected locations died. The remaining 27 808 were reportedly
destroyed. For OIE's comprehensive update on Avian influenza in animals in
Asia (type H5) of 8 Nov 2004, including the said Thai update, see

EU officials to check Thai bird flu situation
---------------------------------------------
Representatives from the European Union (EU) will arrive here on 24 Nov
2004 to begin an 8-day tour to verify the safety of the kingdom's poultry
exports.
According to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang, the EU team will
be shown around government laboratories and poultry farms across the country.
Despite rigorous efforts to prevent spread of the epidemic, bird flu virus
was still present in 13 provinces, 32 districts and 14 tambons, Chaturon
was quoted by the official Thai News Agency (TNA) as saying on Tuesday.
[See comment in previous item].
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
the virus has been detected in the lower part of Thailand's northern region
and the central region, where locals raise free-range ducks.[See next item].
Chaturon said he has instructed livestock officials to adjust long-term
plans to boost efficiency in combating the disease from November 2004 to
September 2005.
The outbreak is likely to continue for some time, he added.
Ministers from China, South Korea and Japan will meet in Bangkok on 25-26
Nov 2004 to exchange information and enhance cooperation in fighting the virus.
Meanwhile, Dr Charal Trinvuthipong, director of the government's command
center on bird flu, said laboratory tests on pigs that had died in early
October 2004 in the eastern Prachinburi province showed that they were
killed not by bird flu, but bacterial infection.

Domestic ducks could pose a new Avian Influenza threat: Joint FAO, OIE and
WHO warning
--------------------------------------------------
Domestic ducks may be acting as a silent reservoir for the H5N1 Avian
Influenza virus, which is highly pathogenic for chickens, and may thus have
acquired an important new role in the transmission of the virus to other
poultry and, possibly, to humans as well, 3 international agencies warned
today.
The concern is greatest in rural areas of affected countries, where
traditional free-ranging ducks, chickens and wildlife mingle, frequently
sharing the same source of water, according to a joint statement by FAO,
the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE).
Findings pointing to an altered role for domestic ducks join other recent
evidence that the H5N1 virus circulating in parts of Asia has increased its
virulence in chickens and mice (a laboratory model for mammals) and has
expanded its host range to include mammals, such as certain members of the
felidae family (e.g. cats and tigers) not previously considered susceptible
to infection.
A new laboratory study of domestic ducks infected with several H5N1 viruses
isolated in 2004 shows that, when compared with infections caused by
viruses from 2003, domestic ducks are shedding more virus for longer
periods and as before, are doing so without showing any sign of illness.
The study found that the quantities of virus excreted by healthy-looking
ducks could approach those excreted by visibly diseased chickens, the
agencies said. It was of public health concern that ducks might be infected
and shed virus for long periods, yet give no warning signal in the form of
visible signs and symptoms that alert officials and the public to take
precautions, the statement added.
WHO, FAO and OIE said affected countries should be encouraged to include
possible exposure to apparently healthy domestic ducks when assessing the
risk of infection to humans and to issue appropriate advice for people
living in affected areas. Such advice should cover the handling of domestic
ducks, particularly at slaughter (e.g. scalding the ducks prior to
plucking), and avoiding use of water that has been in contact with ducks
for human consumption without being treated. WHO has prepared detailed
guidelines.
WHO, FAO and OIE said that discovery of the altered role of domestic ducks
in the transmission cycle of H5N1 needed to be addressed soon, as it might
complicate efforts to control the disease in poultry and to prevent further
human cases. The 3 agencies therefore called for urgent animal surveillance
research to establish how widespread the incidence of infection in ducks
without symptoms has become. They also called for research on the
effectiveness of current vaccines on duck populations.
The wider implications of the role played by domestic ducks are being
jointly considered by FAO and OIE in formulating a long-term strategy for
bringing the current Avian Flu outbreaks in poultry under control, the
statement said.
In animals, an early detection and warning system remains the key to
prevention and rapid response. Governments need to support their
Veterinary Services to enable them to carry out effective control
operations. FAO and OIE have recently issued comprehensive guidelines for
responding to the outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry.
The statement said that regional collaboration in Avian Influenza
surveillance in domestic animals and wildlife, including reporting and
control, was also crucial. Such control needs to consider all suitable
measures ranging from the safe and swift elimination of affected poultry,
through strict biosecurity, movement and market control and if relevant, to
vaccination and its close monitoring.
With the H5N1 virus now endemic in parts of Asia, changes in some
traditional farming practices may be needed to decrease incidence of the
disease, especially in rural areas, and thus reduce opportunities for
community-wide exposure. Such changes may have to be significant and
require careful assessment and implementation of recommended measures with
respect to their social, economic, policy and institutional dimensions,
today's statement said.

[The main findings of the mentioned laboratory studies, completed during
the 3rd week of October 2004 by researchers at the WHO collaborating center
for animal influenza viruses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in
Memphis, Tennessee, USA, were published by the WHO, in advance of
publication, because of their significance for human health.
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/labstudy_2004_10_29/en/>.
WHO's initial response was included in posting 20041029.2924. The
current joint statement adds some relevant guidelines.
If subclinically infected ducks are present in the vicinity of affected
poultry farms, the stamping out of the latter might not be sufficient to
eradicate the outbreak. This might underline the need to give more
consideration to vaccination. - Mod.AS]
