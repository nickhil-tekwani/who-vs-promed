Indonesia: Avian Influenza Claims 40th Human Victim
---------------------------------------------------
A World Health Organization laboratory test has confirmed a
5-year-old Indonesian boy who died last month [June 2006] was
infected with avian influenza, a health ministry official said on
Monday [3 Jul 2006]. His death takes the total number of confirmed
bird flu fatalities in the country to 40.
The victim died on 16 Jun 2006 in Tulungagung in East Java province after
being admitted to hospital on 8 Jun 2006, I Nyoman Kandun, director general
for communicable disease control at the health ministry, told Reuters. The
infection was confirmed to be [caused] by the H5N1 avian virus by a WHO
laboratory in Hong Kong, he said. An official at the health ministry's bird
flu center who declined to be identified said: "There was a dead chicken near
his house." The chicken cage was 15 meters from the boy's home, the official
added.
Indonesia has seen a steady rise in human bird flu infections and
deaths since its 1st known outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in late 2003
and has registered more deaths this year [2006] than any other
country. Indonesia has 220 million people and an estimated 1.2
billion chickens, some 30 percent of them in the yards of homes in
both rural and urban areas. The bird flu virus is endemic in poultry
in nearly all of the 33 provinces in Indonesia, a country of 17 000
islands sprawling across some 5000 km (3100 miles).
Despite the climbing death toll, the government has resisted mass
culling of birds, saying it is too costly and impractical.
Vaccination has been preferred to culling, which has been done only
sporadically at selective farms and their immediate surroundings.
Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease.
Indonesia drew international attention in May 2006 when the virus killed [7]
members of a single family in North Sumatra. Experts said there could have
been limited human-to-human transmission in this case cluster. But they
stressed genetic analyses of the virus have not shown all of the traits that
are known so far to allow it to spread easily among people.
