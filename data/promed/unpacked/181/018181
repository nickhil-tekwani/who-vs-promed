Rice wine poisoning leaves 3 dead in Kampong Cham
-------------------------------------------------
Three out of 69 people who were hospitalized on 26 Oct 2022 after drinking homemade rice wine in Kampong Cham province's Stung Trang district have died, with laboratory test results confirming the wine contained dangerous levels of methanol.

District police chief Em Vathana told The Post on 2 Nov 2022 those taken to the hospital were residents of village 35 in Prek Kak commune.

"Today [2 Nov 2022] the condition of the patients has improved and they have mostly recovered," he said.

Yim Navy, head of the health bureau in Stung Trang district, said many ambulances were required to transport the victims to the district hospital, and those who were in critical condition were transferred to the provincial referral hospital.

He said the victims all described experiencing tightness in the chest, difficulties breathing and headaches after drinking rice wine distilled in the commune's Prek Kak village.

He said health officials then followed up by taking a sample of the rice wine to a lab in Phnom Penh on 2 Nov 2022 which revealed it contained high levels of methanol.

"Our medical team was able to save all but 3 of the patients. As of today [2 Nov 2022], all of the surviving patients have recovered and returned home except 1 who needs to receive further treatment," he said.

According to the Ministry of Health's Department of Drugs and Food, from 2015 through 2021, at least 119 people had died and 4699 others had fallen ill from food poisoning.

Regarding cases of poisoning by rice wine with high methanol content, 8 people died and 74 were injured on 28 May 2022 in 4 villages of Ansar Chambak commune in Pursat province's Krakor district. Later, on 4 and 12 Jul 2022, 9 people died after drinking rice and herbal wines in Svay Tong Khang Tbong commune's Koh Chhwang village of Kampot province's Kampong Trach district.

Amid an upsurge of such cases, the Consumer Protection, Competition and Fraud Repression Directorate-General (CCF) under the Ministry of Commerce has reiterated its call for people to avoid drinking rice wine distilled without permits from the relevant authorities.

[Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until some time after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but (they contain) minute quantities.

Methanol is also known as wood alcohol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid, early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10-20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL (1 oz) of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.
