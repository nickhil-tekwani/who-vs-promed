Understanding that this string has been cut I still have one question: If
they took the 1.2 million dead chickens and made chicken soup, would
everyone feel better? Have a happy New Year.
[Who said this string has been cut? Not I? What I said was that we would
not post every dinky little message about H5N1 in Hong Kong. As for
comments about chicken soup, they would be a bit too schmaltzy to post on a
sophisticated bulletin board. - Mod.CHC

A Chinese saying: "Long journeys begin with the first step."
Perhaps influenza epidemics begin with the first chicken (or pig)?
Please check CNN interactive <http://www.cnn.com>.
[This site contains an unsubstantiated report that there may very well be
influenzavirus A H5N1 in south China. The Chinese Government has denied
there is such evidence (see following). - Mod.CHC

Experts with China's national influenza center confirmed that no cases of
H5N1 virus infection have been discovered in the inland areas although
"human blood samples have have not as yet been tested for the virus."
Surveillance will be intensified across the country. Surveillance already
has been strengthened in some south China provinces since August,
especially in the cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, which border the Hong
Kong special administrative region (SAR).
