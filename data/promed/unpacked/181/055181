My daughter attends school in Ensenada, Mexico, and the kids are
reporting an "epidemic" of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and "passing
out". According to the school it is a "viral illness". I'm just
wondering with about 500 teenagers there in close living arrangements
isn't this a public health concern which would warrant someone going
in and inspecting? The school is Casa by the Sea about 70 miles
south of San Diego. Thanks for any information you may have.
