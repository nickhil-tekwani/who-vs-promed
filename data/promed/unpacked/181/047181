Anthrax Outbreak In Manitoba Cattle Herd Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has been confirmed on a cattle farm in southeast
Manitoba with another 4 farms in the area also suspect, according to an
official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The farms in question
have been quarantined or were in the process of being quarantined.
Dr. George Luterbach, program manager for Agriculture Canada's Animal
Health and Wealth for Western Canada said the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) was alerted last week to the potential disease outbreak by a
local veterinarian. The veterinarian had been looking into the deaths of 2
cows in the Vita-area (southeast corner) of the province.
Upon immediate reporting of the suspicious disease the farm was
quarantined, Luterbach said. Even if the disease is not confirmed, the
quarantine occurs and is enforced by the CFIA to prevent the movement of
livestock into or from the infected farm or farms. The quarantine remains
in effect for at least 30 days after all animals on the contaminated
premises have been vaccinated.
Another 2 farms adjacent to the one in question were also quarantined
within a day or two of the original finding because of further suspicious
deaths of animals at these sites. Results from samples sent to the lab were
also being awaited.
Suspicious deaths at another 2 farms in the neighboring region were also
being attended to by CFIA officials and will likely be quarantined later
today, Luterbach said.
The destruction of the carcasses was underway with the area in which the
animal died also being cleaned up, he said.

[The above wording is confusing. The outbreak is "confirmed" in the first
sentence and then in doubt elsewhere. I will try to contact the appropriate
folk in Canada next Monday for the reality; of course if anyone wants to
contact me first, please do. This is a strange report in that livestock
anthrax is rarely reported these days from Manitoba. The last outbreak in
that province I know of was in bison in the Winnipeg zoo. - MHJ
