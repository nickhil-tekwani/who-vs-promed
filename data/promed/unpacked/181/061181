Netherlands begins 1999 with its fifth case, as of 7 Jan 1999. It is
a six-year-old cow from an 80 cow farm near Utrecht. It is a BAB
case, whose symptoms made it a suspect near the end of December and
was slaughtered on the 30 Dec 1998. [BAB = born after the ban on
feeding bovine remains to bovines - Mod.JW
All animals on the farm (79 cows, 14 ewes, 1 ram, 1 cat) have been
slaughtered today. The inquiries consist of all contemporary animals
on the farm, plus tracing this cow and its mother's descendants over
the country [or in neighboring countries, if that occurred? These
animals, once detected, will be slaughtered to look for BSE.
Feedstuffs are being investigated.
