More than 1 million people contract a tropical disease known as leptospirosis each year, resulting in nearly 59 000 deaths, a new study shows [1]. That worldwide estimate of the impact of the illness, which typically affects underdeveloped areas in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and island nations, is far greater than previously thought, the Yale School of Public Health researchers noted.

"The study identified an important health burden caused by this life-threatening disease, which has been long neglected because it occurs in the poorest segments of the world's population," study leader Albert Ko, chair of the department of epidemiology of microbial disease at Yale, said in a news release from the New Haven, Connecticut, USA-based university. "At present, there are no effective control measures for leptospirosis. The study provides national and international decision makers with the evidence to invest in initiatives aimed at preventing the disease, such as development of new vaccines," Ko added.

Spirochetal bacteria, which is found in the urine of rats and other mammals, causes leptospirosis. The germ can survive in soil and water, infecting people through cuts and scrapes on the skin. In developing countries, leptospirosis can lead to bleeding in the lungs and kidney failure.

The researchers said their estimates are probably conservative since people with leptospirosis are often misdiagnosed with malaria, dengue, or other illnesses. To calculate the global toll of the disease, the team analyzed morbidity and mortality studies and databases. Of all diseases that pass between animals and humans, leptospirosis is one of the leading causes of illness and death, the study published [17 Sep 2015] in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases found.

As climate change affects global temperatures and urbanization accelerates, the study authors said, the prevalence of leptospirosis is likely to rise. Epidemics of the illness in urban slums are triggered when these areas, which have poor sanitation and inadequate sewage systems, experience severe weather and heavy rainfall. The researchers projected that the world's slum population will double by 2030, reaching 2 billion people.

Background
----------
"Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status.

Methodology/principal findings
------------------------------
"We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R2 = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 434 000-1 750 000) and 58 900 deaths (CI 23 800-95 900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48 per cent, CI 40-61 per cent) and deaths (42 per cent, CI 34-53 per cent) were estimated to occur in adult males with age of 20-49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and mortality were observed in GBD regions of South and South East Asia, Oceania, Caribbean, Andean, Central and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan Africa.

Conclusions/significance
------------------------
"Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated."
