Passengers on a Pacific Blue flight from Melbourne [Australia] are
being warned they may have been exposed to measles. The Canterbury
District Health Board said they have been notified of an infected
passenger who arrived on Pacific Blue Flight DJ 60, which departed
Melbourne and arrived in Christchurch at 3 pm on 31 Jan 2011.
Passengers on that flight who were seated in rows 25 to 29 should
contact Community and Public Health on (03) 364 1777.

Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Alistair Humphrey said
measles is a serious illness, with 10 percent of people who have the
disease requiring hospital treatment. Measles is at its most highly
infectious stage before any symptoms of a rash appear. "The infected
passenger was travelling to Christchurch for a wedding and would have
been travelling during this highly infectious period," Humphrey said.
Passengers on the flight would now be experiencing symptoms, he said.
"Measles is easily spread through the air, and people sitting in a
row close to an affected passenger are potentially at risk. Even
people sitting further away could have been infected, for example,
while walking past the passengers with measles, or while waiting in
the airport gate lounge."

Today's [9 Feb 2011] warning follows a number of passengers on a
flight between Brisbane and Auckland last month contracting measles
from an infected passenger. The 1st symptoms of measles are a fever,
runny nose and sore red eyes. Then, after a few days, a red blotchy
rash comes on and lasts up to one week. It usually starts on the face
and spreads to the rest of the body. Children and adults with measles
are often very sick.

[Earlier, 12 people who were either passengers or in contact with
passengers on Emirates Flight EK434 from Brisbane, Australia, which
arrived in New Zealand on 11 Jan 2011, contracted measles virus
infection. The transmission of measles virus by in-flight exposure is
a very real possibility, and, as a consequence, the Canterbury
District Health Authorities have prudently issued this 2nd alert.
