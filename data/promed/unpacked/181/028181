2015 was definitely one of the worse peanut white mold (_Sclerotium rolsfii_, AKA southern stem rot) years in history. High heat and frequent cloudy rainy periods caused it to be worse than usual.

The 2015 season has been very favorable for white mold, pushing all fungicide programs to the limits. Without rain or irrigation to wash the fungicides to the crown of the plant, performance and control are reduced. Managing underground white mold is especially difficult.

[White mould on peanut is caused by _Athelia rolfsii_ (previously _Sclerotium rolfsii_). This fungus can also cause seedling blight on the crop and is a major pathogen of peanut with yield losses of up to 60 per cent. White mould symptoms on peanut may include wilting of upper shoots ("shepherd's crook") as well as white fungal growth and brown sclerotia on stem and crowns of the plant.

The fungus is soilborne and has a wide host range in warm, humid regions, including many crops. Many wild and weedy species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. The pathogen survives between seasons as sclerotia (hard, protective structures) which then provide primary inoculum for new crops. It does not produce spores but is spread with soil, farm machinery and plant debris. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation, crop rotation of several years and some fungicide treatments (as mentioned above).

Similar diseases on other crops, which are also called white mould, may be caused by _Sclerotinium_ species.
