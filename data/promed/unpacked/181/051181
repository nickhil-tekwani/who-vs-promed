We refer to the ProMED-mail post Rabies, fox - Europe [cited above and
would like to make the following comments.
1. It is true that rabies is retreating in continental Europe thanks to
the oral vaccination campaigns.
2. It is also true that the fox populations are increasing. The oral
vaccination of foxes against rabies certainly contributes to the increase
of the fox population, but does not explain it completely, because (i) the
population increase observed in Germany is much higher than that known to
occur normally under the conditions of rabies vaccination campaigns and
(ii) population increases have also been observed in regions free of rabies
in the absence of rabies vaccination programs (e.g. in urban and suburban
areas in the United Kingdom: Harris & Rayner [1986. J. Animal Ecology 55,
pp. 575-591; pp. 593-603; pp. 605-611; 1986; Isle of Ruegen, Germany:
Goretzki et al. [1997. Beitraege zur Jagd- und Wildforschung 22, in
press).
3. The fox is the main definitive host for _E. multilocularis_ in Central
Europe with prevalences of more than 60% in some regions. _E.
multilocularis_ infections of dogs and cats are rare (e.g. Germany: 2/73
dogs, 1/207 and 2/58 cats; France: 2/36 dogs; Muller & Partridge
[1974,Tieraerztl. Umsch. 29, 602-612; Contat [1984, thesis, Lyon Vet
School; Worbes [1992, Angew. Parasitol. 30, 161-165) even in areas with a
high prevalence in foxes. Thus, in Central Europe almost exclusively the
sylvatic cycle of echinococcosis is of epidemiologic importance. By
contrast,_E. granulosus_ infections of foxes have been described only in
the United Kingdom (Wales) and Italy (Sardinia). While _E. granulosus_ is
a frequent parasite in some Mediterranean countries, it is rare in most
other parts of Europe. For Germany and Switzerland, prevalences of less
than 1% in dogs and 1.5% in cattle were reported (Eckert [1988 Wien.
Tieraerztl. Mschr. 75, 457-465; Stossel [1989; thesis, University of
Zurich). Various "strains" of _E. granulosus_ exist which differ in their
infectivity or pathogenicity for humans (Thompson & Lymbery [1995,
Echinococcus and Hydatid Disease. Exon: CAB International).
4. There is considerable evidence indicating that the prevalence of
_Echinococcus multilocularis_ has been on the increase in the traditional
endemic area in southwestern Germany (Swabian Alp, Baden-Wuerttemberg) for
the past 15-20 years. Indications (but no definitive proof) for an
increase was also obtained in some other West-German states. This is
contrasted by an apparently stable prevalence at low level in most
East-German regions. Since rabies control has in place in both parts of
Germany for the past 7 or 8 years, this difference between East and
West-Germany cannot be explained by the oral immunisation campaigns against
rabies.
5. The oral immunisation campaigns of foxes against rabies and the
increase of the fox population coincided with the increase in the _E.
multilocularis_ prevalence observed in some, but not all regions. Thus it
is possible to postulate a causal link between the raise in the fox
population and the increase of the _E. multilocularis_ prevalence for West
Germany, but such a link has not been demonstrated and other explanations
for an increase of the _E. multilocularis_ prevalence have not been ruled
out. However, as already mentioned the prevalence of _E. multilocularis_
among foxes remained relatively stable in East Germany at the time when
rabies control was carried out and the population densities increased.
>From an analysis of _Taenia_ sp., ancylostomatid and _E. multilocularis_
infections of foxes in an area with increasing fox population densities we
obtained data indicating that the prevalences of Taenia spp. were
significantly reduced from approximately 60% to 20%. This study was
conducted between 1992 and 1995. At the same time the prevalence of
ancylostomatid infections increased from about 10% to 30% (Tackmann et al.,
unpublished data). We interpret these results in the following way: A
two-host life cycle depending on a predator-prey relationship is placed at
a disadvantage at raising population densities because an increasing part
of the fox population may have to switch over to a diet which does not
involve exposure to Taenia sp. By contrast, the mainly fox-to-fox
transmitted ancylostomatid infections may be favoured at high population
densities, e.g. due to higher contact rates.
6. By comparison with regions highly endemic for human alveolar
echinococcosis such as Alaska, China or Siberia, alveolar echinococcosis is
a rare disease in Central Europe, even in areas with a high E.
multilocularis prevalence in foxes. Such high incidences of human alveolar
echinococcosis seem to be related to the existence of the urban cycle of
the infection (main definitive host: dog). We do not know exactly,
however, whether an increased prevalence of vulpine echinococcosis
automatically leads to a higher infection risk for humans under the
epidemiologic conditions of Central Europe.
7. After all, echinococcosis is a rare disease in Central Europe. In
Switzerland, alveolar echinococcosis (_E. multilocularis_) was diagnosed in
145 cases and cystic echinococcosis (_E. granulosus_) in 300 cases between
1970 and 1983 (Gloor [1988, thesis, University of Zurich). It is believed
that the vast majority human infections with _E. granulosus_ (cystic
echinococcosis) diagnosed in Germany are not autochthonously acquired,
because these infections are mostly observed in immigrants from Russia, the
Mediterranean and Turkey. Between 1985 and 1989, alveolar echinococcosis
(_E. multilocularis_) was diagnosed in 47 cases in the districs of Swabia
and Upper Bavaria, Germany (population: 1.59 million and 3.72 million,
respectively) with corresponding prevalences of over 30% in foxes. An
average annual incidence of 0.02 - 1.4 per 100,000 inhabitants has been
determined for the Central European endemic area (Eckert [1996, Berl.
Muench. Tieraerztl. Wschr. 109, 202-210). One must point out, however,
that in Germany human echinococcosis is not a notifiable disease which may
lead to underestimation. Furthermore, most epidemiological data are
several years old. Even if more recent data were available, they would not
necessarily reflect recent developments of human echinococcosis due to the
long incubation period of the disease in humans (about 5-15 years).
