Provincial health officers have been mobilized in the wake of a steep rise
in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases. The Phuket Provincial Health
Department reported 60 cases of DHF during the first five months of the
year, including 20 cases in May. During the same period last year, only 23
cases were reported. No deaths had been attributed to DHF in Phuket
through the end of May.
