Update: Mumps Outbreak - New York and New Jersey, June 2009 to January 2010
-----------------------------------------
State and local health departments, in collaboration with CDC,
continue to investigate a mumps outbreak that began in New York in
June 2009 (1). The index case occurred in a boy aged 11 years who had
returned on 17 Jun 2009 from a trip to the United Kingdom, where
approximately 7400 reports of laboratory-confirmed mumps were
received by the Health Protection Agency in 2009 [see:
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2010/news0210.htm#mmps>]. He then
attended a New York summer camp for tradition-observant Jewish boys,
where he became symptomatic on 28 Jun 2009. Subsequently, other camp
attendees and a staff member were reported to have mumps, and
transmission continued in multiple locations when the camp attendees
returned home. As of 29 Jan 2010, a total of 1521 cases had been
reported, with onset dates from 2 Jun 2009, through 29 Jan 2010, a
substantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of 30 Oct 2009
(1). The outbreak has remained confined primarily to the tradition-obse!
rvant Jewish community, with less than 3 percent of cases occurring
among persons outside the community. The largest percentage of cases
(61 percent) has occurred among persons aged 7 to 18 years, and 76
percent of the patients are male. Among the patients for whom
vaccination status was reported, 88 percent had received at least one
dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and 75 percent had received 2
doses. This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the
United States since 2006 (2). Although mumps vaccination alone was
not sufficient to prevent this outbreak, maintaining high measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage remains the most
effective way to prevent outbreaks and limit their size when they occur.

Mumps cases included in this report were reported by 29 Jan 2010.
Cases were classified according to the 2008 case definition of the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists; only cases of
probable and confirmed mumps are included in this report. In the
United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommends that children receive 2 doses of measles, mumps,
and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the 1st dose administered at 12-15
months and the 2nd dose near the time of school entry (at 4-6 years).
Methods used to obtain the vaccination status of patients have
included parental report, review of vaccination cards, and
verification from health-care providers.

The 1521 outbreak-related mumps cases have been reported from several
counties in New York and New Jersey; local transmission is
continuing. The majority (675 [44 percent]) of cases have been
reported from New York City (primarily Brooklyn), followed by Orange
County, New York (364 [24 percent]); Rockland County, New York (298
[20 percent]); and 4 counties in New Jersey (159 [10 percent]). 25 (2
percent) cases (reported during 28 Jun-8 Sep 2009) were associated
with the summer camp in Sullivan County, New York; however, no
additional cases occurred in the county after the camp ended in late
August 2009. Of the 1521 patients, 1477 (97 percent) are members of
the tradition-observant Jewish community. Of the 44 cases not
associated with this religious community, 33 have been reported from
New York City; 7 from New Jersey; 2 from Orange County, New York; and
2 from Rockland County, New York. Many of these outside cases have
occurred among persons who have reported regular contact !
with members of the affected community.

Diagnostic laboratory testing for mumps (i.e., detection of mumps
immunoglobulin M antibodies by various methods, detection of mumps
RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or
isolation of mumps virus in cell culture) has been performed for 761
(50 percent) cases. Of these, 385 (51 percent) cases are laboratory confirmed.

Of the 1518 patients whose age is known, 1385 (91 percent) are aged
over 6 years. The median age of patients is 15 years (range 3 months
to 90 years) and is similar in all areas with ongoing transmission
except New Jersey, where the median age is 17 years. Of the 1489
patients whose sex is known, 1136 (76 percent) are male. 65 reports
of complications from mumps have been received: orchitis (55 cases),
pancreatitis (5 cases), aseptic meningitis (2 cases), transient
deafness (one case), Bell's palsy (one case), and oophoritis (one
case). 19 hospitalizations from mumps have been reported; no deaths
have occurred.

Vaccination status is known for 1115 patients: 966 (91 percent) of
1062 patients aged 18 years and under and 149 (33 percent) of 456
patients aged 19 years and over. Of these patients, 976 (88 percent)
had received at least one dose of mumps-containing vaccine before the
outbreak, and 839 (75 percent) had received 2 doses. Among patients
aged 7-18 years, the age group with the majority of cases and for
whom 2 doses of MMR vaccine is recommended, 93 percent had received
at least one dose, and 85 percent had received 2 doses. The
vaccination status of the patients varies by location. The percentage
of patients aged over 6 years (for whom vaccination status is known)
who had received 2 doses of mumps vaccine is highest in Orange
County, New York (86 percent), followed by New York City (83
percent), New Jersey (76 percent), and Rockland County, New York (73 percent).

Public health response measures in all affected areas have continued
throughout the outbreak. Health-care providers have been notified
about the ongoing outbreak, the importance of verifying that children
have received all recommended vaccinations, and the need to offer
vaccinations to adults with unknown vaccination status who do not
have a history of mumps. State and local health departments also have
worked with affected schools to enhance vaccination policies,
including policies to exclude unvaccinated children from school
during outbreaks and to isolate children at home for 5 days after
onset of parotitis. Certain jurisdictions have encouraged providers
to offer a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine to children aged 1-4 years;
however, this strategy has not been a focus of the public health
response because of the small proportion (4.9 percent) of cases
reported in this age group.

Beginning on 19 Jan 2010, in Orange County, New York, public health
officials began offering a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in 3 schools
where, despite documentation of a high level of 2-dose coverage among
students, transmission had continued for over 2 months. This
intervention is being carried out under an Institutional Review
Board-approved protocol that provides for an evaluation of the impact
of the intervention.

MMWR Editorial Note:

The mumps outbreak in the New York/New Jersey area has grown
substantially, and anecdotal reports from certain affected areas
suggest that the rate of new cases is not decreasing; the appearance
of a downward trend in recent weeks (illustrated by a figure in the
original text) is partly a result of reporting delays. The outbreak
is occurring almost exclusively in a specific religious community,
and no cases outside this community have resulted in sustained transmission.

Like the mumps outbreaks that occurred in 2006 (2), much of the
current outbreak is occurring in congregate settings, where
prolonged, close contact among persons might be facilitating
transmission. Within the affected religious community, cases have
occurred predominantly among school-aged boys, who attend separate
schools from girls. The higher rate among boys might be a result of
the additional hours that boys in this community spend in school
compared with girls, including long periods in large study halls,
often face-to-face with a study partner.

In addition, transmission in the community overall might be
facilitated by relatively large household sizes. According to the
2000 U.S. Census, the mean household size in one of the affected
communities was 5.7, compared with a mean U.S. household size of 2.6.
The limited transmission to persons outside the community might be a
result of the relatively less interpersonal contact between persons
inside and outside the community.

Although the school settings and large household sizes might be
promoting transmission, the high vaccination coverage in the affected
community likely is limiting the size of the outbreak. In addition,
high vaccination coverage in surrounding communities is the most
plausible reason that the few cases outside of the affected community
have not caused other outbreaks.

In this outbreak, as in other recent mumps outbreaks among highly
vaccinated populations (3), most cases have occurred in vaccinated
persons. The mumps vaccine has greatly reduced the incidence of mumps
in the United States. From 1967, when the mumps vaccine was 1st
licensed, to the early 2000s, the number of reported cases decreased
from 186 000 to less than 500 annually (2). Nonetheless, the
effectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is lower than
that of the measles and rubella components. Estimates of the
effectiveness of the mumps vaccine have varied in previous studies,
ranging from 73 percent to 91 percent after one dose and from 79
percent to 95 percent after 2 doses (3-5). At least one study found 2
doses to be more effective than one dose (6).

Public health officials began offering a 3rd dose of vaccine to
students in certain schools in Orange County, New York, because mumps
transmission had continued among students, despite their high rate of
2-dose coverage. Although a previous study indicated that a 3rd dose
of MMR vaccine for seronegative college students resulted in rapid
seroconversion with a low rate of IgM response, which is indicative
of an anamnestic immune response (7), ACIP has not recommended a 3rd
dose, and no data exist on the effectiveness of a 3rd dose in either
reducing the risk for mumps or altering the course of an outbreak.
Data obtained from use of the 3rd dose of MMR vaccine in Orange
County might be used to guide future options for mumps outbreak
control in settings with high 2-dose coverage.

This outbreak emphasizes that mumps outbreaks can occur in highly
vaccinated populations. Although several factors play a role in mumps
control in the United States, maintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccine
coverage remains the most effective way to prevent and limit the size
of mumps outbreaks.

of the low vaccination status of this particular community are not
borne out. A factor in transmission not previously considered is the
role of household size, which is 5.7 in this community compared with
2.6 overall in the USA. - Mod.CP]
