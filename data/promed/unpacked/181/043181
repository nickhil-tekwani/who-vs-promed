Livestock prices in Rakai district have drastically fallen and because of a
foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak.
A bull that used to cost sh 400 000 [USD 216 450] at the beginning of the
year now goes for about sh 50 000 [USD 27 056].
Meat and milk prices have dropped by almost 70 percent with a kilo of meat
selling at sh 800 [USE 0.43] from sh 2500 [USD 1.35] and a litre of milk
going for sh 100 [USD 0.05] from sh 250 [USD 0.13].
The FMD outbreak in the district and the entire country followed an
expulsion of cattle keepers from Tanzania with about 100 000 head of
cattle, some of which are suspected to have had the disease.
Livestock prices started to drop as soon as quarantine was in place and
major market places in Kakuuto, Mutukula and Kasasa were also closed.
Approximately 630 registered families with 47 000 head of cattle were
assured of drugs, which they continuously administered, but they lacked
enough water and pasture to feed the cattle. Cattle keepers resorted to
selling off their animals so as to get money for food and other basic
necessities.
"Few people are willing to buy the cows," said James Rugyema one of the
livestock farmers in Kakuuto sub-county. But he is optimistic that the
disease is almost being mitigated and that they will be back in business
very soon.
Fighting FMD has been a joint effort of the district's chief administrative
officer, the district internal security organs, the Police, Local Defence
Units and Local Council chairmen.
"They mobilised and continuously sensitised the masses about the dangers of
the disease," Kimbugwe said.
A large number of livestock keepers have started moving to other districts
in search of pastures and water. Kimbugwe said they have continued
vaccinating all stock against other diseases including contagious bovine
pleuro-pneumonia.

In the districts of Masaka, Rakai and Sembabule, 42 suspects have been
arrested over illegal transportation of cattle from quarantined areas
between June and August.
Addressing journalists in Rakai on 14 Aug 2006, the Southern Regional
Police Commander, Mr Assuman Mugenyi, said 152 head of cattle were impounded.
He said 17 vehicles, 117 goats, 48 pigs and 18 sheep were also impounded.
Mugenyi said more than 4400 hides and skins were also confiscated.
The Agriculture Ministry imposed a quarantine on livestock in the districts
of Rakai, Isingiro, Ntungamo, Mbarara, Masaka, Mpigi, Kampala and Mukono.

Others are Bushenyi, Luweero, Nakaseke, Kiboga, Mubende, Kabale, Kasese and
Kitgum. This followed an outbreak of the FMD in the districts.
On 2 Aug 2006, the Parliament passed a motion authorising the government to
incur additional expenditure of Shs 4.5 billion [USD 2 435 065 ] for
emergency control and eradication of the FMD that is threatening to engulf
the country.
Finance State Minister Jachan Omach said there was "emergency pressure"
that required immediate purchase of at least 2 million doses of the vaccine
to contain the disease in the affected districts and surrounding areas.
He warned that if the disease spreads near Entebbe International Airport, a
ban might be slammed on international flights.

[FMD seems to have become widespread in Tanzania in recent years (see
20050712.1979). Though also endemic in Uganda, it seems that the situation
there this year is deteriorating. Uganda's most recent FMD data on OIE's
Handistatus data-base relate to 2004. The serotypes recorded were O, SAT 1,
SAT 2 and SAT 3. The 2004 report included the following statement: "Control
of FMD outbreaks through strict livestock movement control and ring
vaccination. 245 000 doses of vaccines were provided to control the
outbreaks. Private companies procured additional vaccine". - Mod.AS]
