Although vaccination is available in all health centers in Fortaleza [the capital], the state of Ceara reported 92 percent of the 401 cases of measles recorded in Brazil from January to the beginning of September [2014]. There were 370 confirmed cases, 142 of them in the capital and the rest in 20 other cities. The incidence rate of the disease reached more than 300 per 100 000 inhabitants in some municipalities. There were no deaths due to complications of the disease.

According to the [5 Sep 2014] epidemiological bulletin of the Ceara Department of Health (SESA), the remaining cases were reported from the states of Pernambuco (24) and Sao Paulo (7). The next bulletin is expected this week.

In Ceara, the city of Massape (272 km/169 miles from Fortaleza) recorded 92 cases of the disease, with an incidence rate of 246.6; Uruburetama (127 km/79 mi from the capital) had 61 cases and an incidence rate of 300.7 per 100 000 inhabitants. Statisticians report that 98 suspected cases are still being investigated in 11 municipalities of Ceara.

The 1st case in Fortaleza was a doctor who was working in the area comprising Regional Secretariat II. "Every time a vaccination campaign does not reach 95-100 percent of the population, it creates these pockets of susceptible people," comments Vanessa Soldateli, the director of immunization of the Municipal Health Department (SMS).

According to the report, the age groups most affected by measles were children between 6 months and one year (63 cases), adults between 20 and 29 years (75 cases), and young people aged 15 to 19 years (54 cases). Soldateli explains that in the capital alone, babies accounted for 44 percent of cases. "Children under one year are not vaccinated because it is not indicated in the routine vaccination schedule for the 1st year of life. But in an outbreak situation, you ignore it because the benefit is greater than any loss," she says.

The coordinator of Health Promotion and Protection of SESA, Marcio Garcia, says that intensification of prevention work in the interior had begun in the 1st semester of 2014. "We managed to contain the outbreak in Uruburetama, and the last case there was reported in June [2014]. In the region of Sobral, where Massape is located, the situation has started to improve, but we [must remain alert] because neighboring municipalities, from other regions of the state are beginning to report suspected cases," says Garcia.

A new Refugee Reception Centre in Karlsruhe has been closed after diagnosis of a case of measles virus infection just 10 days after its opening. The case was recognised 10-14 days after the initial admission of refugees.

A spokesperson for the District Health Department stated that the Reception Centre would only be reopened when no more measles cases were identified. All current admissions to the Refugee Centre would be vaccinated. The current situation is under review. Previously, a measles case had been identified in Karlsruhe, and the infection had not spread as result of prompt vaccination. The new Reception Centre in Greschbach Road will remain under surveillance, and comprehensive vaccination of residents will be completed.

Last weekend, a little more than 300 people arrived in Karlsruhe seeking asylum. While this figure is lower than the expected 500 refugees, it is still well above the average for the past month. Since 1 Sep 2014, more than 4800 people had already arrived in Karlsruhe, a total greater than for the whole of 2010.

At least 15 children have died in Syria during a measles vaccination programme after a muscle relaxant, atracurium, was believed to have been added to the vaccine instead of diluents. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is helping to determine the exact cause of the deaths. But a spokesperson said that it doesn't seem as though there was anything wrong with the vaccine batch itself but that it was "mishandled on the ground." The vaccine must be diluted prior to use [See the initial WHO report posted in Measles update (38) 20140921.2791927].

The matter has been passed on to a local court in Syria to establish whether the incident was an inadvertent error or a criminal act. The local nongovernmental organisation "Measles Control Task Force" (MCTF), which was leading the vaccination programme, says it will continue to pursue an inquiry into the matter and prosecute any individuals if they are found to have been negligent. MCTF's programme had been aided by WHO and UNICEF.

Some 20 000 children were vaccinated in the northern province of Idlib when the campaign began on 15 Sep 2014, but it was cancelled the following day when the 1st deaths were reported. Vaccination is performed by local health facilities in the area, and the MCTF has visited the hospital at the centre of the deaths. In a statement, it says that there was a "great resemblance" between a vial of vaccine solvent and atracurium. Atracurium is often used prior to surgery with its dose determined by weight. Younger children are more severely affected by the medicine due to their small size. All of the children who died were less than 2 years old, while the 50 older children who were affected have recovered, a WHO spokesperson said.

In a joint statement with UNICEF, WHO says it is vital that immunisation efforts in Syria resume as quickly as possible. But before this can occur, the exact cause of the deaths will need to be confirmed and families and communities reassured that the vaccine is safe, WHO adds.

Measles is a particular threat to children who have been displaced from their homes and who are living in refugee camps or unsanitary conditions, says WHO. More than 5 million children have been left in need of basic humanitarian support after 4 years of fighting in Syria.

[This account provides some additional information, but it is unlikely that it will be established whether the event was a deliberate act or an accident.

Idlib governorate, which is the site of this incident, is held by moderate rebel groups opposed to both Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and the extremist Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to the UNICEF report. - Mod.CP

Measles is being diagnosed at the rate of one case a week in Western Australia (WA) this year [2014], with the highest number of cases in 15 years.

The surge has prompted doctors to call for upgraded travel warnings about vaccination, especially for young adults, and renewed efforts to ensure children are fully immunised. 39 cases have been reported so far this year [2014], compared with 14 for all last year [2013] and 6 cases in 2012. It is the highest number since 1998, when 50 cases were reported and health authorities embarked on a mass vaccination of 1.8 million Australian children, or 96 per cent of all primary school students.

The WA Health Department said more than half the cases this year [2014] had been children, most of them unvaccinated, while 44 per cent had been adults aged 20 to 40 who were unvaccinated or had only one dose as children. Many of those infected visited countries where the highly infectious disease is still rife. In some cases, they spread the infection after returning to WA.

A department spokesman said there had been 20 separate incidents this year [2014] involving measles being brought into WA. The biggest cluster was 7 people, with one infected in the Philippines and then spreading measles to 6 people in WA. "The higher number of cases this year [2014] is primarily related to a large measles epidemic in the Philippines, and also from Bali, Viet Nam and other South-East Asian holiday destinations, including Singapore," the spokesman said.

Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said the figures were concerning, particularly the high rate of infection in unvaccinated people. The department said people born since 1996 were at risk of not being fully protected and, before travelling overseas, should check whether they had received 2 doses of the vaccine.
