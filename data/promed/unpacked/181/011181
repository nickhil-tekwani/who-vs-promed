TRYPANOSOMIASIS RX, CANINE ADVERSE REACTION - MOZAMBIQUE: RFI

From: Carlos Lopes Pereira <clp@vetline.uem.mz>
I am treating dogs with isometamidium a preventive/curative drug used
in cattle against tsetse transmited trypanosomiasis. The dogs were
imported from S. Antonio Texas, USA, and were deployed in tsetse
infested areas in Mozambique in 1992 to help in detecting mines. I am
using the drug every 4 months. So far only one dog has died with T.
brucei brucei infection. The drug is used by intramuscular injection
in the thigh. It proved to be very painful.
We usually get 10% or more of the dogs with inflamation after the
injections which require further treatment. Furthermore, we have got
after 5 years , 8% of the dogs developing irreversible fibrosis of the
semimembranosus/semitendinosus muscle. I wonder if the drug can be
applied in together with an antinflamatory, to prevent such damages. I did
not find any reference in the literature. Could somebody suggest something?
