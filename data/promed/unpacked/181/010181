A China Airlines female flight attendant who contracted the viral disease rubella, or German measles, had worked on 6 different flights during her period of communicability, according to Taiwanese health authorities.

Last week on [14 Mar 2015], the woman from northern Taiwan developed symptoms of the infection to include fever, runny nose, cough, and rash. On the following day [15 Mar 2015], she sought medical attention at a medical center. On [18 Mar 2015], rubella infection was confirmed. Prior to her disease onset, she had traveled to Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. As a result, the Taiwan CDC has determined her to be an imported case and the 2nd confirmed rubella case in Taiwan this year [2015].

According to health officials, she worked on 6 different flights, including flights CI116 and CI117 that traveled to and from Taoyuan [municipality in northwestern Taiwan] and Fukuoka [prefecture on the northern shore Kyushu Island, Japan] on [8 Mar 2015], flights CI110 and CI111 that traveled to and from Taoyuan and Fukuoka on 10 and 11 Mar 2015, and flights CI753 and CI754 that traveled to and from Taoyuan and Singapore on 13 and 14 Mar 2015.

Contact tracing has identified 686 contacts, including her family members, her fellow crew members, passengers on the same flights, healthcare personnel, and patients that she came into contact with when she sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [11 Apr 2015].

Passengers on the flights are urged to contact their local health officials and to be aware of rubella symptoms and monitoring their health for the next 21 days. Pregnant women who took the same flight are urged to seek medical attention to determine the need for treatment.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), rubella, sometimes called German measles or 3-day measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with fever and rash. It is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing.

While symptoms of rubella are typically mild, a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body with low fever and body aches, if a pregnant woman contracts rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage. The health problems due to the infection are called congenital rubella syndrome.

[Rubella is a contagious, generally mild viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. In pregnant women, this disease may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Worldwide, an estimated 110 000 babies are born with CRS every year. While there is no specific treatment for rubella, the disease is preventable by vaccination.

The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host.

In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (less than 39 C / 102.2 F), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days.

Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.

When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more.

Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects, and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.

The highest risk of CRS is in countries where women of childbearing age do not have immunity to the disease (either through vaccination or from having had rubella). Before the introduction of the vaccine, up to 4 babies in every 1000 live births were born with CRS.

Large-scale rubella vaccination during the past decade has practically eliminated rubella and CRS in many developed and in some developing countries. The WHO Region of the Americas has had no endemic (naturally-transmitted) cases of rubella infection since 2009. CRS rates are highest in the WHO African and Southeast Asian regions where vaccine coverage is lowest.

The rubella vaccine is a live attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection.

Rubella vaccines are available either in monovalent formulation (vaccine directed at only one pathogen) or more commonly in combinations with other vaccines such as with vaccines against measles (MR), measles and mumps (MMR), or measles, mumps, and varicella (MMRV).

Adverse reactions following vaccination are generally mild. They may include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, rash, and muscle aches. Mass immunization campaigns in the Region of the Americas involving more than 250 million adolescents and adults did not identify any serious adverse reactions associated with the vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs367/en/).

It is understood that all the 686 contacts with the index cases are mostly those with no history of either prior natural disease occurrence or rubella immunization (95 percent protection). While pregnant women are at the highest and immediate risk, male contacts will disseminate the disease further to this former particular risk group.
