Approximately 50 cases of pneumonia are being reported among children in Marshall County Schools, according to officials today [22 Oct 2019]. "Cameron Elementary School and Hilltop Elementary School have a high percentage of reported cases," said Shelby Haines, superintendent of schools. The outbreak, though, isn't limited to those 2 schools.

"There are around 50 reported cases," said Thomas Cook, Marshall County Health Department administrator. The majority of cases are occurring "in a couple of schools," he said, but added, this illness "is not just confined to Marshall County.

There are other cases of this throughout the state," said Tony Wood, spokesman for Marshall County Schools.

It has yet to be determined whether the cases of pneumonia are caused by a virus or bacteria, Cook said. State epidemiologists are sending testing kits to the health department for distribution to rapid care facilities, Cook said. Swabs taken from patients will be sent to the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health for testing and diagnosis of the form of infection affecting local residents.

Treating the symptoms is recommended for either form of pneumonia. Antibiotics, however, are prescribed only for bacterial pneumonia. Doctors "are not going to give antibiotics unless you have a bacteria that you want to eradicate," Cook explained.

Extensive cleaning is being done in school buildings to prevent additional cases. "Last week [week of 14 Oct 2019], we began getting phone calls of reported cases of illness in a number of schools," Haines said. "When those reports came, we began cleaning with an approved disinfectant to try to get a jump on it. We increased the custodial staff to clean with approved methods. "The superintendent said the school district has bought its own ionizer, a machine that is being used for cleaning during after-school hours. "In the evening, we run a cleaning device that sprays disinfectant on all surfaces, on top of regular cleaning. It sprays a mist and sticks to surfaces," she said.

In addition, school personnel and health educators are training children on the importance of hand washing, using facial tissues. and coughing into one's elbow. "Hand washing is the key to everything," Cook said.

The health department has sent a sanitarian to Cameron and Hilltop schools to check the facilities. "The county (school system) has really been pro-active in cleaning and education," the health administrator said.

When the outbreak began, "we started to receive calls from the parents, from the urgent care (centers) with people coming in with some difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever. Chest X-rays were showing congestion in lungs and classical signs of pneumonia," Cook said.

The health official predicted that pneumonia also will affect the adult population and younger children. Patients can go back to school or work when their fever subsides for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication, he said.

[We are told that about 50 cases of pneumonia are being reported among children, mainly in 2 elementary schools in the Wheeling, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, Marshall County, West Virginia, although additional cases are also being reported throughout the state. Patients are said to be school children with difficulty breathing, wheezing, lethargy, fever, and chest X-rays findings consistent with pneumonia. No further details about this outbreak are given in the news report above. The microbial etiology is as yet unknown.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and, less commonly, fungi. Viruses, such as influenza, can cause of outbreaks of CAP. Other viruses that cause CAP in school-aged children include adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus capable (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/5/681.full.pdf). Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are more common in children under 5 years of age (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/15750086). Common bacterial causes of CAP in this age group include _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_. Outbreaks of CAP caused by _M. pneumoniae_ occur mostly in crowded environments, like households, schools, college dormitories, and military barracks, when coughing releases small droplets of respiratory secretions into the air that are inhaled by close contacts.

Fungi rarely cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy people, but outbreaks of CAP caused by environmental fungi that are characteristic of certain regions of the US, such as _Histoplasma_, _Coccidioides_, and _Blastomyces_, can occasionally occur, when soil harboring these fungi are disturbed. Although unlikely in elementary school children, the opioid epidemic in the US could also cause CAP as a result of aspiration of anaerobic bacterial mouth flora or as a result of injection drug use giving rise to hematogenous _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia.

The Wheeling Metropolitan Statistical Area, with a population of a 147 950 residents in 2010, consists of 2 counties in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and one in eastern Ohio, anchored by the city of Wheeling, which is about 90 miles (about 145 km) southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia_metropolitan_area). A map of showing the location of Wheeling can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Wheeling,+WV+26003/Pittsburgh,+Pennsylvania.

Further information on the clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
