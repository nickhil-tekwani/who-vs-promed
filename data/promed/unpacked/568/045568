The EU and OIE Bluetongue reference laboratory at The Pirbright Institute, UK received blood samples from sheep from the Peloponnese area of southern Greece on 4 Jul 2014 (sampling date was not specified). These were used to extract RNA, which was initially tested using a real-time RT-PCR assay targeting genome segment 10 of Bluetongue virus (BTV) (Hofmann et al. ISO/IEC 17025 test), giving positive results (Ct values 20.1 to 24.9).

Samples were also received from Bulgaria on 10 Jul 2014 (collected on 4 Jul 2014) from sheep and goats. Eleven samples (out of 56) were positive for BTV (by Seg-10 real-time RT-PCR assays) with Ct values of 21.2 to 37.2. Virus was isolated from 8 of the samples, and these isolates are designated as BUL2014/01, BUL2014/06, BUL2014/07, BUL2014/08, BUL2014/09, BUL2014/10, BUL2014/11 BUL2014/12, BUL2014/13 and BUL2014/14 in the Orbivirus Reference Collection at Pirbright.

The Greek blood samples and Bulgarian isolates were tested by serogroup specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting genome segment 2 (Seg-2). In both cases, positive results were obtained using primers targeting Seg-2 of BTV serotype 4 (BTV-4) (Ct values of 21.4 to 26.5 and 22.7 to 38.7 respectively).

Full length sequencing of genome segment 2 and phylogenetic comparisons confirmed the identity of BTV-4 in samples from both countries. Seg-2 of the BTV-4 viruses from Greece and Bulgaria (2014) shared 99.9 per cent nucleotide (nt) similarity in Seg-2, consistent with isolation from the same outbreak.

We, therefore, believe that other isolates from the region (adjacent countries) during 2014 are also likely to contain BTV-4 from the same lineage, although this will need to be confirmed by appropriate assays and phylogenetic comparisons.

Further comparison to other available sequence data for Seg-2 showed a closest match to previous BTV-4 isolates from Sudan (SUD1983/01) and other European countries (with 95.7-94.2 percent nt sequence identities), demonstrating that although the 2014 Greek/Bulgarian virus belongs to the major Western topotype of BTV-4, it is not very closely related to previous European strains and can, therefore, be regarded as a novel introduction of this serotype into Europe, probably from Africa.

Full length sequences of the remaining 9 genome-segments were also generated for the virus from both Greece and Bulgaria. Phylogenetic comparisons of these data confirmed that all segments from both sources belong to a "Western topotype" BTV strain, probably from Africa.

The sequence data obtained for the Greek and Bulgarian viruses were nearly identical in most of the other genome segments (showing 99.9 to 99.4 per cent nt identities). Previous experience indicates that this level of identity could be expected for isolates from a single disease outbreak. However, Seg-4 of BUL2014/07 (which does not control virus serotype) was less closely related to the corresponding segment from the 2014 Greek blood sample, with only 96.5 per cent nt identity.

Seg-4 of BUL2014/07 was most closely related to that of BTV-2 from Tunisia 2000 (isolate TUN2000/01) and BTV-2 from Italy 2002 (isolate ITL2002/07) showing 98.8 per cent nt sequence identity. This indicates some heterogeneity in these outbreak strains from Greece and Bulgaria 2014 and could reflect the generation of sequence from blood (in one case) and a virus isolate (in the other case).

It is possible that other variants in individual genome segments may be detected on further analyses of samples from the 2014 outbreak in the region.

We conclude that the BTV-4 outbreak strain is a reassortant, containing genome segments derived from the same lineages as BTV-4, BTV-1 and BTV-2 isolates that have been circulating in the Western Mediterranean and North African countries in recent years.

We have recently received multiple additional samples from Bulgaria and Greece (all of which have tested positive by real-time Rt-PCr for BTV, and for BTV-4.). Five additional samples have been received from Romania (from 2014, 4 from cattle, one from sheep), all of which are also positive by type specific real-time RT-PCR assays targeting Seg-2 of BTV-4. These samples were negative for epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) by virus-species/serogroup specific RT-PCR assays. Sequence analyses and virus isolation are currently underway. We are also expecting to receive samples from FYR Macedonia, Turkey, and Serbia for outbreaks of disease in ruminants that have occurred during 2014.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to the authors of the above firsthand authoritative response to our RFI and to the Pirbright Institute. Detailed information on each of the described 2014 BTV-4 isolates are available in the Pirbright collection at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins/reoid/btv-4.htm.

The finding of a possible African origin of this major BTV-4 epizootic, which reportedly started on 29 May 2014 in the Peloponnese area of southern Greece, is of interest. The 1st reported outbreak took place in Lakonia, on the south of the Peloponnese (OIE map at http://tinyurl.com/pcw5m73), from where the disease seems to have spread further north, most probably by windborne culicoides, eventually covering the northern parts of Greece, Thrace (north west Turkey, bordering Greece), Bulgaria, Romania, FYR Macedonia, and eastern Serbia (OIE map at http://tinyurl.com/o9hon45; click on the Balkan cluster, zoom in). The cluster in Italy is caused by a different serotype (BTV-1).

The closest North African territory where bluetongue has recently been suspected is Algeria (Djelfa and Naama; see ProMED-MENA posting at http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2735996). Samples from the said sites, and enhanced surveillance in other north African countries, particularly Libya and Tunisia, from where infected culicoides could have come, deserve to be considered. Explanation for the exceptionally high morbidity rate in Romanian cattle is yet to be found. - Mod.AS
