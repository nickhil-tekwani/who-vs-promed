Tests show high H7N9 antibodies in Chinese poultry workers
----------------------------------------------------------
Adding to the evidence that poultry are the source of China's H7N9 influenza outbreak, a serology study in the southern Guangdong province city of Shenzhen found evidence of asymptomatic or mild infections in poultry workers, with levels increasing in the outbreak's 2nd wave. Researchers, however, found no evidence of infection when they looked at blood samples from the general population. The team from Shenzhen and the University of Hong Kong published their findings yesterday [27 May 2014] in an early online edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases. They collected blood samples from retail and wholesale poultry workers in May 2013 from all 10 of the city's districts and again in late December 2013 in 7 districts where environmental swabs had tested positive for the virus. The team obtained samples from 501 workers in May and from 375 in December. In December the virus was identified in market environmental samples, and the 1st human case in Shenzhen detected.

For the general public, the authors collected blood samples in March and September of 2013 with the goal of recruiting 70 people in each of 4 age-groups. For both groups they tested for antibodies to both H7N9 and H5N1 using hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays. The researchers found a hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer of at least 1:160 in 7.2 percent of poultry workers in May and in 14.9 percent in December, a rise that was consistent with the 2nd wave of H7N9 activity in China, with Guangdong as one of the hot spots. None of the participants had confirmed H7N9 infections, and investigators didn't find evidence of infection in any of the general public group for either testing period. The team pointed out that other studies of H7N9 seroprevalence in Chinese poultry workers showed much lower levels. For example, a study based on sampling in Zhejiang province in April and May of 2013 found 1.3 percent had antibody titers suggesting earlier infection.

Looking for risk factors, the researchers found that being female and having occupational exposure for 10 or more years was associated with infection. The team said the increased risk in women may reflect their having the major share of poultry duties for that region, which include selling poultry, defeathering, and cleaning. They said the longer work history could be related to reduced preventive measures or may reflect greater susceptibility to infection in older people. They found that working in a retail market, rather than a wholesale setting, was associated with antibody titers indicative of infection in the analysis of samples from May. The researchers wrote that the shorter stays in warehouse markets and twice-a-week disinfection protocols might limit workers' exposure to the H7N9 virus.

[The following is the Abstract of the Clinical Infectious Diseases article entitled: "Seroprevalence to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus among poultry workers and the general population in southern China: a longitudinal study", Xin Wang and others (at: Clin Infect Dis. (2014) doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu399).

"Background: Confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection continue to occur in mainland China. Few confirmed cases have occurred in poultry workers despite potentially higher rates of exposure.

Methods: A serological survey was conducted in May and December 2013 in poultry market workers, and in March and September 2013 in the general population. Blood samples were collected and tested for antibodies to H7N9 and H5N1 viruses by hemagglutination-inhibition assays. Multivariable analysis was employed to identify risk factors related to H7N9 infection indicated by serology among poultry workers.

Results: In the poultry workers, 36/501 (7.2 percent) in May and 56/375 (14.9 percent) in December had HI antibody titer of at least 1:160 to H7N9. Of 96 individuals who participated in both surveys, 52 (54.2 percent) workers had at least a 4-fold rise in H7N9 antibody titers from May to December. In a multivariable analysis, female sex (odds ratio 2.713; 95 percent CI: 1.098-6.705) and at least 10 years of occupational exposure (odds ratio, 3.592; 95 percent CI: 1.246-10.354) were identified as risk factors for infection. Seroprevalence against H5N1 of at least 1:160 was low in May (4/501; 0.8 percent) and December (3/375; 0.8 percent). In the general population, 0/417 individuals in March and 0/408 individuals in September had antibody titer of at least 1:160 to H7N9 or to H5N1.

Conclusions: While none of the participants in our study had virologically confirmed H7N9 infection, the high proportion of poultry workers with serologic evidence of H7N9 infection between May and December 2013 suggests a substantial risk of mild H7N9 infections in this group, supporting stricter control measures in live poultry markets."

This analysis confirms the expectation that poultry workers in South China are exposed to infection at an appreciable frequency by H7N9 avian influenza virus during the course of their employment. Few infected workers develop signs of clinical illness. The rate of onward transmission to their contacts not employed in the poultry industry has still to be estimated.
