Scotland: Bat Conservationist First Suspected Case of Rabies in UK Since 1902
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DUNDEE: A man who is believed to have been bitten by a bat is being treated
for the symptoms of rabies, health officials in Dundee have confirmed. The
patient, who is a bat conservationist, was admitted to hospital with
symptoms of the potentially fatal infection. A spokesman for NHS Tayside
said he is in a "critical but stable" condition. Rabies is a serious
infection of the nervous system that is caused by a virus which is usually
transmitted by a bite from an infected animal. If confirmed as rabies, the
case could be the first occurrence of the infection acquired in the UK
since 1902.
The health spokesman said: "The individual, who lives in Angus (Tayside),
was admitted with mild neurological symptoms which have since developed
into a progressive neurological disorder consistent with rabies. Laboratory
tests are under way. "Clinicians at Ninewells Hospital believe the patient
may have been infected by European Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV) - a type of rabies
known to exist in several north European countries. "The patient at
Ninewells Hospital is known to have had prolonged close contact with bats
over many years and had been bitten on at least one occasion." Doctors said
diagnosis is very difficult because the particular type of rabies being
investigated is so rare. Drew Walker, NHS Tayside's public health director,
said: "It is important to stress that this is not a confirmed case of
rabies. "In the circumstances, however, we believe that it is prudent and
sensible to regard it as such and take all necessary public health measures."
Professor Bill Reilly, a vet surgeon working for the Scottish Centre for
Infectious and Environmental Health (SCIEH), has been offering advice and
support to NHS Tayside. He said: "It is important to stress that this is
not the traditional rabies virus as we know it. "The unconfirmed case in
Dundee concerns a rabies-like virus known only in bats. "It doesn't pose a
risk to the general public. Those who regularly handle bats in the UK are
more at risk, but since 1996 such people have been advised to be vaccinated
against this virus." Prof Reilly said he was not aware of any cases where
people had survived after being infected with bat rabies. Conservation body
Scottish Natural Heritage has advised all of its workers to avoid contact
with bats until advised otherwise.
Last month, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) warned that bats in the UK may be carrying EBLV which can affect
humans. Tests carried out on a bat from Lancashire revealed the presence of
European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV 2) which in rare cases can be harmful to
humans. The Daubenton's bat was sent to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
in Weybridge, Surrey, to be analysed after it bit a woman on the hand in
Lancashire on 11 Sep 2002. The woman, a bat conservationist, was examined
by infectious disease specialists but did not appear to be suffering from
any rabies symptoms.
