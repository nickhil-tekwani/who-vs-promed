[It is not obvious from this report what kind of birds were affected,
but I wouldn't be surprised if they were zoo species or birds of
prey. Last year's (2006) outbreak in Saudi Arabia was in a falcon.
To the north, in Kuwait, there have been recent reports of outbreaks
at the zoo and in backyard poultry flocks. The location of the
outbreak is near the Persian Gulf midway between Kuwait and Qatar --
