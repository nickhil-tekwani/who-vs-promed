Health authorities are working through passenger lists to contact people
who took a cruise to New Guinea and have been exposed to typhoid. Four
people have been confirmed to have the highly-contagious disease and four
more are suspected to have contracted it from a meal taken at a hotel on
the way to the Kokoda Trail. They were on the P&O liner Fair Princess
which left Cairns on May 12.
Dr Graeme Rouch, who chairs the Australian and New Zealand Communicable
Disease Network, says typhoid is readily treated with antibiotics and is
rarely fatal in Australia. "It's an insidious disease. If it's treated in
the first week the symptoms
don't get too severe," Dr Rouch said. "As the disease progresses without
treatment, they start to get very confused and eventually end up moribund."
Ken Adams from Newcastle, who was a passenger, says he spoke to a number of
people on board who reported feeling ill and a petition was taken up among
those who went on the Kokoda trail. "They said they were in bed sick and
the doctor on the ship told them that they had food poisoning from the
Kokoda trail and they were in bed for a couple of days," Mr Adams said.
"I must say any food that P&O prepared was fine it was just what was
prepared on the island that was the problem."

For those interested in counting heads, we have another case in Perth today
(10 Jun 1999) which we picked up with blood cultures (three positive
sets!). This 48 year old lady who had been on the boat presented to her
[physician after seeing the story on the news. She has fever, general
malaise, rash, neutropenia and a transaminitis.

The reports mention an array of symptoms that are not typical of typhoid
fever: "120 of the 900 passengers on board had been afflicted with severe
diarrhoea, abdominal cramping and vomiting, or a range of other symptoms.
"Has the report of three passengers with _S. typhi_ been confirmed by
public health officials? The incubation period for typhoid is generally 1
week or more, although it can be shorter with larger doses of organisms.
Was this cruise out for an extended period, or is some other enteric
infection with a shorter incubation period (viral, other bacterial) more
likely?

[My reading of this and prior postings leads to the conclusion that there
are currently 4 confirmed cases. Dr. Dassey has a point that there may be
another form of food poisoning superimposed on this outbreak of typhoid. -
