[1] Case update

Germany's national disease control center says almost 200 new cases
of _E. coli_ [O104:H4] infection were reported in the 1st 2 days of
June 2011, bringing the number of cases in the country to 1733. 18
people have died, all but 1 in Germany [the single one was in
Sweden].

The Robert Koch Institute said that 520 of those sickened are
suffering from a life-threatening complication that can cause kidney
failure.

The World Health Organization says 9 other European nations have
reported a total of 80 people sick from the bacterium, most of whom
had recently visited northern Germany.

[2] WHO statement

http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/emergencies/international-health-regulations/news2/news/2011/06/ehec-outbreak-rare-strain-of-e.-coli-unknown-in-previous-outbreaks


The strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) O104:H4 isolated
from cases in the EHEC infection outbreak in Germany is a rare one,
seen in humans before but never in an EHEC outbreak. This has been
confirmed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research
on _Escherichia_ and _Klebsiella_, the Statens Serum Institut in
Denmark.

The molecular/genetic features of this pathogen are important in
helping authorities to identify cases in other countries that could be
associated with the outbreak in Germany and to identify the source of
the outbreak. While epidemiological and laboratory investigations
continue, the source of the outbreak still remains unknown.

WHO is not making any new recommendations for treatment. Normal
hygiene measures should be observed: hand washing after toilet use and
before touching food. Anyone who develops bloody diarrhoea and
abdominal pain, and who has had contact recently with northern
Germany, should seek medical advice urgently.

[3] USA Servicemen in Germany

http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/06/03/2-us-military-members-sickened-as-e-coli-outbreak-stabilizes-in-europe/?test=latestnews

So far, 2 USA service members based in Germany are suspected of being
victims of Europe's [EHEC] _E. coli_ outbreak Fri 3 Jun 2011, as
European authorities said the outbreak was "stabilizing."

USA military medical officers were awaiting test results from samples
taken from the ill service members, and they could be confirmed within
several days, according to Phillip Tegtmeier, a spokesman for the USA
military's Europe Regional Medical Command. "We're testing [for _E.
coli_] as a precaution," he told military newspaper Stars and Stripes
on Fri 3 Jun 2011.

One of the service members, an airman, remains in the hospital at the
Spangahlem Air Base, in western Germany. The other American reportedly
affected was treated and released while based in Heidelberg, 48 miles
south of Frankfurt.

The 2 suspected cases in US military were among some 2000 people hit
by the [EHEC] _E. coli_ outbreak across Europe, which so far claimed
18 lives, AFP reported.

Authorities said they were no closer to identifying the origin of the
outbreak Fri 3 Jun 2011, but there were signs the number of infections
was leveling out.

"The situation is that the number of new infections appears to be
stabilizing somewhat," Reinhard Brunkhorst, president of the German
Nephrology Society, told reporters in Hamburg, the epicenter of the
scare. But he added, "We are dealing here, in fact, with the biggest
epidemic caused by bacteria in recent decades." [Obviously excepting
tuberculosis & leprosy. In 2009, 2700 new cases of leprosy were
registered in one state alone -- Mato Grosso. - Mod.JW].

The Health Protection Agency has announced 4 more cases of _E. coli_
infection in the UK linked to the outbreak in Germany. It brings the

recently traveled to Germany. The HPA said there was no evidence of it
being passed from person to person in the UK.

A 2nd person in Switzerland is ill from _E. coli_ after a trip to
Germany, following a deadly outbreak [caused by] bacteria-infected
produce across Europe.

The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health says the most recent case
comes after another person was infected after a trip to northern
Germany. Both individuals are in stable condition and the illness is
running its course in each case. So far, no contaminated produce has
been identified in Switzerland.

Swiss health officials say Switzerland sees about 60 cases of illness
annually from [EHEC] _E. coli_. So far this year far there have been
23 cases, a normal amount.
