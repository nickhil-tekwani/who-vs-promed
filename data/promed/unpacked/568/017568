Well, I'm not European, but I have in the past (in simpler, less informed
times)
eaten horse tartare here in Quebec; so presumably the Europeans do it as well.

Further to Ross Tancreds comment, while trichinella may not have been
detected on the Australian mainland the parasite, as _Trichinella
pseudospiralis_, occurs in the Australian island state of Tasmania. In
Tasmania the infection occurs in native marsupial carnivores (e.g. the
Tasmania Devil). The parasite has been demonstrated to infect laboratory
rats and mice and also the native marsupial brush tailed possum.

I recall hearing about Arctic explorers getting ill from toxic doses of
vitamin A both from polar bear liver and from sledge-dog liver (Vit-A
concentrated from the fish they were fed on). Is it OK to eat the rest of the
dog or bear, but for risk of Trichinella (which cooking would kill if fuel
available)?
Only horse-derived cases of trichinosis which I have heard of were in
France! The Australian complaint seems well grounded.

I thought that the arctic explorers apparently referred to here actually
died from acute hypervitaminosis A-induced hepatic necrosis as a result of
eating polar bear liver.

[Both are correct about hypervitaminosis A resulting from polar bear liver,
but I wouldn't expect an acute presentation. In the instance mentioned, the
autopsies did find evidence of trichinosis. But either way, one should be
cautious when consuming polar bears. And to misquote Mrs. Beeton, "First
catch your bear". - Mod.MHJ

It should be noted that Trichina can be killed either by heating at 144 F
(62 C) instant, or by holding meat frozen for a period of time. For example,
the USDA regulations (9 CFR 318.10) state:
(2) Refrigerating. At any stage of preparation and after preparatory
chilling to a temperature of not above 40 F. or preparatory freezing, all
parts of the muscle tissue of pork or product containing such tissue shall
be subjected continuously to a temperature not higher than one of those
specified in table 1, the duration of such refrigeration at the specified
temperature being dependent on the thickness of the meat or inside
dimensions of the container.
TABLE 1: REQUIRED PERIOD OF FREEZING AT TEMPERATURE INDICATED
Temperature F. Group 1 (Days) Group 2 (Days)
5 20 30
-10 10 20
-20 6 12

Notes: Group 1 = pieces < 6" in size, Group 2 = pieces > 6" in size
It may be that northern peoples, such as Eskimos (Inuit), may solve their
winter cooking problems with Trichina by leaving the meat to remain frozen
for a week or two at artic temperatures before consumption.

The following notes from GIDEON software illustrate the varied epidemiology
(and
epizoology) of trichinosis.
1. Global overview
It is estimated that 11 million are infested worldwide. Most infections
are due to _Trichinella spiralis_ (T1). Trichinosis accounted for 1.5% of
all food-related outbreaks in Europe during 1991 to 1992. In most parts of
Europe, the specific reservoir is the red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) living at
elevations above 400 to 500 meters; however, the raccoon dog (_Nyctereutes
procyonoides_) serves as an additional reservoir in Finland. Over 2,600
cases of human trichinosis were acquired from horse meat in Italy and France
during 1975 to 1996.
- _T. nativa_ (T2) is found in arctic regions (including Finland and central
to northern Sweden), and transmitted by horse and bear.

- _T. britovi_ (T3) occurs in temperate zones, and is acquired from horses and
boar.
- _T. pseudospiralis_ occurs in the Nearctic and Oceania, and is found in
birds and omnivores.
- _T. nelsoni_ (T7) is found in the tropics, and is acquired from wart hogs.
2. Canada
The incidence in Northwest and Yukon territories (11/100,000) is 100-fold
that of other regions. Walrus meat is implicated among the Inuit. 116 cases
were reported during 1981 to 1990; 39 in 1991 (28 of these from the
Northwest Territories). Although nine cases were officially reported in
1993, an outbreak of 24 cases in Ontario (from wild boar meat) has been
published. Two cases were reported in 1994 (both Ontario); 9 in 1995; 4 in
1996. No infested swine were identified through national surveillance during
1985 to 1990 (with the exception of an isolated outbreak in Nova Scotia); no
infested wild boar were identified in 1994.
3. China
5,558 cases were reported in 1983. 3.1% of pigs in Henan Province were found
to be infested in 1991. An outbreak in Harbin during 1979 to 1980 was
ascribed to scalded mutton. Seven outbreaks (250 cases) were reported in
Zhengzhou (Henan) during 1992 to 1996. Over 600 infections and 300 clinical
cases were estimated for a single outbreak during 1995 to 1996, traced to
pork dumplings from a restaurant in Zengzhou. Raw pork (oru and shengpi) are
commonly implicated in Yunnan - the seroprevalence in this Province was
13.5% during the 1990's.
4. France
The first outbreak of trichinosis in France occurred in 1881, and was
ascribed to pork. An outbreak near Paris in 1976 involved 125 cases and was
traced to horse meat imported from Poland. Six outbreaks (total cases over
1,700) were registered during 1975 to 1995. Two outbreaks in 1985 involved
1,073 cases and were caused by horse meat. An outbreak in 1991 (23 cases) was
ascribed to horse meat. An outbreak in 1993 involved 538 cases and was
traced to the meat of a single imported horse; 7 cases in 1994 were acquired
from horse meat imported from Mexico. Only 0.0002% to 0.003% of wild boar are
infested.
5. Israel
Rare autochthonous infections are acquired from wild boar from the upper and
western Galilee and the Carmel Hills. No infections have been found in
domestic pigs since 1948.
6. Italy
Human infection is acquired from boar and horse meat; but not pigs. The
largest recorded outbreak occurred in the North during 1986 (100 cases, none
fatal) and was ascribed to raw horse meat. Approximately 100 cases were
reported during 1985 to 1986. 32% of North Italian foxes were infested in
1960, and 4% in 1988.
7. Lebanon
In 1982, over 1,000 cases were identified in an outbreak in the southern
region.
8. Poland
11,643 cases were reported during 1946 to 1965. The disease rate was
0.9/100,000 in 1985 (18 fatal cases), and 0.5/100,000 in 1990 (6 fatal
cases).
9. Romania
273 cases were reported in 1980; 142 in 1981; 6 in 1988; 23 in 1992. In
1997, over 100 cases were associated with an outbreak traced to pork in Baia
Mare.
10. CIS (Former USSR)
- 90% of the country's cases are reported from Belarus.
- Approximately 50 cases are reported in Latvia each year.
- 86 to 616 cases were reported annually in Lithuania during 1984 to 1992.
An outbreak of 121 cases in Kaunas, during 1992 was traced to pork. 719
cases were registered in 1994.
- As many as 61 persons may have been infected by bear meat in Zima
(Siberia) during an outbreak in 1997 - with additional cases in Sayansk,
Angarsk and Irkutsk.
- 33% of cases in the Ukraine are associated with lard.
11. Spain
987 cases were reported during 1980 to 1989 (51% of these from Andalusia).
27 outbreaks were reported during 1988 to 1994; 325 cases during one
outbreak in 1982; 26 in 1992; 39 in 1993 - with ingestion of wild boar and
pork implicated in several cases; 8 in 1994; 39 in 1995; 16 in 1996
(including 7 from Andalucia and 4 from Extremadura); 10 during the first
half of 1997. As many as 0.48% of wild boars are infested (Extremadura).
12. Switzerland
_Trichinella britovi_ is found in 0.9% to 1.3% of wild foxes. Trichinellae
are not found in pigs, horses and wild boar.
13. Thailand
The disease was first reported in 1962. Highest rates occur in the northern
region. Annual rates of approximately 0.5/100,000 are reported. 118
outbreaks, involving 5,400 cases (95 fatal) were reported during 1962 to
1991. An outbreak of 59 cases of _Trichinella pseudospiralis_ infection in
Ta Sae district (Chumporn Privince) during 1994 to 1995 was traced to a wild
pig.
14. United States
- 2,773 cases were reported during 1944 to 1953; 2,252 during 1954 to 1963;
1,273 during 1964 to 1973; 1,351 during 1974 to 1983. An average of 57 cases
were reported annually during 1982 to 1986 (5 fatal cases during this
period).
- In 1990, Iowa accounted for over 60% of reported cases; 38 of 62 cases
reported in 1991 were reported from Wisconsin; 41 cases were reported in
1992 (28 of these from Alaska); 16 in 1993; 32 in 1994; 29 in 1995 (59% from
Idaho and Iowa); 11 in 1996; 9 in 1997.
- 128 food-related outbreaks were registered during 1973 to 1987.
- 23 fatal cases were reported during 1961 to 1970; 1 (in 1989) during 1986
to 1995.
- Pork accounts for 61% of cases and bear meat 33%. Cougar jerky was
implicated in 10 cases in Idaho in 1995.
- 21% of Alaskan lynx (_Felis lynx_) are infested with Trichinella nativa.
Seroprevalence among Alaskan grizzly bears (_Ursus arctos_) varies from 5%
in the south, to 83% in the north (1973 to 1987).

[The original question was whether other cases of human trichinosis have
been traced to the consumption of dogs, with special reference to Asia. The
absence of any replies in relation to the latter would suggest that it is
rare or infrequent. The thread is therefore cut with the comment that if
epidemiologists sing songs one would expect "If you knew sushi, like I know
sushi ....". - Mod.MHJ
