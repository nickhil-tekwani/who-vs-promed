India (Uttar Pradesh): virus scare grips Saharanpur
---------------------------------------------------
Even as government officials claimed normalcy in Saharanpur [Uttar
Pradesh], the situation there still remains grim as panic-stricken parents
insisted on keeping their children from going to school. According to
reports reaching here, attendance in the primary schools has dropped
drastically as the toll of children dying of the mysterious [illness]
continued to rise.
The death toll so far, according to Dr JK Manchanda, MO [medical officer? -
Mod.SH], Saharanpur was 40, while Dr GC Shrivastava, joint director
communicable diseases, put the figure at 44. "22 fresh cases have been
reported over the last 2 days but no deaths so far," said Shrivastava,
adding that "according to tests on mosquitoes from the area, dengue,
malaria, [and] Japanese encephalitis have been ruled out."

[It must be presumed at this stage that the illness may be transmitted
directly from person to person, since the most likely mosquito-transmitted
viruses and malaria have been excluded by initial tests. Information on any
additional laboratory investigation in progress and a more precise
description of the illness from the relevant local authorities would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]
