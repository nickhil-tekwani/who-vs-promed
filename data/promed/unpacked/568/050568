Mystery epidemic puts gharial on the brink
------------------------------------------
The banks of the river Chambal resemble a mortuary. Already on the
critically endangered list, the Indian gharial is fighting a mystery
disease. Over 100 gharials have died in the last 6 weeks.
Well-known wildlife film-maker Naresh Bedi, among the first to reach
the spot, was shocked at what he saw.
"Their reflexes were not working. They were trying to keep their head
up above the water. Their eyes were closed. So, I don't know what
they were suffering from," he said.
Post-mortem results show presence of lead in the dead bodies. But if
the gharials died from lead poisoning why did it not affect other
wildlife in the Chambal like the crocodile or migratory birds?
The Chambal, in fact, has the largest breeding population of the gharials.
"Anything that affects the gharial even in a small way, in this case,
it's not small because over 50 animals have died and they are all
either sub-adults or adults. It is very serious," says reptile expert
Romulus Whitaker.
A CNN-IBN Investigation a year ago showed how the Chambal habitat was
being destroyed by sand-mining.
Fishermen too, often chop the head and tail of gharials that get
entangled in their nets. With this latest epidemic, gharials are in
danger of being wiped out completely.
"We have created a CMG, so to say crisis management group and our
team have been identified in that," says Chief Wildlife Warden, P B
Gangopadhyay.
The Environment Ministry has called in experts but with no one being
able to name the killer disease, the future remains grim for the
surviving gharials.

[It would be nice to know what toxicological test have been done on
the animal tissues but also on the water. I am concerned that from
the film makers description that we may have neurological paralyzing
agent in the water -- even at low levels these animals are apparently
quite sensitive.
Can someone tell us what diseases have been looked for as well as
what toxicological tests have been conducted? - Mod.TG]

The Chambal River is a tributary of the Yamuna River in central
India. The river flows north-northeast through Madhya Pradesh,
running for a time through Rajasthan, then forming the boundary
between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh before turning southeast to join
the Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh state.
The Gharial lives in the Chambal Sanctuary and is considered a rare
and endangered animal
