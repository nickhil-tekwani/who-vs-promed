Rains Are a Boost for West Nile Virus: Here Earlier, Poses Greater Risk
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This winter's record rains have created prime breeding conditions for
mosquitoes, prompting health officials to warn of a potentially serious
outbreak this year [2005] of the deadly West Nile virus that killed 27 people
in the state last year [2004]. One human case of the disease was confirmed in
Los Angeles County this year [2005], though just when the virus was
contracted was unclear, health officials said. That victim is recovering.
In the past week, the virus has been found in 2 dead birds in Los Angeles
County, a chicken in San Bernardino County and mosquito larvae from a pool of
stagnant water in Orange County. Those findings indicate that the heavy rains
have started the spread of the virus earlier than last year, health officials
said. "We now know it's in the mosquitoes and that's the closest thing to
getting it into the humans," said Mike Hearst, an Orange County Vector
Control District spokesman.
Health officials won't speculate on the potential human toll this year, but
they said the risk of infection increases with higher rainfall levels,
because pools of standing water are mosquito breeding grounds. "You have a
better chance of being bitten this year because of the increased breeding
conditions," said Rosanna Westmoreland, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Health Services.
In 2004, the virus infected 829 people in California, killing 27, most of
whom lived in Southern California. Most people who are infected do not
develop symptoms, but a small percentage, particularly the elderly, can
become severely ill. Westmoreland said a small percentage of the population
developed an immunity to the virus after being infected last year, but it was
unclear whether that would lessen an outbreak this year. In fact, the state
could face a more severe virus season this year because a series of winter
storms broke all-time rainfall records, dumping 39 inches in downtown Los
Angeles and 29 inches in San Bernardino since 1 July 2004, state and local
health officials said.
Mosquitoes contract the virus by feeding on infected birds and spread the
disease to humans through bites. This winter's heavy rainfall and melting
snow are expected to create hundreds of mosquito breeding pools in buckets,
old tires, flower pots and clogged rain gutters throughout Southern
California. Unattended swimming pools also act as prime mosquito breeding
grounds. In San Bernardino County, news of an infected chicken in Ontario --
the first sign of the disease's return to the county this year ï¿½-- prompted
the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to call for the creation of a task force
to drain or spray stagnant pools and educate the public on ways to combat the
spread of the virus. The rains have "set the stage for a particularly bad
season," said County Supervisor Gary Ovitt, whose district includes Ontario.
James Felten, San Bernardino County's Public Health Director, said the report
of the infected chicken in Ontario last week "indicates that mosquitoes are
active again and the cycle has begun." The infected chicken was one of dozens
kept by a local vector control district to gauge the spread of West Nile and
other diseases. The chickens usually survive the infections.
In 2004, the virus began to kill birds and infect chickens in early April.
This year [2005], the virus began to surface in February, signaling a longer
and more dangerous virus season, said Robert Real, field director for the
West Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District in San Bernardino County.
Last month in Orange County, officials reported 2 dead birds infected with
the virus: a snowy egret and an American crow. Last year, the West Nile virus
was not found in birds in Orange County until 31 Mar 2004. Health officials
also trapped a group of infected mosquitoes in January [2005?] at the
Riverview Golf Course on the Santa Ana River.
Hearst, the Orange County vector control spokesman, said the worst was still
to come. "The rains haven't yet had their effect," Hearst said. "The [variety
of] mosquitoes most dependent on large sources of water are just now becoming
active." Vector control officials said the heavy winter rains would cause the
wetlands and marsh areas to be fuller than usual this year.
But they said their biggest concerns were backyard pools of water and windows
without screens to keep out the mosquitoes. Public health officials say
people can reduce the chances of being bitten by a mosquito and contracting
West Nile virus by staying indoors, using insect repellent, wearing pants and
long-sleeved shirts, installing screen doors and emptying pools of standing
water.

USA: Oregon Faces Tougher Year of West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------
Oregon's brush with West Nile virus last summer [2004] might have been merely
a primer for what the state will face this year [2005], a health official
said. The mosquito-borne virus, which has been detected in 8 counties,
sickened birds, horses and 5 people last year [2004]. This year, hundreds of
human cases could be diagnosed if the virus follows the pattern seen in other
states, said Emilio DeBess, a public health veterinarian and epidemiologist
with the Oregon Department of Human Services.
DeBess will convene a summit Tuesday in Portland for public health and
hospital officials from across the state to plan how to deal with a major
outbreak. The virus, which peaks during the summer when mosquitoes are most
active, entered the United States in New York in 1999 and has moved across
the country. It killed 88 people in 2004, according to the national Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. DeBess and other epidemiologists theorize
that the disease can enter an area in 3 stages. In the beginning stage,
infected birds fly into a state and are bitten by mosquitoes, which in turn
become infected with the virus. During the 2nd stage, the virus spreads
widely among mosquitoes [not, of course, from mosquito to mosquito but
because more of the birds they feed on are infected. - Mod.JW]
The mosquitoes bite a large number of people who become infected. DeBess said
it is likely that Oregon is entering the 2nd stage and will see substantial
numbers of human infections this year. In the 3rd year and beyond, the number
of human cases typically declines rapidly because those who were previously
exposed to the virus acquire an immunity to it. Colorado, for example,
reported 14 human cases in 2002. That ballooned to 2947 in 2003 and then
dwindled to 276 in 2004.
It is impossible for the disease to transfer from an animal to a human or a
human to a human, state health officials said. Cattle, sheep, swine, cats and
dogs appear to be immune [the journalist means resistant to infection; an
animal only becomes immune if it survives infection. One dog in Nevada & one
in New Mexico tested WNV positive in 2004, one cat & 5 dogs in 2003 -- see
ref. 2004 (12) & 2003 (33) below. - Mod.JW]. In humans, most people infected
with the virus exhibit no illness or only mild symptoms such as fever,
headache and body aches. DeBess said that although the number of human cases
declines in subsequent years, the amount of virus circulating among
mosquitoes still is high. "The thing to remember is that the virus circulates
between birds and mosquitoes," DeBess said. "Human beings are dead-end hosts.
They're just innocent bystanders in this."
