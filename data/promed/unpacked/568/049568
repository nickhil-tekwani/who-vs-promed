Further laboratory tests have now confirmed that the H6N1 avian
influenza virus present at 2 poultry premises in East Anglia is of
low pathogenicity.

This means that the routine restrictions put in place while the
investigations were ongoing are no longer required and have now been
lifted, as the presence of a statutory notifiable disease has been
ruled out.

The H6 serotype of avian influenza virus has been found in wild birds
in Europe as well as in poultry in previous years. However, to date,
H6 has not been found to be highly pathogenic.

It is important that poultry keepers remain vigilant by looking for
any signs of disease in their birds. Any concerns should be reported
immediately to their local vet or reported to the Animal Health
Agency so that statutory notifiable disease can be ruled out promptly.
