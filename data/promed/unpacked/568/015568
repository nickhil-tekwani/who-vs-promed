Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep and goats / 515 / 179 / 100 / 0 / 0
Affected population: On [17 Mar 2019], a report was received from an owner about the deaths in a herd of 515 sheep and goats (from which around 100 are lambs). From the investigation, it became clear that the beginning of the event was on [27 Jan 2019]. Mortality and the symptoms of the disease were observed mostly in lambs.

["Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is currently present in some countries in the North Africa region, where the situation has evolved in recent years. The disease occurred for the 1st time in Morocco in 2008, with a virus belonging to lineage IV (a virus presents notably in South Asia and the Middle East) and the same lineage IV is also present in Tunisia and Algeria and is widespread in Egypt. According to serological surveys it is suspected but not officially reported in Libya. In Mauritania, PPR is due to virus lineage II.

"Morocco started implementing a mass vaccination campaign in 2008 and this continued in 2010-2011. The results demonstrated that PPR can be controlled through mass vaccination campaigns. Designing and implementing a regional PPR control strategy in North Africa is of crucial importance and regional policies and activities in the field of animal health are coordinated by the Mediterranean Animal Health Network (REMESA: Reseau Mediterraneen de Sante Animale) platform."

Abstract
We conducted a cross‐sectional study during 2013 to quantify the serological prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection and to investigate host factors associated with PPR infection in small ruminants in Libya. A 2‐stage sampling design was carried out. A total number of 148 flocks owning at least 100 heads each were randomly selected. Sixteen to 48 samples were collected from each selected flock. A total number of 3508 serum samples from unvaccinated animals were collected and analysed at IZSLER Brescia, Italy, by using competitive ELISA, IDvet innovative diagnostics (IDvet 310, France). The overall serological prevalence among SR was 33% (95% CI: 31.4-34.5). Significant differences between the prevalence in the geographical branches were observed. The lowest prevalence level was observed in Zawiyah branch (16.1%), whereas the highest value was obtained for the Sabha branch (56.8%). Considering the age, a serological prevalence of 24.7%, 31.5% and 42.1% was observed in SR less than 1 year, between 1 and 2 years, and more than 2 years, respectively. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.001) in the seroprevalence levels were also observed between the age-groups. Our findings suggest that the southern part of Libya could be more exposed to the infections coming from the neighboring countries, and this should be better investigated to correctly identify wherever specific entry points can be considered at higher risk than others. The results also confirmed the endemic status of PPR in Libya, with a constant exposure to the infection of the animals during their life. In the framework of the global strategy for control and eradication of PPR, our results, even if obtained by a preliminary study, can contribute to the assessment of the epidemiological situation of PPR in Libya as required by the Stage 1 of the plan.
