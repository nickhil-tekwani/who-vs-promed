A new outbreak of suspected bubonic plague was reported on 29 Oct 2020 from the Aungba health zone located in the Mahagi territory, Ituri province, in northeastern DR Congo. The area is located in the most active endemic plague focus in continental Africa and borders the West Nile plague endemic focus in Uganda.

On 29 Oct 2020, the head nurse of the health area of Avari alerted the central office of the chief medical doctor of Aungba about 4 community deaths in the village Amoli, close to the Ugandan border. On 30 Oct 2020, the supervision team of the Aungba health zone carried out an outbreak investigation and recorded 7 cases of bubonic plague including 4 deaths.

The index cases appear to be 2 boys aged 13 and 10 years old from the same family residing in Amoli, who died between 26 and 27 Oct 2020; both presented a clinical prognosis consistent with the definition of bubonic plague, i.e. high fever with sudden onset, headache and painful swelling in the armpits. The other 2 deceased persons are 2 girls, aged 14 and 13 years belonging to another family from a household located close to the presumed index cases.

The inhabitants of Amoli have reported domestic and peri-domestic murine epizootics (rat falls) in the week preceding the appearance of the 1st human cases.

The investigation team searched for other cases in the area, which led to the discovery of 3 other active suspected bubonic plague cases, which were treated at the nearest health center. In addition, 26 contacts were treated preventively with doxycycline (100 mg), and the 2 houses where the deaths occurred were dusted with deltamethrin to control potentially infected fleas.

This is the 8th plague outbreak reported in less than a year from the plague endemic focus in the DR Congo.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. - Mod.LL]
