TILLETIA INDICA - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
==========================================

We publish here the NAPPO
[North American Plant Protection Organization]
report concerning the first record of
_Tilletia indica_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) in the United States.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the
Arizona Department of Agriculture, announced on March 8, 1996,
that Karnal bunt, a fungal disease of grain, was detected in
durum wheat seed in the State of Arizona. Suspect seed samples
were detected at a seed dealership during routine testing by the
Arizona Department of Agriculture. After forwarding samples to
the State's agricultural lab, USDA's Agricultural Research
Service was given samples for final confirmation. The disease
was confirmed as Karnal bunt on March 8, 1996.
Karnal bunt, or partial bunt, is a fungal disease of wheat, durum
wheat, and triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye. Infected plants
produce less grain, and the quality of the grain itself is
lessened. Typically, only a portion of the kernel is affected,
which is why the disease is sometimes called partial bunt. The
disease is caused by the smut fungus _Tilletia indica_ Mitra
(also known as _Neovossia indica_) and is spread by spores. It
has been reported in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Brazil
and Mexico. This is the first report from the United States.
Following the detection of Karnal bunt in Arizona, a scientific
panel comprised of State, Federal and industry technical experts
was convened to determine further actions. Investigators are
tracing the source and distribution of all confirmed Karnal bunt
positive seed while officers of USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service and State regulators impose the appropriate
regulatory actions to prevent the further spread of the disease.
A statewide survey of all Arizona wheat varieties continues.
As of March 20, 1996, Karnal bunt has been confirmed in four
varieties of durum wheat: Reva, Durex, Ocotillo and Kronos, in
Arizona. Two samples of wheat which originated in Arizona and
were submitted to New Mexico's State Agriculture laboratory were
also confirmed positive for Karnal bunt. One sample is from
Durex variety seed that originated in Arizona and has been
planted near Fabens, Texas. The second sample is from Durex
variety seed that originated in Arizona and has been planted near
Demming, New Mexico.
According to UDSA's Economic Research Service's Wheat Yearbook,
durum wheat is expected to account for 4.7 percent of the total
wheat produced in the United States in fiscal year 1995-96.
Emergency quarantines have been issued to restrict the movement
of seed, machinery, and soil from farms where the infected seed
has been planted. State and Federal quarantines will be placed
to augment this emergency action. In accordance with the
International Plant Protection Convention, trading partners are
being informed of the detection through the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and NAPPO. A wheat
export certification team has been established by APHIS/PPQ to
develop options for dealing with potential trade issues. For
further information contact the Phytosanitary Issue Management
Team, PPQ/APHIS, Riverdale, Maryland, telephone (301) 734-5261,
