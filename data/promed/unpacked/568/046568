A food-borne illness is suspected in an outbreak that has left about
75 Monterey County Jail inmates sick with diarrhea and stomach
cramping. Sick inmates began reporting to the jailhouse infirmary on
Sun 8 Jan 2006, and by Mon 9 Jan 2006 morning, there were 20
prisoners complaining of diarrhea and bloody stool, authorities said.
By that night, 75 cases were reported.
"We're waiting to see what the cause is," said sheriff's Chief Deputy
Bert Liebersbach of the custody operations bureau. The cases came
from 8 to 10 units in the main jail, with a few cases in the women's
section, he said.
"We can be pretty confident that it's a food-borne illness," said
John Ramirez, assistant director of environmental health at the
Monterey County Health Department.
The jail had another outbreak last June 2005, when at least 112
inmates complained of flu-like symptoms including nausea, diarrhea
and high fever. Investigators determined that infection began after
some inmates hoarded food to make tamales that later became spoiled,
Liebersbach said.
"We're trying to find out if it was that same scene or if it had to
do with the kitchen foods," Ramirez said.

[ProMED would appreciate more information about this cluster of
gastrointestinal illnesses. The etiology of this outbreak is presumed
to be food borne. An epidemiologic investigation is needed to assess
which food(s) may be implicated, and bacteriologic, serologic and
perhaps even toxologic data may be needed to identify the organism or
toxin involved. If a particular food can be linked to this illness,
an incubation period may be helpful in suggesting a cause.
Bacterial enteritides, such as those caused by _Shigella_,
_Campylobacter_ and _E. coli_ (especially O157:H7), can cause bloody
diarrhea. The former 2 are associated with a febrile illness, the
latter one is usually afebrile. Ingested toxic substances can also
cause similar symptoms, such as, for instance, what occurs with the
potential bioterrorism toxin, ricin. - Mod.LL]
