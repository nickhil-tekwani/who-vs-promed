West Nile virus infected birds now total 46
------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: The District of Columbia is reporting a sharp increase in birds
testing positive for West Nile virus. So far this year, 46 dead crows have
been identified with the disease, compared with just 5 throughout 2000.
Dr Ivan Walks, director of the District's Health Department, said no humans
have been infected in the Washington DC area, and no mosquitoes have tested
positive for the virus. But the health department is concerned because of
the large number of birds found to be carrying the virus. Health officials
are not sure why the figure is up.
Dr Walks said 40 of the birds found were in the northeast quadrant of the
city, an area that may be part of a migratory path. The other 6 were
scattered throughout the city. The birds themselves are not a danger to
people, but mosquitoes can pass the virus from birds to humans. Infected
birds have also been found in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs.
Health workers are going door-to-door warning residents to take precautions
and not to pick up dead birds. City workers are helping to eliminate
standing water, something Dr Walks said residents need to watch for as they
clean up after the flood [? - Mod.SH.
So far, there are no plans to spray pesticide in the district for
mosquitoes. The district, like neighboring counties, is using pellets to
kill mosquito eggs in sewers and other standing water.
