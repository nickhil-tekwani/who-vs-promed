This Saturday [26 Feb 2011], [health] authorities in the Los Rios
Region confirmed the death of a 2nd person caused by [a] hantavirus
[infection]. The victim was a 73-year-old man, an accomplished
sportsman and Corral community municipal official who since a week ago
was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Clinico Regional
Hospital for a serious pulmonary condition, reported Radio Bio Bio.
The death of the 2nd affected individual was confirmed by the Director
of Health Services of Valdivia, Marienela Caro, based on the samples
sent to the Public Health Services and to the Hospital of the
Universidad Catolica.

Thus, there are now a total of 2 fatal victims due to [a] hantavirus
[infection], while another 2 people remain in stable condition with
their serious situation, but progressing favorably despite their
[hantavirus infection] diagnosis.

[With the above report, the numbers of fatal cases of hantavirus
infections in this area are confusing. Yesterday [25 Mar 2011], there
was a report of 2 women who died on 24 Mar 2011 of an apparently
confirmed hantavirus infection, with a 3rd woman's death suspected.
Perhaps the 2 women cited above as progressing favorably were, in
fact, those who died. This would bring the total number of deaths from
a hantavirus infection in the region to 3 or 4 confirmed and one
suspected so far in March 2011. ProMED would appreciate receiving
information about the total number of cases in the Valdivia/Corral
area.

As is usual for these types of reports from Chile, the specific
hantavirus involved with these cases of hantavirus infection is not
indicated. The virus most likely to be responsible for this case is
Andes virus, with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
