Thousands of fish suspected to have been poisoned by industrial waste
have been dying in a lake in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, posing a health
risk to slum dwellers who have been collecting the dead fish for food.
One resident said, "Thousands of dead fish started surfacing in the lake
3 or 4 days ago, attracting poor people to collect them." Some of the
fish have been collected and destroyed by city authorities.

[Since poisoning is suspected in this die-off, and there is no mention of
ulcerative disease, this event is presumed to be unrelated to the fish
die-off reported earlier this year (see ProMED-mail reference cited above).
