Rinderpest in Mauritania: Confirmation of serological findings in warthogs
[date of report: 22 Aug 2003]
See also: 25 Jul 2003, 18 Jul 2003
Translation of information received 21 Aug 2003 from Dr Mokhtar Fall,
Deputy Director, Department of Animal Production and Agriculture, Ministry
of Rural Development and Environment, Nouakchott:
End of previous report period: 22 Jul 2003 (see Disease Information, 16
[30], 181, dated 25 Jul 2003).
End of this report period: 21 Aug 2003.
According to the latest results, received on 7 Aug 2003 from the OIE
Reference Laboratory for rinderpest (Pirbright, United Kingdom), the
presence of rinderpest antibodies was confirmed in 2 of the 32 serum
samples collected in warthogs (_Phacochoerus aethiopicus_) within the
framework of epidemiological surveillance for rinderpest in wildlife.
The Reference Laboratory results confirm the results received from
Nouakchott (National Animal Production and Veterinary Research Centre
(CNERV(1)), Dakar and Bingerville laboratories (see Disease Information, 16
[29], 171, dated 18 Jul 2003).
Date of sampling: 6 and 10 Jan 2003.
Location of sampling: Guere and N'Khaila.
Measures during reporting period:
Following confirmation of the results, clinical investigations and sampling
were carried out in the bovine population.
Planned measures:
- clinical and serological surveillance of bovines and wildlife;
- PACE(2) will be requested to assist in carrying out more detailed
investigations and implementing the appropriate surveillance methodology in
wildlife.

[Note that the warthog serum samples were collected in January 2003; that
laboratories in 3 different African countries tested the sera, & found 2
rinderpest positives which Mauritania reported to OIE on 17 Jul 2003; that
the UK reference laboratory reported the samples negative for rinderpest but
positive for peste des petits ruminants (PPR) antibodies on 22 Jul 2003 (see
refs. below), but the same laboratory confirmed rinderpest positivity after
all on 7 Aug 2003; and that this report was received by OIE on 21 Aug 2003. -

[This is obviously not good news for the eradication program (see moderator
comments on the OIE report 20030720.1775 referenced below). It is important
to remember that good surveillance will usually identify pockets of positive
individuals as any disease eradication campaign progresses. Of course, the
identification of positive wild animals in an area presumed to be free of
disease presents a challenge to eradication efforts. In accordance with OIE
standards, many countries self-declared provisional freedom from the disease
in the late 1990s. Ongoing surveillance in both domestic and wild
populations is critical. For a map and additional information on the
rinderpest status of surrounding countries, see:
