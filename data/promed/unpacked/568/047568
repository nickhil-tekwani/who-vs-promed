The mystery illness that is affecting children in Fiji has now been
confirmed to be hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The Ministry of
Health received laboratory confirmation from Australia saying hand,
foot and mouth were suspected after children presented to clinics in
the Suva area with symptoms early this month [December 2010].

Symptoms include a slight fever, tiredness, loss of appetite,
blisters in the mouth and on the hands and feet and a sore mouth for
a few days before the ulcers or blisters appear. Affected young
children may refuse to eat or drink.

The Health Ministry says there is no specific treatment for HFMD;
however, the risk of getting the disease can be reduced by frequently
washing hands, especially after diaper changes, thoroughly cleaning
objects and surfaces (toys, doorknobs, etc.) that may be
contaminated, avoiding close contact (like kissing and hugging) with
people who [may be] infected, and keeping the affected child away
from other children until the sores are completely healed.

Outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease are common in Asian
countries such as China, Taiwan, and Korea and sometimes are reported
in Australia [and elsewhere].

[As predicted in the 2 previous ProMED-mail posts, this previously
undiagnosed illness of children has been confirmed as HFMD. HFMD can
be caused by a variety of enteroviruses, but the occurrence of
seizures (fits) in a minority of affected children in Fiji suggests
that the agent responsible for this outbreak may be enterovirus 71.
This virus has been prevalent in Southeast Asia in recent years (and
infrequent in North America) and responsible for meningitis and
encephalitis in a few children. It would be useful to have
confirmation of the identity of the enterovirus responsible for this outbreak.
