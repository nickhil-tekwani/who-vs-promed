From: "Dr. Richard H. Evans" <snaver@home.com>

When outbreaks of distemper occur in unvaccinated, urban dog populations,
spillover into urban wildlife (such as red and gray foxes, skunks, raccoons
and coyotes) regularly occurs. In this particular case I was contacted to
consult on the situation by the California Department of Fish and Game. I
received tissue samples from several dozen raccoons and foxes and found
typical canine strains and histopathological lesions present.
In Orange County (southern California), we have noted that canine distemper
and canine and feline parvovirus are endemic, with cyclic outbreaks
occurring every 5-6 years. Three months ago we noted an increase in these
diseases at the County Animal Shelter, the index cases being within a month
of the last outbreak 5 years ago. These outbreaks are VERY well correlated
to socioeconomic areas with low vaccination rates, as has been reported by
Dr. Glickman in the midwest.
At the risk of sounding like a mynah bird, I too must reiterate the need for
all public health officials, animal control agencies, private veterinarians,
vaccine manufacturers, etc. to stress to pet owners the need for timely
vaccination of their pets. Let's follow the good work we have done for
Rabies prevention!

[One can only second Richard's informed plea loudly. The only place I ever
came across that was officially silent on distemper vaccination was Manaus,
Brazil in 1977 because the city authorities held that distemper was the only
thing that kept the dog population in check and thereby limited canine
rabies. A moment's thought would demonstrate the weakness of that logic.
While on the subject of domestic pets may I make a strong seasonal plea to
NOT give puppies, kittens and young rabbits as presents. Do it only if a
responsible request has been made. Unfortunately, come March & April the
animal shelters fill up with no longer wanted animals, or they are abandoned
on highways, farmland, or suburbia. Domestic rabbits are not bred to
survive in the wild, and I suspect most are frightened dog, fox, coyote or
owl feed within hours. And all three species need their appropriate shots.
