The Houston Zoo's herd of elephants, a huge draw through the years,
could become a thing of the past if a herpesvirus continues to kill
young animals.

None of the 14 calves conceived by the zoo's elephants during the
last 25 years is alive today. Six were stillborn or died during pregnancy.

Eight elephants who were born at the zoo later died, 6 from the
nearly always fatal elephant herpesvirus, prompting a scientific
research team to characterize the zoo as a "hot spot" for the virus.
The virus's most recent victim was Mac, a 2-year-old calf and one of
the zoo's most popular attractions, who died last week.

Among the issues raised by the spate of deaths at the zoo and others
elsewhere is whether captivity plays a role in the virus's
transmission and onset of illness. Some animal welfare groups have
called on zoos to halt breeding programs until a cure is found. And
some zoos, including Houston's, could find themselves with no Asian
elephants to replace aging ones as they die.

''Every year, we have fewer female elephants of reproductive age,"
said Lauren Howard, an associate veterinarian at the zoo. "That is a
huge concern."

The virus is proving lethal to many young Asian elephants, the only
species kept at the zoo. Researchers discovered the virus in 1995,
and while their understanding of it has progressed, they remain
unclear about how it is transmitted and when elephants are exposed to
it. A cure or vaccine is even further off.

The disease is plaguing Asian elephants at many zoos worldwide. In
North America, at least 17 of 41 zoos that are members of the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums have been home to an elephant that
died from the herpesvirus or contracted it, according to a report
last year [2007] by In Defense of Animals, a nonprofit organization
that works to protect animals and their natural habitats.

Once the virus is detected, very few elephants have survived. It
causes blood vessels to leak and can cause their hearts to stop.

Death can come quickly; from the 1st day, the virus's effects become
visible out to 5 days later. In Mac's case, his handlers saw signs of
the virus -- lethargy and a swollen head -- the morning of 9 Nov
2008. He died that evening.

Infection with the virus has caused 20 percent of the deaths of Asian
elephants in North American facilities during the last 25 years,
according to the International Elephant Foundation, a nonprofit that
promotes conservation of elephants. The virus is the number one
killer of young elephants in the U.S., according to the National Zoo's website.

Zoos and other North American facilities hold a small number of the
animals -- 150 African elephants, 141 Asians -- according to the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums. African elephants, a different
species not merely a different breed, have been nearly unaffected by the virus.

Zoos don't have the option of importing elephants from the wild
because Asian elephants are an endangered species.

Instead, zoos rely on breeding to replace aging elephants. The virus
has hampered many breeding programs since it afflicts mostly young elephants.

Until recently, some researchers believed the virus was limited to
zoos and other facilities that keep animals, because no cases were
confirmed in wild elephants. Animal welfare groups such as In Defense
of Animals and Born Free USA have questioned whether the stress of
captivity or some other aspect of captive life triggers onset of the
virus or causes it to spread.

Researchers from a Berlin wildlife center and other institutions in
2006 reported that Seima, an Asian elephant born in the wild in
Cambodia, died from the virus.

However, Seima didn't live in the wild for long. Shortly after her
birth, she fell into the hands of traders. Authorities later took her
away from the traders. She was then bottle-reared and lived in an
elephant sanctuary.

The life expectancy for Asian elephants in the wild and at North
American zoos is about 45 years, according to the Association of Zoos
and Aquariums.

Laura Richman, who discovered the virus in 1995 and heads the Indo
Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus Lab at the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C., said that in yet-to-be-published papers,
researchers will report the virus has killed other Asian elephants
that lived in the wild.

Richman said she and other researchers now are investigating whether
most or many adult Asian elephants carry the virus, which usually lies latent.

Adult elephants survive occasional flare-ups. But newborns and
calves, such as 2-year-old Mac, sometimes do not, because their
immune systems haven't completely developed, Richman hypothesizes.

If her theory is correct, Mac may have caught the virus from one of
the 4 other elephants in the maternally-run zoo herd, including his
mom, Shanti and Methai, a surrogate mom.

Methai gave birth to 6 calves. All died, including ones that were
sent to zoos in Berlin, Chicago and Canada. Five of the deaths were
caused by the virus.

Of Shanti's 2 calves, Mac died from the virus. Bella, born in 2004,
died after Shanti rejected her.

In Defense of Animals said other virus hot spots include Dickerson
Park Zoo in Springfield, Missouri and Rosamond Gifford Zoo in
Syracuse, New York.

Some stillborn elephants in Europe tested positive for the virus,
leading researchers to believe that their mothers passed it on to
them, according to a 2005 article on the National Zoo's website.

Houston Zoo director Rick Barongi said the 6 failed elephant
pregnancies at the zoo over the last several decades occurred before
1995, when the virus was discovered. The zoo, he said, doesn't know
whether the virus caused the failed pregnancies.

Eric Kleiman, research director at In Defense of Animals, said zoos
should halt breeding programs until they know how the virus is
transmitted and a vaccine or other treatment regimen is developed.

Barongi said, "We know we've got a serious problem here. We know
we're at risk unless we find a cure."

But there is no reason to believe that Mac would have been better off
if he had not spent 2 years living with his mom and learning tricks
taught to him by keepers and receiving their love, said Barongi.

Halting the breeding program, he said, won't find a cure for the
virus. ''What does that get you?" he asked.

[This is a very complicated situation. If captive breeding promotes
the disease, then there must some situation that makes the elephants
more susceptible or the virus more virulent. Or, is it a case of
biosecurity or cleanliness of something so simple we may not realize
we are promoting the virus? Is it the way we feed them? What we feed
them? How we water them? More research is certainly in order to find
a cure, but time is running out for the elephants. - Mod.TG]
