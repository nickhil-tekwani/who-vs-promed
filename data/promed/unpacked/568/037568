The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is urging college and university
students to protect themselves with 2 doses of the MMR jab after a huge
increase in cases of mumps in Bedfordshire. In 2008, just 2 people
contracted confirmed cases of mumps in the county, but this year [2009], 61
people were diagnosed with the illness in just 6 months between January and
July 2009.

In the east of England, 467 confirmed cases of mumps were reported up to
July 2009 compared with 136 cases in total in 2008. The HPA says that young
people aged 15 to 24 are most affected in the region; the age group makes
up 73 per cent of all cases reported in 2009. Dr Joe Kearney, regional
director for the HPA in the east of England, said: "Young people who
haven't received 2 doses of MMR should speak to their GP [general
practitioner] urgently."

In contrast, the number of confirmed cases of measles in Bedfordshire seems
to be decreasing. Last year [2008], there were 5 people diagnosed with
measles, and from January to July this year [2009], there have been only 2.
Across the region [the HPA East of England Region comprises the counties of
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Essex,
Suffolk, and Norfolk. - Mod.CP], 70 cases were reported to the HPA up to
July 2009, compared with a total of 90 cases in 2008. (For more information

[The contrast between the number of measles cases and the number of mumps
cases is striking. This may be a consequence of the relative lesser
immunogenicity of the mumps component of the triple MMR vaccine, such that
a single dose of the measles component may be sufficient to confer adequate
immunity, whereas a 2nd immunisation is required to achieve adequate
protection against mumps virus infection.
