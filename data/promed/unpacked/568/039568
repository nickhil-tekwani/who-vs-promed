The cause of the 7 cows' deaths wasn't immediately clear. All of the animals died between late summer and fall of 2017 in Albemarle County, the prosperous, semi-agricultural county that surrounds the city of Charlottesville. Another cow on the property, sick but alive, was found with signs of anemia, weakness, and respiratory distress.

Fearing the deaths were a sign of a new foreign animal disease, the US Department of Agriculture came to Albemarle to investigate and found that 6 other cattle on the farm were infected with _Theileria orientalis_, a fairly benign disease known to infect livestock in the US. But a later study done at Virginia Tech that looked at the form the _Theileria_ took made a startling discovery: rather than the more common strain scientists were accustomed to seeing in North America, the disease infecting the Albemarle cattle was a virulent form known as the Ikeda subtype.

Ikeda had never before been detected in the western hemisphere. And investigators weren't happy to see it. Studies from New Zealand have found that about 5% of cattle infected with this subtype die; those that survive often grow more slowly, produce less milk and are more likely to miscarry their calves. In Australia, this results in an estimated USD 20 million worth of cattle losses annually; in Korea and Japan, that number may be as high as USD 100 million.

Since the Asian longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) was first identified in New Jersey in 2017, the exotic parasite has spread to at least 9 US states, mostly in the East, but also in Arkansas. In much of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, the longhorned tick is a significant and damaging parasite and vector of diseases affecting humans and animals.

Authorities in Virginia have identified the tick in 24 counties, the most in any state.

Concerns over the spread of )_H. longicornis_ have increased recently with confirmation of _Theileria orientalis_ (Ikeda genotype) in a group of Virginia cattle. _T. orientalis_ Ikeda is a parasite that causes a disease in cattle that results in major economic issues in Asia, New Zealand, and Australia.

_T. orientalis_, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a tickborne hemoprotozoan with a life cycle that affects erythrocytes and leukocytes and contributes to chronic anemia, ill-thrift, and persistent subclinical infections in livestock. In Australia and elsewhere, the longhorned tick serves as the primary vector for _T. orientalis_. Formerly though, the strains of _T. orientalis_ found in North America had low levels of virulence in cattle.

That all changed though, in August 2017, when 7 cattle from a herd in Albemarle County, Virginia, died after showing signs of weakness and malaise. Affected cattle included bulls, cows, and steers ranging in age from 3 months to 13 years, and all the affected animals were born and raised on the farm.

Investigators also found longhorned ticks on the farm and on the farm's cattle. After diagnostic testing to rule out _Anaplasma_, _Babesia_, and _Leptospira_ in the affected animals, pathologists confirmed the animals were infected with piroplasmid hemoparasites, specifically.

_T. orientalis_, and more specifically, the foreign Ikeda strain, as verified through PCR testing, according to the CDC report, has been implicated as the etiologic agent of infectious bovine anemia. Subsequent testing of live cattle in the index herd and on adjacent properties found a high percentage positive for _T. orientalis_ Ikeda.

The CDC report notes that in this study, some of the animals that were positive for _T. orientalis_ Ikeda by PCR remained positive 5 months later, suggesting a chronic state, although the animals that had initially exhibited clinical signs were no longer clinically ill during the spring and summer months. In New Zealand, the authors note, disease caused by _T. orientalis_ demonstrates seasonal pathogenicity, and anemia is more pronounced during autumn and winter months. They also point out that without subsequent testing following negative diagnosis for anaplasmosis, identification of the pathogenic _Theileria_ species might not have occurred, illustrating the need for more surveillance and appropriate characterization of any parasites detected.

[The news report above includes a map showing the distribution of the longhorned tick in NE USA.

This bovine disease has long been seen in the Antipodes (Australia & New Zealand). A single injection of the drug buparvaquone, if administered early in a cow's infection, can greatly reduce mortality rates. To quote my fellow moderator TG [24 Sep 2016 Theileria, bovine - Australia (02) 20160924.4509096]: "There are any number of drugs in various countries that have long withholding times. The drugs are necessary to save the animals and the livelihood of the people who raise the animals.

A number of methods of control for the drug exist. The drug could be controlled so that only veterinarians are capable of obtaining the drug and it must be administered by the veterinarian. Furthermore, drug assays could be developed to test for the drug in blood or serum or urine and even in tissues, such as muscle, and liver and kidneys.

The drug testing would provide good evidence that the drug was no longer in the animal's system. It would allow the animal owners to continue to operate and it would show other governments the security system was working. Further, it would start to control the _Theileria_ sp.

_Theileria_ sp. has been affecting the cattle of Australia for some time. The farmers are suffering, the animals are suffering and the number of exportable cattle will decline as _Theileria_ rages through the country unchecked. Consequently, not providing adequate treatment to the affected animals may already be affecting the number of exports available.

While emergency measures are put into place, a research project to clearly document how long the drug is in the meat and organ tissues of a treated animal would further science, and assure other countries of the safety of the drug. Likewise, the animal producers would be able to stay in business and make a living doing what many have done most of their lives.

Even with long withholding times, owners would be able to get another calf out of a living animal, which would help sustain the farming operations. Likely the affected premises would rather have to keep an animal for a long period of time and have a productive animal than a dead animal.

_Theileria_ are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying _Theileria_ feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters the red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _T. buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of _Theileria_ throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (fewer than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies (or horse flies) have also been shown to transmit infection.
