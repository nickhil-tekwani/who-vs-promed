The foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has broken out in Rakai [Central
region] and Isingiro [Western region] districts.

Animal husbandry state minister Maj. Bright Rwamirama said the
ministry had banned movement of cattle between Uganda and Tanzania to
control the disease.

Rwamirama on Thursday [12 Mar 2009] said the vaccination of cattle in
the affected areas would begin after 2 weeks. "We have started the
procurement process for the vaccine and in 2 weeks time, we will
begin the vaccination. We shall start with the affected areas and
then go through the cattle transit routes," he said. 2 million head
of cattle will be vaccinated in Mbarara, Masaka, Sembabule, and other
districts in the cattle corridor.

Meanwhile, Rwamirama has advised farmers and traders in the cattle
corridor to be alert and make sure the animals that come to their
areas are cleared by the relevant authorities.

"Farmers should be vigilant and not accept uncleared animals. An
animal with FMD remains a carrier for 6 months," he said.

Rwamirama also encouraged farmers and traders to only purchase cows
from the markets and not from personal farms, explaining that the
animals in the markets are normally cleared before sale.
