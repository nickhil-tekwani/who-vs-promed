Nigeria records 31 deaths in cholera outbreak
---------------------------------------------
At least 31 deaths have been recorded so far in 2022 in a cholera outbreak in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) said on Wednesday [13 Apr 2022].

The country has recorded a total of 1359 confirmed cases of cholera from the onset in January [2022], Jessica Akinrogbe, NCDC's senior emergency response officer, told reporters in Abuja.

Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. Akinrogbe said a total of 15 states have been affected by the outbreak, noting the NCDC had already deployed rapid response teams to the states to curtail the spread.

With the approaching rainy season in the country, more efforts must be geared toward preventing recurrence. The public health official urged the states to step up their cholera preparedness and response plan and build capacities to manage emergencies.

The health agency has been supporting states to ensure a coordinated, rapid, and effective response to the current outbreak, including the deployment of rapid response teams to support the response at the state level, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, and scale-up of risk communications among other activities.

Part of the measures so far taken by the government includes the distribution of cholera kits to hotspot local government areas, while 5813 households received water treatment chemicals, she said, adding a total of 107 persons were trained on hygiene and sanitation promotion, water quality monitoring, water schemes operation, and maintenance, while 40 water points were chlorinated.

Cholera outbreaks are frequently reported in Nigeria due to the lack of potable water supply, especially in densely populated areas.

Fight against cholera in Malawi gets timely boost amid outbreak in 2 regions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malawi received 1.9 million oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses through the Global Emergency Stockpile for the 1st round of its vaccination drive after cholera was detected in areas affected by floods in March [2022].

According to Malawi's Ministry of Health, 3 deaths and 65 cases have been detected in the Nsanje and Machinga districts.

The vaccination drive against cholera will run for the next few weeks.

"The vaccination campaign will target 1.9 million people comprising adults and children from one year old upwards who are living in flood-affected and cholera-prone districts. The targeted people will receive 2 doses of cholera vaccines 2 weeks apart," said the WHO.

A 2nd batch of 2 million doses, provided under the Vaccine Alliance, will take the total up to 3.9 million doses.

Cholera was first detected in Malawi in 1973 and has been recurring since.

[Contaminated water is the main factor related to the widespread dissemination of _Vibrio cholerae_, the cause of cholera.

The 209th anniversary of the birth of John Snow, an early epidemiologist who, in 1854, discovered contaminated water as the source of cholera, occurred recently on 15 Mar 2022. The following is a discussion of the discovery:

"How often does a map change the world? In 1854, one produced by Doctor John Snow, altered it forever.

In the world of the 1850s, cholera was believed to be spread by miasma in the air, germs were not yet understood, and the sudden and serious outbreak of cholera in London's Soho was a mystery. So Snow did something data journalists often do now: he mapped the cases. The map essentially represented each death as a bar, and you can see them in the smaller image above [the map is available at the source URL below]. It became apparent that the cases were clustered around the pump in Broad (now Broadwick) Street.

There were some outliers, though, and Snow wrote that 'in some of the instance[s], where the deaths are scattered a little further from the rest on the map, the malady was probably contracted at a nearer point to the pump.'

One 59-year-old woman sent daily for water from the Broad Street pump because she liked its taste.

Wrote Snow, 'I was informed by this lady's son that she had not been in the neighbourhood of Broad Street for many months. A cart went from Broad Street to West End every day, and it was the custom to take out a large bottle of the water from the pump in Broad Street, as she preferred it. The water was taken on Thursday 31 August, and she drank of it in the evening, and also on Friday. She was seized with cholera on the evening of the latter day and died on Saturday.'

At a local brewery, the workers were allowed all the beer they could drink; it was believed they didn't drink water at all. But it had its own water supply, too, and there were consequently fewer cases.

In nearby Poland street, a workhouse was surrounded by cases but appeared unaffected: this was because, again, it had its own water supply.

It turned out that the water for the pump was polluted by sewage from a nearby cesspit, where a baby's nappy contaminated with cholera had been dumped. But [Snow] didn't just produce a map; it was one part of a detailed statistical analysis." (http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map) - Mod.LL
