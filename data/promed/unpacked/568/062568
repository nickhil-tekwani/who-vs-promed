FASCIOLA HEPATICA, HOST RANGE (02)
==================================
[Fasciola hepatica, host range: RFI 970522173756]
Date: Thu, 22 May 1997 20:19:58, -0500
From: LNPK80A@prodigy.com (DR NORMAN C RONALD)
After checking the records of the Texas Vet. Med Diag. Lab, I have
failed to find any record of _Fasciola hepatica_ in any species of bird
posted at our lab. Texas has a large ratite population and a considerable
population of F. hepatica in our sheep and cattle herds with occasional
populations of the
parasite in wild rabbits. I cannot remember any reference to _Fasciola
hepatica_ in birds.
