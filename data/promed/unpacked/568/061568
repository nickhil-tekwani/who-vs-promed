Hundreds of parents received a recorded voicemail from the high school principal. The call came after students came face-to-face with bats, twice in one week.

[SC] was one of the many parents that packed into the Brennan High School [in San Antonio, Texas] parking lot to pick up her daughter. She played the school voicemail that was left on her phone. "The result of the 1st bat tested positive for rabies," the recording said. The school also released a letter to parents to inform them about the bats found on campus.

"We've had conversations with our kids about other animals and stray dogs or cats or even other people's pets, but I never thought that I would have to talk about bats," SC said. "Yeah, I was a little freaked out," student [ML] said.

A class dedicated to learning outside turned into a life lesson for a student. 3 teens found the bat outside the school and a teen was bitten by the bat while trying to move it to a safer place, according to Barry Perez, the school district spokesperson.

"From what my teacher told me he said that the student shouldn't be at school today," ML said. "That the bat had went and bit the kid and now he has rabies."

Perez did not confirm if the student was diagnosed with rabies, but did add that the teen was being treated with rabies shots.

Just 2 days after the student was bitten, another bat was found on campus dead. According to a letter sent to parents, the lab results of the 2nd bat are still pending.

Texas is known as the battiest state in the country and Bracken Cave holds the largest bat colony in the world. The cave is located nearly 40 miles [about 64 km] from the school. Bats are some of the most common sources of human rabies infections in the United States, according to the CDC.

The newest lecture at school: do not touch wild animals.

"Well, it seems like it would be common sense, but I guess now I do need to learn a few things," ML said.

Pest control checked out the campus and Perez says they did not find a colony of bats nearby.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, and these infections are almost always fatal, unless prophylaxed. - Mod.PMB
