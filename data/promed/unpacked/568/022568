The number of tick-borne illnesses throughout the state [Tennessee] has far surpassed the total last year [2011]. The Tennessee Health Department has reported 304 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever as of this month [July 2012], compared to 255 known cases in all of 2011.

Children can contract the illnesses without a tick being found, since the insects can remove themselves after their blood meal.

Medical experts link the increased cases in tick-borne illnesses to an abundance [of ticks] this season following a mild winter and early spring.

[For a discussion of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), see the ProMED-mail post "Rocky Mountain spotted fever - USA (03): (TN) 20120606.1157629." In this post, the news report, dated 3 Jun 2012, said that for the state of Tennessee, there were "more than 100 cases statewide this year [2012] alone." The news report above gives the exact number of 304 for the 1st 7 months of this year, in comparison to 255 for all of last year [2011].

The incubation period of RMSF is about a week after the tick exposure, days after the tick has detached. Frequently, the patient is unaware of a preceding tick bite.

RMSF is caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia rickettsii_. This organism is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected tick species. In the United States, these include the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_), Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_), and brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/). A female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick) can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm#fig1.

Pictures of the rash of this disease can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html#rash.
