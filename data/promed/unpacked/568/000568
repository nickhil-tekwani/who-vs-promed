Experts say the spread of American foulbrood disease among bees could worsen due to factors such as deforestation.

They say the disease wiped out about 40 percent of commercial bee colonies in the Western Cape last year [2014].

Leaders in the industry met in Oudtshoorn on [Wed 28 Oct 2015] to discuss the way forward.

A 20-billion a year industry under threat. Role players say they are concerned. Bees are an integral part of food security for humans. They are crucial for pollination.

However, human activity is threatening their livelihood. A beekeeper, says: "We don't have enough nature resources for our bees anymore. One of the biggest problems is the loss of our eucalyptus trees being cut down. Beekeepers aren't allowed to keep bees in any big nature reserve, vandalism becomes a bigger problem. So, that put the beekeepers under big stress to find good places to put their hives for the bees to survive."

Without a sustainable food source of their own. Experts warn American foulbrood disease could wipe out more commercial colonies.

Researcher, Mike Allsopp says: "What will happen later in the season when we get into January, February and there's no food available, that's going to be the telling moment if we're going to have a substantial 50 percent collapse or whether the colonies are genuinely better than a year ago. My gut feeling is that sometime in the next 3, 4 months we'll see a large-scale collapse again."

Beekeepers have been encouraged to keep their bees healthy. A lack of enough beehive inspectors is a concern.

It is suspected that American foulbrood disease was first introduced to the Western Cape in 2009 from infected imported honey or beekeeping equipment.

Foulbrood disease is [caused by] bacterial spores ingested by bee larvae, causing [the colony] to [dwindle] and die.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
