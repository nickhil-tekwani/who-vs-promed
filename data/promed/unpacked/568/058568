In Nigde Province in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey, [the] Chamber of Agriculture has warned growers to be timely in applying their agrochemicals, as there are signs of "downy mildew" [see comment below] in the early potato planting areas. The recent cool and damp weather has created the perfect conditions for [the] disease.

Annually Nigde produces close to 800 000 tones of potatoes and if measures are not taken, the disease could seriously damage output. Chamber of Agriculture engineers need to carry out regular checks and take early preventive measures. [They said that] last year [2015] growers noticed too late and suffered losses.

[Downy mildews include many species in several genera which cause similar symptoms on a range of hosts, including many crops. Individual species usually have a narrow host range affecting only 1 or a few different hosts.

However, no downy mildew pathogens are known to affect potato. The report above may either refer to powdery mildew (PM; _Erysiphe_ spp.) or late blight (PLB; _Phytophthora infestans_; for more information see links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). PLB is favored by cool, moist conditions, as described above; while warmer conditions, absence of rain and high air humidity are usually more favorable for PM.

Both diseases may be controlled with suitable fungicide applications, but to optimize control measures reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved in the problems is needed. Crop monitoring and clean planting material are vital for management of both diseases.
