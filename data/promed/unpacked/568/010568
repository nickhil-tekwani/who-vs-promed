[This outbreak has been going on at least since mid-April 2010. The
number of fatalities from encephalitis has increased from 414 on 13
Oct 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20101014.3727) to the 469
reported above. As with several of the previous reports, there is no
indication of which etiological agent involved in these 2 cases.
ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about
definitive diagnoses of these and any new cases.
