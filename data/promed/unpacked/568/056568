Researchers have discovered 2 mutations that likely allowed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, to transmit from bats to humans.

MERS, a viral respiratory disease, was 1st diagnosed in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has infected more nearly 1200 people and led to 442 deaths, including the recent outbreak in the Republic of Korea.

In the new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota compared the sequences of MERS-CoV and 2 MERS-like viruses in bats, discovering 2 mutations that allow the bat viruses to infect human cells, according to a press release. In order for a virus to infect host cells, it must attach to a receptor on the host cell and be activated by its enzymes, which allows for the fusion of the virus and host cells.

The 2 mutations were similar to others discovered that allowed the virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, to jump from animals to humans. UM researchers suggest future studies on both diseases need to examine the evolutionary processes that allowed each virus to mutate in order to infect human cells.

The study is published in the Journal of Virology.

"1. Abstract
To understand how MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmitted from bats to humans, we compared the virus-surface spikes of MERS-CoV and a related bat coronavirus HKU4. Although HKU4 spike cannot mediate viral entry into human cells, 2 mutations enabled it to do so by allowing it to be activated by human proteases. These mutations are present in MERS-CoV spike, explaining why MERS-CoV infects human cells. These mutations therefore played critical roles in the bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV".

"2. Concluding commentary (references deleted)
Understanding the molecular mechanisms for cross-species transmissions of viruses is critical for evaluating their emerging disease potentials and for preventing and controlling their spread in human populations. Here we examined the different cell entry activities of the spike proteins from human-infecting MERS-CoV and a closely related bat coronavirus HKU4. Although MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes share a high sequence homology and recognize the same host DPP4 receptor, only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates viral entry into human cells. Our study revealed that introduction of 2 single mutations, S746R and N762A, into HKU4 spike at the S1/S2 boundary fully instilled its capability to mediate viral entry into human cells. MERS-CoV spike already contained both of these mutations, explaining why MERS-CoV is capable of infecting human cells. Thus these 2 mutations in the spike are essential for MERS-CoV to transmit from bats to humans by allowing MERS-CoV spike to be activated by human cellular proteases.

Viral adaptation to human cellular proteases is critical for viral infection of human cells because human cellular proteases, particularly endosomal proteases, are more reliable sources than some extracellular proteases to activate viral entry. Previous research also identified 2 mutations in SARS-CoV spike that led SARS-CoV to transmit from palm civets to humans (19-22). These mutations increased SARS-CoV spike's capability to bind human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Thus, different entry factors appear to have played the most critical roles in the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV: adaption to human cellular proteases by MERS-CoV and adaption to human receptor by SARS-CoV. Although MERS-CoV spike might also need to adapt to human DPP4 receptor upon infecting human cells, such adaptations might only have incremental effects on the infectivity of MERS-CoV in human cells. In contrast, the 2 mutations adaptive to human cellular proteases transformed MERS-CoV spike from completely lacking to fully owning the capacity to mediate viral entry into human cells, and thus they likely played the most critical role in the bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV".

The current knowledge on the role of bats in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is based upon findings in a single _Taphozous perforatus_ bat (Egyptian tomb bat) captured in October 2012 in Bisha (Saudi Arabia), about 12 km (7.5 mi) from the premises of a MERS-CoV patient. A product obtained by PCR amplification of nucleic acid from a fecal pellet of the said bat "showed 100 percent nucleotide identity to the virus cloned from the index case-patient in Bisha." No additional detections of MERS-CoV in bats have become known since; a viable MERS coronavirus has yet to be isolated from a bat. - Mod.AS]
