'Neck blast' disease devours paddy
----------------------------------
Farmers [in Sirsa district] who transplanted Pusa-1401 paddy have reported damage to their crop due to the 'neck blast' disease. Pusa 1401 is a popular variety of basmati which has been sown by many farmers in the area.

A large number of farmers assembled to discuss the issue. "My crop in 80 acres [32.38 ha] has started turning white leaving its panicles dying prematurely, within 4 days. We have been told that this is an attack of neck blast," said a farmer.

Neck blast, according to agricultural experts, occurs when the pathogen infects the neck of the panicle. The infected neck is girdled by a greyish brown lesion and the panicle falls if the infection is severe. If neck blast occurs before the milk stage (grain forming stage), the entire panicle may die prematurely, leaving it completely unfilled.

[The] Deputy Director [of] Agriculture at Sirsa admitted that neck blast had hit the crop and the department had advised spraying with fungicides.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_, previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or (as in the case above) neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

In India earlier in 2015, an outbreak of rice blast has also been reported from Tamil Nadu (ProMED-mail post 20150128.3124545).
