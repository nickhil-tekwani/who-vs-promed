[While this week's report may look somewhat promising, the circulation of the cVDPV continues in Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. Case numbers are down from 2020, but still high enough to be of significant concern. Of note the year to date totals in the report for cVDPVs is unchanged from last week's and should be 485 to include the case from Côte d'Ivoire reported this week.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan - violence against polio teams
[A]
Date: Sun 12 Dec 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/12/pakistan-gunmen-kill-policeman-guarding-polio-vaccinators


Gunmen shot dead a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team in Pakistan's northwest on Sunday [12 Dec 2021] in the second such killing in 2 days, police said on Sunday [12 Dec 2021].

The attack in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa came a day after 2 men with the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP, gunned down another police officer who was guarding a similar vaccination team in the same area [see [2B] below].

"Two gunmen riding a motorbike opened fire on a policeman who was guarding a 2-member female polio vaccination team in the Sheikh Uttar area, killing him on the spot," Tank district police chief Sajjad Khan told the AFP news agency. Another local police official, Amanat Ali, confirmed the incident and said the assailants had escaped. No one has claimed responsibility for the killing, but a spokesman for the TTP earlier claimed Saturday's [11 Dec 2021] attack.

The attacks came 3 days after the armed group announced that a month-long ceasefire agreement with the government had come to an end, accusing authorities of violating the terms of the 1-month truce.

No progress had been made in fresh negotiations with Pakistan's government, according to an audio message released late on Friday [10 Dec 2021] by Pakistani Taliban leader Noor Wali Mehsud.

Prime Minister Imran Khan announced in October [2021] that the government was in talks with the group for the 1st time since 2014, facilitated by the Afghan Taliban, which seized power across the border in August [2021].

The TTP, a separate movement from the Afghan Taliban, plunged Pakistan into a period of deadly violence after forming in 2007.

Police guards protecting vaccination teams in Pakistan have come under attack in the past, mostly from homegrown armed rebels, who claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilise children.

Pakistan is 1 of 2 countries where polio remains endemic but only 1 case has been reported this year [2021] after 84 in 2020, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Polio is a disease that especially affects children, and can cripple people for life. In 2014, the WHO made it mandatory for all people travelling from Pakistan to have a polio vaccination certificate, although the ban is not effectively enforced.

Police officer Sajjad Ahmed said 2 gunmen on a motorbike opened fire on the police team escorting the polio vaccinators in the Chaddarah area, killing 1 constable on the spot and critically wounding a Frontier Constabulary officer. Members of the vaccination team were unhurt.

Pakistani militants often target polio teams and police assigned to protect them, claiming the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilise children.

Taliban gunmen shot dead 1 police officer and wounded another protecting polio vaccination workers in north-western Pakistan, officials today [11 Dec 2021] confirmed. The terror group struck out in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on the 2nd day of a 5-day anti-polio drive in a bid to vaccinate more than 6 million children.

Two gunmen riding a motorbike 'opened fire' on a police security detail that was escorting the polio vaccinators -- killing one on the spot and critically wounding another, eyewitnesses confirmed.

Mohammad Khurasani, spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, known as the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban had previously denounced the polio vaccine as a 'Western conspiracy' and 'bio-weapon' that would endanger children. The terror group promised violent attacks against those found to be supplying and using it.

Saturday [11 Dec 2021] marked the 1st time the TTP had attacked those involved in a vaccination effort since announcing the end of a 1-month ceasefire with the Government.

[It's very disturbing to see the return of violence against polio workers in Pakistan. And somewhat ironic to have it be a splinter group of the Taliban, simultaneous with a massive vaccination campaign in neighboring Afghanistan currently under Taliban rule. (see https://www.econotimes.com/Afghanistan-Health-ministry-launches-polio-vaccination-campaign-1623333).
