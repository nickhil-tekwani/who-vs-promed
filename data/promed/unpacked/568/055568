Abstract
--------
Japanese encephalitis is mainly considered a rural disease, but there is growing evidence of a peri-urban and urban transmission in several countries, including Cambodia. We, therefore, compared the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia. We monitored 2 cohorts of 15 pigs and determined the force of infection - rate at which seronegative pigs become positive - in 2 study farms located in a peri-urban and rural area, respectively. We also studied the mosquito abundance and diversity in proximity of the pigs, as well as the host densities in both areas. All the pigs seroconverted before the age of 6 months. The force of infection was 0.061 per day (95 percent confidence interval = 0.034-0.098) in the peri-urban cohort and 0.069 per day (95 percent confidence interval = 0.047-0.099) in the rural cohort. Several differences in the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between both study sites were highlighted. The later virus amplification in the rural cohort may be linked to the later waning of maternal antibodies, but also to the higher pig density in direct proximity of the studied pigs, which could have led to a dilution of mosquito bites at the farm level. The force of infection was almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied, which shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus. This study is a 1st step in improving our understanding of Japanese encephalitis virus ecology in different environments with distinct landscapes, human and animal densities.

Author summary
--------------
The number of Japanese encephalitis cases has decreased substantially over the past decades with the implementation of childhood vaccination programs. Japanese encephalitis virus, however, remains the most important cause of acute viral encephalitis in Eastern and Southern Asia, with an estimated 68 000 cases reported annually worldwide. Our results demonstrate that Japanese encephalitis virus circulates intensely both in a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia, which raises important public health concerns as peri-urban areas are densely populated. These results support the importance of changing vaccination recommendations for travelers and of not focusing national immunization programs against Japanese encephalitis solely on rural areas.

[Although ProMED has posted relative few reports of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Cambodia over the years, that country is within the JE virus endemic area. JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. In Southeast Asia, JE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ group of mosquitoes and wild birds. Ardeid wading birds and pigs are amplifying vertebrate hosts. In endemic areas, incidence in humans is one-10 per 10 000 population. Children under 15 years of age are at greatest risk of encephalitis. For most travelers to Asia, the risk for JE is very low but varies based on destination, duration of travel, season, and activities.

Inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine (manufactured as IXIARO) is the only JE vaccine licensed and available in the United States. This vaccine was approved in March 2009 for use in people aged 17 years and older and in May 2013 for use in children 2 months through 16 years of age.

USA CDC JE Vaccine Recommendations:
- JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend 1 month or more in endemic areas during the JE virus transmission season. This includes long-term travelers, recurrent travelers, or expatriates who will be based in urban areas but are likely to visit endemic rural or agricultural areas during a high-risk period of JE virus transmission.
- Vaccine should also be considered for the following:
1.- Short-term (less than1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the transmission season, if they plan to travel outside an urban area and their activities will increase the risk of JE virus exposure. Examples of higher-risk activities or itineraries include: 1) spending substantial time outdoors in rural or agricultural areas, especially during the evening or night; 2) participating in extensive outdoor activities (such as camping, hiking, trekking, biking, fishing, hunting, or farming); and 3) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets.
2.- Travelers to an area with an ongoing JE outbreak.
3.- Travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel.

JE vaccine is not recommended for short-term travelers whose visits will be restricted to urban areas or times outside a well-defined JE virus transmission season.

CDC summaries of JE virus, its epidemiology and available vaccines can be found on the US CDC website:
https://www.cdc.gov/japaneseencephalitis/vaccine/index.html.

The above report indicates that visitors to peri-urban areas that have pig populations should also consider vaccination if they are going to be present during the JE virus transmission season. - Mod.TY
