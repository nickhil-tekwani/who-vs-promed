Cambodia reported 13 700 malaria cases in the 1st 5 months of this year [2013], down 60 percent from 31 100 cases in the same period last year, the National Center for Malaria reported Monday [17 Jun 2013].

From January to May this year [2013], the disease killed 4 people, a sharp decrease compared with 27 deaths in the same period last year, the report said.

Dr. Char Meng Chuor, head of the center, said the remarkable decline was thanks to a mosquito net distribution and awareness campaign. Last year [2012], more than a million mosquito nets were given free-of-charge to vulnerable groups of people throughout the country. He said the country is committed to eliminating the disease by 2025.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease. In Cambodia, the disease is often found in the rainy season and mostly happens in forest and mountainous areas, particularly provinces along the border.

Last year [2012], the country recorded 45 553 cases of malaria, with 45 deaths, the report said.

[There have been 3810 new cases in one month since our previous report from 2 Jun 2013. The 60 percent reduction compared to last year (2012) is important, as emerging artemisinin resistance is occurring in western Cambodia, and mosquito control probably is the best strategy to contain the pool of malaria parasites with reduced susceptibility to artemisinins. - Mod.EP
