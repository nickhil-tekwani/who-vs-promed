Antimicrobial movement from agricultural areas to the environment: The missing link. A role for nuclear techniques

Executive summary
-----------------
Antimicrobials (AM) play a critical role in the treatment of human and animal (aquatic and terrestrial) diseases, which has led to their widespread application and use. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and some parasites) to stop an antibiotic, such as an antimicrobial, antiviral, or antimalarial, from working against them. Globally, about 700 000 deaths per year (33 000 in Europe [1]) arise from resistant infections as a result of the fact that antimicrobial drugs have become less effective at killing resistant pathogens. Antimicrobial chemicals that are present in environmental compartments can trigger the development of AMR. These chemicals can also cause antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) to further spread antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) because they may have an evolutionary advantage over non-resistant bacteria.

For some time now, AMR has been approached mainly from the human and animal health angles; however, little is known about the impacts that AMR in the environment may have on health. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) have a long-standing partnership to combat health threats associated with interactions between humans and animals. In a recent Memorandum of Understanding, this tripartite alliance agreed to strengthen its joint work with a focus on tackling AMR.

Global efforts on AMR must recognize the extent to which antibiotics, and resistant bacteria, spread through manufacturing run-off and human and animal waste. Inviting UN Environment to collaborate with FAO, WHO, and OIE on the environmental aspects of AMR is fully in line with the directives in Resolution EA.3/Res.4 [2], which was adopted by the UN Environment Assembly in 2017. This resolution notes that human, animal, and plant health and the environment are interconnected and requests the UN Environment to prepare, by the 5th session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in 2021, a report on the environmental impacts of AMR. Furthermore, a preliminary report on the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Meeting in collaboration with OIE on Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance: Role of the Environment, Crops and Biocides (November 2018) highlighted the importance of AMR and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGS) in the immediate plant production environment. The report indicated that conventional and organically grown vegetables could be vehicles for the dissemination of AMR bacteria and their resistance genes to humans if consumed raw, and that soil, organic fertilizers, and irrigation water are sources of microbial residues and contamination. Thus, AMR bacteria are present in agricultural soil and may spread into the food.

Potentially high levels of antibiotics and, correspondingly, high levels of ARB and ARG can be found in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants. The sewage of industrial plants that have produced antibiotics might contain more ARB and ARG than does sewage from hospitals or from urban areas. In general, wastewater can act as a potential reservoir. The spread of AMR in the environment is generally not controlled by national or international legal regulations. The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive contains a provision on ensuring high quality fresh water according to agreed standards. However, the phenomenon of AMR is not referenced. The other transmission route of ARG and ARB -- over manure into soil that is connected to surface water or groundwater -- is even more complicated to control. One bottleneck is the lack of reporting and definitions of ARG and ARB in the environmental context. In contrast, clinical strains are much better described.

This paper will provide alternative screening methods useful for environmental samples and surveillance approaches in planning such screening efforts. We consider a range of methods for studying environmental horizontal gene transfer. A better understanding of how antimicrobial resistance moves from agricultural areas to the environment through soil and water is important if we are to develop guidance to managing it cost effectively. Based on case studies, this paper aims to summarize the current understanding of the occurrence of ARG in the environment, and the antimicrobial movement from agricultural areas to the environment.

Current convectional chemical methods used to analyze antibiotics and study ARB with metagenomics provide comprehensive surveys on high concentrations of contaminants in the environment, but fail to elucidate sources and sinks, or to reveal how the 2 parameters influence each other. Nuclear techniques could help determine the sources of antibiotics and where they are eliminated through isotopic fingerprinting of sources and may detect the degradation of antibiotics by transformation-induced isotopic effects.

The cost benefit and cost effectivity of analyses are not discussed in this technical paper. Neither does the paper touch on risk management approaches, such as hazard identification, exposure assessment, toxicological assessments, and overall risk assessment. Instead, the focus is on the methodologies that can be used to detect and trace the source and transport of antibiotics through soil and water, and, more importantly, the nuclear techniques (multi-element stable isotopes fingerprinting) that can determine the origin, production process, and transport of AM, using compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA). We offer recommendations on how to handle samples gathered in the field, including sampling strategies and protocols, the transport and preservation of samples, and methods for analyzing them. The paper concludes with our thoughts on the way forward, including knowledge gaps on AMR that warrant investigation using nuclear and microbiological methods.

This technical paper was developed by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture (AGE), the Animal Health Service (AGAH), and the Land and Water Division (CBL), Climate, Biodiversity, Land and Water Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with inputs from accredited colleagues in the field of nuclear techniques in agriculture and the environment.

The widespread agricultural application of triazole fungicides and antibiotics and their persistence in the environment can reduce the population of susceptible soil microbiome and act as a significant selective force for the emergence and spread of resistant genotypes. This concern has been recently raised regarding the emergence of drug-resistant _Candida auris_ and _Aspergillus_ species (see ProMED-mail posts Candida auris: MDR, emergence due to agricultural use of azoles, susp. 20190407.6409119 and Aspergillosis - USA: multidrug resistance 20180928.6057087).

Concern for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms was also raised in recent ProMED-mail posts regarding the recent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval of spraying streptomycin on all citrus crops in the USA 3 times per year. Please see ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance (03): USA, spraying streptomycin on citrus trees, EPA 20190320.6377319. - Mod.ML]
