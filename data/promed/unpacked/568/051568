STREPTOCOCCUS SUIS, HUMAN - VIET NAM (02)

Regarding _Streptococcus suis_ in Viet Nam, [see ProMED archive
20070721.2345, Streptococcus suis, human - Viet Nam]
nothing indicates so far that a new outbreak is taking place now in 2007.
The Viet Nam Institute of Tropical & Contagious Diseases in Hanoi has
newly developed capacities to diagnose human _S. suis_ infection.
This was not present before 2007. It is not known if the "increased"
number of human _S. suis_ is related to the PRRS [porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome] outbreak or simply a better
detection system not previously present in the north of the country.
In the south of the country (Ho Chi Minh City), a hospital with
similar affiliation has been detecting cases in humans for many
years. Dr. Constance Schultsz from the Oxford University Clinical
Research Unit Hospital for Tropical Disease in Ho Chi Minh City has
very good experience on isolation and characterization of Vietnamese
strains of human _S. suis_, and it seems that _S. suis_ is already
one of the main causes of adult human meningitis in this country.
Isolates from the North will soon be sent to her laboratory for MLTS
[? multilocus sequence testing] analysis.

[We thank Marcelo Gottschalk for his comments. He has published
extensively on the microbiology of _S. suis and _S. suis_ infection
in humans and pigs. (For a recent discussion of _S. suis_ by Marcelo
Gottschalk, see
<http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/1/health-and-welfare/1980/lessons-from-chinas-istreptococcus-suis-ioutbreak-the-risk-for-humans>.)
ProMED-mail 20070726.2403 updated the total number of human
infections with _S. suis_ in Viet Nam in 2007 to 42, adding 20 cases
in the south to the 22 cases described earlier from the north
(ProMED-mail 20070721.2345). The relationship between pig-origin _S.
suis_ infections in humans and PRRS (porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome) in pigs was discussed in ProMED-mail
20070726.2403. The possible under-diagnosis of human _S. suis_
infection in the United States was discussed in ProMED-mail
20070823.2756. I believe at the present time only one (VITEK 2) of 3
commonly used commercial automated diagnostic panels available in
clinical laboratories has the capacity to speciate _S. suis_, an
alpha-hemolytic streptococcus when grown on sheep blood agar plates
from clinical specimens.
Although serotype 2 is considered the most virulent and the most
frequent serotype isolated from disease, virulence can vary
substantially both within and among the 35 known serotypes,
Serotyping is based on the immunogenicity of the capsular
polysaccharide. Not all isolates of the same serotype cause the same
disease and the importance of particular serotypes can vary
geographically. Multilocus sequence testing is a procedure that has
been used to characterize clones or clonal groups of _S. suis_
isolates on the basis of nucleotide sequences of 7 housekeeping gene
fragments -- see <http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/40/10/3671.pdf>. - Mod.ML]
