Tonj North County authorities have warned that health centers in the area are dangerously overcrowded with patients suffering from malaria and typhoid.

Commissioner Marko Awuoc visited the local hospital on Thursday [20 Aug 2015] to take stock of the situation and found 125 patients had been admitted. "When I asked the doctors about what happened in the hospital... [they] said I can call it an outbreak of malaria in Tonj North," he said.

He said he has received assurances from the Warap state health ministry that medical teams will soon be arriving to assess the situation.

The Medical Director for Tonj North County, Albino Madut Akot, said the situation is not just limited to that area. "I visited one payam named Aliep last week, and I found the same issue in the area," he said. "And also ... we discover from all payams signs of outbreaks of malaria.

[Warap State is located to the North, bordering Sudan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrap_(state).

Malaria is endemic in South Sudan, but control measures like distribution of insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying are highly likely to have suffered during the recent civil unrest. According to the WHO World Malaria Report 2014, 70 percent of the population had access to insecticide treated bed nets, but there are no data on how many actually used the impregnated nets (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf?ua=1). The same report shows that indoor residual spraying was almost nonexistent. Thus, the reported outbreak is an indication that the present civil unrest has led to a breakdown of malaria control. - Mod.EP
