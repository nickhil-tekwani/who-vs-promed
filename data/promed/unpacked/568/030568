ANTHRACNOSE, COFFEE - VIET NAM: (DAC NONG)

In more than 60 000 ha of coffee plantations in the Central Highland
province of Dak Nong, around 30-40 percent of berries have fallen, and
the harvest is likely to be thousands of tonnes less than expected.

The trees were being attacked by pseudococcus, a type of mealy bug,
and on top of that, there had been more rain than in previous years,
which combined with the high humidity, had made the berries' stalks
rotten.

The coffee farms [have also] been hit by anthracnose whose scientific
name is _Colletotrichum_. The disease spreads quickly on the wind in
high humidity. It appeared in the province a month ago but local
farmers did not discover it in time and it spread. The Dak Nong Plant
Protection Department asked district plant protection stations to help
local farmers to apply proper measures to treat the disease.

[Several fungal species have been found to be associated with
anthracnose symptoms on coffee in Viet Nam, including _Glomerella
cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_), _C.
acutatum_, _C. capsici_, _C. boninense_ and a number of unknown
species (see link below). Blotches and lesions were seen on berries,
leaves and twigs causing serious yield losses, but _C. kahawae_ which
causes coffee berry disease in Africa, was not found in Viet Nam. _G.
cingulata_ has also been reported from other countries in the region
as the cause of twig dieback, brown blight of ripening cherries and
leaf necrosis diseases of coffee.

Anthracnose diseases can affect a wide range of crops and symptom
development is usually favoured by humid conditions. On woody species,
the fungi generally have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead
twigs and fallen leaves which are often the main sources of inoculum
for such crops. Spread may occur with infected plant material, by
mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and water
splash. Disease managemen requires diligent fungicide programmes, but
may also include phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and cultural
measures to reduce moisture in plantings. Coffee cultivars with
resistance to the different anthracnose fungi identified in the region
need to be developed.
