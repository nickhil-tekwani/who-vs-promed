In the past 5 months, 22 276 people have been found to be infected with the
chikungunya virus, according to the Public Health Ministry. Public health
minister Witthaya Kaewparadai, who opened a campaign to combat the virus in
the southern province of Phatthalung, said the rapid spread of the virus
from the lower south to the upper south between January and May [2009] was
alarming. Infected people had been found in 28 provinces, he said. None of
them had died from the disease.

Songkhla has the most infections, with 9078 people being treated, followed
by Narathiwat, with 7011 and Pattani, with 2942.

The disease causes joint pain and a high fever.

march up the peninsula and is now increasingly active in southern Thailand,
with sporadic cases reported from the north.
