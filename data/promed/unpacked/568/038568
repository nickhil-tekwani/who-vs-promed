----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for posting my comment on the recent ProMED item. I agree with your further comments. One point to remember, however, is that research, particularly research on wildlife health, in the Arctic has increased only relatively recently so some 'emerging' diseases may have been there all along, perhaps for many hundreds of years. I do agree that as climate warms new diseases may appear but the idea that the 'pristine cold Arctic environment' has been disease-free in the past is a false premise without historical data.
