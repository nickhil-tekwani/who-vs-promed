A couple of comments about the article that is the source of this post:
-------------
First, Dennis Graves, the animal control supervisor for the county,
is quoted as saying the dog that was potentially exposed to rabies
had been quarantined for 10 days. This is not only contrary to
recommendations, it is useless. The incubation period for rabies in
dogs is usually 3-8 weeks, so a just-exposed dog will not develop
clinical signs within 10 days. The 10-day quarantine applies only to
domestic animals that have bitten a human; the rationale is that if
they haven't developed signs of rabies (or died) within 10 days, they
won't have been shedding virus at the time the bite occurred.
The second is regarding Roland Davis's being quoted as saying that if
pets have been vaccinated, "you should be fine." Again, the
recommendations suggest that is not necessarily so. If a dog, cat, or
ferret that is current on its rabies vaccinations is exposed to a
rabid animal (or a wild animal that cannot be caught and tested), it
should be revaccinated immediately and watched for 45 days for signs
of rabies.
Excerpted below are the pertinent paragraphs from the Compendium of
Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, 2002, put together by the
National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc.
(NASPHV) and posted on CDC's website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/Professional/publications/compendium/comp_02.htm>
"Part III: Rabies Control
B. CONTROL METHODS IN DOMESTIC AND CONFINED ANIMALS
5. POSTEXPOSURE MANAGEMENT
ANY ANIMAL POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO RABIES VIRUS (See Part III.A.1.
Rabies Exposure) BY A WILD, CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL OR A BAT THAT IS NOT
AVAILABLE FOR TESTING SHOULD BE REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN EXPOSED TO
RABIES.
(a) DOGS, CATS, AND FERRETS
Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should
be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to have this
done, the animal should be placed in strict isolation for 6 months
and vaccinated 1 month before being released. Animals with expired
vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Dogs,
cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should be
revaccinated immediately, kept under the owner's control, and
observed for 45 days."
6. MANAGEMENT OF ANIMALS THAT BITE HUMANS
(a) A healthy dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person should be
confined and observed daily for 10 days; administration of rabies
vaccine is not recommended during the observation period. Such
animals should be evaluated by a veterinarian at the first sign of
illness during confinement. Any illness in the animal should be
reported immediately to the local health department. If signs
suggestive of rabies develop, the animal should be euthanized and the
head shipped for testing as described in (c) below. Any stray or
unwanted dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person may be euthanized
immediately and the head submitted for rabies examination."
I would also like to point out a couple of relevant papers:
Wilson PJ, Clark KA. 2001. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis protocol
for domestic animals and epidemiologic characteristics of rabies
vaccination failures in Texas: 1995-1999. J Am Vet Med Assoc
218(4):522-5.
Clark KA, Wilson PJ. 1996. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis and
preexposure rabies vaccination failure in domestic animals. J Am Vet
Med Assoc 208(11):1827-30.
These publications point out that rabies vaccination may, in rare
instances, fail to protect. Nevertheless, the reason we have so
little rabies in domestic animals in this country is the widespread
use of vaccine. It seems to me that the advisability of immediate
revaccination for any exposed, vaccinated pet needs to be stressed to
the public during this epizootic.
