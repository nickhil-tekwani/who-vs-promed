Blue Ridge Beef of Eatonton, GA is recalling one lot of its frozen "Kitten Grind" raw pet food after consumer complaints, including reports of the deaths of 2 kittens. One of the kittens was confirmed to have died from Salmonella septicemia.

The recall falls on the heels of the Food and Drug Administration's investigation into the pet deaths, according to the recall notice on the agency's website.

Septicemia is an infection of the blood stream, also referred to as bacteremia or blood poisoning. Lab tests conducted by FDA on samples of the raw meat kitten food found both _Salmonella_ sp. and _Listeria monocytogenes_ in the product.

Consumers can identify the recalled 2-pound tubes of frozen Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind by looking for "Lot #GA1102" and a manufacture date of 2 Nov 2017.

The lot number is stamped on the clips at each end of the tubes, also referred to as chubs.

Blue Ridge Beef distributed the implicated lot in Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and North Carolina.

The manufacturer urges consumers to check pet food in their homes for the affected lot number and to stop feeding the recalled product of Kitten Grind to their pets. The product should be disposed of safely or returned to the place of purchase for a full refund.

Consumers with questions can contact Blue Ridge Beef by email at <blueridgebeefga@yahoo.com>.

The FDA encourages anyone with concerns or complaints about the safety of specific pet foods to file a report. Details are available at https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ReportaProblem/ucm182403.htm.

[How very sad for the owners regarding the loss of their pets. However, there have been reports of _Salmonella_ affecting felines in the past. One article from a home mixed raw meat diet can be found at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736718.

This pet food was not included in the list of pet food recalls which were in ProMED-mail post Salmonella, pet food - USA: recall 20180215.5630733.

"Salmonella is a group of gram-negative bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Salmonella is mainly an intestinal pathogen, but can also cause systemic disease and can then be isolated from blood and various organs.

Cats can become infected if contaminated raw material in the feed is inadequately heated.

Some small birds are infected with salmonella and when large numbers of small birds in late winter and early spring gather around bird tables they may facilitate the spread of infection. Birds suffering from malnutrition after a long winter may die from the infection. Live or dead birds, such as passerines, and bird faeces may be a source of infection both for cats and dogs.

The severity of clinical symptoms of salmonella infection in cats varies. Asymptomatic infection is common, as are mild clinical symptoms such as minor rise in temperature and inappetence.

In more severe cases, high fever (often above 40 C, 104 F), inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain can be seen. Diarrhea can range from mild to watery or mucous to very severe and blood streaked. Affected cats may rapidly become dehydrated, and in severe cases life-threatening septicemia and endotoxemia may develop. In rare cases the infection may spread to different organs. With or without concurrent or previous gastrointestinal symptoms, even symptoms such as pneumonia, meningitis and abortion may be seen, depending on which organs are affected.

Cats usually recover spontaneously from uncomplicated acute diarrhea caused by salmonella. Cats that suffer a more serious gastroenteritis may need supportive care, including fluid therapy. Antibiotic therapy may be required in serious cases, but some reports indicate it may prolong the shedding of the organism in the feces.

If there are several pets in the household, be extra careful with hygiene as long as there is an infected cat in the household. This applies even if the other animals do not show symptoms."
