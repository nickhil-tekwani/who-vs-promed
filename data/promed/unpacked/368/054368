Vaccination-associated Deaths in Brazil Attributed to Innate Susceptibility
-------------------------------------------------
[The following is the Abstract of a paper recently published in the journal
Virology, which effectively draws a line under the debate concerning the
safety of the 17D vaccine by demonstrating its remarkable genetic stability.
The paper is entitled "Phenotypic and Molecular Analyses of Yellow Fever
17DD Vaccine Viruses Associated with Serious Adverse Events in Brazil". The
authors of the paper are: R. Galler, K. V. Pugachev, C. L. S. Santos, S. W.
Ocran, A. V. Jabor, S. G. Rodrigues, R. S. Marchevsky, M. S. Freire, L. F.
C. Almeida, A. C. R. Cruz, A. M. Y. Yamamura, I. M. Rocco, E. S. Travassos

The yellow fever (YF) 17D virus is one of the most successful vaccines
developed to date. Its use has been estimated to be over 400 million doses
with an excellent record of safety. In the past 3 years, yellow fever
vaccination was intensified in Brazil in response to higher risk of urban
outbreaks of the disease. Two fatal adverse events temporally associated
with YF vaccination were reported. Both cases had features similar to yellow
fever disease, including hepatitis and multi-organ failure.
Two different lots of YF 17DD virus vaccine were administered to the
affected patients and also to hundreds of thousands of other individuals
without any other reported serious adverse events. The lots were prepared
from the secondary seed, which has been in continuous use since 1984.
Nucleotide sequencing revealed minor variations at some nucleotide positions
between the secondary seed lot virus and the virus isolates from patients;
these differences were not consistent across the isolates, represented
differences in the relative amount of each nucleotide in a heterogeneous
position, and did not result in amino acid substitutions.
Inoculation of rhesus monkeys with the viruses isolated from the 2 patients
by the intracerebral (ic) or intrahepatic (ih) route caused minimal viremia
and no clinical signs of infection or alterations in laboratory markers.
Central nervous system histological scores of rhesus monkeys inoculated ic
were within the expected range, and there were no histopathological lesions
in animals inoculated ih.
Altogether, these results demonstrated the genetic stability and attenuated
phenotype of the viruses that caused fatal illness in the 2 patients.
Therefore, the fatal adverse events experienced by the vaccinees are related
to individual, genetically determined host factors that regulate cellular
susceptibility to yellow fever virus. Such increased susceptibility,
resulting in clinically overt disease expression, appears to be extremely
rare.
