The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in an 80 month old dairy cow from Alberta. No part of
the animal's carcass entered the human food or animal feed systems.

The animal's birth farm has been identified, and an investigation is under
way. The age and location of the infected animal are consistent with
previous cases detected in Canada.

This case was detected through the national BSE surveillance program, which
continues to play an important role in Canada's strategy to manage BSE.

Canada remains a Controlled Risk country for BSE, as recognized by the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Accordingly, this case should
not affect exports of Canadian cattle or beef.

For information, contact Canadian Food Inspection Agency Media relations at
613-773-6600.

[The press release is slightly unclear. It says the age and location of the
infected animal are consistent with previous cases detected in Canada. What
is consistent? What is the location?

This animal was born after the ban (BAB) on ruminant products being fed to
ruminants, so it is unclear just what is consistent. If the epidemiology
points to spontaneous cases in a certain location, then more work is needed
to understand why they are occurring. - Mod.TG]
