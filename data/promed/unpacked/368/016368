COVID-19 is spiking in multiple federal prisons around the country, spurred by the omicron variant and still-substandard infection control, advocates say that the BOP's COVID-19 protocols are as broken as ever.

"They've continued with business as usual as a mass death event has unfolded under their watch," said Joshua Manson, the communications manager for the UCLA Law COVID Behind Bars Data Project, which tracks COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons. "It's been a catastrophe."

Nearly 3000 incarcerated people have died of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, including roughly 300 in federal custody. People in prison are roughly 3 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than the general population, after adjusting for the fact that the prison population skews younger.

Biden made reversing that trend part of his pandemic strategy -- and a pillar of his larger goal of prioritizing equity throughout his COVID-19 response. But interviews with leading prison advocates, independent legal and medical experts, a former federal prisoner, and a U.S. senator reveal persistent and fundamental issues with the BOP's approach toward COVID-19. That includes poor infection control in prisons; inaccurate, opaque data on how many incarcerated people are infected and have died of COVID-19; a substandard vaccine rollout; and almost no public information on how the BOP is prioritizing booster shots for its population.

"They have a long runway to meeting the goals they set out for themselves with respect to health equity, racial equity, and civil and human rights more broadly," said Sakira Cook, senior program director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of over 200 civil rights organizations.

They're on the path, she said, but they have "miles to go." ...

Biden does not have unilateral power to fix the disparities in the entire prison system because many facilities are run by state authorities, not to mention that roughly 3000 jails are typically run by local agencies, like counties. But he does have the authority to make changes at federal prisons run by the BOP.

The prison system's struggles to address the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are well-documented, and they often mirrored struggles outside the prison walls, like poor access to COVID-19 tests. But the rapid deterioration in several prison systems over the last few weeks suggest that many aspects of the BOP's COVID response remain broken 2 years after the pandemic began.

During the week of [17 Jan 2022], 7 BOP prisons had triple-digit increases in new COVID-19 cases, including 216 new cases at FCI Berlin in Berlin, N.H., which houses only roughly 750 people, according to data compiled by Guernsey and her research assistant. As many as 4 facilities had similar triple-digit spikes the following week, including 321 new cases in 4 days at FCI Oakdale I, a men's prison in Louisiana that houses roughly 900 people.

Legal experts have complained that it has been difficult to track the number of deaths from COVID-19 in prisons. The BOP has been slow to update the publicly available tally of deaths occurring in its facilities -- some deaths have taken a year or more to be reported -- and it does not count people who were dying of COVID-19 in prison and then released, shortly before their death, to die at home.

The DOJ spokesperson argued that the BOP updates its death counts as quickly as possible after a medical examiner conducts an autopsy and the family of the deceased is notified. They confirmed, however, that the BOP "does not track changes in medical status or potential death rates for anyone who is no longer in BOP's custody."

The BOP does also report daily infection tallies for each of its facilities, but experts say those counts likely miss a large number of infections. They note, for example, that the BOP does not report granular enough testing data to calculate so-called test positivity rates, a measure often used in public health to estimate what percentage of a population likely has COVID-19, given not every person in a community is typically tested at one time.

A DOJ spokesperson told STAT that 93 501 federal inmates -- 69.4% of the federal prison population -- are fully vaccinated, which they noted "is a higher percentage than in the US population as a whole, which has a vaccination rate of 63.5%."

Medical experts have complained, however, that the BOP's vaccination efforts are likely leaving behind the most vulnerable people in prison. That's because the BOP has not undertaken the type of educational efforts that they say are needed to convince people who have questions about the vaccine because of concurrent medical issues or distrust of the correctional system.

The situation is even worse in immigration facilities. On [Mon 1 Feb 2022], the ACLU filed a lawsuit against ICE on behalf of several people at high risk of COVID-19 complications who are being held in immigration detention and are not able to access boosters. Less than 700 of the 21 000 people detained in ICE facilities have been boosted, according to the lawsuit.

The CDC currently recommends boosters for everyone 12 years and older, at least several months after they complete their initial vaccination series.

There have been some other modest improvements in the BOP's management of COVID-19 since Biden took over the White House.

The CDC, for example, launched a new testing program in December [2021] that will offer no-cost PCR testing to congregate settings like prisons. The Biden administration also announced in late December [2021] that it would not require people that were released to home confinement in response to COVID to return to prison at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Death rates have also seemed to flatten as vaccines were rolled out, though experts say it's impossible to say so definitively because of the BOP's sporadic reporting of COVID-19 deaths. Of the 281 people Guernsey's team identified by name as having died of COVID-19, roughly 66% died in 2020 and 30% died in 2021. A total of 9 incarcerated people have died thus far in January [2022], according to publicly available data.

"There's some progress but it's been very slow, and very halting, and very ad hoc," said Corene Kendrick, deputy director of the ACLU National Prison Project.

A. Imaging shows post-vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 less severe
---------------------------------------------------------------
A study yesterday in Radiology used imaging to determine that breakthrough infections are less severe when a patient is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with patients who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. The study was based on images collected from the COVID-19 Korean Imaging Cohort for COVID-19 (KICC-19) from [June to August 2021] of 761 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 47 patients (6.2%) were fully vaccinated (breakthrough infection), 127 were partially vaccinated (17%), and 587 (77%) were unvaccinated.

Initial chest x-rays showed no pneumonia in 75% of fully vaccinated patients with breakthrough infection, compared with 63% of unvaccinated patients. Computed tomography chest scans showed differing levels of severity based on vaccination status. The proportion of scans without pneumonia was 22% (71/326) in unvaccinated patients, 30% (19/64) in partially vaccinated patients, and 59% (13/22) in fully vaccinated patients.

"Mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death occurred only in the unvaccinated group," said senior study author Yeon Joo Jeong, MD, PhD, from the department of radiology and biomedical research institute at Pusan National University Hospital in Busan, South Korea, in a press release. "After adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, analysis showed that fully vaccinated patients were at significantly lower risk of requiring supplemental oxygen and of [intensive care unit] admission than unvaccinated patients."

B. High BMI more strongly connected with COVID death in racial minorities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Body mass index (BMI) was more strongly associated with COVID-19-related death in racial minorities than among White patients, according to a study today in Nature Communications.

A team led by the University of Leicester in England examined the electronic health records and census and death data of 12.6 million adults older than 40 years who had a recorded BMI from [January to December 2020].

Of 33 951 deaths, 0.29% each were of patients of Black or South Asian race, 0.27% were White, and 0.18% were of other races. BMI was tied to COVID-19 death in all races, but compared with White patients, the association was stronger in Black, South Asian, and other races (P < 0.001 for interaction).

For instance, at a BMI of 40 kg/m2 (obese), hazard ratios (HRs) for death among White, Black, South Asian, and other races were 1.73, 3.01, 5.25, and 3.89, respectively, relative to a BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 (healthy weight) in White patients.

At a low BMI of 20 kg/m2, the risk of COVID-19 death was similar in Black (HR, 0.95) and other minority patients (HR, 1.13), compared with White patients, and South Asian patients were at slightly higher risk (HR, 1.21). At a BMI of 40 kg/m2, the risk of COVID-19 death in Black, South Asian, and other minority groups relative to White patients widened to 1.74, 3.05, and 2.25, respectively.

The associations between race, obesity, and COVID-19 hospitalizations was similar to those of death, with 1.13% of Black and South Asians, 0.84% of other minority groups, and 0.76% of White patients needing hospital care.

The authors said that obesity may worsen COVID-19 outcomes by triggering a change in the role of inflammatory mediators produced by fat tissue, which leads to a pro-inflammatory state, predisposition to blood clots, exaggerated immune responses, and limited antibody responses.

In a University of Leicester press release, coauthor Kamlesh Khunti, MD, PhD, said the study "gives insights that will allow healthcare professionals and policy makers to put measures in place and create tailored plans to protect people from ethnic minority groups who are overweight or obese and thus try to reduce mortality."

[3] Opinion: detection of new variants
Date: Wed 2 Feb 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/opinion/covid-variant-air-sewage.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytopinion


When scientists in South Africa noticed an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the Gauteng Province last November [2021], they began investigating the source. These researchers and others in Botswana quickly discovered the omicron variant and heroically shared their discovery with the rest of the world. And yet it was still too late -- omicron was already rapidly infecting people across the globe.

The question for a world enduring the variant's astonishing surge is how we can discover the next one early enough to stop its spread. Currently, the hunt for coronavirus variants is too slow and sporadic. Scientists in a handful of countries -- South Africa, Botswana, the United States and others -- monitor patterns in case counts and regularly sequence samples of the virus from infected people to see whether there are notable genetic changes. The results of these analyses can be shared within a global network, such as GISAID, an international community of scientists who openly share data on disease variants, to compare coronavirus sequences from around the world.

By the time this happens, variants are often already spreading in a community and most likely beyond it. This analysis process is like testing every piece of hay in a stack to see whether it's a needle -- or, really, the equivalent of choosing and testing just 1% of the haystack.

But there are places to look that may help scientists find new variants even faster: sewage and the air. People can shed the coronavirus in their feces and their exhaled breath. As a result, the virus can be spotted before people have been tested or developed symptoms.

Wastewater monitoring has been used throughout the omicron surge by scientists in New York City, Boston and elsewhere. They have been able to identify impending surges of cases in certain neighborhoods even before a variant has been identified from test swabs. The opposite is also true: In Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., for example, officials who witnessed a drop in the amount of virus in wastewater were able to predict that omicron's peak had passed.

Far less attention has been paid to testing air samples, at least until recently. Chinese officials have developed a detection system they will reportedly use to collect and test air samples from venues at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. In the United States, a partnership between the city of Davis, Calif., and the University of California at Davis is monitoring air filters in elementary schools for the virus.

So far scientists have mostly used environmental samples like these to track trends in coronavirus concentrations and identify hot spots for response. But these samples can also provide a window into the dynamics of a concerning new variant in the broader community, quicker and more accurately than any sample from a single person. A virus sample from a nasal or saliva swab offers information on one person; a single wastewater or air sample offers information on many people, and in the case of the former, up to thousands of people. Leaning more heavily on these methods could provide the world additional time to respond before variants become widespread.

Still, some practical challenges remain. Environmental samples can contain a lot of background noise, including myriad other viruses, bacteria and fungi found in human waste. Determining what's important and what isn't can be tough. Coordination is another issue; the world needs to develop a consensus on how to analyze environmental sequences and create a hub that, as GISAID does for clinical sequencing, enables near-real-time information sharing and insights across countries.

As these initiatives are pursued and funded, it's also important that the public be made aware of how environmental testing and sequencing works in order to avoid some of the misinformation and misunderstandings that have affected other tools like vaccines. Organizers must make clear that environmental samples are anonymous: they do not confirm who shed the virus, only that the coronavirus is in a community.

Testing and sequencing virus samples found in sewage or the air is not a singular solution; it is best used alongside other data sources to construct a broader, more holistic view of a pathogen's spread across a community and around the world. But because it is the quickest way to detect variants, it can help leaders prepare for and potentially prevent the next coronavirus surge, and hopefully, the next pandemic.

[Environmental testing through waste water and air is an excellent approach to detection on a population-based scale rather than individual testing. To be useful, it must be real-time, but both waste water and air samples have been used for testing in the past, thus it should not be difficult to develop for detection of variants of SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK]

[4] BA.2
Date: Mon 31 Jan 2022
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/sudden-rise-more-transmissible-form-omicron-catches-scientists-surprise


On [7 Dec 2021], as the omicron variant of the pandemic coronavirus began to pummel the world, scientists officially identified a related strain. BA.2 differed by about 40 mutations from the original omicron lineage, BA.1, but it was causing so few cases of COVID-19 that it seemed a sideshow to its rampaging counterpart.

"I was thinking: 'BA.1 has the upper hand. We'll never hear again from BA.2,'" recalls Mark Zeller, a genomic epidemiologist at the Scripps Research Institute. Eight weeks later, he says, "Clearly that's not the case. ... I'm pretty sure [BA.2] is going to be everywhere in the world, that it's going to sweep and will be the dominant variant soon in most countries if not all."

Zeller and other scientists are now trying to make sense of why BA.2 is exploding and what its emergence means for the omicron surge and the pandemic overall. Already a U.K. report issued last week [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings] and a large household study from Denmark posted this week as a preprint [Frederik Plesner Lyngse , Carsten Thure Kirkeby, Matthew Denwood, et al. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC subvariants BA.1 and BA.2: Evidence from Danish Households. medRxiv 2022.01.28.22270044; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.28.22270044] make it clear BA.2 is inherently more transmissible than BA.1, leaving scientists to wonder which of its distinct mutations confer an advantage.

But so far, BA.2 does not appear to be making people sicker than BA.1, which itself poses less risk of severe disease than variants such as delta and beta. In Denmark, where by 21 Jan BA.2 accounted for 65% of new COVID-19 cases, "We see a continuous, steep decline in the number of intensive care unit patients and ... now a decrease in the number of hospital admissions related to SARS-CoV-2," says Tyra Grove Krause, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the country's public health agency. In fact, the Danish government is so confident the variant won't cause major upheaval that it lifted almost all pandemic restrictions on [1 Feb 2022].

Still, some scientists predict BA.2 will extend omicron's impact. "I would guess we'll see [BA.2] create a substantially longer tail of circulation of omicron than would have existed with just [BA.1], but that it won't drive the scale of epidemics we've experienced with omicron in January [2022]," computational biologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center tweeted on [28 Jan 2022]. In South Africa, BA.2 already may be stalling the rapid decline in new infections seen after the country's omicron wave peaked in December [2021].

Although BA.2 represented less than 4% of all omicron sequences in the leading global virus database as of [30 Jan 2022], it has been identified in 57 countries, with the earliest documented case dating to [17 Nov 2021] in South Africa. It likely now dominates in India, according to Bijaya Dhakal, a molecular biologist at the Sonic Reference Laboratory in Austin, Texas, who examined sequence data uploaded from 8 large Indian states. In the United Kingdom, the proportion of likely BA.2 cases doubled from 2.2% to 4.4% in the 7 days that ended on [24 Jan 2022].

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not yet tracking BA.2 separately. But Bedford estimates it accounted for 7% of new U.S. cases as of [30 Jan 2022], up from 0.7% on [19 Jan 2022]. "In each country and across time, we see that the epidemic growth rate of omicron BA.2 is greater than omicron BA.1," he says.

The report last week from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) backs up that assessment in England, finding BA.2 was spreading faster than BA.1 in all regions where enough data were available to make an assessment. UKHSA data also show that in late December [2021] and early January [2022], transmission was higher among household contacts of BA.2 cases, at 13.4%, than in contacts of other omicron cases (10.3%).

The study from Denmark, which sequences the virus from virtually every person who gets COVID-19, paints a more dramatic picture. In households where the first case was BA.1, on average 29% of other people in the household became infected. When the first case was BA.2, 39% of household members were infected.

Omicron was already known to have mutations that help it evade antibodies, but the Danish researchers also found that BA.2 may be even better at dodging vaccine-induced immunity: vaccinated and boosted people were 3 times as susceptible to being infected with BA.2 as with BA.1. Vaccinated but unboosted people were about 2.5 times as susceptible, and unvaccinated people 2.2 times as susceptible. Early U.K. data [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050721/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-4.pdf], however, showed vaccinated people, if boosted, had about the same level of protection against symptomatic infections with BA.1 or BA.2--63% and 70%, respectively.

In one hopeful and unexpected finding from Denmark, those who were vaccinated or vaccinated and boosted passed on BA.2 to household members less often, relative to BA.1. The same didn't hold for unvaccinated people, who passed BA.2 to their household contacts at 2.6 times the rate they passed BA.1.

Much as scientists a few weeks ago wondered whether a previous infection with delta or another variant would protect people from omicron overall, some are now looking for data on whether omicron's first surge created a shield against BA.2. "To what extent does a BA.1 infection protect you against reinfection with BA.2?" Zeller asks. "From what I have seen in Denmark, it's not going to be 100%."

Scientists are also probing the variant's ability to dodge vaccine-induced antibodies in lab dish studies. And drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline is testing its monoclonal antibody, sotrovimab, made with Vir Biotechnology, against BA.2 in lab studies. It's the only widely authorized antibody that still thwarts BA.1.

Scientists note BA.1 and BA.2 are about as far apart on the evolutionary tree as earlier variants of concern--alpha, beta, and gamma--are from each other (see graphic, below). Some even think BA.2 shouldn't even be considered omicron. "I hope in the near future that BA.2 gets its own variant of concern [label] because people assume it's very similar which it's not," Zeller says.

BA.2 doesn't have all of the mutations that help BA.1 avoid immune detection, but it has some its sibling doesn't. Thomas Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, notes that most of the differences are in an area of the spike protein, called the N-terminal domain (NTD), that houses antibody targets. "What we don't know is: Just because there are changes, are they changes that actually do something?" says Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern.

But one NTD difference--a deletion at amino acids 69 and 70 that is present in BA.1 and not in BA.2--could give researchers a tool for monitoring the spread of the up-and-coming omicron strain. Certain SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests detect three genetic sequences of the virus, but the mutation in BA.1's NTD gene eliminates one of those targets. Polymerase chain reaction tests pick up all 3 targets in BA.2, providing a proxy for distinguishing the omicron strains if there is no full virus sequence.

How the sibling strains were born is also preoccupying scientists. Viral evolution in a single immunocompromised patient is one theory, says Andrew ¬Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh. "It's possible that long-term infection could produce quite a lot of diversity within a single individual. It could be compartmentalized. So different variants living in different parts of the body." Both omicron strains could have also evolved in animals infected with human-adapted SARS-CoV-2, then spread back into people.

Why BA.2 is emerging only now is one more mystery, Hodcroft says. She speculates that a factor as simple as which omicron caught an earlier flight out of South Africa, where both strains were first identified, may be the explanation. "BA.2 may have just been trapped for a little bit longer. But when it did finally get out and start spreading it started to show that it can edge out its big sister."

[In the past 24 hours, 47 countries including the USA (366 088), France (315 363), Germany (223 322), Brazil (188 552), The Netherlands (172 713), India (164 593), Russia (141 883), Italy (119 323), Turkey (110 682), Japan (93 388), The UK (86 854), Spain (86 222), Czech Republic (57 378), Poland (56 051), Portugal (54 693), Denmark (52 009), Argentina (45 070), Mexico (42 181), Switzerland (40 906), Sweden (39 205), Australia (25 436), Peru (23 986), Iran (38 160), Romania (35 802), Ukraine (35 014), Greece (26 320), Austria (39 410), Chile (30 715), Georgia (24 201), Israel (23 877), Slovenia (23 332), Norway (23 299), South Korea (22 904), Slovakia (20 224), Hungary (19 690), Canada (18 521), Indonesia (17 895), Jordan (17 893), Serbia (17 851), Columbia (15 110), Lithuania (12 916), Bangladesh (12 193), Costa Rica (12 385), Lebanon (10 760), Uruguay (10 618), Latvia (10 610), and Croatia (10 003), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 13 405 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 1 Feb 2022 to late 2 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 89 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 7.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 17.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 4.2% increase in daily reported cases and a 28.03% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3.23 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 385.30 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.71 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
