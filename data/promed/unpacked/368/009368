MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION (GROUP C) - FLORIDA, USA (7)
====================================================
The time-space clustering of the cases isn't clear, but you might
consider molecular subtyping of the group C isolates to see if they are
clonal. I'm sure that there are a variety of available subtyping
systems, but a few years ago CDC's Bacterial Special Pathogens
laboratory was having success with multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.
