--------------------------------------------------------------------
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has since spread throughout the world.

One measure of viral spread is the R0, the expected number of secondary infectious cases produced by a primary infectious case. This calculation is used to determine the potential for epidemic spread in a susceptible population. The effective reproduction number, Rt, determines the potential for epidemic spread at a specific time t under the control measures in place (figure 1). To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions, the Rt should be quantified in different settings, ideally at regular and frequent intervals (for example, weekly).

In an article published in JAMA, Pan and colleagues (1) evaluated the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods, according to key events and interventions, including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.

In their study, Pan et al (1) determined the Rt as an indicator to measure the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after the interventions. In a figure in their article, the authors show the extraordinary change in the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with reducing social interaction (Figure 2). In early through mid-January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan had an Rt of 3 to 4. In other words, each case spread to an average of 3 to 4 others. That is a striking number: compare it to the Rt of 1.4 to 1.7 for influenza, which is a disease that spreads widely around the world every year. Couple that with the fact that each new generation of SARS-CoV-2 cases occurs every 5 days, and it is clear to see how this epidemic was spreading out of control.

On [23 Jan 2020], a series of major actions were taken by the Chinese government, including a city lockdown and home and centralized quarantines. Some of the measures put in place in Wuhan would not be deemed either societally acceptable or practically feasible in many parts of the world; for example, complete control of movement for months or compulsory isolation in facilities. Other measures put in place at that time (not shown in this figure but widely reported elsewhere) included business closures, school closures, and cancellation of gatherings, which also contributed to substantially lowering social interaction. Those measures have become the core of social distancing interventions taken around the world to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

When all those measures were taken collectively in Wuhan, the Rt of the epidemic declined to below 1 within weeks. When an Rt decreases below 1 for a given disease in a given place, disease spread slows and the epidemic has the potential to be controlled in that area.

Figure 2 illustrates what the goal must be now around the world. Until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and globally disseminated, countries need to use some combination of social distancing measures to work to bring their Rt below 1.

Hopefully, countries will find strategies to implement social distancing in ways that allow economies to come back and society to resume some normalcy. Given the severe economic and societal consequences of these strategies, continued efforts should be made to study the need for and effectiveness of social distancing measures as they are put in place and relaxed in the time ahead. Beyond the larger measures of business and school closures and cancellation of gatherings, individual actions to keep physical distances of at least 6 feet, wear cloth masks in public, and telecommute to work will help reduce the Rt. Absent any social distancing at all, SARS-CoV-2 would likely revert to its pattern of spread as it was back in early January, with an Rt in the 2 to 4 range and doubling in size every 5 days, until a substantial portion of the population develops immunity through infection and recovery, or through vaccination.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should regularly report on the Rt for the US and for each of the 50 states so that political and public health leaders can gauge how well the combined organizational and individual social distancing measures in place around the country are working to diminish transmission of this virus. The CDC should then communicate this transparently to the public to increase public buy-in and understanding of the actions being taken to slow the spread of COVID-19.

[2] Prisons and COVID-19

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prisons are a hotspot for COVID-19. In theory, prisoners have the same right to health as anyone else, but the reality is very different.

We will probably never know the extent to which coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has penetrated the world's prisons and detention centres. Testing capacity and the supply of personal protective equipment are already constrained, and inmates are rarely a priority. Nonetheless, at least one prison has done mass testing. The Marion Correctional Institution in Ohio, USA, holds around 2500 detainees. As The Lancet went to press, more than 2000 of them had tested positive for COVID-19.

According to the New York City Board of Correction, there are currently 378 cases of COVID-19 among inmates in the city jails, equating to an infection rate of around 10%. But this does not include those who contracted the virus in custody and have since been released or transferred, or have died. Hundreds of cases have been registered among prison and jail employees, who can obtain testing far more easily than prisoners, including almost 1000 in New York City alone.

"The prisons and jails in the USA that have reported high rates of the coronavirus are the ones who are doing the testing", points out David Patton, executive director and attorney-in-chief of the Federal Defenders of New York. "It is hard to imagine that the virus is not already rampant throughout the US penal system." Around 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in the USA; no other country imprisons as many people.

In the UK, COVID-19 has been detected in the majority of prisons, and at least 15 prisoners and 4 members of staff have died after being infected. For much of the rest of the world, statistics on infection rates and mortality in prisons are hard to come by, but the danger that COVID-19 poses to such institutions can be discerned from another set of statistics.

The global prison population is estimated at 11 million. At least 124 prisons worldwide exceed their maximum occupancy rates. The Philippines has imprisoned 215 000 people in a system designed for no more than 40 000. As many as 92 000 inmates are thought to be scattered across Myanmar's 100 or so prisons and labour camps, served by a medical staff that is estimated to consist of 30 doctors and 80 nurses. A quarter of inmates in Canada are over the age of 50 years. The UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, reckons that around 1800 prisoners in the UK would be especially susceptible to severe disease were they to contract COVID-19.

The situation in Latin America is particularly worrying. Haiti's prisons are running at 450% occupancy. As many as 773 151 people are imprisoned in Brazil, in a system built to hold 461 026 people. "Conditions in the prisons in South America are ripe for coronavirus to spread", said Tamara Taraciuk Broner of Human Rights Watch (Buenos Aires, Argentina). "These places are typically very unsanitary and overcrowded and inmates do not always have access to running water." In such circumstances, regular handwashing and social distancing are impossible to achieve.

"Prisoners share toilets, bathrooms, sinks, and dining halls. They are mostly sleeping in bunk beds; in some countries they sleep crammed together on the floor", explains Frederick Altice of the Yale School of Medicine (New Haven, CT, USA). "These settings are in no way equipped to deal with an outbreak once it gets in." If an institution is already operating at far beyond its capacity, it is going to be very difficult to find areas where prisoners with suspected COVID-19 can be isolated. "If a prisoner knows he is going to be put in solitary confinement if he admits to being sick, which is usually a punishment, then there is a heavy disincentive to seek medical attention", adds Patton.

Prisoners tend to be in worse health than the wider population. "80-90% of people charged with a crime in the USA are too poor to afford legal counsel", notes Patton. "They have high rates of asthma, diabetes, and smoking". Prison itself is hardly a healthy environment. A lot of time is spent sitting around, and the food is typically poor quality. And, in some places, even poor-quality food is in short supply.

The occupancy rate for prisons in DR Congo is estimated at 432% of capacity, but food is budgeted on official capacity. That means a maximum of one meal a day. According to the UN peacekeeping mission in DR Congo, at least 60 people died from hunger at Kinshasa's central prison during the first 2 months of 2020. In Niger, those in pretrial detention, a cohort that makes up over half the prison population, are not provided with any food at all. If you cannot rely on family or friends to bring in supplies, you are in serious trouble.

International norms stipulate that prisoners should receive the same standard of health care as the wider community. The reality is very different. "First of all, if you are a prisoner, you cannot just choose to visit the emergency room; you have to go through the officers and that can be a huge obstacle", said Altice. "Almost no prisons have real hospitals within their walls, and the ratio of clinical staff to prisoners is extremely low; there is no true equivalence of care".

Sending prisoners for external medical care means seconding officers and transport. Prison administrators can be reluctant to expend such time and resources on a single inmate. "There is both a lack of ability to deal with health issues in-house, because of chronic understaffing, and disincentives to seek outside attention", said Patton. "It means that prisoners have to be in a very bad state before they get the treatment they need."

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has encouraged governments to release inmates who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, such as older people, as well as low-risk offenders. "Imprisonment should be a measure of last resort, particularly during this crisis", she noted, in a statement on [25 Mar 2020]. Experts believe that there is plenty of scope for prisoner releases. In at least 46 countries worldwide, the majority of prisoners have not been convicted of any crime. Rates of pretrial detention are high. A third of Brazil's sizeable prison population, for example, are in pretrial detention. More than one in 6 prisoners around the world are serving time for possession of drugs for personal use.

"Deincarceration has to be the foremost strategy here", said Altice. "Several countries, including the USA, have extraordinarily high levels of incarceration. It will certainly be possible to release prisoners and maintain public safety." He advocates diverting drug offenders to evidence-based treatment programmes. "You can take a lot of people out of the system by doing that, and these are people who are at increased risk of comorbidities such as HIV and hepatitis C, so there is an immediate public health benefit", said Altice.

Several countries have taken action. Iran announced the release of 85 000 prisoners in March [2020]. France and Italy have reduced their prison populations by 10 000 and 6000, respectively. Chile has let out 1300 low-risk offenders, and states across the USA are releasing varying numbers of prisoners. "There is absolutely no doubt that this crisis calls for reducing overcrowding and finding alternatives to prison for people in particular categories, definitely those in pretrial detention for non-violent offences", Broner told The Lancet. She gave the example of semiopen facilities in Brazil, where prisoners spend the day outside the institution and return in the evening. "That is a huge risk for transmission of COVID-19; it would be better to allow these prisoners to just remain outside", she said.

UK prisons are running at 107% capacity, which is modest by international standards. The government has pledged to release 4000 prisoners to alleviate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, the Prison Governors Association reckons that 15 000 inmates, representing almost a 5th of the prison population, would have to be let out if prisoners were to not share cells. Making a meaningful difference to overcrowding in prison systems elsewhere will require far larger measures. Whether governments are willing to release prisoners in the numbers necessary to truly cut the risk of COVID-19 from tearing through prisons remains to seen.

[3] Recovered patients who tested positive for COVID-19 likely not reinfected
Date: Thu 30 Apr 2020
Source: Live Science [edited]
https://bit.ly/3fjZ7hE


More than 260 COVID-19 patients in South Korea tested positive for the coronavirus after having recovered, raising alarm that the virus might be capable of "reactivating" or infecting people more than once. But infectious disease experts now say both are unlikely.

Rather, the method used to detect the coronavirus, called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cannot distinguish between genetic material (RNA or DNA) from infectious virus and the "dead" virus fragments that can linger in the body long after a person recovers, Dr Oh Myoung-don, a Seoul National University Hospital doctor, said at a news briefing [Thu 30 Apr 2020], according to The Korea Herald.

These tests "are very simple", said Carol Shoshkes Reiss, a professor of Biology and Neural Science at New York University, who was not involved in the testing. "Although somebody can recover and no longer be infectious, they may still have these little fragments of [inactive] viral RNA which turn out positive on those tests." That's because once the virus has been vanquished, there is "all this garbage of broken-down cells that needs to be cleaned up," Reiss told Live Science, referring to the cellular corpses that were killed by the virus. Within that garbage are the fragmented remains of now non-infectious viral particles.

To determine whether or not someone is harboring infectious virus or has been reinfected with the virus, a completely different type of test would be needed, one that is not typically performed, Reiss said. Instead of testing the virus as it is, lab technicians would have to culture it, or place that virus in a lab dish under ideal conditions and see if it was capable of growing.

Patients in South Korea who re-tested positive had very little to no ability to spread the virus, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Korea Herald reported.

Reports of patients testing positive twice aren't limited to South Korea; they have also poured in from other countries, including China and Japan. But the general consensus in the scientific community -- with all the information available to date on the new coronavirus -- is that people aren't being reinfected, but rather falsely testing positive, Reiss said.

What's more, "the process in which COVID-19 produces a new virus takes place only in host cells and does not infiltrate the nucleus," or the very core of the cell, Myoung-don said during the briefing, the Herald reported.

Here's why: some viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the chickenpox virus, can integrate themselves into the host genome by making their way into the nucleus of human cells, where they can stay latent for years and then "reactivate". But the coronavirus is not one of those viruses and instead it stays outside of the host cell's nucleus, before quickly bursting out and infiltrating the next cell, Reiss said. This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence," he [sic. Should be "she". - Mod.SH] said. In other words, it's "highly unlikely" that the coronavirus would reactivate in the body soon after infection.

But reinfection at some point is a theoretical possibility. "We don't know what's going to happen a year from now, nobody has that kind of crystal ball," Reiss said.

Reassuringly, the virus is currently undergoing very small genetic changes that are "too tiny" to evade the immune systems of people who have already been infected. The genetic changes would have to be substantial enough that a person's existing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 would no longer work against a new strain. So far, that seems unlikely.

"If this virus remains as it is [with] really tiny changes ... then it's highly unlikely" that a person would be reinfected next year, Reiss added. In the best-case scenario, which Reiss thinks is likely, the virus will behave like the virus that causes chickenpox, "imprinting" on the host immune memory. Then, even if antibody levels drop over time, people will retain a population of memory cells that can rapidly boost production of more antibodies if they are exposed to the virus again, Reiss said. Of course, this is still an "assumption," and it will be some time before we can fully understand the strength of the army the immune system creates against this virus -- and whether that army's protection is long-lasting.

[4] Using waste water to track COVID-19
Date: Fri 1 May 2020, 4:30 AM EDT
Source: Politico [edited]
https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/01/cdc-human-waste-coronavirus-222253


The [United States] federal government is eyeing a new strategy for monitoring the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The US has struggled to keep pace with other advanced countries on coronavirus testing, and now is considering tracking the spread of the virus through sewage systems as a way to predict where the next hot spot may be.

Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, raised the intriguing possibility on [Mon 27 Apr 2020] in a conference call with private-sector representatives, according to audio of the call reviewed by Politico. Most of the discussion had the grave and staid tone that has characterized public health officials' conversations about the virus that has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more than 60 000. Butler fielded prescreened questions on a host of buttoned-up topics, including face-mask use, sick leave and contact tracing.

Then he got a question about wastewater. "There is not a lot of evidence of transmission through stools," he said. "I know at least one tabloid in the UK got a lot of coverage by someone speculating that COVID-19 could be spread by flatulence or, to quote the headline, by farting. There really is not a lot of science behind that."

But, he continued, the virus can sometimes be present in human waste -- and that may be a feature, not a bug. "It does raise the intriguing possibility, though, that wastewater could potentially be monitored for the presence of the RNA as a marker for whether or not it's in the community," he said. "If you're new to public health, that may seem really odd but that's actually a practice that's been done for literally decades to look for reemergence of polio viruses in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated."

While wastewater surveillance has been used for years in developing countries to detect outbreaks of polio, in the US, it has been used more recently to track opioid use within communities. A spokesperson for CDC confirmed that the agency is eyeing wastewater as part of its response to the pandemic, though it is not yet doing so. "At this time, CDC is exploring the potential for wastewater testing to inform the response, but we are not conducting any testing at CDC," the spokesperson said in a statement. "However, there are external groups that are currently conducting wastewater testing."

Because the novel coronavirus can be detected in feces within 3 days of infection -- days before most individuals begin showing symptoms -- there is hope that wastewater monitoring could provide an early warning of new outbreaks of the virus as the country tries to avoid a 2nd-wave of the pandemic that could arise as states begin to open up. Even if testing capacity ramps up, monitoring sewers could alert public health and other local and state government officials to a coming wave of infections days before patients need hospital beds.

Recent research out of the Netherlands has shown that the virus' genetic material, or RNA, can be detected in wastewater as much as 2 weeks before the 1st diagnosis of a sick patient by a doctor, said Peter Grevatt, a former Environmental Protection Agency water official who now runs the nonprofit Water Research Foundation. His group this week convened a summit of wastewater utility leaders, researchers, and other experts to chart a path forward on the method. "There is some near-term potential to use this sewer-shed monitoring as a signal of a trend, and it seems that there could be tremendous value in that as we're reopening economies around the world and there's so much uncertainty about what will happen next," he said. But, he added, there are still major scientific gaps that limit the method's usefulness.

While wastewater monitoring can detect the presence of the virus in the community, researchers can't yet correlate the number of infected individuals with the concentrations of virus they find. That's because it's not yet known how shedding rates vary among individuals, including among those with moderate, severe, or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. Scientists also don't know how long individuals keep shedding the virus after they recover.

The EPA, which regulates wastewater treatment plants, said it is coordinating with the CDC to kick off scientifically sound monitoring in areas hit hard by the virus. "EPA is currently coordinating sewage sampling and storage protocols with CDC to start sewage surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 with wastewater utilities in multiple cities with a high number of current confirmed cases," the agency said in a statement.

[5] Outpatient estimation of seroprevalence of COVID-19 using preserved serum, Kobe, Japan: cross-sectional study
Date: Fri 1 May 2020

ref: Doi A, Iwata K, Kuroda H, Kuroda H, et al. Estimation of seroprevalence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using preserved serum at an outpatient setting in Kobe, Japan: a cross-sectional study. medRxiv. 2020. doi: 10.1101/2020.04.26.20079822
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been affecting many people on earth and our society. Japan is known to have relatively less number of infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from 31 Mar to 7 Apr 2020, stratified by decade of age and sex.

Results
There were 33 positive IgG among 1000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (population: 1 518 870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50 123 (95%CI: 34 934-69 868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was 2.7% (95%CI 1.8-3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40 999 (95%CI: 27,333-59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858 fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City.

Conclusions
Our cross-sectional serological study suggests that the number of people with seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kobe, Japan is far more than the confirmed cases by PCR testing.

[6] Large-vessel stroke as a presenting feature of COVID-19 in the young

-------------------------------------------------------------------
We report 5 cases of large-vessel stroke in patients younger than 50 years of age who presented to our health system in New York City. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed in all 5 patients.

Cough, headache, and chills lasting 1 week developed in a previously healthy 33 year old woman (Patient 1) (table 1). She then had progressive dysarthria with both numbness and weakness in the left arm and left leg over a period of 28 hours. She delayed seeking emergency care because of fear of COVID-19. When she presented to the hospital, the score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 19 (scores range from 0 to 42, with higher numbers indicating greater stroke severity), and computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography showed a partial infarction of the right middle cerebral artery with a partially occlusive thrombus in the right carotid artery at the cervical bifurcation. Patchy ground-glass opacities in bilateral lung apices were seen on CT angiography, and testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Antiplatelet therapy was initiated; it was subsequently switched to anticoagulation therapy. Stroke workup with echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck did not reveal the source of the thrombus. Repeat CT angiography on hospital day 10 showed complete resolution of the thrombus, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Over a 2-week period from [23 Mar to 7 Apr 2020], a total of five patients (including the aforementioned patient) who were younger than 50 years of age presented with new-onset symptoms of large-vessel ischemic stroke. All 5 patients tested positive for COVID-19. By comparison, every 2 weeks over the previous 12 months, our service has treated, on average, 0.73 patients younger than 50 years of age with large-vessel stroke.

On admission of the 5 patients, the mean NIHSS score was 17, consistent with severe large-vessel stroke. One patient had a history of stroke. Other pertinent clinical characteristics are summarized in table 1.

A retrospective study of data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, showed that the incidence of stroke among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was approximately 5%; the youngest patient in that series was 55 years of age (1). Moreover, large-vessel stroke was reported in association with the 2004 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Singapore (2). Coagulopathy and vascular endothelial dysfunction have been proposed as complications of COVID-19 (3). The association between large-vessel stroke and COVID-19 in young patients requires further investigation.

Social distancing, isolation, and reluctance to present to the hospital may contribute to poor outcomes. Two patients in our series delayed calling an ambulance because they were concerned about going to a hospital during the pandemic.

[7] Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the risk of rapid respiratory failure (1) and cardiac complications (2) due to COVID-19, it is unclear whether there is an association between COVID-19 and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Lombardy region of Italy was among the first areas to have an outbreak of COVID-19 outside China (3), and the 1st case there was diagnosed on [20 Feb 2020], in Lodi Province (4).

Using the Lombardia Cardiac Arrest Registry (Lombardia CARe), we compared out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred in the provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantua during the first 40 days of the COVID-19 outbreak [21 Feb through 31 Mar 2020] with those that occurred during the same period in 2019 [21 Feb through 1 Apr 2019] (to account for the leap year). We reviewed daily reports of new COVID-19 cases recorded by the National Department of Civil Protection (5) and cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the electronic database of the emergency medical system to identify either symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever lasting greater or equal 3 days before out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with cough, dyspnea, or both) or positive results of testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs obtained before the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or after death.

During the study period in 2020, a total of 9806 cases of COVID-19 were reported in the study territory. During this period, 362 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were identified, as compared with 229 cases identified during the same period in 2019 (a 58% increase). Increases of various magnitudes in the numbers of cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were seen in all 4 provinces (table S1 in the supplementary appendix). The sex and age of the patients were similar in the 2020 and 2019 periods, but in 2020, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to a medical cause was 6.5% points higher, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at home was 7.3 % points higher, and the incidence of unwitnessed cardiac arrest was 11.3% points higher (table S2). The median arrival time of the emergency medical service was 3 minutes longer in 2020 than in 2019, and the proportion of patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from bystanders was 15.6% points lower. Among patients in whom resuscitation was attempted by the emergency medical service, the incidence of out-of-hospital death was 14.9% points higher in 2020 than in 2019.

The cumulative incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2020 was strongly associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 0.91; P less than 0.001), and the increase in the number of cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest over the number in 2019 (133 additional cases) followed the time course of the COVID-19 outbreak (Figure 1). A total of 103 patients who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Table S3) were suspected to have or had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 (87 and 16 patients, respectively); these numbers account for 77.4% of the increase in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest observed in these provinces in 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.

Methods
Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between [20 Dec 2019 and 15 Mar 2020], and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of [28 Mar 2020].

Results
Of the 8910 patients with COVID-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those 65 years of age or under; odds ratio 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio 2.70; CI 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio 2.48; CI 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio 1.95; CI 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio 2.96; CI 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio 1.79; CI 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio 0.33; CI 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio 1.23; CI 0.87 to 1.74).

Conclusions
Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

[9] Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19
Date: Thu 30 Apr 2020

ref: Rubin R. Testing an old therapy against a new disease: convalescent plasma for COVID-19. JAMA. 2020. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.7456. Online ahead of print
-----------------------------------------------------------
As deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to mount, desperation has driven physicians to try therapies backed by little or no evidence.

Perhaps the greatest excitement surrounds convalescent plasma, a treatment more than a century old that has gone in and out of fashion -- in when infectious disease outbreaks occurred and then out when treatments and vaccines that could be mass-produced were developed to contain them. Taken from healthy people (or in the earliest reported cases, animals) who have recovered from the infectious disease of interest, antibody-rich convalescent plasma is thought to give recipients' immune systems a running start.

"To explain how desperate the need is, we probably have at least 300 [COVID-19] patients in the hospital today, over a third of them intubated," anesthesiologist Elliott Bennett-Guerrero said in mid-April [2020]. He's the principal investigator of a just-launched convalescent plasma trial at Stony Brook Hospital in New York with a planned enrollment of up to 500 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a 3rd of whom probably will be intubated. "We are at lightning speed ramping up production and processes for collecting convalescent plasma," Bennett-Guerrero explained.

The 1st published report of convalescent plasma against COVID-19, a preliminary communication in JAMA about 5 seriously ill patients in China, was posted online [27 Mar 2020]. Two more reports from Wuhan, one published [6 Apr 2020] and the other published [15 Apr 2020], described infusing convalescent plasma into a total of 16 patients seriously ill with COVID-19. All 3 articles said the therapy appeared to save lives; the authors called for randomized controlled trials to confirm their findings.

Without randomized controlled trials, researchers can't be sure whether patients recovered because of an experimental therapy or in spite of it. Yet virtually everything that's known about the use of convalescent plasma against infectious diseases comes from studies in which every patient received the treatment. "We do not know if this is safe and effective," Bennett-Guerrero acknowledged in an interview. "We hope it is, because we desperately want to help our patients."

His study does include a control group, but 80% of participants will receive the active treatment -- a higher proportion than in most randomized controlled trials. "We think that we're doing the responsible thing by trying to maximize the number of people who may potentially benefit," Bennett-Guerrero said. The remaining participants will receive plasma donated by people who had not been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, therefore, lack antibodies against it.

Pulmonologist A Whitney Brown, of the Inova Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, and her coprincipal investigator, Grace Banez-Sese, director of Inova Blood Donor Services, thought long and hard about whether to include a control group in their just-launched convalescent plasma trial in seriously ill patients. "I think that's something everybody is struggling with," Brown said in an interview. "That's been our problem historically with convalescent plasma. You use convalescent plasma when you have no treatment, when you have no vaccine. You just want to help as many people as you can and not hold back."

She and Banez-Sese hope to enrol 200 or more patients into their study. They considered including a control group that would receive plasma without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as Stony Brook is doing, Brown said. "The ethical concern is we think COVID-19 may cause increased clotting." Plasma is rich in clotting factors and typically used to reverse bleeding problems, Brown noted, so it theoretically could increase clotting risk in patients with COVID-19 without any promise of benefit. (Bennett-Guerrero noted that in some conditions, plasma promotes anticoagulation.) Still, she added, "I would love a control group. I would love to rigorously prove" that convalescent plasma works. But instead of a control group, Brown said, she and Banez-Sese will compare trial participants to published case reports of patients with COVID-19 who weren't treated with convalescent plasma.

Due to the dearth of randomized controlled trials, "there are no data that I'm aware of that clearly demonstrate the value of [convalescent plasma] for an infectious disease," said H Clifford Lane, clinical director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

In 2019, Lane coauthored one of the few published randomized trials of convalescent plasma. He and his collaborators randomized 140 children and adults with influenza to either convalescent plasma with high levels of anti-influenza antibodies or to standard plasma. The double-blind study concluded that the anti-influenza convalescent plasma conferred no significant benefit over standard plasma. The NIAID will not pursue a similar trial involving patients with COVID-19, Lane said. "I'm a little bit more on the physician-do-no-harm end of the spectrum," he said. "Many of the things that are so promising in theory fall apart when really studied rigorously." But, Lane said, he understands why the treatment has captured the attention of so many physicians, scientists, and patients and their families. "Everything that's going on right now in terms of trying to find an effective treatment for COVID-19 is driven by fear and this strong desire to do something for patients," he said.

Seeking answers
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1st announced on [24 Mar 2020], with more details on [3 Apr 2020] and on [13 Apr 2020], that it would facilitate access to convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 via 3 regulatory pathways. For now, they are the only avenues for obtaining convalescent plasma, an investigational medical product, to treat patients. "Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be effective in COVID-19," the FDA cautioned. "It is therefore important to determine through clinical trials, before routinely administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19, that it is safe and effective to do so."

One way to administer convalescent plasma is by conducting a clinical trial, as Bennett-Guerrero and Brown have opted to do, under the traditional investigational new drug (IND) regulatory pathway. Another is expanded access, also called "compassionate use," which enables patients with a serious or life-threatening disease to obtain an investigational medical product outside of a clinical trial when there is no alternative treatment available. If such patients can't obtain convalescent plasma through clinical trials or an expanded-use protocol, their physician can request a single-patient emergency Investigational New Drug Application (eIND). Houston Methodist Hospital reported that on [28 Mar 2020], it became the 1st US hospital to provide convalescent plasma to a patient with COVID-19, in this case under an eIND.

The FDA's National Expanded Access Treatment Protocol entry criteria are fairly broad: Adults aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 whose disease is severe to life-threatening or deemed by their physician likely to become so are eligible. By [27 Apr 2020], 2115 sites had registered to participate and enrolled 5968 patients, 2576 of whom had received convalescent plasma.

As the FDA notes on the expanded access program's website, though, "the focus of an EAP is to provide treatment whereas a clinical trial is focused on research." However, the expanded access program is collecting information about treated patients from their physicians, who are asked to complete short forms 4 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after infusion if their patients remain hospitalized that long.

Practically every day, another medical center announces plans to begin administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19. "The use in the United States is mushrooming very rapidly," said Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

A blast from the past
In the first known trial of convalescent serum, as described in JAMA in 1893, German scientists used serum from animals immunized against diphtheria to treat patients with the disease. By 1901, Emil von Behring had won the first Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his research demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies, or antitoxins, could be transferred from one person or animal to another. (Von Behring carried out his research into treating diphtheria with antibody-rich plasma with Paul Ehrlich, who shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for his immunology work.)

Over the next 120 years or so, convalescent plasma was also used against the 1918 pandemic flu, measles, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola virus disease. "For most people, this was forgotten history," said Casadevall, a self-described history buff. By late January [2020], he said, he recognized that SARS-CoV-2 "was going to be bad" and felt compelled to refresh people's memories about convalescent plasma.

He recalled reading of a prep school physician in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, who had suppressed a measles outbreak by infusing students with plasma taken from a classmate who'd recovered from the disease. Casadevall figured that the 85 year old report would be particularly engaging because it involved children. To raise awareness as quickly as possible, he dashed off a 600-word op-ed piece about the prep school physician's experiment and how convalescent plasma was worth trying against COVID-19. The article was rejected by a few newspapers before the Wall Street Journal published it on [27 Feb 2020].

Casadevall followed up the op-ed column on [13 Mar 2020] with a scientific journal article about the use of convalescent sera for containing COVID-19. That article spurred the establishment of the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project--"a decentralized grass roots effort from academic institutions...to deploy the use of plasma in this emergency." Casadevall chairs the group.

"Dr Casadevall has inspired the national movement of convalescent plasma," University of Chicago lung and thoracic surgeon Maria Lucia Madariaga said on [13 Apr 2020] at a press conference announcing the launch of her institution's 10-patient open-label trial of the investigational treatment.

Casadevall distributed his op-ed piece to 20 close scientist friends. "We are a very eclectic group who are very concerned about the direction of science," he said. "We converse all the time by email." Upon reading it, Casadevall said, his friends were eager to test the treatment. Among them was Michael Joyner, MD, an anesthesiologist and physiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, whose main research interests had been exercise physiology and human performance.

It seems only appropriate that he quoted legendary football coach Vince Lombardi in a recent tweet about efforts to deliver convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19: "People who work together will win, whether it be against complex football defenses or the problems of modern society."

Supply and demand
Individuals who want to donate convalescent plasma must be able to document that they had COVID-19 with a laboratory test, according to the FDA, which has compiled resources for people who'd like to donate.

At the beginning of the US COVID-19 outbreak, many symptomatic individuals were unable to get a confirmatory nose or throat swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, so at first, they were ineligible to donate convalescent plasma. However, the FDA now accepts a positive blood antibody test as proof of prior infection. "The people doing the plasma collection are very interested in increasing the pool of donors based on the lookback test," said Joyner, referring to antibody testing of individuals presumed to have recovered from COVID-19 that was not confirmed when they were sick. Still, some collection organizations, such as Inova Blood Donor Services, require that convalescent plasma donors have had a confirmatory PCR test because of questions about the antibody tests' accuracy. "They're not fully vetted," Brown said of the tests.

The FDA has not yet cleared any SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for marketing, but it has granted several emergency use authorizations so blood centers can screen prospective convalescent plasma donors who had not had a confirmatory PCR test when they were sick.

Prospective donors must be symptom-free for at least 28 days, or, alternatively, for at least 14 days if they get a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that they are no longer infectious, according to the FDA. They must also be eligible to donate blood.

The American Red Cross is fulfilling orders for convalescent plasma through both the expanded access treatment protocol and eINDs. "While the Red Cross first meets the needs of area hospitals, it can also provide convalescent plasma...throughout the country," spokeswoman Stephanie Rendon said in an email. As of [20 Apr 2020], the Red Cross had collected convalescent plasma from about 110 donors, which translated into nearly 250 units, 120 of which had already been delivered to hospitals treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, Rendon said.

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, many people have taken to social media to plead for convalescent plasma for their seriously ill loved ones. However, blood collection centers generally do not permit donors to designate their blood for a specific patient. Instead, Brown said, she encourages people interested in making a designated donation to pay it forward and donate to replace the convalescent plasma used by their intended recipient.

The AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) and the New York Blood Center and several other community-based blood centers have partnered with Survivor Corps--a grassroots organization of COVID-19 survivors whose mission is to support research into developing a cure and a vaccine--to increase convalescent plasma donations.

Timing and dosing
In 2016, an international team of researchers published findings from a trial of convalescent plasma involving 84 patients with Ebola virus disease in Africa. The patients were compared with 418 patients who had been treated for Ebola during the previous 5 months at the same hospital. Convalescent plasma was not associated with a significant improvement in survival, the study found.

The Ebola trial doesn't dissuade Christopher Hillyer, MD, president and CEO of the nonprofit New York Blood Center, which is collecting and banking convalescent plasma for use by hospitals throughout the country, and, as of [22 Apr 2020], had shipped 2700 units. "They were giving it to extremely ill people," Hillyer explained.

For patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma seems more effective if it's given earlier in the course of the disease, according to Beth Shaz, MD, New York Blood Center's chief medical officer. "It appears to slow progression of disease and keep people out of the ICU. Some are getting extubated shortly after transfusion," she said on [15 Apr 2020] in an email to Hillyer and other colleagues.

In patients critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome, though, convalescent plasma doesn't seem to be as effective, wrote Shaz, who also is president of AABB.

Stanford University researchers will soon begin testing convalescent plasma in emergency department patients with COVID-19 respiratory symptoms who aren't yet sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. They hope to enroll 206 patients in their double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will compare convalescent plasma with plasma that does not contain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Johns Hopkins scientists have launched a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma in 150 adults who aren't even sick. Eligible participants are high-risk based on age and overall health. They must have had close contact with a COVID-19 patient within 96 hours of enrolling in the study. Participants will receive either convalescent plasma or plasma without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within 120 hours of having close contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Plasma with higher titers of anti-COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies is thought to be most effective, but many patients are receiving plasma with unknown titer levels. The FDA advises that if collection centers don't measure antibody titers before convalescent plasma is infused, they should save a bit of the donor's blood for future testing to see if higher titers do indeed correlate with better outcomes.

Many patients are receiving a 1-time dose of 1 unit of plasma, but some institutions think 2 units, administered 24 hours apart, helps address the variability in donors' antibody titers, Shaz said.

Next Steps
Convalescent plasma is like a bridge. It's thought to help defend patients against SARS-CoV-2 until their own immune systems get up to speed. And in the minds of some scientists, it's a stop-gap measure until more refined treatments and a vaccine can be mass-produced.

One of those treatments is intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin, made of pooled IgG from convalescent plasma. The NIAID has been working to develop and launch a placebo-controlled trial of IV IgG to treat COVID-19, Lane said. Unlike convalescent plasma, IV IgG can be standardized and used to treat anyone, no matter their blood type.

Chinese scientists in March [2020] reported on 3 Wuhan patients with severe COVID-19 who recovered after receiving high-dose IV IgG. They concluded that randomized trials of high-dose IV IgG in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19 should be considered.

Further down the road is the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2. The Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard have launched a COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which will screen new monoclonal antibodies for possible anti-COVID-19 activity.

Patrick Wilson, an antibody biology researcher at the University of Chicago, plans to isolate B cells, which produce antibodies, from convalescent plasma donors' white blood cells. Every B cell produces a unique antibody as part of the immune response. Wilson said his lab will clone antibody genes from COVID-19-induced B cells to try to determine which one accounts for a convalescent plasma donor's effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2.

For now--and possibly the next 18 to 24 months, Bennett-Guerrero said--convalescent plasma, despite supply issues and questions about efficacy and who is most likely to benefit from treatment, remains the only off-the-shelf therapy for COVID-19.

[10] Drug tests

The more researchers know about how the coronavirus attaches, invades and hijacks human cells, the more effective the search for drugs to fight it. That was the idea my colleagues and I hoped to be true when we began building a map of the coronavirus 2 months ago. The map shows all of the coronavirus proteins and all of the proteins found in the human body that those viral proteins could interact with.

In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a place where drugs could fight the coronavirus. But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.

Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, called the QCRG, identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with potential to treat COVID-19. A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to Institut Pasteur in Paris and Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.

In the last 4 weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I'm happy to report we've identified some strong treatment leads and identified 2 separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were published on [30 Apr 2020] in the journal Nature.

The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn't know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.

To find those answers we needed 3 things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don't yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are frequently used in place of human cells to test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human cells do.

After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.

After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.

It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs. But the results are interesting for 2 reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening. We identified 2 groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it 2 different ways, one of which has never been described.

At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some of the cell's machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.

When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found 2 compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus. The 2 compounds are called ternatin-4 and zotatifin. Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.

Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a clinical trial to treat COVID-19. The second drug, zotatifin, hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.

The 2nd group of drugs we identified work in an entirely different way. Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act like specialized switches. When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to infect cells. Our original map identified 2 promising MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.

We identified 7 drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics, haloperidol and melperone, which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines, clemastine and cloperastine, also displayed antiviral activity, as did the compound PB28 and the female hormone progesterone.

Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes. At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.

Interestingly, a 7th compound - an ingredient commonly found in cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan - does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.

This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.

All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should panic and jump to conclusions.

Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine - the controversial drug that has shown mixed results in treating COVID-19 - also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently. Researchers have long known that hydroxychloroquine easily binds to receptors in the heart and can cause damage. Because of these differences in binding tendencies, we don't think hydroxychloroquine is a reliable treatment. Ongoing clinical trials should soon clarify these unknowns.

These same proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect and replicate in human cells and that are targeted by these drugs are also hijacked by related coronaviruses SARS-1 and MERS. So if any of these drugs do work, they will likely be effective against COVID-22, COVID-24 or any future iterations of COVID that may emerge.

The next step is to test these drugs in human trials. We have already started this process and through these trials researchers will examine important factors such as dosage, toxicity and potential beneficial or harmful interactions within the context of COVID-19.
