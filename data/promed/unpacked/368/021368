There are no testing kits for aflatoxin-infected maize in Embu, where
farmers are eating the poisoned grain.

[However, aflatoxin will fluoresce light/bright blue green under a
blacklight. And blacklighting the grain does not use it up either. While
blacklight is basically a screening test, it is inexpensive and easy to
perform. The aflatoxins all have absorption maxima around 360 nm. The B
toxins are named for their blue fluorescence (425nm) and the G toxins for
their green-blue fluorescence (450nm). The B1 toxin is the most common,
flowed by B2 toxin, while the G toxins are fairly rare. The fluorescence
sensitivity of the G toxins is more than 10 times greater than that for the
B toxins. The minimum detectable level is about 100 pgrams for the G toxins
and 1 ngram for the B toxins. - Mod.TG]

The government had promised to test all the maize held by farmers in 29
affected districts. It also promised to buy for destruction, any
contaminated cereal for KES 1000 [USD 12.40] to cushion farmers against
losses. [If they test all the maize, then there will be nothing left to
consume. Aflatoxin is produced in "hot spots" such that one area may be
very hot or be positive with aflatoxin and a few inches over there is
nothing. - Mod.TG]

This has yet to happen, so farmers are consuming and retailing the grain.
Embu West district commissioner Maalim Mohamed told the Nation: "We have
told transporters to ascertain that farmers have authorisation from
agricultural officers to transport the grain."

The administrator said it would be difficult to move from house to house
testing the maize held by farmers, so testing kits would be based at the
National Cereals and Produce Board's depots.

But farmers who spoke to the Nation said that they did not believe that
their maize was infected, arguing that they have not fallen ill after
eating the grain. [The aflatoxin cannot be seen by the unaided eye, so it
is understandable they believe their grain is not affected. - Mod.TG]

Mr Mohamed refuted claims by Manyatta MP Emilio Kathuri that there was
malice on the part of the government. Mr Kathuri has urged his constituents
not to sell their grain, saying the price was too low. He branded the
proposed sale an avenue for corruption.

But Mr Maalim was categorical: "There is no malice on the part of the
government. We are only concerned about the health of the residents. The
government will mop up all the bad maize at a cost."

Eastern provincial commissioner Clare Omolo said mobile kits would be used
to test the maize, adding that the condition of 3 people in hospital after
consuming contaminated grain was getting better.

Eastern deputy PC Daniel Kurui confirmed this: "Of the 11 people who had
been hospitalised, only 3 are still admitted to Kibwezi, Makindu, and
Mutumo hospitals."

Elsewhere, wide discrepancies in laboratory analysis reports for the maize
sampled in Eastern and Coast provinces have brought into question the
accuracy of the level of contamination.

According to an update report on a survey in the affected region, the
difference in the laboratory results ranged from not detected to 580 parts
per billion (ppb) in one farmer's sample. [This is not unusual. As
explained above, the aflatoxin localizes in hot spots, where one area is
affected and a few inches over, there is nothing. - Mod.TG]

No single test concurred in the 4 laboratories of the Kenya Bureau of
Standards (Kebs), the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services (Kephis),
the National Public Health Laboratory Services (NPHLS), and the University
of Nairobi (UoN).

In samples from Mr Danstan Riungu, a farmer from Imenti South for instance,
Kephis found 580 ppb whereas Kebs did not detect any aflatoxins, while
NPHLS and the University of Nairobi found 93 and 18 ppb.

According to a laboratory assistant at Kebs, there were 2 aspects that
could explain the discrepancy, and one was the need for homogeneity in the
samples from the 4 laboratories. He said what the 4 laboratories had done
was proficiency testing and what was now required was a more intense test
for accurate results. "Based on the urgency of the situation, the
government went with the proficiency results of the test to inform their
next cause of action because we are talking about human lives," he said.

In Kenya, at least 2.3 million bags of maize are this year [2010] rendered
unfit for consumption and trade due to high toxic levels produced by a
fungus. Scientists now try to prevent future contamination.

Kenya this year [2010] is again grappling with high levels of aflatoxin
contamination that has rendered at least 2.3 million bags of maize unfit
for human and livestock consumption and trade, to the dismay of the
millions of small-scale farmers that depend on the crop for food and income.

The contamination of the country's main staple with aflatoxin, a highly
poisonous cancer-causing chemical produced by a fungus scientifically known
as _Aspergillus flavus_, was a result of poor drying and storage of the
grain following heavy rainfall near harvest time, according to scientists.

There are now works to avoid such loss of valuable food in the future.
African and US scientists now say they can offer "a natural, safe, and
cost-effective solution to prevent future contamination of maize" while in
the field. The biocontrol technology works by introducing strains of the
same fungus that do not produce the aflatoxin in the affected fields,
which, out compete and drastically reduce the population of the
poison-producing strains.

Ranajit Bandyopadhyay, a plant pathologist with the Africa-based
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and Peter Cotty of
the Agriculture Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA-ARS) have identified biocompetitive strains of "the good fungus"
native to Kenya that can now be used to control aflatoxin contamination in
the country.

According to Dr Bandyopadhyay, a single application of this biopesticide
2-3 weeks before maize flowering is sufficient to prevent aflatoxin
contamination throughout and beyond a cropping season and even when the
grains are in storage. He says that the technology's ability to continue
working even when the grain is in storage ensures the safety of maize from
aflatoxin contamination. These non-toxigenic strains "are also carried in
the grains from the field to the stores. So, even if the grains are not
stored properly or get wet during or after harvest, as is happening this
year [2010], they continue to prevent aflatoxin contamination during the
postharvest period," said Dr Bandyopadhyay.

Aflatoxin is a silent killer that causes liver cancer and suppresses the
immune system. It also retards growth and development of children. People
exposed to very high aflatoxin concentrations experience liver failure and
rapid death. From 2004 to 2006, nearly 200 unsuspecting people in Kenya
died in this manner after eating highly contaminated maize. Aflatoxin is a
colourless chemical that is invisible and only laboratory tests can confirm
its presence and contamination levels.

Kenya is one of the world's hotspots for aflatoxin. Research performed by
one of Dr Cotty's graduate students, Claudia Probst, has shown that in
areas where aflatoxin is a persistent and serious problem, there is a very
high occurrence of one of the most toxic strains of _A. flavus_ in the
world, the S strain.

According to Dr Cotty, the S strain produces very high levels of aflatoxins
and dominates in regions where contamination is very high, including some
areas of the US. In Africa, this S strain has been only found to be
dominant in the severely affected regions of Kenya. In the US, biocontrol
with atoxigenics has successfully reduced its contamination.

In Nigeria, IITA has obtained provisional registration of the technology
under the name Alfasafe, a mixture of 4 atoxigenic strains of Nigerian
origin. In 2009, maize farmers in Nigeria were able to reduce aflatoxin
contamination by 80 per cent by broadcasting 10 kg/ha Aflasafe 2-3 weeks
before maize flowering.

The researchers are now calling upon the government and the private sector
in Kenya to partner with them and "make this biocontrol option and other
management practices available to the farmers to save their much-needed
harvests from future aflatoxin contamination."

[Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic for
humans. Animals are susceptible to acute death and liver damage when
exposed to high doses, but seldom develop cancer following long-term
low-level exposure. The toxicity varies between different species, but data
from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in 1974, which involved moldy
maize and in which nearly 100 people died, suggest that the toxicity of
aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere between that for the dog and that
for the rat. The involvement of aflatoxins with human cancer is more
complex and remains to be defined (source:

Any of the produce fed to animals may produce clinical signs including a
decrease of production, such as a drop in milk production.
