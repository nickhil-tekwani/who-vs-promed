Officials are recalling packages of frozen coconut after tests revealed it could have a rare strain of _Salmonella_. The FDA reports that Evershing International Trading Company is recalling 16-ounce bags of Coconut Tree brand frozen shredded coconut sold between [3 Jan 2017] and [3 Jan 2018]. The recalled product carries item number 331223and a UPC of 05216-44081. It was distributed in several states, including Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington, California, Oklahoma, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Florida, and Texas.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health said that the discovery of the rare strain came while state and Boston officials were investigating a single case of salmonella. Mass. DPH indicated that as part of the investigation, department staff and members of Boston Inspectional Services collected samples of assorted food products used as ingredients in a Boston restaurant, as well as interviewing those who became ill.

"Those food samples were brought back to the State Public Health Laboratory for testing, which confirmed that one of the samples, an unopened package of raw frozen coconut meat, was positive for _Salmonella_. DPH shared the lab results with the FDA and the CDC, which ultimately led to the decision by the distributor to announce the recall of all lots of frozen shredded coconut sold between [3 Jan 2017] and [3 Jan 2018]," the Mass. Department of Public Health explained in a statement.

Customers who may have recalled product should return it to the place of purchase for a refund.

Evershing International Trading Company Recalls Frozen Shredded Coconut Because of Possible Health Risk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evershing International Trading Company is recalling 16 ounces Coconut Tree Brand Frozen Shredded Coconut (Item number 331223, UPC 05216-44081) because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune system. Healthy persons infected with salmonellosis often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can result in the organism getting in to the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. No illnesses have been reported to date.

These coconut products were distributed in Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington, California, Oklahoma, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Florida, and Texas. This Frozen Shredded Coconut product is package in 16 ounces plastic bags. This recall is limited to Lot SE07A1, but the lot number is only printed on the case. Therefore, any customer that purchased this product from [3 Jan 2017] through [3 Jan 2018], should return the product to place of purchase for full refund. Customers may also contact Evershing International Trading Company at (408) 975-9660 during hours of operation, Monday to Saturday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

The issue was discovered by testing performed by the State of Massachusetts.

This voluntary recall is being made with the knowledge of the FDA. We appreciate your assistance in this matter.
