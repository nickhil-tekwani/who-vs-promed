Belarus suspends import of cattle from Denmark
----------------------------------------------
Belarus has suspended import of beef cattle, sheep and goats from Denmark, BelTA learnt from the veterinary and food supervision department of the Agriculture and Food Ministry of Belarus.

The decision was made in connection with the reemergence of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] infection in Denmark (Zealand island). In this regard, Belarus' veterinary authorities have suspended the imports and transit through its territory of cattle and small ruminants from Denmark.

The recently detected virus provisionally named "Schmallenberg" (SBV) virus (Simbu serogroup, Bunyaviridae family, genus Orthobunyavirus) is found in ruminants. Clinical signs in adults are mainly mild or nonexistent, but transient fever, loss of appetite, a reduction in milk yield and diarrhoea have been observed in association with the infection. The major clinical sign of SBV is congenital malformations in newborn animals similar to those observed in infections by Akabane virus. Current knowledge suggests that it is unlikely that SBV can cause disease in humans.

[Since mid 2012, the profile of SBV has been lowered by EU; the last SBV-related presentation was discussed by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) in June 2012.

A useful source of SBV information is provided by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) in Germany at http://tinyurl.com/c66dsz2, updated 23 Apr 2013. FLI states that "so far infections with Schmallenberg Virus have been detected in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Estonia, Switzerland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Austria and Switzerland. According to unconfirmed reports there could be infection in further European countries".

OIE's technical factsheet on SBV, updated Feb 2013, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Schmallenberg_virus.pdf>.

In view of the Belarusian claim on "the reemergence of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] infection in Denmark (Zealand island)", firsthand update on the current SBV situation in Denmark will be helpful.- Mod.AS]
