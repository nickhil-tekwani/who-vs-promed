Three persons died apparently from food poisoning in Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Sacatepequez, and another 32 were admitted to medical facilities with vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, and severe dehydration, leading the departmental health authorities to declare a red alert in this municipality.

The victims were identified as a 12-year-old male who died in Chimaltenango's National Hospital; his 10-year-old sister, who died in the Pedro de Betancourt facility of Antigua Guatemala, Sacatepequez; and a 27-year-old male who died at home having refused to be taken for medical assistance.

A total of 23 persons were admitted to the Xenacoj Health Center with vomiting and diarrhea and another 9 were admitted to the Chimaltenango and Antigua Guatemala hospitals, according to Amado Quelex from the Municipal Fire Department

A source from the Hospital mentioned that apparently the affected persons had eaten vegetable that they had bought in the local market, and that they could have been contaminated with some chemical product such as pesticides.

The father of the children who died said they had eaten mangos that they had gotten in the market, and that their health status had rapidly deteriorated due to dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea.

Members of [another family that had affected members] informed [the press] that they had eaten beans and cauliflower wrapped in egg, and a few hours [later] they had the onset of vomiting and diarrhea, which led them to go to the hospital for medical treatment. They mentioned that the 27-year-old refused to go to the hospital for medical treatment in spite of his symptoms and as a result he died.

Facing this emergency, the Sacatepequez authorities have declared a red alert in the municipality. Calixto Reyes, mayor of Xenacoj, said that as a preventive measure the market has been closed. He added that they will investigate what happened in the market and that they do not know how long it will remain closed. This is the 1st time such a situation has occurred and he was sorry about the deaths of the neighbors.

Case investigation
------------------
Francisco Bermudez, Director of the Sacatepequez Health Zone said that they are investigating the poisoning incident that occurred in Xenacoj.

He confirmed that the focus of contamination was the market and the vendors would be asked to maintain higher levels of hygiene.

Governor Teresa de Jesus Cocoyo indicated in addition to the market, the schools have also been closed.

Four persons have died and at least 96 have been poisoned following the consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with _E. coli_ in a community to the west of Guatemala City.

The municipal Fireman's Department reported that there have been 4 deaths, while dozens of persons have been admitted to various hospitals in the area. Amilcar Zapote explained that the illness was due to consumption of vegetables and fruits in the community of Santo Domingo Xenocoj, in the Department of Sacatepequez, 45 km to the west of Guatemala City.

Jose Morales, physician in charge of the "Aura Castellanos" health center in the community, informed the Associated Press that according to analyses conducted, they were able to detect _Escherichia coli_, commonly called _E. coli_ as responsible for the deaths.

"Up through today [12 Apr 2013], we have treated 96 persons; in the analyses that we've made, we were able to isolate _E. coli_, and this was due to faulty food handling/hygiene," said Morales.

Zapote indicated that there have been "a total of 4 deaths; various persons are in the hospital, and the sale of fruit and vegetables has been prohibited in the town." One family was among the most affected: 6 of the 7 family members suffered from the illness, of which 2 of the children, ages 9 and 12 years, died.

The 40-year-old father of the deceased children said that his family ate broccoli wrapped in egg for supper, which they bought at the local market, and that this may have been responsible for their illnesses.

[Hygiene in the market may be important because if it is a chemical on the outside of the fruits and vegetables, then it is possible it could have some absorption through the skin.

Hopefully the authorities will be able to trace to where the vegetables came from and ascertain which chemical was used.

Also eating fresh fruits and vegetables out of the hand can be very satisfying, but may not been safe. Wash them first, to help insure the removal of any bacteria, but especially pesticides.

This article does not give us any indication of the time frame from consumption of food to onset of symptoms. However vomiting and diarrhea are common with chemicals as well as with some bacteria. It is a function of the body that intense illness with vomiting and diarrhea leaves one dehydrated, and tired.

We look forward to knowing the outcome of this investigation and what chemical or bacteria has been the cause of illness and death. - Mod.TG]

[This newswire does not specifically state the symptom complex manifested in the outbreak or whether the _E. coli_ involved was identified as an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. The fatalities suggest that this may be the case, but ProMED awaits more information.
