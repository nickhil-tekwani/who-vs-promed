According to Mongolian media reports, a herdsman in Erdenemandal sum
[district] in Mongolia's Arkhangai Province contracted anthrax
recently. On [20 Apr 2008], when the patient sought treatment at the
Arkhangai Province Infectious Disease Hospital, physicians diagnosed
possible anthrax infection.

To prevent spread of the disease, relevant agencies vaccinated 11
neighboring herdsmen and 4500 heads of livestock, and implemented
quarantine [measures]. Later, tests at the Mongolian National
Infectious Disease Research Center confirmed that the patient had
contracted anthrax.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. It
is an infectious disease of cows, horses, sheep, and other animals,
but at times it can infect personnel engaged in tanning and livestock work.

[Anthrax is enzootic in Mongolia with livestock cases being seen in
the following provinces in recent years: Arkhangai, Bayanhongor,
Bulgan, Darkhan-Uul, Dornod, Dzavhan, Gobi-Altai, Hovsgol, Khenti,
Ovorkhangai, Selenge, Ulaanbaatar, Uvs, and Zavkhan. Human cases are
less frequent but occur, usually with the same history as this
herder. Our thanks to Dan Silver for his translation. - Mod.MHJ]
