The energy company EnBW confirmed that on Friday [12 Oct 2012] the health department investigated the company's cooling tower in connection with the recent legionellosis outbreak and has taken samples. These samples will now be tested by the country's health department. "Also, it is assumed that the power plant may not be the source of the contamination; the health department has to check all potential sources," said the EnBW press office on Friday night [12 Oct 2012]. "The health department has to investigate all potential sources of infection to get reliable results."

EnBW regularly carries out microbiological testing of their cooling towers at its power plants, the report said. "The results were submitted to the authorities. At no time were there any unusual findings," EnBW said in a statement. In the meantime, at least one more case of Legionnaires' disease has been detected in the region according to confirmation by the SLK Clinic [Heilbronn] on Friday [12 Oct 2012] afternoon. Another patient, a male from the same region, is undergoing treatment at the hospital after being admitted on Tuesday [9 Oct 2012].

Information published by the paper "Heilbronner Stimme" on Friday [12 Oct 2012] that another patient suffering from acute and life-threatening pneumonia has been admitted to the Heilbronner Gesundbrunnen hospital has not been confirmed by SLK spokeswoman Valerie Blass.

There are now at least 4 Legionnaires' disease patients undergoing treatment at the Gesundbrunnen and not 3, as had been reported on Friday [12 Oct 2012]. The 4th, not yet named, Legionnaires' disease patient who lives in the district had suffered from the symptoms when he was admitted to the hospital, District Office spokesman Hubert Waldenberger confirmed. "We only had the official confirmation that the patient was infected with Legionnaires' disease on Thursday [11 Oct 2012] afternoon, so we only could pass on the information to the district health office on Thursday," said SLK spokeswoman Valerie Blass. When asked about other suspected cases, Blass said, "I can't comment on suspicions."

With relation to the patients from the district, there have been extensive investigations into the possible source of infection, said Waldenberger. "In some cases, the search is very difficult." There is an indication that one of the 3 patients might have been infected in a private household, according to information by the city of Heilbronn. In relation to the 3 cases, various private houses and workplaces have been investigated. Apart from the usual sources of infection like showers and sinks, some individual cooling plants are under investigation, Heilbronn spokesman Christian Britzke said on request. Sometimes the search for the source can last for days or weeks.

SLK spokeswoman Valerie Blass said on Wednesday [10 Oct 2012] that each of the patients was already ill when they were taken to the Gesundbrunnen Hospital. "The health of 3 of the patients is improving with regard to Legionnaires' disease," Blass said on Friday [12 Oct 2012]. "The 4th patient is undergoing specific treatment after the test results came back."

_Legionella_ are transmitted through water. They can infect humans by breathing in very fine droplets of water containing the pathogen, a rod-shaped bacterium. Not every contact with water contaminated with _Legionella_ represents a health risk; for people with an intact immune system, even drinking water containing the pathogen poses no risk.

Transmission of legionellosis is often associated with hot water supplies or air conditioning in private homes, hospitals, care homes, hotels, swimming pools or other facilities, which aerosolize water droplets. Warm water provides the ideal conditions for the bacteria to grow and multiply. The infection is also known under the name Legionnaires' disease.

Legionellosis is notifiable. The numbers are collected by the Robert Koch Institute [RKI]. Annually, an average of 500 to 600 cases are reported, according to the RKI.

The largest outbreak of legionellosis in Germany was in 2010 in Ulm; 64 people were infected, and 5 died. The Ulm health authorities identified the cooling towers of a power station near the main railway station in Ulm as the source of infection.

According to Dr. Peter Liebert from the Heilbronn city health office, the local health authority and the national reference laboratory are investigating the current legionellosis outbreak in the region, using a complicated method, trying to establish whether _Legionella_ recovered from patients are "genetically identical," thus establishing whether the patients have become infected by the same source. According to Liebert, in 2010 and 2011, only 2 cases of legionellosis have been detected in Heilbronn.

Information from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany points out that not every case of legionellosis is detected, thus the amount of under-reporting is regarded as substantial. Therefore, although reporting is mandatory, it is still difficult to obtain reliable data.

The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

Heilbronn, with approximately 123 000 residents, is a city in northern Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. Heilbronn can be found on a map of Germany at: http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bpcl=35277026&biw=1138&bih=598&q=heilbronn.

EnBW (Energie Baden-Wurttemberg AG) is one of the largest energy companies in Germany and Europe, which generates, trades in, transports, and sells energy, and operates in the fields of electricity and gas (http://www.enbw.com/content/en/group/portrait/index.jsp).
