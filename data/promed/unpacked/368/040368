Department of Health (DOH) officials warned on Thursday [5 Nov 1998
that the spread of shigella, a bacterium that causes a contagious
form of dysentery, may lead to an epidemic as a growing number of
schoolchildren in Taoyuan County are reported to have been infected.
Sixty-nine students at Taoyuan's Tah Chung and Tah Yung primary
schools experienced vomiting and diarrhea, both symptomatic of
dysentery. Of the 69 students, three have been hospitalized. On
Wednesday, 79 pupils from Taoyuan's Wu Kung Primary School were
confirmed to have contracted shigellosis, the disease resulting from
the shigella bacterium. Wang Kung-jen, director of the DOH's National
Institute of Preventive Medicine, said well water used by the school
was the source of the infections. But neither the Yah Chung nor the
Tah Yung primary school uses well water.
Wang said the outbreak at Wu Kung Primary School was an isolated
occurrence. He noted that all the victims were students at the school
and that neither the students' parents nor the school's faculty had
been infected.
DOH officials changed their stance, however, after infections were
detected at schools that do not use well water. All schools in the
Taoyuan region, whether or not they use well water, should have their
water supply examined, officials said.
