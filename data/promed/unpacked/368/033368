In response to the enquiry [on PACNET regarding influenza vaccine
formulation for the Southern Hemisphere:
There is currently no formal WHO recommendation for influenza vaccine
formulation for the Southern Hemisphere. An Australian Influenza Vaccine
Committee meets in late September each year to review the WHO formulation
recommendation made in February in light of subsequent findings. If
necessary, and this is often the case, the committee updates the
formulation for the Australian vaccine. Invited representatives from New
Zealand and South Africa participate in this meeting and these countries
usually adopt the recommendations of the Australian meeting.
The formulation recommended for the 1998 Australian winter, and also
adopted by New Zealand and South Africa is:
A/Bayern/07/95 (H1N1)-like strain
A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2)-like strain
B/Beijing/184/93-like strain
The ideal time for vaccination varies because of the differing epidemiology
of influenza in different geographic regions. In temperate Southern
Hemisphere regions it is usually accepted that vaccination should take
place in March-April, however later vaccination may still be effective, as
the peak period for outbreaks is most commonly June-September. In tropical
and sub-tropical areas influenza activity tends to have less distinct peak
seasons and may occur throughout much of the year, but often with two
periods in which increased activity occurs. Based on rather limited data
it appears that in the Southern Hemisphere tropical/sub-tropical regions
the first peak is often around February-March with a second around
September-October.
