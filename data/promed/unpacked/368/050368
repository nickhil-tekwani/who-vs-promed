One person has died and 60 people have reportedly been hospitalised in the dysentery outbreak in the northern mountainous province of Lai Chau. Although the outbreak has been under control, the risk of a reoccurrence is high, the provincial Preventive Health Centre said. Report from the health clinic in Phong Tho District's Ma Ly Chai Commune showed that the 1st cases of dysentery were reported in late February [2017] with typical symptoms such as fever, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

In late April [2017], 27 cases were found, causing an outbreak in the commune. The health centre in Phong Tho District also reported 11 patients suffering from dysentery. The illness claimed the life of a 72 year old woman. All the patients tested positive for _Shigella flexneri_ -- a bacterium that causes dysentery.

The reason for the outbreak was unhygienic habits of patients. The hot weather along with high humidity also contributed to the development of the bacteria. A preventive health team has been mobilised for supervision in Ma Ly Chai Commune. Those who are suspected of having the disease must be strictly observed. Chloramine B for sterilisation has been sent to the commune to prevent the spread of the disease.

Dr Tran Thị Lien, director of the Preventive Health Centre, said that they have asked the district's authority to support residents' water tanks and soaps and chloramine B. The centre has antibacterial medicines to treat those at high risk. There are 4 villages in Ma Ly Chai Commune with 99 percent of Hà Nhì ethnic minorities. Only 7 percent of them have hygienic toilets.

_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL]
