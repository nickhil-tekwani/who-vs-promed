In reply to comments of both moderators, please find below some
information from CIRAD Guadeloupe in charge of the surveillance of
West Nile virus (WNV) in Guadeloupe for the veterinary services.

The event was discovered in Guadeloupe thanks to an annual sentinel
study on seronegative equines in 7 areas considered to be at risk for
West Nile virus following a risk analysis study.

Samples were tested by WNV epitope blocking ELISA at CIRAD
Guadeloupe, confirmed by IgG ELISA and PRNT at AFSSA France. The
event demonstrates the 1st seroconversions of equines in Guadeloupe
since 2003. Seroconversion are thought to have occurred between
August 2007 (date of the last negative tests for these equines) and
April 2008 since the equines were tested positive in July 2008 by IgG
ELISA but negative by IgM ELISA, and the average duration of WNV IgM
is considered to be around 3 months.

Equines were not vaccinated; the source of infection is unknown and
could be related to either an increase in circulation of WNV or to a
new introduction. No clinical sign was observed as already described
during the major seroconversion period in 2002-2003.

For more information on past activities of WNV in Guadeloupe, please

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Thierry Lefrancois and pleased to
get some details on the current outbreak. It appears there were no
clinical signs apparent in horses and these were surveillance
samples. Thus, the source and cause of these seroconversions are
unknown at present. We also appreciate the references to previous WNV
in Guadaloupe.

This thread is now cut because future updates will be incorporated
into our West Nile virus update - Western Hemisphere series - Mod.PC]
