[Malaria is endemic in Chhattisgarh, with an annual incidence in the
local population of 10-50 cases per 1000 population per year (WHO
World Malaria Report 2010
<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_ind_en.pdf>).
The province has about 20 million inhabitants, so the reported 152 303
cases give an estimated incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 population.
