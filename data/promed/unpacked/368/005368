An Outbreak of Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Serogroup B Meningococcal Disease in a Military Base, 2017

On 23 Jul 2017, a hospital in Taoyuan reported a suspected case of meningococcal disease, who was a soldier in a military base, to Taoyuan Department of Health. After investigation, another 2 soldiers who served in the same base with the index case developed symptoms of meningitis and were reported subsequently. Blood cultures from all 3 cases yielded serogroup B _Neisseria meningitidis_ with indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. A total of 114 contacts received chemoprophylaxis with rifampin or ciprofloxacin. Nevertheless, the hospital laboratory found that the isolate from the index case was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Of the 98 contacts receiving ciprofloxacin as initial chemoprophylaxis, 54 contacts were offered azithromycin, while the rest 44 contacts declined. No secondary cases were identified in the contacts during the one-month follow-up period. The outbreak underscores the importance of antimicrobial surveillance of _Neisseria meningitidis_. The antimicrobial profiles of isolates from the cases should be reviewed and taken into consideration in terms of chemoprophylaxis for contacts.

[Household and other close contacts of persons with invasive meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and invasive disease, for which they should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ as soon as possible. Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the U.S. CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where fiprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected U.S. counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).
