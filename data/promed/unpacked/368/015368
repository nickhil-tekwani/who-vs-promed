A bacterium called _Streptococcus suis_ from pigs claimed 2 lives in North Viet Nam, the Central Tropical Disease Hospital in Hanoi announced.

The Central Tropical Disease Hospital has admitted 2 people infected with the bacterium, said Dr Nguyen Hong Ha, head of the hospital. Patients were rushed to the hospital in critical condition and they were suffering from serious complications such as abscess, meningitis, septicemia, and limb gangrene.

Most patients contract the _Streptococcus suis_ bacterium after eating undercooked infected pork, blood paste, or coming into direct contact with secretions from diseased pigs via open wounds or airborne [transmission].

Dr Ha warned people not to slaughter and eat diseased pigs and go to hospitals for timely treatment, or they will suffer severe complications, even death.

[The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus suis - Viet Nam: (QM, QG) human 20130123.1510728:

_Streptococcus suis_ is sub-divided into at least 34 serotypes that vary in pathogenicity. Serotype 2 is the most frequently isolated serotype from diseased animals. _S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis).

_S. suis_ can cause potentially fatal zoonotic infection in humans, namely meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97186/). Toxic shock may also occur if the strain produces the appropriate toxins.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
