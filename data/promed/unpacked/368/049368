Researchers at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology reported in the
current issue of Science Magazine that the global influenza epidemic of
1918, which claimed the lives of 20 million people, was caused by a mutated
virus that evolved in American pigs. The disease was spread in large part
by American troops being mobilized for World War I and shipped to many parts
of the world.
The research was conducted on a specimen of lung tissue taken from an Army
private based at Fort Jackson, SC.
(Thus the suggested name for the virus is Influenza A/South Carolina.)
Research involved partial sequencing of the genes for hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase, which are 2 key proteins in flu virus. The hemagglutinin
gene most closely matched that of swine flu. However, despite the close
resemblance, the 1918 virus is unlike any known influenza virus.
Because their study supports a widely held theory that flu viruses that
evolve in swine become the most virulent flu viruses affecting humans --
Asian flu (1957), Hong Kong flu (1968) and now Influenza A/SC (nee Spanish
flu) -- the researchers are calling upon health officials to set up a
worldwide program to monitor viruses in pigs. Currently, only humans are
monitored for influenza infections for the purpose of the annual redesign of
vaccines.
