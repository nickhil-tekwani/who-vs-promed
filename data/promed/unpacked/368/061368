Yaws and/or yaws-like skin lesions have been commonly observed and reported
in wild lowland gorillas and chimpanzees at specific locations in both the
Republic of Congo and Gabon. The distribution of yaws in ape populations
appears to be limited to specific areas, with some populations showing a
high prevalence of lesions, scars, and antibody titers consistent with yaws,
and other populations in neighboring areas apparently less or completely
unaffected. The disease appears to be common in lowland gorillas in some
parts of Gabon and in the northwest region of the Republic of Congo.
Lesions consistent with yaws have been reported very rarely (if ever)
in gorillas in the northern district of the Republic of Congo (Department
of Likouala), but a few descriptions and photographs of wild chimpanzees in
that same region appear to be consistent with yaws infections. Since both
species typically have heavily pigmented skin, it is important not to
falsely assume that all depigmented lesions or scars in these 2 ape species
are due to yaws infection versus trauma or other dermatopathies.
Given the fact that yaws lesions have been suspected in human populations for
0.5 to 1.5 million years, and given that the organism is spread mainly by
direct contact, it is interesting to speculate about why only some ape
populations appear to have the disease circulating. If there has indeed been
cross-species transmission, one explanation could be the release by their
village owners of infected pet chimpanzees or gorillas. Another could be the
opposite direction of transmission, i.e. the infection of humans from the
handling of great apes hunted for meat. It is likely that both of these
scenarios have been occurring for millennia and we are just beginning to
recognize the possible consequences. Of course, a more traditional hypothesis
is possible. _Treponema_ organisms evolved along with apes and hominoids,
and the infections we see in the 3 modern-day species are genetically
distinct and possibly host-specific.
