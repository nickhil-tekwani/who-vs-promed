[Thus, there was an additional diagnosed death and case in Greater
Glasgow & Clyde. Without clarification, this could be a moribund case
that died on admission (adding to both columns at the same time) or
was an additional case now being treated (confirmed case +1) and the
death of a case under treatment (deaths +1). Numerically, it makes
little difference, but it does in judging clinical success. Being
reported on a Monday, the events were probably confirmed over the
weekend. The CFR is now 37 percent.

A number of cases have also been identified in England: see
<http://www.hpa.org.uk> for information on these cases.
The latest report on the 3 English cases was issued on 1 Mar 2010;
