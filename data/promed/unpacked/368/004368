Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] has caused at least 6 deaths and 397 cases
this year [2007] in Honduras, a health source indicated.
Up until the past 14th [Jul 2007], the Honduras Ministry of Health had
certified
5 deaths and 297 DHF cases, while 6038 were affected by classical
dengue fever.
Nationally, in the entire past year [2006] there were 6 deaths and 72
affected by DHF, as well as 7800 cases of classical dengue fever,
according to the records of the Ministry of Health.
The Honduras [health] authorities are maintaining a "yellow alert" for
[dengue] prevention in Tegucigalpa and a "green alert" for caution in
4 departments [state or province equivalents. - Mod. TY] in the face
of the high dengue incidence.

The Ministry of Health says there have been reported cases of dengue
fever in Belize as well as in neighboring countries. Ethan Goff,
Epidemiologist, [said] “There has been an increase in Guatemala,
Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, and also earlier this year [2007] there
was an increase in Mexico in the state of Quintana Roo, which is the
state bordering Belize.
"In the country of Belize so far [in 2007] we have identified 47
possible cases. There are cases that showed the signs and symptoms,
the symptoms that you usually find with dengue. The first case was
identified in March, but that was only one, and that was in Corozal.
Since then up until July -- April, May, June, and July -- we have been
identifying sporadically other possible [dengue] cases and those cases
have been investigated and some have been confirmed as being dengue
positive in Corozal and in Belize district. The ones in Corozal were
actually in May, and the ones in Belize were actually June and July
[2007]. They were 17 cases in Corozal, and in Belize there are 10 that
have been tested as positive for antibody. That does not actually mean
that they are positive for dengue, it just means that they are
positive for a virus that could be dengue. But based on that and the
symptoms, we believe [that they are] dengue cases. The cases are
actually being investigated and measures are being put in place at the
level of the health regions.”

[ProMED would be interested in further information when the results of
the tests
for dengue virus infection are available, and in knowing which of the
4 dengue serotypes are involved in this outbreak.

[In addition to the report for Honduras given above, this article provides
a summary of recent dengue cases in other Central American countries.
Mod. TY]
With the arrival of the rainy season, there has been a resurgence in dengue
in Central America, causing epidemics in some of the countries of the region,
where the more lethal variety [syndrome; DHF] has begun to cause fatalities.
Nicaragua
---------
43 cases of DHF have been confirmed, there are an additional 202
suspected [DHF cases], with 446 confirmed and 5055 suspected cases of
classical dengue fever. This year [2007] 5 people have died of the
dangerous variety [DHF].
Costa Rica
----------
Another of the affected countries, although up until now no fatalities
have been recorded. With more than 8300 ill [individuals with dengue]
up to the 1st week of July [2007], the number of dengue cases has
increased 123 percent compared to the same period last year [2006].
The principal zones affected [by the epidemic] are the Caribbean and
Pacific coasts -- [the areas] most frequented by tourists.
Panama
------
Has recorded 1252 classical dengue [fever] cases so far this year [2007].
Guatemala
---------
With 1402 [dengue] cases, there has been an increase of 20 percent as of
mid-June [2007] in comparison with 2006. The disease has caused one
death. There is a risk of epidemic outbreaks in half of the 22
departments of the country, according to the Ministry of Health.

The 3rd death due to dengue [occurred] in Aragua
------------------------------------------------
The newest victim recorded last month [June, 2007] in Aragua State
[was due to] DHF. [These fatalities] from this disease included an
infant, another child and a woman of 25 years.
This information was confirmed by the president of the Regional Health
Corporation, Humberto Trejo, who indicated that all the victims were
from the southern zone of the Marino (Tumero) municipality. They have
redoubled preventive measures to eradicate mosquito breeding sites in
this jurisdiction, as they have [attempted to do] in Girardot,
Libertador, Linares Alcantara, Mario Briceño Iragorry, Zamora y Sucre,
which have high indices of positive [dengue] cases also.
The representative of the central regional health organization
attributed the increase in [dengue case] statistics to the [previous]
6 years when the disease was silent, [setting the scene] for
significant outbreaks that "put us in a situation of relative
emergency".

The number of dengue cases recorded by the Bahia Secretary of Health
in the first 6 months of this year [2007] are 63 percent of those last
year [2006]. More than 6000 persons have been infected [by dengue virus
transmitted] by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the state.
In Salvador [the state capital], the disease has afflicted 517 people,
of whom 16 had the most serious type, DHF. [Of the DHF cases], 3 died
-- 2 in Salvador and one in Ipira, in the interior of the state. In
2006, there were 4 deaths.
An analysis by the Ministry of Health, referring to the first semester
of 2007, revealed that the dengue cases recorded in 4 northeastern
states have now exceeded the number infected in all of 2006 --
Paraiba (132 percent [increase]), Maranhao (55 percent), Pernambuco
(23 percent) and Piauí (22 percent).
Despite the number of [dengue] cases not having exceeded that of 2006,
the cases reported in the first semester of 2007 in Alagoas equals 85 percent
of last year's [2006] cases. [Up to] now Ceara has had 64 percent of
2006 cases. These figures are from the Ministry of Health.
According to Cristiane Cardoso, coordenator of Epidemiological Surveillance of
the municipality [of Salvador], the increase in numbers of cases might
represent, in reality, efficiency in reporting of the disease. "Due
to the campaigns to fight and prevent [dengue], people seek medical
services when they have the first [dengue] symptoms." she said. Of
the 16 cases of DHF recorded in Salvador this year, 7 were diagnosed
in the Cuoto Maia Hospital.
