The Head Veterinary Surgeon of Ukraine has sent his resignation
-----------------------------------------------
Today [6 Dec 2005], Petro Verbytsky announced his resignation in the
parliamentary session. He also urged the government of Ukraine to sign it
as soon as possible.
As a reminder, the bird flu outbreak was provoked by a lack of preventive
measures. The 1st cases were registered 2 months ago, but the government
and the local authorities did not respond.

[If indeed the 1st Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) cases in Crimea
were registered earlier (September? October? 2005), this will fill in a
missing link and complete the mapped trail of virus spread, from southern
Siberia to the Balkans: in July 2005 -- Novosibirsk; in August 2005 --
Altai Territory, Chelyabinsk region, Kurgan Region, Novosibirsk region,
Omsk region and Tiumen region; later in August 2005 -- Kalmykia (media
reports, no official confirmation; see item 3); in October 2005 -- Romania,
Turkey, Croatia. See BBC bird migration map, cited in 20051018.3041

The reporting of cases in wild swans in the Volga delta, Astrakhan (see
further item 3 and comments), is an additional piece of information to
support the (not yet unequivocally proven) likely assumption on the role of
migratory birds in the spread of H5N1 HPAI. - Mod.AS]

Ukraine Backs State of Emergency to Fight Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------------
Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday [6 Dec 2005] endorsed President Viktor
Yushchenko's decision to declare a state of emergency to combat a bird flu
outbreak, despite some lawmakers' claims that the move was excessive.
Yushchenko put 3 regions in the Crimean peninsula under an indefinite state
of emergency on Saturday [3 Dec 2005], after the country recorded its 1st
case of type H5 bird flu.
The parliament supported the measure following a raucous session, but urged
the president to specify the order by saying how long the state of
emergency would last and what extra powers it gave local officials.
"Today it is better to do much more than necessary than tomorrow to have
this problem throughout the whole of Ukrainian territory," Emergency
Situations Minister Viktor Baloga said during an emergency parliamentary
session. Under Ukraine's Constitution, parliament must meet within 2 days
of the president's order to confirm the state of emergency, which can be
declared when there is a "threat to the population's life and health."
It was the 1st time since the 1991 Soviet collapse that a state of
emergency was enacted in Ukraine, Baloga said.
Baloga defended the government's response as "justified," even as lawmakers
grumbled that when bird flu appeared in neighboring Russia, a state of
emergency was not declared. They also complained that Yushchenko did not
specify when the emergency state would end. On Monday [5 Dec 2005],
Yushchenko suggested it would last 2 weeks. Mykhailo Pozhivanov, a lawmaker
in Yushchenko's party, warned the measure could hurt Ukraine's image and
scare away tourists from the Black Sea resort area.
Veterinary authorities have detected new bird flu cases in a southern
Russian region, but it is yet to be determined whether it is the deadly
Asian strain, Interfax reported Tuesday [6 Dec 2005], citing a regional
veterinary official. [Information on this report -- referring to southern
Russia -- is requested. - Mod.AS]

[On 7 Dec 2005, the Russian news agency Interfax reported: "Poultry death
registered in 4 more villages in Crimea." Confirmation or otherwise will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu quarantine lifted in Russian provinces
-----------------------------------------------
The quarantine imposed in relation to bird flu will be lifted in the last
Russian communities on Wednesday [7 Dec 2005].
"The quarantine period is expiring in all communities where the disease was
registered in the public sector and homesteads. The last quarantine will be
lifted on Wednesday [7 Dec 2005]," Sergei Dankvert, head of the Federal
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service (Rosselkhoznadzor), told Interfax.
Dankvert said monitoring and preventive efforts will continue, because bird
flu remains in wildlife. He reminded Interfax that the disease caused the
death of swans in Astrakhan region [see comment]. "But there was no die-off
of poultry," he said.
Dankvert said that initial sampling did not confirm bird flu in Kalmykia.
"In addition, Rosselkhoznadzor missions have inspected the entire coastal
zone of the Volga. Birds have stopped dying," he said.
Since the beginning of the epidemic, bird flu has been confirmed in over 60
communities in 8 constituent territories of Russia. In over 90, the bird
flock was under suspicion. Migrating birds, mainly from Southeast Asia,
spread the disease.
The Russian Poultry Union has estimated the related damage at over 100
million rubles [approximately USD 3.5 million].

[Russia's last follow-up report to the OIE was sent on 19 Oct 2005,
notifying the outbreak in Tula region. According to FAO's update on Avian
Influenza No. 35, 5 Nov 2005 (see 20051106.3251), additional outbreaks have
been recorded in Russia as follows:
- Ioujnii Village, Tambov Region (21 Oct 2005);
- Sunaly Village, Chelyabinsk Region (22 Oct 2005);
- Morshansk, Morshanskogo, Tambov Region (24 Oct 2005);
- Pokrovka Village, Altai Territory, Sunaly, Chelyabinsk Region and
Streltsy Settlement, Tambov Region (26 Oct 2005);
- Novichiha Settlement, Altai Territory Rozovka Settlement, Omsk Region
near the border with Kazakhstan (27 Oct 2005);
- Polovinnoe Village, Kurgan Region (29 Oct 2005);
- Grjaznova Village, Altai Territory and Shatrovo Village, Chelyabinsk
Region (31 Oct 2005);
- Shatrovo, Chelyabinsk Region (1 Nov 2005);

For a time-line on bird-flu in Russia, see
<http://en.rian.ru/russia/20051115/42093297-print.html>.
The outbreak in wild swans in Astrakhan (the Volga delta, bordering
Kalmykia on the west, Kazakhstan on the east and the Caspian sea on the
south), was not included in the above list because it did not affect
domestic fowl. The event was published by CNN on 23 Nov 2005:
"....Meanwhile, Russian veterinary authorities said Tuesday [22 Nov 2005]
that bird flu had been detected in a southern region and that measures were
being taken to prevent it from spreading, AP reports.
The country's veterinary service identified the H5 type of bird flu in 200
swans that were found dead in the Volga River delta in the Astrakhan
region, the Agriculture Ministry said. It had not yet been determined
whether it was the H5N1 strain." See
<http://edition.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/conditions/11/23/birdflu/>.
Final results of laboratory testing of the swan material will help.
Astrakhan has suffered recently cases of West Nile fever; West Nile virus
is known to be spread by migratory birds and several years ago caused a
major outbreak in Romania.
Romania and Croatia reported cases of HPAI H5N1 in wild swans during
October 2005. The Croatian notification to the OIE mentioned 1500 wild
migratory swans, of which 15 birds died. The mute swan is to be found
extensively across Europe, Asia, North America, South Africa, Australia and
New Zealand. Northern populations in Europe might migrate to and winter in
warmer areas in the northern Levant and the Black & Caspian Seas. It will
be interesting to obtain information on recent seasonal movements of mute
swans into and from these areas, and results of epidemiological and
virological surveillance in this species, if undertaken. - Mod.AS]
