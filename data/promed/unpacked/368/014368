Family members are poisoned after eating a meal of toxic fish
--------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 members of one family from Suez have (been diagnosed
with) acute food poisoning, from eating a meal of a toxic fish which
is banned from hunting or eating. These fish are highly toxic and kill
within hours unless the antidote is given in a timely manner.

Major General Adel Rifaat, Security Director of Suez had received a
communication from the Suez General Hospital stating the arrival of 5
members of one family, who showed symptoms of acute poisoning as a
result of eating a meal of fish.

On a related matter, there are currently warnings in the governorates
of Suez and the Red Sea to refrain from eating the [Alakrbeh] fish.
The General Union of Fishermen has said to refrain from fishing of
many species of poisonous fish in the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf
of Suez and the Lakes region, which cause poisonings. This fish is
also known as "sea-chicken" or "sea cat."

[This fish is in the same family as the rock fish, the lion fish and
the scorpion fish. These fish are very toxic and while similar to the
Alakrbeh fish, the Alakrbeh fish is extremely toxic. Natives to the
area never eat the fish. Therefore, the fish became mixed up with
others in some type of stew or mixed dish, or these folks were not
native to the area. - Mod.TG]

[ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on the toxin
associated with the Alakrbeh fish. Extensive internet searching in
English and Arabic (using machine translation) did not identify the
toxin. It should be noted that the rock fish, the lion fish and the
scorpion fish are all fish that have toxins in spiney protrusions and
human intoxication occurs when there is physical contact with these
poisonous spines. From the above description, it appears as though
this fish may have toxin in the actual flesh or in organs if the
individuals were poisoned through eating fish cooked in a stew.
Clarification and identification of the actual toxin would be greatly
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
