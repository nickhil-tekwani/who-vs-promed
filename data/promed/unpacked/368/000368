Three cases of suspected botulism have been reported in Meath and Kildare. On one farm, 20 beef animals, worth close to EU 30 000 [USD 35 000], died within a period of hours. It is understood that up to 10 animals died in the other suspected cases.

Speaking in the Dail last week, Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said poultry litter containing "residual poultry carcasses" must be disposed of in an incineration plant approved by the Department of Agriculture or the EPA, or in an approved rendering plant.

He also stressed only haulers who are registered with the Department of Agriculture are permitted to transport poultry litter.

"The material must be transported in covered, leak-proof containers or vehicles which are maintained in a clean condition with signage stating 'Category 2 Material - Manure,'" said Minister Creed.

He was replying to Deputy Timmy Dooley, who requested clarification on the disposal measures, transport regulations, and compliance requirements for those disposing of or using poultry litter.

Minister Creed added that "enforcement action," including the issuing of a compliance notice requiring a particular action and also the use of criminal sanctions, is provided for within the EU regulations for poultry litter.

Botulism is one of the world's deadliest toxins. Sniffing as little as 13 billionths of a gram of the toxin can be lethal. It is fatal within hours once ingested by an animal.

While poultry manure that does not contain "residual poultry carcasses" is a usable soil fertiliser, it must be spread without delay, and, in the event that the material is being held for a short time prior to land-spreading, strict control measures are required to be taken, Minister Creed said.

It is understood that actions related to the handling and use of poultry litter, which may have contributed to the animal losses in Meath and Kildare, are now being considered for compliance with the statutory EU regulations.

[It is unfortunate that some chicken carcasses may have been in the litter, presumably used for fertilizer.

Certainly 20-30 bovines are a substantial number, but often in these cases, the death count is much higher.

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf):

"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.

"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxico-infectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution

"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.

"Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog."

The preliminary suspicion of botulism in cattle may be based upon the very typical signs and symptomatology. However, laboratory confirmation is required to exclude other possible etiologies, such as ionophores [polyether compounds] intoxication.

Botulism is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases.
