Botulism in blue foxes - Finland: Botulinum toxin type C detected in feed
--------------------------------------------------
As investigated in the Botulinum laboratory at the Department of Food and
Environmental Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of
Helsinki, animal feed containing botulinum toxin type C was confirmed to
cause botulism in blue foxes in Finland. Of the so individual raw material
components used for preparing the toxic feed investigated so far, none
contained botulinum toxin. Low numbers of _Clostridium botulinum_ types B
and E cells or spores were detected in individual feed components by a
multiplex PCR assay, but the significance of this finding in the entire
epidemic has not yet been determined.

[Botulinum type C toxin has been incriminated in almost all instances of
intoxication in minks and foxes; storage of meat by-products in metal
drums, in which anaerobic conditions prevail, provides excellent conditions
for production of the toxin. The reported absence of the incriminated C
toxin in the various feed components may indicate that the contamination
occurred incidentally after the mixing or manufacture of the final toxic
batch. Birds, in which toxicoinfection by Botulinum type C is not uncommon,
are plausible candidates. - Mod.AS]
[The proposed mechanism may well be as moderator AS has suggested in his
comments above, but there are several additional questions that come to
mind -- food for thought. The individual ingredients were tested, but was
the final feed tested? Did the mixer have any foreign material in
it? Was the feed mixer cleaned well? The fact that the foxes died on 30
to 40 different farms tends to go against the theory of contamination
having occurred at the feeding site. Was there any additive sprayed on the
food? Often times digest and flavoring are added to canine or carnivore
food. Was this tested for _Clostridium botulinum_ spores and toxin? - Mod.TG]
