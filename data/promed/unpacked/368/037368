Two people in Greece have contracted the West Nile virus [WNV], which is carried by infected mosquitoes, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) said on Wednesday [27 Jun 2018] in its weekly epidemiological data posted on its website.

The two patients who were diagnosed with the virus are the 1st cases recorded in 2018 and are in stable condition, the disease control agency said.

KEELPNO said the patients are from western Attica but noted that the virus' circulation areas in the current season cannot be safely predicted, as WNV's epidemiology is determined by many factors.

Outbreaks of the virus in humans and animals were recorded every year between 2010 and 2014, and in 2017 during the summer months in various regions of the country. The agency said it expects more cases during the year [2018].

[WNV is transmitted to humans via infected mosquito bites. The transmission period is typically between mid-summer and early autumn when mosquitos are most active. Most people infected with WNV have no symptoms, but 20 percent develop West Nile fever, a flu-like illness that causes fever and body aches. Less than one percent of infections progress to diseases with severe neurological manifestations, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis.

Greece has reported WNV cases since 2010 and has a well-defined surveillance program in place https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434877/. Key characteristics of West Nile virus (WNV) infection surveillance in Greece include human, animal and vector surveillance as well as inter-sectoral collaboration. - Mod.UBA
