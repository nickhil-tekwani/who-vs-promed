Bubonic plaque found in Flagstaff wildlife
------------------------------------------
Health officials in Coconino County, AZ, say they've found bubonic plague
in wild animals in a Flagstaff suburb. They're warning people to avoid
contact with wild animals and to treat their pets for fleas.
A pair of prairie dogs were found dead last month [Jul 2007] in Doney Park,
north east of the city. A lab at Northern Arizona University confirmed the
presence of the disease after testing fleas found in the animals' borrows.
Plague is transmitted by fleas from infected animals.
County environmental specialist Hugh Murray says plague is ever-present in
the Flagstaff area. No human cases of the disease have been reported in the
county since 1996.

[The commonest animals in the west [found to suffer plague] are prairie
dogs, squirrels, or one of the varieties of ground squirrel. This article
mentions prairie dogs, but suggested to me that perhaps other wildlife had
been affected.
The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people through
fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each rodent species is
host to one or more species of fleas which, when infected, are carriers.
These fleas generally do not infest other animals unless their natural
hosts are unavailable.
Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They
may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as
a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellants
appropriate for pets and available. Some products may be suitable for dogs
but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be
sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats,
kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.
