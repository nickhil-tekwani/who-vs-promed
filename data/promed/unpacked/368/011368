Siberia is facing an historic battle against a tiny but sometimes deadly arachnid, the tick. In a vast Russian region that is frequently hit by flooding and wildfires and has not been spared from the coronavirus, ticks and the diseases they transmit are shaping up as another major challenge this year [2020].

"I was just walking along a paved path when a tick bit me," says TR, a resident of Krasnoyarsk, a regional capital and the 3rd-largest city in Siberia. "They say they are everywhere in the grass. We have a lot of ticks this year [2020], not only in the parks and the forest, but even on city streets."

Reported tick bites in the sprawling Krasnoyarsk region, which stretches up from the lands north of Mongolia to the Arctic shore, are up 400 per cent over the same time last year [2019], and the tick season is only just getting under way. According to government statistics, 1925 people reported bites in the week of 22-28 May [2020] in the region, and more than 10 000 bites have already been reported in 2020. Cases of ticks found to be infected with tickborne encephalitis [virus] have been identified in 57 of the region's 61 administrative districts. The problem is equally prevalent in other regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East, as well as parts of western Russia.

"We are seeing a high level of activity of naturally occurring tick-borne infections," the press service of the Krasnoyarsk branch of Rospotrebnadzor, the state consumer-protection agency, told RFE/RL. "The number of ticks is significantly greater than average." The cause, the officials said, was the region's unusually mild winter followed by the early onset of spring. "The weather conditions enabled the main hosts for ticks -- forest-dwelling rodents -- to survive the winter well," the agency said. "Their numbers have grown, and the number of ticks has increased correspondingly. As a result, the 2020 season has seen an active outbreak of tickborne encephalitis."

To make matters worse, scientists of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences say they are tracking a relatively new tick that is a hybrid of the common taiga (_Ixodes persulcatus_) and Far Eastern (_Ixodes pavlovskyi_) ticks (see ProMED-mail. Ixodes tick hybrids - Russia: Siberia region 20200608.7441189). The hybrid tick seems to be capable of transmitting to humans all the parasites of both the more common types, including 4 types of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, encephalitis, Kemerovo tickborne viral fever, and Siberian tickborne typhus (Rickettsia).

In addition, experts believe the hybrid tick might be more adaptable to various environments and capable of vastly expanding its geographical range.

The head of the regional Health Committee, Marina Garashchenko, said: "At present, there is no immunoglobulin for the prevention of tickborne encephalitis in the Russian Federation." Citizens, she wrote, had been repeatedly advised "to refrain from visiting natural places not treated against ticks."

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus infections in Russia are common. This is the season of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia. Russia, especially western Siberia, has the largest number of reported TBE cases.

Although the above report states that there is a high level of tick-borne infections, presumably including TBE virus, no case numbers are given. For additional details on TBE, see Mod.LL's extensive comments drawn from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/tickborne-encephalitis). The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. It is curious that no vaccination of people resident in or visiting the areas of high tick abundance is mentioned. - Mod.TY
