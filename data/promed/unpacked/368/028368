Study suggests BA.2 COVID-19 subvariant more contagious
-------------------------------------------------------
A study on how omicron subvariants transmit in Danish households found that the BA.2 subvariant is substantially more transmissible than the original variant, researchers reported yesterday in preprint findings. [FP Lyngse, CT Kirkeby, M Denwood. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC subvariants BA.1 and BA.2: Evidence from Danish Households. medRxiv 2022.01.28.22270044; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.28.22270044]

BA.2 is now dominant in Denmark, with levels rising in other countries, raising questions about how fast current surges will decline. In South Africa, which first reported the original omicron variant, BA.2 levels are increasing, but against the backdrop of decreasing infections, Tulio de Oliveira, PhD, who directs South Africa's Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said yesterday [30 Jan 2022].

Less transmission from breakthrough cases
-----------------------------------------
The group examined secondary attack rates in households that had a primary case between 20 Dec 2021 and 11 Jan 2022, looking at differences in transmission between BA.2, BA.1 (the original omicron variant), unknown, and delta variants. Of the households, 2122 had an initial BA.2 case, and 6419 had a primary BA.1 case.

They found that the secondary attack rate was substantially higher for BA.2 than BA.1, estimating that the rate was 39% for BA.2 and 29% for BA.1.

When the team looked at susceptibility differences, they found that BA.2 was associated with increased susceptibility in unvaccinated people, fully vaccinated people, and those who had received boosters compared with BA.1. They also found that unvaccinated primary cases involving BA.2 were more likely to transmit the virus, compared to those who had the original strain. However, they didn't find increased transmissibility from vaccinated or boosted people who had BA.2 breakthrough infections.

Frederik Plesner Lyngse, PhD, the study's 1st author who is with the University of Copenhagen and Denmark's Statens Serum Institute, said on Twitter that it's important to sort out the difference between the 2 omicron variants, because BA.2 is very different than BA.1, differing by about 40 mutations. He noted that BA.2 increased rapidly in Denmark, rising from 0% of sequences samples on 6 Dec 2021 to 47% of sequenced samples on 11 Jan 2022 [https://twitter.com/LyngseF/status/1488055615465340929].

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in its latest update that BA.2 is now dominant in Denmark.

Commenting on the study, Eric Topol, MD, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said on Twitter than the BA.2 variant findings suggest 3-dose vaccination protects well against symptomatic infection, which goes against any increased immune evasion. He also added that BA.2's increased transmissibility will prolong the Omicron wave in many places. [https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1487961173148397569].

[2] Disabilities and COVID

COVID patients with disability prone to longer hospital stay, readmission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a disability were more likely than peers without a disability to have a longer hospital stay and be readmitted -- but were no more likely to die in the hospital or be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), finds a retrospective study today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). [Outcomes in patients with and without disability admitted to hospital with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [Brown HK, Saha S, Chan TCY, et al. CMAJ. 2022; 194(4): E112-E121; https://www.cmaj.ca/content/194/4]

University of Toronto researchers led the study of 1279 adults diagnosed as having COVID-19 and released from one of 7 hospitals in Ontario from 1 Jan-30 Nov 2020 -- well before the recent highly transmissible delta and omicron variants were circulating.

The team compared rates of in-hospital death, ICU admission, hospital length of stay, and unplanned 30-day readmission among those with and without a physical disability, impaired hearing or vision, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or intellectual or developmental disability.

"Consideration of disability-related needs has largely been absent from the COVID-19 response, with vaccine eligibility driven primarily by age and medical comorbidity, limited accommodations made for patients with disabilities who are in hospital, and disability data often not being captured in surveillance programs," the researchers wrote.

36% longer hospital stays, 77% more readmissions
------------------------------------------------
Of the 1279 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, median age was 66 years, 58% were men, and 22.3% had a disability, including physical disability (74.4%), traumatic brain injury or intellectual or developmental disability (8.4%), impaired hearing or vision (6.3%), or multiple disabilities (10.9%).

Patients with a disability were older than those without a disability and more likely to be women, live in long-term care facilities, and have chronic conditions. They also had a higher predicted baseline risk of death.

After adjustment, patients with a disability had 36% longer hospital stays than those without a disability (rate ratio, 1.36) and were 77% more likely to be rehospitalized (relative risk, 1.77). There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the two groups for in-hospital death or ICU admission.

The highest risk for poor outcomes was among patients with TBI, intellectual or developmental disabilities, and multiple disabilities.

In age-stratified analyses, the investigators saw longer hospital stays among patients with a disability than in those without in both patients younger than 65 years and older subgroups, while younger patients with a disability had the highest risk of rehospitalization.

In a CMAJ news release, Sandi Bell, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Health Care Standards Development Committee, said that 2.5 million Ontarians have disabilities. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941236]

"Yet throughout COVID-19, people with disabilities have been made to feel invisible," said Bell, who was not part of the study team. "We have become even more vulnerable, as maneuvering [through] the health care system has been difficult, confusing and scary. There is genuine demand for this type of data to help prioritize the needs of people with disabilities, which is what we believe Canadians would want to see."

Slower recovery, vulnerability to recurrent illness
---------------------------------------------------
The study authors noted that while people with disabilities have different activity limitations, they are more likely than others to contract COVID-19 because of factors that include coping with poverty, needing close-contact care, residing in congregate care settings, living in minority communities, and, in some people, having different abilities to comply with public health rules and recommendations. Once infected, they are prone to worse outcomes because of their high rate of underlying medical conditions.

"Longer hospital stays and higher risk of readmission among patients with disabilities may reflect slower recovery and increased vulnerability to recurrent illness because of physiologic differences," the researchers wrote.

The authors called for prioritization of people with disabilities for COVID-19 vaccination, accommodations for those who need support people, implementation of clinician training, minimization of care disruptions amid crises such as the pandemic, introduction of patient-oriented hospital release planning, and inclusion of disability-related data in COVID-19 surveillance.

"Future research should also evaluate the intersection of disability with gender, experiences of racism, and other social determinants of health, which may further affect COVID-19 outcomes," the researchers concluded. "Such efforts should be prioritized in the pandemic response to ensure equitable care for patients with disabilities who have COVID-19."

[3] Long COVID
Date: Mon 31 Jan 2022
Source: Vox [abridged, edited]
https://www.vox.com/22906853/omicron-long-covid-vaccinated-symptoms-cause


What causes long COVID? Scientists are zeroing in on the answer
---------------------------------------------------------------
Long COVID can develop after mild or even asymptomatic COVID-19, too. "If you say omicron's mild, it doesn't say anything about long Covid," Amy Proal, a microbiologist at the PolyBio Research Foundation, told me. "We don't even know how mild omicron is." The WHO has pushed back against calling omicron "mild," but it seems to result in less severe illness, especially among the vaccinated. This may be because it's better at evading the immune system, which isn't a good thing because it raises the possibility that the virus is remaining in the body, Proal added.

Vaccination appears to offer some protection against long COVID, but it's not clear how much. It certainly helps by preventing serious illness in the first place, and it may help clear the virus before it can lodge in the body for the long term. It also spurs the immune system to specifically target the virus, rather than raise defenses throughout the whole body, which could cause collateral damage elsewhere.

The sheer range of symptoms reported by people with long COVID -- more than 200 across 10 groups of organ systems, according to one patient-led survey -- makes uncovering their biological origins a gargantuan task. There are likely several subtypes of long COVID, each with its own cluster of symptoms and cause. "We're not talking about a monolithic, single entity," said Horwitz.

One of the primary functions of the immune system is to keep pathogens in line -- including those that live inside our bodies, like dormant viruses and normally benign gut bacteria. When it isn't working properly, these pathogens can act up and cause illness. "Patients might clear [SARS-CoV-2] itself from tissue, but immune dysregulation might allow other viruses and pathogens to reactivate and then drive chronic systems," said Proal. Epstein-Barr virus, for example, seems to be reactivated in people with COVID-19, and scientists are studying whether the herpes viruses and the common parasite Toxoplasma do the same.

It's possible, too, that the reactivation of these pathogens contributes to autoimmunity. Research recently published in Science posited that prior infection with the Epstein-Barr virus drives multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease, by spurring production of autoantibodies. Proal suggested that a similar mechanism could be at play in long Covid. "What it really means is that overall, autoantibodies can be generated as part of the immune system response to infection," she said.

Lingering virus may also be to blame
------------------------------------
One theory is that inflammation in tissues caused by persistent virus can trigger inflammation in the brain via the far-reaching vagus nerve, which runs the length of the spine and connects to the brainstem. A recent preprint from a team co-led by Yale's Iwasaki showed that mice with mild COVID-19 had activated brain microglia cells and higher levels of some inflammatory molecules. One of those molecules has been observed at high levels in the brains of long-haulers experiencing cognitive issues like brain fog. "You can start to see a scope of connected symptoms that can really make someone ill," said Proal.

Like the symptoms of long COVID, the research is all over the place. "It's a mess -- anyone who says they get it is lying," said Putrino. But patterns in the data are steadily emerging, which many of the researchers I spoke to attributed to collaboration among long COVID research teams and patient advocacy groups. Organizations like the Long COVID Alliance and Survivor Corps have been instrumental in helping recruit participants and lobby for much-needed funding since research on the condition began, they said.

Recent research identifying the people who are most at risk is especially promising. A small study recently published in Cell [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00072-1] named 4 factors that may put people at higher risk for long COVID: higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the blood in the early stages of infection, type 2 diabetes, reactivated Epstein-Barr virus (which infects over 90 percent of the global population), and the presence of certain autoantibodies -- which target the body's own cells as if they were intruders. Other risk factors could include low levels of antibodies called IgM and IgG3 and preexisting asthma, as a recent study in Nature Communications suggested. Bell cautioned, however, that such factors are for "research purposes only" and shouldn't be viewed as metrics for diagnosis." [Excerpts by Mary Marshall]

[In the past 24 hours, 46 countries including the USA (644 139), France (392 168), India (164 271), Spain (182 123), Russia (124 070), Germany (119 696), Brazil (102 616), Turkey (93 261), Switzerland (89 321), France(82 657), Israel (70 415), Italy (57 631), Argentina (43 472), Sweden (41 791), Hungary(40 047), Australia (38 199), Poland (33 477), Peru (50 044), Mexico (12 521), Portugal (27 916), Denmark (27 606), Austria (27 411), Czech Republic (24 018), Ukraine (22 026), Romania (31 683), Iran (28 995), Chile (28 241), Norway (15 988), Panama (19 722), Greece (19 731), Philippines (14 522), Serbia (15 352 ), Canada (19 144), Jordan (16 226), South Korea (16 085), Colombia (15 284), Ecuador (14 814), Finland (14 439), Bangladesh (13 501), Georgia (13 150), Vietnam (12 674), Ireland (13 363), Costa Rica (12 385), Indonesia (10 185), and Bulgaria (10 151), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 9807 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 29 Jan 2022 to late 30 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 89 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 89 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 15.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 19.3% decrease in daily reported cases and a 7.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.55 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 377.69 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.69 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA
