Measles cases 'spike' in 2 states
---------------------------------
Measles cases have spiked in 2 states, with national statistics
showing babies and young people have been hardest hit. The latest
report from the federal health department shows 58 official
notifications of the highly contagious disease in the 1st half of
this year [2008], compared to just 7 at the same time last year
[2007]. "This is due to several localised clusters and outbreaks in
New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD), and secondary cases
associated with cases who acquired measles outside of Australia," a
department spokeswoman said.

NSW has been most severely affected, with 38 cases, including a few
babies less than one year old. Nationwide, 10 children under the age
of 4 have been affected, while 17 involve adolescents and teenagers
and most of the remaining cases affect people in their 20s.

Both federal and state authorities have warned that a significant
proportion of those affected had not been immunised, or had only
received one dose of the 2-dose vaccine. The measles vaccine is
provided at age 12 months and 18 months, with a catch-up at 4 years
for those who have missed out earlier, leaving babies under one at
particular risk, the spokeswoman said.

Parents have been warned to watch for initial symptoms including
fever, fatigue, runny nose, coughing, and sore red eyes. These are
later followed by a rash that typically starts on the face and
spreads over the body, lasting a few days.
