Acute Salinomycin and Maduramicin Toxicosis in Lactating Sows. Authors: Britzi, M., Shimshoni, J.A., Edery, N., Cuneah, O., Younis, A., Blech, E., Oren, P., Perl, S.and Pozzi, P.S.
---------------------------------
The epidemiological investigation of an incident that killed 98 sows (170-220 kg b.w.) out of a total of 180 sows was described. The sows were at the beginning (1-2 weeks) of their lactation period. The incident started with the sudden death of 8 sows and lasted 20 days. No clinical signs of disease were observed prior to the death of the first animals while the remaining sows displayed clinical signs of ionophore toxicosis, including ataxia, recumbency, respiratory distress, lethargy and partial anorexia. The investigation consisted of clinical examinations, autopsy, blood and serum clinical chemistry, bacteriology, virology combined with chemical analysis of ionophores and the presence of pesticides in the feed. Three batches of identical feed were consumed by the affected sows. Lesions and degenerative changes were found only in the skeletal muscles and myocardium. Microscopically, degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle were characterized by hypereosinophilia, loss of cross-striation and fragmentation. Gross increase in liver enzyme activities and elevation of serum urea and creatinine values were observed. High levels of maduramicin (7.0 to 25.2 mg/kg) in 2 batches and salinomycin (2.0 to 42.1 mg/kg) in all three batches of feed were found. The results of the investigation indicated simultaneous ionophore poisoning by 2 agents, maduramicin and salinomycin, in a non-target species.

[The clinical signs shown by pigs intoxicated with ionophores are variable depending on the drug and the amount fed. In general, in cases of ionophore intoxication, pigs are off feed, weak, depressed, and no fever is present. Some pigs may be down with indications of neurological disease (not paddling), and some pigs may have respiratory difficulty.

Ionophores are a group of antibiotics used as feed additives to control bacterial and coccidial infections and to promote growth in poultry, cattle and swine.

Ionophores can be safe at the right dose in the right animal species. At least in the USA, only narasin is approved for use in swine. Other ionophores approved for other species having caused intoxications in swine are monensin, salinomycin, lasalocid and maduramicin.

On necropsy, there will be degeneration and necrosis of the muscle cells, which microscopically may be quite profound.

If the swine are being treated with tiamulin, it can interfere with the metabolism and excretion of ionophores and can result in toxic blood levels, even if the dosage of the ionophore in the feed might otherwise be safe. This does not appear to be the case, in the case reported here.

Ionophore intoxication in swine is not common but usually is quite dramatic when it does occur. - Mod.TG
