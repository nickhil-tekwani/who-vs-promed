Omaheke on Foot-and-Mouth Disease Alert
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry has intensified
efforts to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) from
Botswana into the eastern parts of Namibia. Following an outbreak of
the disease at Ghanzi, a town close to the Namibian eastern border,
officials from the ministry in the Omaheke Region have been holding
meetings with farming communities to sensitise them on the dangers of FMD.

The officials last week held a meeting at Otjombinde. Farmers from
the Eiseb Block area also attended the meeting, while a similar
meeting was held this week at Corridor 13 in the Aminuis
constituency. In addition to the meeting, veterinary service
officials assisted by police officials have also been patrolling the
border fence to ensure that animals do not cross the border, as well
as repair parts of the fence that might be damaged.

An official in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry at
Gobabis, Engelbertha Sorogwe, informed New Era that border officials
have been taking extra precautions to prevent the disease from
spreading into Namibia. Apart from banning the importation of all
animal products from the Ghanzi area, cars entering Namibia are being
sprayed with a disinfectant.

She noted that one of the common ways that FMD spreads is through the
movement of people. She added that the virus is carried on shoes,
clothes, luggage, bedding, interior and exterior of vehicles and on
tyres and so forth and thus all these items are being sprayed at the border.

Another means of infection is through the movement of infected
livestock such as cattle, goats and sheep.

"The movement of meat, milk, skins and other animal by-products is
also a serious source of infection and thus it has been banned for now."

She added that although FMD is not transmitted through water,
congregation of animals at water points will increase the spread of
the disease.

FMD is a highly infectious disease and has become a serious concern
in the trade of cloven-hoofed animals and their products. Importing
countries will not accept any product that originates from a zone
where the disease is occurring or has occurred in the recent past.

Sorogwe noted that it is important that farming communities work hard
to stop the disease from spreading into the country.

The management and control of FMD is governed by strict regulations
contained in the marketing agreement between Namibia and the European
Union (EU). These regulations are very clear in their description of
the control of FMD and are implemented by the department of
veterinary services.

Kuke fence upgrading starts
---------------------------
The Department of Veterinary Services has killed 1581 cattle in
Ghanzi District to prevent the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).

FMD control coordinator, Dr Letlhogile Modisa, said the cattle were
from New Look Farm, where the disease was first detected and from 2
neighbouring farms. "I am happy to report that we have finished the
first and very important part of the eradication exercise on the
11th," said Dr Modisa. He said the upgrading of Kuke fence to a 2.4m
[10 foot] game-proof double cordon fence has also started and will
cover an area of 200km [124 miles] from the Namibian border.

Dr Modisa noted that government has approved P24 million (USD 2 965
272) for the eradication exercise, saying it will cover
compensations, upgrading of the fence and personnel wages.

Addressing farmers at the Ghanzi Farmers Association general meeting
last week, Dr Modisa said they have managed to trace back and forth
all the animals that had left the district. He said the animals left
before the outbreak and were tested to satisfaction. He said only
goats, sheep, donkeys and horses were left at the affected farms in
the red zone, adding that they are keeping a close watch on them
because they were also susceptible to the disease. Dr Modisa, who is
also the deputy director of the Department of Veterinary Services,
said they were also keeping a close eye on other adjacent farms in
the yellow zone where the movement of animals is still not allowed.

Dr Modisa thanked farmers for their cooperation, but noted that they
had a few cases where farmers were not cooperative. On other issues,
Dr Modisa urged farmers to repair and strengthen their farm fences.

[The FMD outbreak (serotype SAT 2) in Ghanzi started, according to
Botswana's OIE reports, on 20 Oct 2008. A summary of the event,
including links to the immediate notification of 28 Oct 2008 and the
follow-up reports submitted 7 and 18 Nov 2008, with a map, can be accessed at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7459>.

The summary indicates that the outbreak is continuing and includes
the following epidemiological comment: "The area was a surveillance
zone and monitored by scheduled monthly inspections when the disease
was noted. The affected farm is south of the Kuke cordon fence.
Movement of people between the 2 zones also occurs through
decontamination sites. Patrols have been ongoing since outbreak in
zone 2c and movement of cloven hoofed stock and fresh products has
been disallowed since". Follow-up report No 3, submitted 18 Nov 2008,
includes the following additional, updated epidemiological comments:
"All the 3 affected farms have been depopulated. The last animal was
culled on 11 Nov 2008 in the infected area. No clinical cases were
observed after 4th and 3rd rounds of surveillance in infected and
surveillance zones respectively. 1410 cattle in surveillance and free
zones, and 273 sheep and goats in infected zone were blood sampled
for tests to antibodies to SAT-types FMD virus. Zone 12 is blockaded
with veterinary and security personnel and there are
disinfection/decontamination sites in strategic locations". All 3
reports include, under the article 'Control measures applied', the
information "Vaccination prohibited". Botswana was included by the
OIE in the list of countries "having an FMD-free zone where
vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter
2.2.10. of the Terrestrial Code". Botswana's free zones were
designated by the Delegate of Botswana in a document addressed to the
OIE's Director General in December 2006, enabling exports of meat
from such zone(s). However, as said above, Botswana has also zones
where vaccination is periodically applied.

To better understand the seriousness of the situation and its
potential implications, subscribers are referred to Ref 1, and in
particular to the map 'Botswana Veterinary Disease Control zones' on
page 16. As can be seen in the map, Ghanzi is situated in the
FMD-free (green) zone; this zone is separated from the adjacent
"vaccination zone" (rose), to its north, by the mentioned fence.

The Namibian concern about this outbreak reflects its potential
impact upon continued exports, mainly to the EU. The perception
thereupon in Botswana itself can be deduced from the following
newswire which deals, apparently, with the upgrading of a football
stadium. MP Shaw Kgathi is quoted as saying: "if it was not for
budgetary constraints caused by the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
outbreak and the Zimbabwean problem, Bobonong would have had a
stadium by now". (see "Botswana: Yizo Yizo Win Bobirwa Constituency
League" in AllAfrica of 20 Nov 2008, at
<http://allafrica.com/stories/200811200269.html>.

It will be helpful if more data become available on the current FMD
situation within other parts of Botswana, and in particular within
the above mentioned vaccination zone. Have disease cases been
observed within the zone? If affirmative, what was the vaccination
history of the affected animals? Had the vaccine undergone efficacy
tests and what were their results?
