The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Paoy Pet Commune,
Banteay Manchey Province in the north-west of the country. The outbreak
started on 14 June 1998 and has so far affected three villages - Khaal
Spean, Baliley and Kilo Leek Buon. Up to 29 June, 69 cases and 15 deaths
were reported. Control measures are being carried out by the Banteay
Meanchey provincial health authorities (Ministry of Health).
Current control measures include the following:
- Paoy Pet Health Center is functioning as a Cholera Treatment Center which
is open 24 hours a day.
- New case-finding is being carried out in Paoy Pet.
- A health education campaign by Banteay Meanchey health staff including
interpersonal and mass media communication directed at the general public
and village chiefs in and near Paoy Pet.
- Regular analysis of the cholera situation by collaborating with Banteay
Meanchey Health Department, the Ministry of Health, MSF, UNDP/CARERE and
the WHO country and Regional offices.
In 1997 a total of 155 cholera cases were reported in Cambodia, but in 1996
and 1995 a much higher number of cases occurred (4,190 and 3,085 cases
respectively).

[ProMED-mail's prior posting (980713081913 cited above) which was derived
from news media reports gives higher numbers for cases and fatalities for a
location spelled 'Poipet' in that translation. I presume these reports to
be referring to the same outbreak. The present report provides additional
information concerning the public health response, and some historical
perspective. - Mod.ES
