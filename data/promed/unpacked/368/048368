The Ministry of Health, Guinea has reported 2 cases of yellow fever on
20 Aug and 12 Sep 2008. The cases have been laboratory confirmed by
the Institut Pasteur, Dakar. The 1st case was reported in a
24-year-old male living in the sub-prefecture of Bounouma, Prefecture
of N'zerekore: the man reported first having symptoms on 26 Jul 2008,
and blood samples were taken on 4 and 5 Aug 2008. The 2nd case was
reported in the 3rd week of August 2008 in the Urban Commune of
N'zerekore in another 24-year-old male. Neither case had any history
of yellow fever vaccination.

A yellow fever outbreak investigation team composed of experts from
the MoH and WHO visited 10 sub-prefectures, the Urban Commune of
N'zerekore and 2 other sub-prefectures in the Prefecture of Lola, from
the 5-14 Sep 2008. The mission concluded that:
(i) according to the yellow fever case definition, 14 suspected cases
were found retrospectively, one of these cases died having presented
with symptoms of fever and jaundice;
(ii) Most of the prefectures were vaccinated in 2005 with a reported
coverage of 95%;
(iii) The only areas where a low coverage rate was reported (45%) were
Bounama sub-prefecture, Urban Commune and the Ivorian Refugee Camp of
Kouankan 2.

On the basis of these results, the Ministry of Health decided to carry
out a reactive mass vaccination campaign in these 3 areas, in October
2008, targeting 140 342 people. The campaign will be conducted with
the technical assistance of WHO and the support of the GAVI alliance
(the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization). The MoH has
submitted a request for yellow fever vaccine from the global emergency
stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine
Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG). The yellow fever
emergency stockpile is financed by the GAVI Alliance and managed by
the YF-ICG. The YF-ICG is composed of representatives from UNICEF,
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), the International Federation of the
Red Cross (IFRC), and the World Health Organization, which acts as its
secretariat.
