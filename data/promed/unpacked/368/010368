Anthrax kills 11 cows
---------------------
For the past 2 weeks, people in the remote Kumadzong village of Gongdue gewog [group of villages] in Mongar have been eating beef every day.

On 13 Jan 2012, the villagers reported to the gewog livestock extension office in Daksa, which is about 3 hours walk from the village, that 11 cows had died in their village since 31 Dec 2012. An anthrax outbreak is suspected to have killed all 11 cows that belonged to 5 households.

After the livestock extension officer visited the village, the carcass of the 11th cow was buried. Villagers told the officer that they had consumed the 1st 10. They have so far not reported with any illness.

Gongdue gewog's extension officer Arun Thapa said anthrax causes sudden death in cattle without prolonged sickness. The animals also bleed from their mouth, nose, and rectum. These were seen in the last carcass. "The sample could not be tested because of a lack of testing equipment in the centre but the disease is now control," he said. "No new cases have been reported."

Another 30 cows belonging to all 5 households in the village were also given antibiotics to prevent the disease from spreading in the locality.

Mongar's livestock officer Dorji Wangchuk said this is the 1st time an anthrax outbreak was reported in the district.

[Diagnosis appears to be based on the sudden death of these 11 animals, with bleeding from body openings of the last case. No blood smears were taken, fixed, and stained; nor were cultures done. That the villagers had butchered and eaten 10 carcasses without any developing the typical skin lesions, or gastroenteric symptoms, adds to one's doubts as to whether this was anthrax. One can only hope that the Bhutan government can update their diagnostic capacity and invest in Sterne vaccine to protect these and other cattle against future outbreaks as there will have been significant environmental contamination involved with the butchering of the 10 carcasses.
