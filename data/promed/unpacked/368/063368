This blastomycosis case in Ontario provides a firsthand example for me (an early career veterinarian) of a need for integrated surveillance between animal and human health sectors.

I am an associate veterinarian on Manitoulin Island, the same district as the recently posted case (ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - Canada: (ON) fatal 20150123.3112589). We (myself and clinic colleagues) noticed an increase in dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis in 2014, and in at least 2 cases, family members were also diagnosed.

Blastomycosis is an excellent example where our pets might act as sentinels, given that dogs are at a higher risk of contracting the disease. The amount of blasto we've seen this year [2015] has left me wondering how frontline veterinarians and physicians might communicate better to help reduce the disease burden of all our patients. There are numerous diseases that, while not zoonotic, have an environmental component shared by humans and animals alike. How can the 2 sectors collaborate to improve surveillance and control of these shared diseases? This case provides an opportunity to pose that question to the ProMED community.

[Dr. Gardner has made an excellent point that although blastomycosis is not a zoonotic disease, owners of affected animals may be at increased risk for the disease because of exposure to a common source. Blastomycosis occurs in several animal species, including horses, non-human primates, dolphins, and cats, but it is most commonly diagnosed in dogs. The finding of concurrence of blastomycosis in pet dogs and their owners has suggested to several authors of case reports a common environmental exposure for the dog and its owner (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807253/).
The environmental source of blastomycosis is believed to be soil with rotting leaves and decaying wood (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/blastomycosis/causes.html).
Pet dogs with blastomycosis could possibly act as "the canary in a coal mine," in signaling increased risk for the disease in the pet's owner, which could be especially a problem for an immunosuppressed owner; people with underlying immunosuppression are more likely to develop severe, potentially fatal blastomycosis. However, one study from Manitoba and northwestern Ontario found blastomycosis in a pet dog was not a risk factor for the disease in dogs' owners (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807253/).
This study found immunosuppression to be an independent risk factor for development of blastomycosis. People with significant immunosuppression I assume would be more likely housebound. If the owner of an "outdoor" dog with blastomycosis were housebound, this owner might not have been exposed to wooded areas where _Blastomyces_ is thought to reside to which their dog was exposed, which could explain why this one study found that canine blastomycosis was not a risk factor for the disease in the dogs' owners. - Mod.ML
