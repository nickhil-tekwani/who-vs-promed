THE CANADIAN NOSOCOMIAL INFECTION SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM: RESULTS OF THE FIRST
18 MONTHS OF SURVEILLANCE FOR METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS IN
CANADIAN HOSPITALS:
Introduction - The emergence of organisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial
agents is occurring worldwide. Among these organisms, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been found to have a major impact on patient
care and has been responsible for numerous outbreaks in hospitals. The
prevalence of MRSA increased from less than 3% in the early 1980s to rates as
high as 40% in many hospitals in the United States and Europe. The first
outbreak due to MRSA in Canada was reported in 1981. Since then, MRSA has
been identified in many Canadian hospitals and long-term care facilities.
community-acquired MRSA has also been described in aboriginal communities in
the prairie provinces. However, nationwide data describing the incidence and
epidemiology of MRSA infection in Canada were not available prior to 1995.
This report presents preliminary results of the first national MRSA
surveillance study, conducted as part of the Canadian nosocomial infection
surveillance program (CNISP).
Discussion - The epidemiology of MRSA in Canadian hospitals has been
different from that described in the United States and many other countries
for most of the past 15 years. In the United States, for example, MRSA
appeared to have spread rapidly and become endemic in many hospitals
throughout the 1980s, with prevalence rates as high as 10% to 40% of all S.
aureus isolates. In contrast, MRSA was not thought to be endemic in any
Canadian community or health-care facility. There have been relatively few
reports in Canada of institutional outbreaks of MRSA and these appeared to
have been controlled by implementing stringent infection-control measures.
The results of the first 18 months of CNRSP surveillance confirm that
isolation rates of MRSA remain substantially lower in Canadian centres
compared to those that have been reported in the United States. However,
the occurrence of MRSA is variable in health-care facilities in different
parts of the country. As noted recently, there has been a marked increase in
MRSA isolation rates in Ontario in the past 1 to 2 years; this increase has
been largely attributed to the spread of a single clone of MRSA that has
caused outbreaks in many Ontario centres.
Elsewhere in the country, MRSA isolation rates appear to remain stable and
low at less than 2%. Most MRSA cases appear to be hospital-acquired, but a
significant number of MRSA cases in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta are
community-acquired and associated with [Native Americans] living on reserves,
as previously described.
Although molecular typing of isolates by PFGE has indicated considerable
genetic diversity, there has also been evidence of both intra- and inter-
institutional spread of MRSA strains in Canada. The results of this study
may be limited due to the relatively small number of hospitals which
participated in the surveillance. However, most of these hospitals are
large, urban, tertiary- care centres. Whether these hospitals represent
sites in Canada where MRSA is more likely to be found is unknown, but large
tertiary-care hospitals in the United States have historically been
associated with the highest rates of MRSA. These results do provide an
accurate "snapshot" of MRSA in tertiary-care hospitals across the country,
and have relevance for other institutions because of the ease with which MRSA
is transmitted between health-care facilities, including those which are
smaller and community-based.
Although challenging and costly, control of MRSA within hospitals has been
feasible and considered to be cost-effective, provided aggressive control
measures are implemented rapidly. Successful control of antimicrobial
resistance also requires a good understanding of the extent and epidemiology
of the problem. Continued surveillance is essential as the situation with
MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant
enterococci, is constantly evolving.
