Slugs or snails infected with rat lungworm parasites [_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_] can pass them along to humans who happen to eat all or part of the tiny animals, often on raw, unwashed produce. The state confirmed today [16 Aug 2018] the 5th case of rat lungworm disease in a toddler from East Hawaii.

In May [2018], the Department of Health (DOH) found Oahu's 1st case of rat lungworm disease this year [2018] in a toddler from Central Oahu. The department would not say how the children contracted the disease, caused by a parasite that can move throughout the body and cause major damage to the nerves.

In 2017, the DOH confirmed 18 cases of rat lungworm and 3 probable cases. Most of the cases have been on Hawaii island. To confirm the disease, patients typically require a spinal tap to draw fluid that is tested for the presence of the parasite or its DNA. Cases are considered probable when patients exhibit symptoms of the illness but have not had a lab test.

This is the 3rd confirmed case of rat lungworm disease contracted on the Big Island this year [2018]. The DOH said the toddler started exhibiting symptoms in late July [2018] and last week [around 9 Aug 2018] was taken to the emergency room and subsequently hospitalized and transferred to an Oahu facility. The child was discharged after several days in the hospital. The Health Department is investigating possible sources of infection.

"Our children move quickly and are naturally curious about the world around them, which is a normal part of their early development," Aaron Ueno, Hawaii Island district health officer, said in a news release. "The risk of rat lungworm disease exists statewide, and we can work together to take steps to prevent it in our communities."

To prevent the spread of the potentially debilitating disease, the DOH recommends controlling the population of snails, slugs and rats around homes, gardens and farms. The department also urges residents to use traps and baits and wear gloves when working outdoors. People should also carefully inspect and wash produce, especially leafy greens, and store them in sealed containers.

[Infection with _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is by ingestions of snails and slugs, which are found on greens and lettuces. The health authorities in Hawaii have provided clear guidelines for the population to avoid infection. In February 2018, Hawaii established a task force to stop the outbreak; see the ProMED post below from 26 Feb 2018. - Mod.EP
