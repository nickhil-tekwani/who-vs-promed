Public health officials in OutbreakNet (the network of
epidemiologists and other public health officials, facilitated by
CDC, who investigate outbreaks of foodborne, waterborne, and other
enteric illnesses nationwide) are investigating a multistate outbreak
of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Wandsworth infections. Serotype
Wandsworth is rare.
Interviews comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons show that
consumption of Robert's American Gourmet brand Veggie Booty was
statistically associated with illness and, therefore, the most likely
source of the outbreak.
As of 10 Jul 2007 at 11AM ET, 60 persons infected with _S._
Wandsworth have been reported to CDC from 19 states: California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Among
the patients for whom clinical information is available, 77 percent
developed bloody diarrhea and 10 percent were hospitalized. No deaths
have been attributed to this infection. Onset dates, which are known
for 58 patients, ranged from 4 Mar to 15 Jun 2007. Most (90 percent)
cases have occurred in children aged 10 months to 3 years. During the
initial phase of the outbreak, the number of cases gradually
increased, with only 8 cases reported from 6 states before 1 May
2007. Health department and CDC investigators worked for weeks
conducting interviews with parents of ill children to develop
theories about possible sources of infection.
A multistate case-control study demonstrated a strong association
between illness and consumption of Veggie Booty, a snack of puffed
rice and corn with a vegetable coating. CDC OutbreakNet staff shared
this information with colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) on 27 Jun 2007. After being informed about the outbreak by FDA,
the company that manufactures the product issued a voluntary recall
on the following day [28 Jun 2007]. None of the 60 known illnesses
from _S._ Wandsworth had onset after the product recall date. Persons
are advised to discard any product in their possession.
OutbreakNet officials at CDC and in state and local health
departments, FDA, and the marketing and manufacturing companies are
working collaboratively to learn more about production of Veggie
Booty to determine how it may have become contaminated. The Minnesota
Department of Agriculture Laboratory (MDAL) has isolated the outbreak
strain of _S._ Wandsworth from 4 sealed bags of Veggie Booty obtained
from retail stores. MDAL also isolated _S._ Typhimurium, a different
strain of _Salmonella_, from an additional sealed bag of Veggie Booty
collected at the same time as the 4 bags positive for serotype Wandsworth.
On 2 Jul 2007, the company expanded the recall to include Super
Veggie Tings Crunchy Corn Sticks. This was done due to the company's
concern that Veggie Booty and Super Veggie Tings share ingredients
that could be contaminated. Persons should discard any Super Veggie
Tings in their possession. CDC is not aware of any human illnesses
associated with the consumption of Super Veggie Tings.

[In the week between CDC reports, there were 3 more cases reported,
one more state involved, and a 2nd serotype not clearly associated
with cases found. It is important to note that no cases have occurred
after the recalls in the USA and Canada. Although not confirmed in
the CDC reports, the company's new release, as reported below, stated
that the seasoning used on the snacks was the source and that it was
imported from China.

State and federal health officials say 57 people in 18 states,
including an Illinois resident, and almost all of them children, have
fallen ill from salmonellosis linked to a popular snack food called
Veggie Booty.
The snack company, based in New York, said Tue 3 Jul 2007, that a
seasoning imported from China and used on Veggie Booty and Super
Veggie Tings was the "likely cause" of contamination. China has been
in the spotlight recently as the source of tainted pet food and
seafood. But FDA spokesman, Michael Herndon, on Wednesday [4 Jul
2007], said it was too early in the investigation to speculate on the
cause. The agency is analyzing product samples taken from the
company's manufacturing plant.
