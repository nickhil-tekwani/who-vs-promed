CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg infections that is likely caused by
eating ground turkey. Public health investigators are using DNA
"fingerprints" of the bacteria to identify ill people who may be part
of this outbreak. The bacteria are obtained from diagnostic testing;
pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is used to determine DNA
fingerprint patterns. Investigators are using data from PulseNet, the
national subtyping network made up of state and local public health
laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs
molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. The outbreak strain of
_S._ Heidelberg is resistant to several commonly prescribed
antibiotics; this antibiotic resistance may be associated with an
increase in the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure
in infected individuals.

A total of 107 people infected with the outbreak strain have been
reported from 31 states between 27 Feb 2011 and 9 Aug 2011. The number
of patients identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1),
Arkansas (1), Arizona (3), California (6), Colorado (2), Georgia (2),
Illinois (13), Indiana (1), Iowa (2), Kansas (1), Kentucky (2),
Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (3), Maryland (1), Michigan (12),
Minnesota (2), Mississippi (1), Missouri (4), Nebraska (2), Nevada
(1), New York (2), North Carolina (3), Ohio (10), Oklahoma (1), Oregon
(1), Pennsylvania (5), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (2), Texas (14),
Utah (1), and Wisconsin (4).

Among those for whom information is available, illnesses began on or
after 27 Feb 2011. Patients range in age from less than 1 year to 89
years old, with a median age of 21 years old. 55 per cent are male.
Among the 64 ill people for whom information is available, 25 (39 per
cent) have been hospitalized. One death has been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies indicate that eating ground
turkey is the likely source of this outbreak. Among the 71 patients
about whom information is available, 40 (56 per cent) reported
consuming ground turkey. This proportion is significantly higher than
results from a survey of healthy people in which 11 per cent of those
interviewed reported consuming ground turkey in the 7 days before they
were interviewed. Product information (such as date and location of
purchase of ground turkey) is also being collected from ill people and
is being used by local, state, and federal public health, agriculture,
and regulatory agencies to further the investigation.

Cultures of 5 ground turkey samples purchased from 5 retail locations
between 7 Mar 2011 and 27 Jun 2011, yielded _S._ Heidelberg with the
outbreak strain. Preliminary information indicates that all of these
products originated from a common food-production establishment
(Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation in Springdale, Arkansas). These
products were obtained as part of routine sampling in the National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), and are not linked
to illnesses.

This is a multidrug resistant strain of _S._ Heidelberg. As of 5 Aug
2011, investigators have collected antibiotic resistance information
on isolates from 4 samples of ground turkey collected at retail and
from 9 ill people infected with the outbreak strain. The isolates from
the ground turkey samples are resistant to antibiotics including
ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin. The
sensitivity testing results, to date, indicate that isolates from
humans are also resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, and
tetracycline, and some are resistant to gentamicin; however, the
testing is not complete for all isolates. All human isolates are
sensitive to several common antibiotics that are used in clinical
practice such as ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antimicrobial resistance may increase
the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected
individuals.

A sample of leftover unlabeled frozen ground turkey was collected by
public health officials from the home of an ill person in Ohio
infected with the outbreak strain. Culture of the ground turkey sample
yielded the outbreak strain on 29 Jul 2011. In addition to the
outbreak strain with the "initial" PGFE pattern, a 2nd closely related
PFGE pattern of _S._ Heidelberg was identified in the contaminated
leftover product. Since 27 Feb 2011, a total of 23 patients have been
reported to PulseNet with this closely related PGFE pattern. Among the
8 such patients that have been interviewed to date, 6 (75 per cent)
report consumption of ground turkey in the week before their illness
began. The closely related PGFE pattern was also found in a retail
sample of ground turkey taken as part of NARMS [National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring System] surveillance. This retail sample
originated from Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation establishment in
Springdale, Arkansas. Based on these findings, the 23 ill people with
this second closely related PFGE pattern of _S._ Heidelberg have been
included in the total count of outbreak cases.

[Since the last update on this outbreak, 29 cases have been added as
well as cases in 5 more states. Since the freezer-life of the ground
turkey is substantial, it is likely that cases will continue to be
reported by CDC. Properly cooking the ground turkey and practicing
appropriate kitchen hygiene will prevent these cases. - Mod.LL]
