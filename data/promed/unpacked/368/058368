At least 400 jawans [police officers] attached to the Central Reserve Police Force camp at Pallipuram were taken ill due to suspected food poisoning, the police said. They were admitted to various hospitals in the city following complaints of diarrhea and vomiting after consuming food on Saturday, 1 Apr 2017, they said.

Initial investigations suggested that the police fell ill after consuming fish curry.

109 police personnel are under observation at Trivandrum Medical College Hospital. State health minister KK Shylaja visited them at the hospital last night [1 Apr 2017].
