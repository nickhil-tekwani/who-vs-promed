In a follow-up on the polio situation in Papua New Guinea, a new polio case was reported this week by the National Department of Health of Papua New Guinea (NDOH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in a 22-month old girl from Eastern Highlands Province.

This is the 4th case in the country, following confirmation of 2 cases from Morobe Province in June and July 2018 and a case from Enga in early August [2018].

The girl had an onset of paralysis on [Sun 8 Jul 2018]. Based on initial laboratory results, this case is genetically linked to the current outbreak in the country.

The NDOH has enhanced surveillance system and continuously receives reports of suspected acute flaccid paralysis. To date, there are 65 suspected cases being investigated.

The identification of the case highlights the risk of polio in children under 5 years of age. Children can be protected from polio only with vaccination. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country, the risk of further spread of polio within the country continues to be classified as high.

The NDOH calls on parents to bring every child under 5 years of age to the nearest health center or vaccination point for polio drops during the next round of the polio campaign in August [2018] on the following schedules:

20 Aug - 2 Sep 2018: Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces
27 Aug - 9 Sep 2018: Enga, Chimbu, Southern Highlands, Western Highlands, Jiwaka, and Hela
September and October 2018: nationwide polio vaccination campaign
Children will need to receive multiple doses of oral polio vaccine, irrespective of previous immunization status. The vaccine is safe and free and has a unique ability to stop person-to-person spread of the virus.

[This is now the 4th case of polio confirmed in Papua New Guinea this year (2018). This case is from the Eastern Highlands, which has an eastern border with Morobe province and a northern border with Madang province (see map at http://www-01.sil.org/pacific/png/show_maps.asp).
The article mentions that the country has identified 65 suspected cases. The definition of a suspected case is a case of acute flaccid paralysis, which has many other etiologies, of which one is the poliovirus family. As a reminder, the 3 previous cases were associated with infection with a circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), and presumably this case is also associated with the same virus.

I suspect that this week's expected polio update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (not as yet available) will have more information on this newly confirmed case. - Mod.MPP
