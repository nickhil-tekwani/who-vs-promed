[As the H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread thoughout Asia, our posts on
non-humans have spread to different threads for different geographical
areas and different avian species. In order to simplify the threads we are
starting a new unifying thread, "Avian influenza - Asia", which will
encompass much of what before had been in an ever increasing number of
threads. - Mod.DK]

Russia says dangerous bird flu outbreak spreads
-----------------------------------------------
Russia said on Tuesday [16 Aug 2005] an outbreak of bird flu in Chelyabinsk
was dangerous to humans, as teams of sanitary workers destroyed birds
[domestic? wild? - see comment] in Siberia in an attempt to prevent the
westward spread of the deadly virus.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu is behind the outbreak in Chelyabinsk, a city
in the Ural mountains, the Emergencies Ministry said in a statement.
It said no cases among humans have been confirmed in Russia.
"Measures are being taken to prevent the spreading of the infection among
domestic birds and to exclude the possibility of the infection moving to
humans," the statement added. Russia is battling to contain a bird flu
outbreak, which top health officials say has killed more than 11 000 birds
countrywide and could spread westwards to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The outbreak was discovered in mid-July 2005 in Novosibirsk and has spread
through Tyumen, Omsk, Kurgan, Altai and now Chelyabinsk, which is about
1000 km (600 miles) from Novosibirsk.
Senior agricultural officials believe the flu was brought by migrating
birds from Asia, where more than 50 people have died from the deadly H5N1
strain since 2003.
Officials fear that the virus could spread to Europe and Africa as tens of
millions of birds continue their migration to warmer climates from next
month ahead of Russia's harsh winter.
Chelyabinsk lies in the Ural mountains, the geographic divide between Asia
and Europe. Russia's top state epidemiologist, Gennady Onishchenko, said
migratory birds move on to warmer areas in southern Russia, Africa and
Europe in the autumn after nesting in Siberia.
But the diversity of Siberia's bird species makes plotting the flight paths
of the birds difficult, specialists in Moscow said.
"There are about 800 different species of birds in Russia and so there are
many different migration flows which criss-cross Russian territory," said
Dr. Pavel Tomkovich, a senior ornithologist at Moscow's Zoological Museum.
He said water fowl will leave to winter in warmer climates, flying through
Russia's southern regions, northern Kazakhstan, the Caspian and Black seas
towards the Mediterranean and north Africa. That would/could take infected
birds through Russia's agricultural heartland in the south.
Health officials were meeting in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the
situation, the state's consumer watchdog said.
In parts of Chelyabinsk, barriers were placed on roads and local officials
imposed a ban on the sale of all poultry products, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported. Farmers are being compensated for birds which were being
destroyed, the agency said.
Bird flu comes in different stains, such as H5 and H7, which have 9
different subtypes. The H5N1 subtype is highly pathogenic and can be passed
from birds to humans, though there have been no cases of human-to-human
transmission.

Avian flu spreads westward in Russia
-------------------------------------
Avian influenza has cropped up in chickens near Russia's Ural Mountains,
possibly signaling a continued westward march of the deadly H5N1 virus,
news services in Russia reported today.
The Chelyabinsk region along the southern end of the Urals is the 6th area
in Russia to have been hit by avian flu outbreaks recently, according to
Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Reuters. The Urals separate Siberia from
European Russia.
A regional official said 60 chickens in the village of Oktyabrskoye died
over the weekend, according to an online report by Mosnews.com. The report
said testing had detected an H5N1 virus in the dead birds. However, the AFP
and Reuters reports said it was not yet known if the virus was H5N1.
Other parts of southwestern Siberia that have reported recent outbreaks of
avian flu include Novosibirsk, Altai, Omsk, Tyumen, and Kurgan, all to the
east of Chelyabinsk, according to AFP. But the H5N1 strain has been
identified only in the Novosibirsk, Altai, and Omsk outbreaks, the report said.
The Siberian outbreaks have killed 10 896 wild and domestic birds,
according to an RIA Novosti news agency report quoted by AFP. Hundreds of
thousands of birds have been culled since the 1st in the series of Russian
outbreaks was reported in Novosibirsk on 21 Jul 2005, according to
Mosnews.com. No human cases have been reported.
Russia's top government epidemiologist, Gennady Onischenko, warned that
migrating birds could spread avian flu to Russia's major agricultural
region and on to the Middle East and Mediterranean Sea this fall.
"An analysis of bird migration routes has shown that the contagious A
(H5N1) virus may spread from western Siberia to the Caspian and Black Sea
areas this fall," said Onischenko, as quoted by an RIA Novosti report
today. "Some birds nesting in the affected regions (the Novosibirsk and
Altai territory) migrate to the above-mentioned areas for winter or stop
there on their way to Africa or Europe."
He added that bird migration routes run through Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq,
Georgia, Ukraine, and Mediterranean countries, raising a risk of outbreaks
there as well, according to the story. Onischenko made the statements in a
letter to regional directors of the Federal Service for the Oversight of
Consumer Protection and Welfare.
Russia's Agriculture Ministry said all sick and infected birds in
Chelyabinsk were being destroyed, and Russian media reported that roads
leading to the affected village were cordoned off in an effort to contain
the outbreak, according to Reuters.
A Russian agricultural official said the Chelyabinsk outbreak is near a
lake that borders the Kurgan region and Kazakhstan, where other avian flu
outbreaks have been reported recently, according to the Mosnews.com report.
Meanwhile, a Russian journalist named Maria Pashkova, who was hospitalized
after visiting an area affected by avian flu, has been tested for the
illness, according to an RIA Novosti report today. Results of the test are
expected later this week.
Mosnews.com reported that Pashkova had already recovered from her illness.
4 other Russians were hospitalized with suspected avian flu recently, but
all 4 tested negative, the RIA Novosti story said.

[In the absence of an official OIE update since 5 Aug 2005, it is not clear
what measures are currently being undertaken by the Russian authorities to
control the disease within the 5 regions (oblasts) situated west of the 1st
affected region, Novosibirsk, and to prevent its further spread. It would
also help to know if virological/serological surveillance in wildfowl is
being undertaken. - Mod.AS]
