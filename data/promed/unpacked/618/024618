[I believe this case to be the same one reported on 11 Jul 2000 in the
ProMED-mail reference cited above. This report includes the strain
characterization, but still lacks detail about the origin of the case
(imported vs. locally acquired) and the number of secondary cases observed,
if any. - Mod.ES
