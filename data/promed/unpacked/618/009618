BIRD TABLES, RISKS OF POOR HYGIENE

Keeping bird tables piled high with nuts, bread and dripping could be
killing birds with kindness, according to a team of researchers. They say
that overcrowded tables are rife with salmonella and E coli, diseases fatal
to birds. The three-year study found further danger in the stress triggered
by scrabbling for food among a flock of hungry birds which can also kill
species such as the chaffinch and the greenfinch.
Encouraging the congregation of large numbers of birds in a small area,
sometimes for prolonged periods, is likely to result in heavy
microbiological contamination of the feeding stations,' the team from the
Scottish Agricultural College in Ayrshire reports in the scientific journal
Veterinary Record. 'The small amount of feeding space available to each
bird leads to aggressive behaviour and male dominance at the feeding
stations, stressing the birds and increasing their susceptibility to
infectious disease.
The study based on the examination of the bodies of 116 birds found in
gardens with bird tables, found that 9 out of 10 died from the bacteria _E.
coli_ 086, or a strain of _Salmonella_. These infectious diseases may then
infect other species of wild birds in the vicinity. There is a possible
threat to human health, but neither of these particular bacterial strains
is found in humans. Greenfinches and chaffinches are thought to be most at
risk during the struggles for food. House sparrows, blue tits, pigeons and
doves are also vulnerable to diseases spread through droppings. Many of the
infected birds die from lung or liver disease, while others become weak and
are an easy target for hungry cats.
Geoff Foster, one of the authors of the report, said: 'What could be
happening is that the bird tables are bringing together birds that are
carrying agents causing infection and the bird table provides the potential
for the spread of the disease. 'The bird tables certainly create a focal
point for the infection to transfer.'
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds [RSPB] warned against abandoning
the age-old tradition of feeding birds in winter. Instead they urged nature
lovers to make their tables more hygienic by clearing up old food and
removing droppings.
Spokesman Chris Harbard said: 'We would certainly advise people to continue
to feed birds in their gardens. By offering these birds food we are
offering them a chance to survive that they would not otherwise have. What
we would advise people to do is treat bird tables as an eating place and
keep them as clean and tidy as possible. The problems are probably caused
when people put a lot of food in the one place. This will attract a lot of
birds to the one place and if the birds are carrying something it will
spread.' Although birds are most at risk from starvation in February and
March, the RSPB recommends year-round feeding.
Experts suggest that instead of piling up food on one large table, bird
lovers could leave out smaller amounts of food in several locations around
the garden. Hanging bird feeders full of nuts, mixed seed and bread from
trees can also cut down on the spread of disease.
Bird tables and feeders should be moved around the garden regularly, while
the water in bird baths needs to be changed daily. And to lower the risk of
bacteria spreading to people, rubber gloves should be worn when handling
and cleaning feeders.
