Another four people in Australia were Thursday confirmed with legionnaires'
disease sourced to the Melbourne Aquarium, bringing the number of such
cases to 91. So far the aquarium outbreak has claimed two lives while 19
people are still in hospital, six of them in critical condition.
A 77-year-old man died Wednesday night following complications from the
disease but he had not been confirmed as a victim of the aquarium outbreak,
health officials said. The officials said they were unable to speak to the
man and his relatives had not been sure whether he visited the aquarium
during the 11-25 Apr 2000 danger period.
Federal Finance Minister John Fahey is among those diagnosed with the
illness and is recovering at home after visiting the aquarium for a Liberal
Party function last month. The outbreak is the largest [outbreak of
legionellosis in Australia, although the worst [outbreak was in 1987 when
there were fewer cases but 10 people died.
