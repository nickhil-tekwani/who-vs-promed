On Wednesday (17 Feb 2021), the Atlantic Provinces Harness Racing Commission (APHRC) was informed of a new confirmed case of strangles in a Standardbred on Prince Edward Island.

This case is in a different barn then the stable having been under quarantine since early November [2020]. Testing of other horses in the newly impacted stable at Red Shores at the Charlottetown Driving Park is underway, and the stable has been quarantined. No other horses in this barn had shown any clinical signs for _Streptococcus equi_ except for the horse coming up positive on Wednesday [17 Feb 2021].

The originally impacted barn has been following testing and treatment protocols established by the Atlantic Veterinary College. This has resulted in the majority of the horses in the stable being cleared. The remaining horses are undergoing testing and treatment protocols set forth by the attending veterinarians.

Strangles is a highly contagious and serious infection of horses and other equines caused by the bacterium _S. equi_.

Horse people are reminded to remain vigilant, institute appropriate biosecurity measures, and consult their veterinarians for advice.

A 2nd barn at the Red Shores Racetrack in Charlottetown is under quarantine after a horse there tested positive for strangles.

The director of racing for the Atlantic Provinces Harness Racing Commission said a vet noticed a horse on Tuesday [16 Feb 2021] with some symptoms of the disease, and the horse was tested the same day.

On Wednesday [17 Feb 2021], the test came back positive.

Strangles is a highly contagious upper-respiratory illness that can cause swollen lymph nodes and fevers in horses, donkeys, and mules. While the illness can be fatal, most horses do survive.

"That barn's taken quick action, and they've put the barn under quarantine and implemented biosecurity measures," said Brett Revington, director of racing for the Atlantic Provinces Harness Racing Commission. "They've taken the action of wearing gloves, disinfecting horse gear, disinfecting the feed and water tubs, and really limiting the people in and out of that barn as well."

Revington said another 18-20 horses in the same barn have also been tested.

Another case of strangles was confirmed in November [2020] in a young horse, resulting in the quarantine of about 25 horses at another barn at Red Shores.

"We're not cleared of that situation yet; the barn [is] still under quarantine. There's just a few horses left," Revington said.

Of the old and new cases, he added: "I don't think they're related; they're in totally separate barns. Like any outbreak . . . we'd like it to be cleared up sooner rather than later. But unfortunately, sometimes these occurrences take a lot longer than we'd all like."

Red Shores Racetrack has taken measures to prevent the spread of strangles, including adding security and restricting who can enter the barns.

Red Shores also hosted an information session about strangles, with an expert speaker from the Atlantic Veterinary College, and almost 3000 viewers tuned in.

"I think a lot of horse people in Prince Edward Island are being vigilant. They want more information, and this was a really good step," said Lee Drake, manager of racing, brands, and broadcast divisions at Red Shores.

Drake noted that time is on Red Shores' side at the moment: The harness racing season is finished for now, resuming in May [2021].

"There's never really a good time for this ever, but I think at this point, because we're in the offseason right now, it gives us an opportunity and the ability to really get a grip on this and get it under control," Drake said. "We're confident the experts who continue to do work on this file and everybody works together, that we'll get through this."

Under commission rules, horses must test negative for the disease 3 times before the quarantine will be lifted. Drake said that's why it can take a while to clear up the cases.

"The testing regime takes weeks because of the protocols and the testing the veterinarians want in place, and the disease control experts want in place, so it does take a while to get through it," Drake said. "We accept it because the majority of the horses that were in the original quarantine barn have been released, and that's because of good testing."

However, the Atlantic Commission's director of racing said it is unlikely they will ever find what caused either of the outbreaks.

"No, I think it's the million-dollar question. I don't think we'll totally ever be able to find out," Revington said. "There's just such a movement of horses between the Maritimes, and between Ontario and back, and between the Maritimes' different racetracks: 6 different racetracks. It's really difficult to nail it right down."

Although strangles is highly contagious to other horses, it is only rarely passed on to humans.

[The following is extracted from the AAEP/Equine Disease Communication Center Disease Fact Sheet (https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Outside%20Linked%20Documents/DiseaseFactsheet-Strep_equi_final%20Cobranded_0.pdf):

"Disease name: _Streptococcus equi_ equi is also known as "strep equi," or strangles.
Disease type: bacterial infection
Transmission: _S. equi_ is spread from horse to horse through direct contact. Horses can also contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces. The disease is highly infectious.
Frequency: _S. equi_ is extremely common. Most horses are exposed and/or infected at a young age.
Incubation period: 3-14 days.
Carrier status: Horses that have been infected but are clinically healthy can continue to incubate and shed the bacteria. A recovered horse may be a potential source of infection for at least 6 weeks after the clinical signs of strangles have resolved. Some horses that have recovered from the disease can become long-term, periodic shedders and can cause outbreaks when introduced to new herds.
Shedding period: Horses infected with _S. equi_ are a source of infection to others and often continue to shed for up to 6 weeks post-recovery.
Latency: _S. equi_ is present during the incubation period, and the horse can be a carrier without any clinical signs.
Severity: low
Clinical signs:
- fever, usually preceding other clinical signs by 24-48 hours
- abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes (in the throatlatch and below the jaw)
- nasal discharge: often thick white and yellow mucus
- inflammation of the throat
- difficulty swallowing
- wheezing
- cough
- purpura hemorrhagica: bleeding from the capillaries, which causes red spots on the mucous membranes and swelling of the limbs and head (rare; only in cases with complications)
- swelling of the muscles (rare: only in cases with complications)
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made through a culture of nasal wash, nasal swab, or pus aspirated from abscesses or through PCR testing.
Treatment: Supportive care is the primary treatment. Use of antibiotics in infected horses is restricted to those with severe clinical signs such as respiratory difficulty, as most horses recover without antibiotic treatment. Horses treated with antibiotics early in the course of infection may avoid lymph node abscesses but may not develop immunity to the disease. Treatment decisions should be made by a veterinarian.
Prognosis: Good. Strangles is rarely fatal, and horses usually make a full recovery in 3-4 weeks with few complications. Horses who have been infected with strangles can maintain long-term immunity to the bacterial strain.
Prevention: An intranasal vaccine is available but is not effective against all infections. Any surfaces contaminated with mucus or other nasal discharge from infected horses pose a threat of infection to healthy horses. After an outbreak, cleaning should involve removal of all organic material from surfaces and subsequent disinfection of water containers, feeders, fences, stalls, tack, and trailers.
Biosecurity: _S. equi_ outbreaks can be hard to prevent because of the prevalence of subclinical carriers (clinically healthy horses who shed the bacteria for weeks or even years after recovery). Outbreaks are common, especially in facilities with high horse traffic where new horses are frequently moved between stables or herds. Whenever possible, new horses should be quarantined for up to 3 weeks when being introduced to a new facility. High standards of hygiene should be maintained in facilities to decrease chance of horses contacting contaminated surfaces. To prevent indirect infection during an outbreak, handlers should avoid coming in contact with susceptible animals after handling infected animals. Handlers should wear protective clothing, avoid using the same equipment on multiple animals, and disinfect hands and equipment when moving between animals." - Mod.TG
