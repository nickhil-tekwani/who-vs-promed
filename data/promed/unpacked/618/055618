Metapneumovirus Infection and Acute Wheezing in Finnish Children
---------------------------------------------------------------
[In The Lancet 2002;360:1393-1394, Jartti et al. report the following:] A
new respiratory virus, human metapneumovirus, was recently identified [in
the Netherlands]. We detected this virus by PCR in 10 (8 percent) of 132
consecutive children admitted to Turku Hospital, Finland, for acute
expiratory wheezing (median age 7 months, range 4 to 25 months). The mean
duration of hospital stay was 2·5 days (SD 1·6) and mean duration of
respiratory symptoms was 19 days. The white blood cell count, C-reactive
protein, and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell-expressed and
T-cell-secreted (RANTES) concentrations in nasal secretion remained low,
whereas interleukin 8 concentrations in nasal secretion were high. Human
metapneumovirus is a clinically important causative agent of acute wheezing
in young children.

[This is the latest report identifying human metapneumovirus as an
important respiratory pathogen of human infancy since the virus was
described initially by van den Hoogen et al. in the Netherlands in 2001.
Subsequently human metapneumovirus infection has been reported from
Australia, Canada, and the UK. These previous reports, together with the
current report, indicate that human metapneumovirus is prevalent worldwide.
In their original paper van den Hoogen et al. reported that from 28 young
children in the Netherlands (all negative for human respiratory syncytial
virus), they isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative
new member of the genus _Metapneumovirus_ based on virological data,
sequence homology, and gene constellation. Previously, turkey
rhinotracheitis virus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus,
hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus is _Human
metapneumovirus_. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus
was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial
virus infection, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe
bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of
5 years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to
human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for
at least 50 years.
Stockton et al. (2002) reported that in the UK 2.2 percent of infants with
unattributed acute respiratory tract infections were positive for human
metapneumovirus. Boivin et al. (2002) in Canada reported that human
metapneumovirus (like human respiratory syncytial virus) was associated
with severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants, the elderly, and
immunocompromised patients. In Australia, Nissen et al. (2002) identified
human metapneumovirus in children with acute lower respiratory tract
infection of unknown etiology. Molecular biological studies by van den
Hoogen et al. (2002) have confirmed a close genetic relationship between
human metapneumovirus and turkey rhinotracheitis virus (56-88 percent amino
acid sequence identity for corresponding open reading frames).
It is becoming clear that human metapneumovirus is a novel human pathogen
contributing to acute respiratory illness in infancy and very probably in
the elderly. Its importance relative to human respiratory syncytial virus
has yet to be established.
