[The previous FMD event (December 2014) in the Zambezi region was caused by FMD serotype SAT2. The event was declared resolved on 10 Jun 2015; see event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=16667.

The new event in Zambezi is the 3rd officially notified new FMD event on Namibia's territory this year [2015]. According to the official information in the WAHID website, the 1st event started on 12 Jan 2015, was confirmed on 13 Jan 2015, and notified to the OIE about 4 months later, namely on 18 May 2015. The causative agent has remained un-typed, with only one focus/outbreak included. See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17073.

The 2nd event reportedly started on 11 May 2015, was confirmed on 13 May 2015 and was duly notified to the OIE on the same day (13 May 2015). The causative agent has been serotyped as SAT2. For the reports and an interactive map showing the 17 accumulated outbreaks adjacent to Namibia's border with Angola, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17724.

ProMED-mail's request for information on an outbreak in Kanango West (archive no. 20150617.3445619) has been addressed in Namibia's follow-up report no 3 of 30 Jun 2015, reporting 13 new outbreaks.

Namibia is one of 12 OIE member countries which are recognised as having an FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of Chapter 8.7. of the Terrestrial Code, edition 2014. The zone was designated by the Delegate of Namibia in a document addressed to OIE's Director General in February 1997. The list of countries with FMD-free zones without vaccination was updated in May 2015 and is available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/list-of-fmd-free-members/.

The current event is situated within an "infected zone where vaccination is allowed."

FMD is endemic and spreading in southern Africa. Since 1 Jan 2015, outbreaks have been reported (in addition to Namibia), from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa (Mpumalanga), and Angola (Cuando Cubango).
