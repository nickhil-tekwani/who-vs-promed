Democratic Republic of Congo: measles epidemic in Equateur Province
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KINSHASA: Up to 300 cases of measles have been reported in Basankusu, 210
km north east of Mbandaka, the main town in the Democratic Republic of
Congo province of Equateur, the deputy director of epidemiological services
at the Ministry of Health, Dr Mondonge Makuma, said on Fri 13 Feb 2004.
However, doctors in Basankusu told the UN Mission in the DRC that some 800
people were infected, 3 of whom had died. "We accept that the figures 200
to 300 cases are estimates because the epidemic may be worse," Mondonge
said in Kinshasa, the nation's capital. National health workers have been
on strike for one week now, and it is difficult to determine the exact
figures for the sick.

The cause of this epidemic is also unknown but doctors at Basankusu suspect
it has been caused by the poor refrigeration of vaccines. However, the
World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemiological services at the
Ministry of Health, and vaccination experts say the cause could lie
elsewhere. "It is not necessarily because of bad vaccines, because Medicins
Sans Frontieres have maintained vaccine refrigerators very well in this
area," Mondonge said.

"The greater likelihood for the disease is that vaccination coverage
against measles has been poor in many of these health zones." He said that
the epidemic had resurfaced in all areas where fewer than 80 per cent of
residents had been vaccinated. Fewer than 80 per cent of Basankusu's 100
000 residents were vaccinated against measles, Dr Leon Kinuani, an adviser
on vaccinations at the WHO, said.

[ProMED-mail has not been reporting outbreaks of measles in the African
continent on a routine basis, but this outbreak appears to be more
extensive than usual. Although isolates of measles virus display some
genetic variability worldwide there has been no firm evidence to suggest
that the immune response induced by the current live attenuated virus
vaccine is insufficient to provide protection. Local administrative and
social problems, as in the current situation in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, appear to be responsible. - Mod.CP]
