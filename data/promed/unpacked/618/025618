CHOLERA - JAPAN EX INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES, THAILAND
*********************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[see: Cholera - Japan: imported 990307120345]
From: Ikushi Onozaki, MD, MPH <qurantin@nrt0.narita-airport.or.jp>

According to a report from Ministry of Health and Welfare, 8 cases of
cholera have been confirmed in Japan since 1 Jan 1999 as of March 5.
All were imported and identified as Cholera O1 Eltor Ogawa. Five were
visitors to Philippines and three to Thailand. They made relatively short
trips from 5 days to 2 weeks.
In 1998, 57 cases of bacteriologically confirmed Cholera were officially
reported in Japan; 54 of them were imported cases, and all those were from
Asian countries except for one from Peru. Most of them were Japanese.
Thailand (16 cases) was the leading destination among the patients.
However, it is very interesting that 13 of them were reported within two
weeks of the middle of Feb 1999. Some ProMED-mail readers might remember
discussions on imported cases from Thailand to Hong Kong at that time.
India, Indonesia and Philippines were other destinations that [produced]
more
than a half dozen cases.

[As mentioned in other ProMED-mail posts, Indonesia, Philippines & Thailand
are not reporting to WHO that they have endemic cholera, whereas India does.
Travelers to those countries should beware, & take the proper precautions -
