Over the weekend The Sunday Telegraph ran an over-the-top article about a
normal cow -- reading carefully it emerges, reluctantly, to be in
Switzerland -- being diagnosed with BSE:
The Sunday Telegraph, UK Sun 4 Oct 1998
Cow from 'safe' herd had BSE
------------------------------------
By Victoria Macdonald
"BSE has been detected in an apparently healthy cow, from a herd that was
meant to be free of the disease, as it was about to enter the food chain, a
report will disclose this week. The discovery, which threatens a new crisis
for beef farmers, was made last week when scientists carried out tests on
the carcass of a four-year-old cow from a Swiss herd. The BSE-infected
carcass was discarded. Researchers from the Swiss biotechnology firm
Prionics, who developed the test, believe that their results suggest that
more herds than had been thought are infected with the prion protein which
causes BSE. They say there is no certain way of telling how long the cow had
been infected."
The author then goes on to state that UK/MAFF was "playing down" the
"threat" involved. However, the reality of the events in Switzerland
was very different. The details are available on:

If you read the official report on the Swiss National Veterinary Website
at http://www.admin.ch/bvet
you will see that the cow had presented nervous signs of the disease but
there was an error in the clinical interpretation of the change in the
behaviour of this cow. The cow was affected by a mastitis and the change of
behaviour was misdiagnosed [as] reaction to pain.
