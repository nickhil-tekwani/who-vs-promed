[1] Blast - Bhutan (Sarpang)

With rice blast affecting at least 25 per cent of paddy in [parts of] Sarpang [district,], [a] farmer said, "We're seeing such rice disease for the 1st time here." Farmers fear the disease will wipe out entire fields. "It is spreading rapidly, it began 2 weeks ago."

Farmers are worried about seeds for the next cultivation. "I'm hopeful that I would be able to sort out uninfected rice for seeds," [a farmer] said. "Otherwise we may have to buy new seeds."

Agriculture officials said the immediate measure taken to avoid further damage of crop was to advice farmers for immediate harvest.

[2] False smut and blast - India (Telangana)

Rice blast and false smut diseases are likely to have an adverse impact on the paddy production in [Nalgonda] district as hundreds of acres have been affected by the fungal disease. Frequent and prolonged rains led to rice blast infection in most of the areas.

According to officials the disease would lead to reduction in the paddy production by 25 to 30 per cent. District Agricultural Advisory and Transfer of Technology Centre's (DATTC) Shailaja [said] that majority of farmers in the district had taken up cultivation [of] BPT and 1110 varieties of paddy, which were vulnerable to rice blast and false smut diseases.

[A] farmer said sprays suggested by the agricultural officers were not available in the market. Shops were selling gullible farmers low quality sprays.

[Rice blast
----------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilisers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread with infected plant material (including seed), by mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed, as mentioned above in item 1, would pose a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.

In Bhutan, rice blast is also currently reported from Punakha district (see link below), but in that area the expected damage is not considered severe due to the outbreak occurring late in the growing season. Farmers in that district may also be growing different cultivars resulting in less severe yield losses.

False smut
----------
False smut of rice is caused by the fungus _Ustilaginoidea virens_. The disease can reduce yield by up to 75 per cent and affects grain quality and seed germination rates. Large orange to brown-green fruiting structures on one or more grains of the mature panicle develop. Surface spores spread the disease to immature panicles, and disease development is favoured by high humidity.

So far, not much is known about the life cycle of the pathogen, including the time in the plant's growth cycle at which infection occurs. The "smut balls" survive between crops in the soil. In addition to causing yield losses, the mycotoxin ustilotoxin is produced by the pathogen and may be of concern in rice products. Disease management may include phytosanitation, cultural methods, fungicides and use of resistant cultivars.

In India, false smut outbreaks have become increasingly severe over the past decade. It appears, as also mentioned above in item 2, that the available resistant varieties are not favoured by farmers, and this makes disease control more difficult.
