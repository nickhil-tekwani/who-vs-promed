The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the Houston County Health Department have determined that the cause of a respiratory illness cluster in southeast Alabama was a combination of influenza A, rhinovirus (the virus associated with the common cold), and bacterial pneumonia.

"This is good news. Testing has ruled out avian flu and novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV]," said State Health Officer Dr. Don Williamson.

Earlier this month [May 2013], 7 patients [now 9 -- see [2] below] were admitted to the hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath with no known cause for their illness. Public health officials began an epidemiological investigation to interview the families of the patients about travel and exposure. Specimens were requested and submitted to the ADPH Bureau of Clinical Laboratories in Montgomery. Of the 7 patients whose specimens were submitted, 6 were found to be positive for either influenza A, rhinovirus or a combination of the 2, and 3 patients were found to have bacterial pneumonia. Two of the 7 patients eventually died.

Dr. Mary McIntyre, assistant state health officer for disease control and prevention, said: "While enhanced surveillance associated with this cluster is no longer necessary, health care providers are encouraged to continue routine year-round influenza surveillance activities and submit specimens to the state laboratory for testing."

Health care providers should always use standard precautions when dealing with patients with respiratory illness.

If you or your family members have respiratory symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, please contact your healthcare provider to be evaluated. In addition, everyone should take steps to prevent transmission of disease and are reminded to follow these precautions:
- Cover your cough or sneeze with a sleeve or tissue.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are also effective.
- Avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose with your hands.
- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
- If you get sick, stay home and limit contact with others to avoid infecting them.

[2] Possible H1N1

One of the deaths in the recent outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness could be associated with the H1N1 flu virus. The Dothan Eagle, which is based in Houston County, is reporting that officials with the local office of the Alabama Department of Public Health said that one of the 2 deaths could be associated with the H1N1 virus.

The number of those infected has risen from 7 to 9, Lesa C. Smith, a registered nurse with the state Department of Public Health told the newspaper. The Department of Public Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are investigating the illness, which they described as a "cluster of respiratory illnesses of unknown origin." According to the Associated Press, the CDC is expected to release more information about the illness on Thursday [23 May 2013]. Al.com requested comment from the CDC on Wednesday [22 May 2013] afternoon, but a message hasn't been returned.

The 2 deaths associated with the illness occurred Saturday and Sunday [18-19 May 2013], according to the Dothan Eagle. Some patients with the illness are improving and being allowed to return home. Smith told the Dothan Eagle that the 3 key symptoms of the illness are shortness of breath, coughing and fever. Two of the infected people tested positive for specific viruses, which included the H1N1 flu virus. Another person tested positive for the type A virus [H3N2?], which is a typical seasonal flu virus.

[In the USA, during the 1st week of May 2013, influenza activity continued to decrease since peaking in late December 2012 to early January 2013 and is now below seasonal thresholds. Nationally, the proportion of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) outpatient consultations decreased to 1.0 percent, below the national baseline of 2.2 percent. The proportion of clinical ILI specimens testing positive for influenza decreased from the peak of 38 percent in the last week of 2012 to 6.5 percent (177/2746) during the week ending April 2013. The proportion of all deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System continued to decrease from the peak of 9.8 percent in the 4th week of January 2013 to 6.6 percent, which is below the threshold of 7.2 percent. Overall numbers of P&I deaths since the beginning of the season have been relatively high compared to recent seasons. Laboratory confirmed influenza related hospitalizations were 44.2 per 100 000 population; this was higher than the previous 3 seasons and was most notably in the age group over 65 years, accounting for 50 percent of all reported cases. Among all hospitalizations, 9757 (79.2 percent) were associated with influenza A and 2476 (20.1 percent) with influenza B.

Since the beginning of the 2012-13 influenza season, all influenza As were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses, although 0.3 percent (4/1268) of A(H3N2) and 1.3 percent (3/234) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested had reduced titres, with antiserum produced against the A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/California/7/2009 viruses, respectively. Of the influenza B viruses characterized, 33.0 percent (269/815) belonged to the B/Victoria/02/87-like lineage, which is not in the current trivalent vaccine.

[One suspects that with the heightened awareness worldwide for severe acute respiratory illnesses [SARI], the occurrence of 7 apparent cases in a short period of time in a localized area raised an alarm to warrant immediate investigation, a positive sign of good disease surveillance activities. The identification of a combination of influenza A H1N1, rhinovirus and bacterial pneumonia explains the severity of the disease seen, as influenza A H1N1 has been associated with severe disease, and the addition of a secondary bacterial pneumonia in 3 cases adds to the severity of the clinical presentation.
