The Leprosy Mission International (TLM) based in Niger State has stated that over 35 000 new cases of leprosy are discovered in Nigeria annually.

In view of this situation, the mission has launched a sensitisation initiative on the danger of leprosy and has expended NGN 18 million [USD 113 300] so far on the fight against the disease in Niger State, Pius Ogbu Sunday, the operations Manager of the Mission, stated at a sensitisation meeting of the mission in Minna. He said the fund was expended on capacity building and sensitisation for prevention as well as control. According to Ogbu, the activities of the mission have been expanded to cover Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kogi states. The Mission 1st came to Nigeria through Akwa Ibom State.

He explained that a 5-year action plan has been drawn up to raise funds for the Mission to carry out its activities in collaboration with state governments and religious bodies in the country.

The operations manager stated that the disease is highly contagious and could be found in 30 countries of the world, with India having the highest prevalence rate.

Appealing to the public to be cautious of the early signs of leprosy, he affirmed that the symptoms could be discovered only through clinical examination.

Deputy Director, Rehabilitation and Desk Officer of TLM in the state Ministry of Gender Affairs Hajiya Hajara Ndayako gave assurances of Niger's readiness to collaborate with TLM in order to combat leprosy in the state.

[Before 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy-endemic countries in the world, with prevalence rates ranging from 16 to 390 per 10 000 (http://www.leprahealthinaction.org/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). Following introduction of multidrug therapy for leprosy in 1985, Nigeria attained the WHO elimination as a public health problem target of less than one case per 10 000 population at the national level by the end of 1998 (http://www.leprahealthinaction.org/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). The registered prevalence of leprosy at the end of 2012 was 3915 cases, or a prevalence rate of 0.22 per 10 000 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

The number of new cases of leprosy detected in 2012 was 3805 according to the latest data from WHO (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf), not over 35 000 as stated in the news report above. In fact, the number of new cases of leprosy was 5276 in 2004, 5024 in 2005, 3544 in 2006, 4665 in 2007, 4899 in 2008, 4219 in 2009, 3913 in 2010 and 3623 in 2011 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). The number of new cases has never been over 35 000 in the past 9 years. In 2012, Nigeria accounted for 1.6 percent of the total number of new cases (232 857) detected worldwide.

Although the number of new cases of leprosy detected in Nigeria annually decreased from 5276 in 2004 to 3805 in 2012, Nigeria remains one of 16 countries reporting 1000 or more new cases of leprosy during 2012; these 16 countries account for 95 percent of the new cases detected worldwide during 2012 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

Nigeria, with an estimated population of 174 507 539 in 2013, is the most populous country in Africa and the 7th most populous country in the world (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria#Population_of_major_cities). It is located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean with the Republic of Benin to the west, Chad and Cameroon to the east, and Niger to the north.

Nigeria is a federal constitutional republic with 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
