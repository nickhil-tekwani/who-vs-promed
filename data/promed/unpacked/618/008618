[Primorsky Krai, where sheep pox was reported also in 2015, borders China and North Korea; the current outbreak is situated close to the border with China's province Heilongjiang. The most recent available OIE report from China on sheep pox incidence covered the period January-June 2015; Heilongjiang was not mentioned.

It would be interesting to note if the previous event was followed by vaccination.

Sheep pox may be devastating if it occurs during the lambing season; the mortality rate is proportional to the number of juvenile animals in the affected flocks. Such animals are particularly susceptible.
