A total of 4 301 cases and 146 deaths (3.4%) had been notified up to 25
November in Maputo City, other areas of Maputo Province and Xai-Xai City in
Gaza Province, of which 2 637 cases were registered since 7 November.
Maputo City continues to be the most affected area with 92% of all cases
reported. However, the daily admissions at the central hospital in Maputo
City have declined from over 200 to 150. Up to November 22,1997, 63 cases
(no deaths) had been reported in Xai-Xai City, Gaza Province since the
outbreak started there on November 5, 1997. Three suspect cases and one
death were notified in Chokwe district in the same province on November 24.
The government has reactivated the National Commission for Emergency
Management, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, and the Minister of
Health has set up and chairs the National Technical Commission for the daily
coordination of all technical aspects of the campaign. WHO is working
closely with the national authorities to coordinate the international
response and mobilize resources.
Several countries (Egypt, Italy, Portugal, Spain) responded to Government
appeals with funds, rehydration fluid, tents and technical assistance.
Médecins Sans Frontières has organized a new treatment facility and is
assisting in control activities. Agencies interested in further supporting
the control activities can contact the WHO Cholera Task Force for details on
immediate and long term activities (fax: 41-22-791 4893 or e-mail:
neiram@who.ch.).
