[Ukraine is divided into several levels of territorial entities. At the 1st level, there are 27 regions: 24 oblasts [provinces], one autonomous republic, and 2 "cities with special status" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Ukraine.

Since 2014, ASF has been reported to occur in 16 of the 24 provinces. The affected provinces are: Chernihiv, Cherkassy, Chernovtsy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovograd, Kiev, Lugansk, Nikolayev, Odessa, Poltova, Rovno, Sumy, Vinnitsa, Volyn and Zhitomir.

Although the notifications of ASF in each province have been reported to the OIE as events which have involved a defined zone of the country, given the number of affected provinces, and the continued reports of the disease in different provinces, it is clear that the disease is now spread throughout practically the entire country.

All outbreaks of ASF reported from 1 Jan 2015 to date can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/jpvgau8 (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in). - Mod.CRD
