Head of Livestock and Fisheries Extension Division, Agriculture and
Forestry Service of Borikhamsay [Bolikhamxai] province, Mr Nouman
Souttavanh, disclosed last week [19 Feb 2009] that 282 cattle died of
foot-and-mouth [FMD] disease in 3 districts in [Bolikhamxai] province
since the [outbreak of the] disease began in December last year
[2008], said a local official.

The disease has been [affecting] 3 districts in the province:
Pakkading, Paksan, and Thaphabath, which were also flooded last August
[2008].

Pakkading is the hardest hit by the outbreak with over 220 cattle
dying and another 442 cattle affected in 18 villages.

Paksan has reported 59 [dead] cattle and another 66 affected with the
disease in 18 villages. Fortunately, Thaphabath only has 2 villages,
Nakhan and Laokha, reported suffering from foot-and-mouth disease.

Mr Nouman said that the disease had not originated locally but it was
brought in by cattle imported from southern provinces.

At present, local authorities and veterinarians are making great
efforts in mitigating the outbreak of the disease and preventing it
from spreading to other areas.

The [movement] of warm-blooded animals like goats, sheep, and cattle
into and from the province is banned and strictly inspected by
concerned officials.

[No periodic reports have been submitted from Laos to the OIE for the
years 2006, 2007, and 2008. The most recent annual report from Laos
available at OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database)
dates back to 2005, when FMD was declared to be present clinically in
the country and, reportedly, no vaccination against it applied.

On 13 Nov 2008, Laos submitted an "immediate notification" to the
OIE, reporting a single outbreak with 112 cases in a Luangnamtha farm
with 125 cattle and 2 buffaloes. The following epidemiological
comments were included: "According to the owner of the animal, cattle
was purchased for slaughter from Bokeo province, that shares border
with Thailand and Myanmar." The control measures were limited to
quarantine and animal movement control, no culling or slaughter, and
no vaccination.

See the notification, with a map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7513>.
Reportedly, the event had resolved on 3 Nov 2008 and no follow-up
reports would be submitted. It is unlikely that this was the only
outbreak during the year, while neighboring (and vaccinating!)
countries, namely Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, reported multiple
outbreaks.

However, additional information on the Laotian FMD situation may be
derived from several other sources, in particular the websites of the
World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), and of the OIE SEAFMD
(South East Asia FMD) Regional Co-ordination Unit.

The following information on FMD in Laos (Lao People's Democratic
Republic) is available at the country page of the World Reference
Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/lao.htm>:
FMD 1st recorded: [type] O (1978), Asia 1 (1984), A (2003)
FMD eradicated: no
Serotypes (last reported): O (2008), Asia 1 (2002), A (2006)
Current status: endemic.

During the 3 years 2005-2007, 9 samples sent from Laos were found FMD
positive (serotypes A and O). During 2008 (more specifically on 24 Jul
2008), 5 samples from Laos were received, all found to be of serotype
O, topotype SEA (South East Asia), strain Mya98.

The said website also includes a Molecular Epidemiology Report Form,
with information on the 10 most closely related viruses. The 1st 3 in
the said list (difference less than 0.31 percent) are O/MAY/4/2007,
O/MAY/7/2007 and O/TAI/7/2007. There is also a list of the relevant
reference strains (for possible vaccine selection).

The OIE SEAFMD website includes the summary "FMD at a Glance in 2008"
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/news.php?articleID=74>, saying that
in Lao PDR, "outbreaks of serotype O were only limited in 2 provinces
(Vientiane and Xayaburi [Xaignabouli])."

More information is to be found in appendix I "Status of foot and
mouth disease in South East Asia," page 37 of the document "SEAFMD
2020: a roadmap for FMD freedom with vaccination by 2020 in
South-East Asia," available at
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/documents/SEAFMD%202020%20WEB%20Version.pdf>.

Regarding vaccination, readers are referred to the ProMED-MBDS posts
'Foot & mouth disease, bovine - Laos: Vientiane 20090226.0791'
and
'Foot & mouth disease - Laos (02): multiprovince, alert 20081211.3892,'
which include the information that "there has been vaccination of some
of the cattle and buffaloes in the affected areas although the
vaccination coverage still seems to be low." Clarification, and
details on vaccination coverage as well as the composition (serotypes)
of the vaccine applied, are requested.
