[1] Syria: Healthcare worker infections
Date: Thu 6 Aug 2020
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/coronavirus-cases-reported-syria-al-hol-camp-200806162159182.html


Three health workers in a displaced people's camp in northeastern Syria have contracted the novel coronavirus, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Wed 5 Aug 2020.

They were the 1st reported infections in the Al-Hol camp, a vast tent city that is home to tens of thousands of people, including the relatives of ISIL fighters.

It is run by the autonomous Kurdish administration that controls most of northeastern Syria and has reported 54 cases of COVID-19 in areas under its control.

"On 3 Aug 2020, 3 health workers reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 at the Al-Hol IDP [internally displaced people's] camp," said OCHA in a press release.

"The contact tracing process is ongoing. As a precautionary measure, only critical staff, with personal protective equipment, are allowed to operate inside the camp," it added.

A health official at the camp said the 3 infected staff work with the Kurdish Red Crescent in Al-Hol. "We fear that the virus could have spread to camp residents visiting health clinics," he said, asking not to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media on the issue.

Critical situation
--------------
The latest infections raise to 9 the number of Kurdish Red Crescent staff in northeastern Syria who have contracted the virus, a volunteer at the organisation told AFP news agency, asking not to be identified.

Nine years of war have battered healthcare provision across Syria, but the situation in the northeast is particularly critical, as the Kurdish authorities have been left to cope with the coronavirus pandemic largely unaided.

This has raised fears that any outbreak could swiftly escalate into an epidemic gripping the entire Kurdish region.

As of 4 Aug 2020, the Syrian government has confirmed 847 people have tested positive for COVID-19, including 46 people who died and 268 who recovered.

[While most countries are currently struggling to respond to COVID-19, the pandemic poses a particularly dire threat in fragile and humanitarian settings. An estimated 1.8 billion people live in fragile contexts worldwide, including 168 million in need of humanitarian assistance. [https://www.ippf.org/blogs/covid-19-humanitarian-settings-double-crisis]. People affected by humanitarian crises and those living in low capacity settings are differently impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. In these settings, critical measures for COVID-19 prevention and control that have been a feature of the response in higher resource settings, such as physical distancing, movement restrictions and home confinement, handwashing with water and soap, closure of schools and workplaces may be more difficult to implement and some of them potentially harmful to the survival of many community members. In addition, capacities for testing, isolating and treating those who develop the disease, tracing and quarantining contacts may be severely lacking locally owing to weaker health systems.

The above report does not clarify whether the healthcare workers (HCWs) got infected while working in the camp or had arrived from another location. Working on the presumption that Covid transmission may already be occurring in the camp, as the health status of displaced populations cannot be monitored adequately and testing facilities may be limited, these workers may have acquired the infection in the camp. Alternatively, the healthcare workers may be a source of the virus in this community, with grievous implications.

Either way, use of medical masks must be prioritized for HCWs, sick individuals in the community and their caretakers, and respirators (N95, FFP2, FFP3) be reserved for HCW. For HCWs, additional PPE need to be used according to the WHO guidance on the rational use of PPE.

[2] Belgium: Meat processing plant outbreak
Date: Fri 7 Aug 2020
Source: Swiss info [edited]
https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/belgian-meat-processing-plant-confirms-67-covid-19-cases/45953848


A pork processing plant in Belgium reported 67 COVID-19 infections on Fri 7 Aug 2020, one manager of the firm told Reuters, joining a string of outbreaks at abattoirs and meat processing facilities around the world.

Westvlees tested and quarantined 197 workers from the meat cutting department of its plant in Westrozebeke, West Flanders, on Wed 5 Aug 2020 after some employees reported infections.

The company will test all 850 workers at the plant next week, as a precaution, product manager Manuel Goderis said on Fri 7 Aug 2020.

The meat cutting department is closed and will reopen on 17 Aug 2020 at the earliest. "For now, there is no reason to believe that there will be other cases," Goderis said.

Meat processing plants in Ireland and Greece have also reported clusters of new infections this month [August 2020], while countries including Germany, the United States and Australia have seen major outbreaks in the industry.

A German abattoir was shuttered in June 2020 after 1500 workers tested positive. More than 16 000 U.S. meatpacking workers had been infected by the end of May 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A CDC report in April 2020 said conditions in meat processing facilities could help spread the virus, including work on fast-moving production lines that hinder social distancing, and the physical demands of the work, which can make wearing face coverings difficult.

[Meat processing plants have been identified as an industry with high risk of transmission, owing to the indoor nature of the work in relatively confined spaces with difficulties in adherence to social distancing. The above outbreak is just another example of the risks in industries providing food for consumption, along with seafood and vegetables/fruit packing facilities. - Mod.UBA]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 8 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published guidance on the public health surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This document combines and supersedes the Global surveillance guidance for COVID-19 caused by human infection with COVID-19 virus: Interim guidance, and Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection: Interim Guidance 10 May 2020.
- A plane carrying 20 tonnes of trauma and surgical supplies from WHO has landed in Beirut, Lebanon to support the treatment of patients injured by the blast which occurred in the city on 4 Aug 2020. This latest emergency has occurred at a time of recent civil unrest, economic crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak, and heavy refugee burden. "We are in this together, and we are committed to supporting Lebanon in this very difficult time" said Dr Najat Rochdi, UN Resident Coordinator in Lebanon.
- Epidemics and Public Health Emergency Operations Centre opens in Skopje, North Macedonia. At the Centre's inauguration, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, commended North Macedonia for its commitment to strengthening public health capacity to fight COVID-19. Dr Venko Filipce, Minister of Health of North Macedonia, thanked WHO for its continuous support in the COVID-19 response and shared that the Centre will play a critical role in North Macedonia's preparedness and response.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 54.5% of the global newly reported cases and 65.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.1 million cases. The USA reported 35.6% of cases (55 318), followed by Brazil 34.2% (53 139), Colombia 7.7% (11 996), Peru 5.0% (7785), Argentina 4.8% (7513), Mexico 4.2% (6590), and Chile 1.4% (2154).

- The European region reported 11.0% of the global newly reported cases and 6.9% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 16.5% (5212) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 14.3 % (4507), Kazakhstan 14.1% (4413), France 6.0% (2181), Israel 6.9% (1672), Ukraine 4.7% (1489), Romania 4.4% (1379), Turkey 3.7% (1185), Germany 3.5% (1122), the UK 2.7% (871), Poland 2.6% (809), Uzbekistan 2.1% (650), and Kyrgyzstan 3.5% (425).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.4% of the global newly reported cases and 5.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 27.3% (3461) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 19.4% (2450), Saudi Arabia 12.4% (1567), Morocco 8.0% (1018), Pakistan 6.5% (824), Kuwait 5.4% (682), Palestinian Authority 4.1% (514), Oman 2.7% (354), Lebanon 2.2% (279), and Libya 1.6% (199). Cases are increasing in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 4.2% of the global newly reported cases and 5.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 60.8% (7292) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Kenya 6.1% (727), Ethiopia 4.6% (552), Algeria 4.4% (529), Ghana 3.8% (455), Nigeria 3.6% (443), and Madagascar 1.5% (182). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past few days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.1% of the global newly reported cases and 0.56% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 56.3% (3294) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 27.7% (1624), Australia 7.0% (410), Singapore 4.1% (242), China 2.1% (120), South Korea 0.73% (43), and Viet Nam 0.66% (39). Japan and Australia continue to increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 23.7% of the global newly reported cases and 15.7% of global deaths. India reported 91.23% (61 537) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.2% (2851), and Indonesia 3.6% (2473). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (8 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.0% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India continues to be rapidly increasing.

In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (65 156), followed by USA (54 199), and Brazil (46 305) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (63.1%). There were 5612 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Russia, and Philippines. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4131 to 65 156. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Chile, Iran, Japan, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and Bolivia; their range of reported new cases is 1468 to 3325.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease of 1.5%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 2.2%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; albeit, I wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [4E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.) The most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
