[Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a rare tick-borne zoonotic disease that causes acute febrile hemorrhagic illness in humans and monkeys, especially in the southern part of India. The disease is caused by the highly pathogenic KFD virus (KFDV) which belongs to the genus _Flavivirus_, family Flaviviridae. Seasonal outbreaks are expected to occur during the months of January to June.

There is no specific treatment for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD). Morbidity and mortality can be reduced by prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment, including maintenance of hydration, hemodynamic stability, and management of neurological symptoms. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, vaccination, and tick control are the key measures for the prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf). - Mod.UBA
