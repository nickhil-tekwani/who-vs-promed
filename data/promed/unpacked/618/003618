A total of 390 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotypes] Bareilly and Nchanga have been reported from 27 states and the District of Columbia. The 74 new cases are from Alabama (1), California (3), Connecticut (2), District of Columbia (1), Georgia (5), Illinois (2), Kansas (1), Louisiana (2), Massachusetts (3), Maryland (13), Nebraska (1), New Jersey (9), New York (10), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (9), South Carolina (1), Texas (7), and Wisconsin (2).

376 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Bareilly have been reported from 27 states and the District of Columbia. The number of ill persons with the outbreak strain of _S._ Bareilly identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (4), Arkansas (1), California (7), Colorado (1), Connecticut (11), District of Columbia (3), Florida (1), Georgia (18), Illinois (29), Indiana (1), Kansas (1), Louisiana (6), Massachusetts (36), Maryland (39), Missouri (4), Mississippi (2), Nebraska (2), New Jersey (35), New York (58), North Carolina (12), Pennsylvania (34), Rhode Island (6), South Carolina (4), Tennessee (4), Texas (13), Virginia (22), Vermont (1), and Wisconsin (21).

14 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Nchanga have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Nchanga identified in each state is as follows: Georgia (2), Maryland (1), New Jersey (2), New York (6), Texas (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (1).

Among 390 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 1 Jan 2012 to 3 Jun 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 30 years. 60 percent of patients are female. Among 291 persons with available information, 47 (16 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 18 May 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. The numbers of new cases have declined substantially since the peak in April 2012. The outbreak may continue at a low level for the next several months since some food establishments may be unaware that they received recalled product and continue to serve this frozen raw yellowfin tuna product, which has a long shelf-life. Food establishments should not serve recalled frozen raw yellowfin tuna product, and consumers should not eat it.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing surveillance to identify new cases.

[74 more cases of the outbreak strains are now reported since the last report, 4 weeks ago. The number of cases involved in this outbreak continues to increase. The following is extracted from the FDA statement regarding the manufacturing facility (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofFoods/CFSAN/CFSANFOIAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM303440.pdf):

"Tanks used for storage of process waters have apparent visible debris, filth, and microbiological contamination. Sand and activated carbon filter units used in manufacturing of water are not sanitized, and ventilation for tanks is not filtered to protect against contamination. There is no laboratory analysis for water used in ice manufacturing at the facility to show the water used to make ice is potable. Ice manufacturing lacks sanitary controls: ice manufacturing equipment at the Moon Fishery facility is located outside and is susceptible to adulteration from pests and the environment. Apparent bird feces were observed on the ice manufacturing equipment at Moon Fishery; insects and filth were observed in and on the equipment. Ice manufacturing equipment at your facility is rusty and situated so that the ice can not be protected against adulteration, as the ice manufacturing process is constructed into the flooring of the ice facility. Tuna processed at your facility, which is consumed raw or cooked, comes in direct contact with water and ice." - Mod.LL
