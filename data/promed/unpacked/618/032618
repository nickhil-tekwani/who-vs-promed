Both BTV-8 as well as BTV-1 are currently present in southwest
France. On Tue 9 Sep 2008, both serotypes were found to be present
simultaneously on 2 farms.

The French Minister of Agriculture will now insist on EU co-financing
BTV-1 vaccination.

About 11 000 cases of bluetongue have been confirmed in France this
year [2008, see commentary].

[BTV-8 vaccination is carried out throughout the entire territory of
continental France, which has been declared a protection zone (PZ).
Its application is voluntary, becoming obligatory only in cases where
prescribed by EU trade requirements (for animals which exit the
French protection zone). BTV-1 vaccine is applied only in the
southwest, declared "BTV-1,8 PZ", where its application is obligatory.

As reported by the French delegate to the EU's Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), during the 16 Sep 2008
meeting of the section "Animal Health & Animal Welfare" in Brussels,
as of 15 Sep 2008, more than 26 million doses of BTV-8 vaccine were
applied in bovines and more than 10 million in small ruminants. The
figures for BTV-1 vaccine were: more than 3.5 million doses in
bovines and more than 4 million in small ruminants.

The presentation included also the following historical figures on
the number of outbreaks (BTV-infected farms) in France since 2006, as follows:
BTV-8:
2006 -- 6;
2007 -- 21 585;
2008 -- as of 30 Jun 2008, 10 farms; as of 2 Sep 2008, 8804 farms; as
of 15 Sep 2008, 13 856 farms.

BTV-1:
2006 -- none;
2007 -- 3;
2008 -- as of 30 Jun 2008, 6 farms; as of 2 Sep 2008, 206 farms; as
of 15 Sep 2008, 1217 farms.

For the entire presentation (in French, including maps) see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/scofcah_16092008_fr.pdf>.

According to EU legislation, all BTV-susceptible animals are free to
move within the confluent Protection Zones (PZ) in Europe, e.g. from
the "BTV-8 PZ" in Germany to the BTV-8 PZ's in the UK, France, the
Netherlands and other BTV-8 countries, or from the "BTV-1,8 PZ" in
France to the "BTV-1,8 PZ" in Spain, etc. When the move is within a
PZ, no pre-movement testing is required. Animals for export to and
from any EU Member State have to fulfill basic export certification,
which means that a vet in the country of origin would have to check
and certify they are healthy i.e. no clinical signs of disease. As
bluetongue infection does not always express clinical signs in
infected animals, it is, therefore, not unexpected to see BT-positive
animals moving between Member States. Several such cases have been
reported in previous postings, such as UK ex France and ex Germany,
and -- most recently -- Hungary ex France. The continued advance of
BTV-1 from southwestern France to north and east, where ruminants are
being vaccinated only against BTV-8, is therefore a cause for great
concern, and not only to the French authorities. Further BTV-1 spread
can be hastened by trade in live animals throughout the EU. - Mod.AS]
