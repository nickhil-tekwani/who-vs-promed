The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in a 50-month-old dairy cow from Alberta. The animal
was first reported on Monday, 10 Jul 2006, based on preliminary test
results. The entire carcass has been incinerated and did not enter the
human or animal feed systems.
The CFIA has located the birth farm, and investigators are tracing other
cattle born on the premises within 12 months before or after the birth of
the affected animal.
Given its age, the affected animal was exposed to BSE after the 1997
implementation of Canada's feed ban. This scenario, as well as the animal's
age, is consistent with the experiences of most countries reporting cases
of BSE. Nonetheless, a full accounting and determination of how this animal
was exposed to BSE will be the primary focus of the CFIA's investigation.
The CFIA has extended an invitation to American animal health officials to
participate in this effort.
With a view to accelerating the eradication of BSE from Canada, the CFIA
announced on 26 Jun 2006 further enhancements to prevent specified risk
material (SRM) from entering the animal feed system, pet food and
fertilizers. SRM are tissues known to contain concentrated levels of the
BSE agent in infected cattle. These tissues have been removed from all
cattle slaughtered for human consumption since 2003. This key public health
protection is internationally recognized as the most effective way to
protect the safety of food from BSE.
This animal, along with all previous cases, was detected through the
national surveillance program, which targets the highest-risk animal
populations. The program is intended to establish the prevalence of the
disease and continues to indicate that only a very low level of BSE is
present in the national cattle herd. Canada has monitored its cattle for
BSE since 1991. Starting in 2003, the number of animals annually tested
sharply increased. During the same period, the CFIA, provinces and industry
have collaborated to promote awareness and encourage reporting of potential
BSE cases, which is an important factor in domestic and international
confidence.
The CFIA continues to receive excellent cooperation from the owner of the
affected animal and the Province of Alberta. Information obtained through
the investigation will be posted to the CFIA's website as details become
available.

An Alberta cow may have been stricken with Canada's 7th case of BSE, or mad
cow disease.
If found to be infected, the Alberta cow would be Canada's 7th confirmed
case of BSE and the 2nd in the last week. Officials expect to confirm their
findings by week's end. The agency confirmed last week that a cow in
Manitoba died of BSE.
The Alberta cow's age suggests it would have been exposed to the BSE agent
after the 1997 introduction of Canada's feed ban, likely during its 1st
year of life.
The agency's senior veterinarian George Luterbach said it was not uncommon
to have traces of BSE-infected products in the feed system after the 1997 ban.
"The incidents of BSE in the (cattle) population are very low," he said.
"One cannot take this from the perspective that this falls on the heels of
the (Manitoba) case."
The CFIA has placed the Edmonton-area farm under quarantine, although
officials caution [reassure that?] no part of the carcass entered the human
food or animal feed systems.
Luterbach said the suspected cow was about to give birth to a calf when it
died. Officials are now looking into whether the cow gave birth to any
offspring in 2004 or 2005.
Luterbach said the recent findings from Alberta and Manitoba should not
raise alarm in the United States, which closed its border to Canadian beef
between 2003 and 2005.
"The position of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is that Canada has a
sound and robust program," he said.
Luterbach said the CFIA has tested 115 000 cows since Canada's 1st case of
Mad Cow disease was discovered.
Recently, the federal government extended its feed ban. Under the new
rules, no animal feed, pet food or fertilizer can contain cattle parts that
are susceptible to BSE. Luterbach said these measures, combined with the
1997 ban, will lead to the disease being eradicated in Canada's herd in the
next 10-15 years.

[This becomes the 4th case of BSE in Canada this year -- 2 in Alberta, one
in British Columbia, and one in Manitoba. It is not surprising that a
feedborne disease with such a long and varied incubation period would have
a fairly wide geographic dispersion. For a map of the provinces see
<http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/ca.htm>.
This animal was most likely "born after the ban," but neither this fact nor
its geographic dispersion means that BSE is widespread in Canada. On the
contrary, it probably more accurately suggests that the Canadian BSE
surveillance system has had some success in identifying cases, which is a
good sign. The nature of transmission and unusual incubation period for a
transmissible agent would suggest that we will see the occasional cases of
the disease during the above mentioned 10-15 years that it may take to
eradicate the disease. An unfortunate fact, but such is life. - Mod.PC]
