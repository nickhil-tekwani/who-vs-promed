Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus disease (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that one case of this virus has been recorded in Al-Ahsa Governorate, [an 83 year old male] suffering from multiple chronic diseases.

[The MOH has pointed out that it has tested 43 samples during the past 24 hours, and all of them have resulted negative.]

[The confirmation of this case in the Al-Ahsa Governorate raises the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 54 including 30 fatalities, and raises the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia to 40 including 24 fatalities.

More information on the specific location of this case (if associated with the original healthcare facility based cluster in Al-Ahsa or another location), possible exposures and risk factors will be appreciated.

[This fatality raises the global number of fatalities attributable to infection with MERS-CoV to 31. More information on this case, including age, gender, location of infection within Al-Ahsa Governorate (if part of the healthcare facility based cluster) would be greatly appreciated. (At the time of writing of this report, the Saudi MOH English website does not contain information on this case). - Mod.MPP]

MERS-CoV - update 5 Jun 2013
----------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is a 14-year-old girl with underlying medical conditions who became ill on 29 May 2013. She is reported from the Eastern region, but not from Al-Ahsa where an outbreak began in a health care facility since April 2013. The patient is in stable condition.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [5 Jun 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 54 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 30 deaths. [The Saudi MOH website does not as yet contain information on this 14 year old girl -- nor does the WHO Global Alert and Response website reflect information on the 83 year old male mentioned on the Saudi MOH report of 4 Jun 2013 [above] - Mod.MPP]

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date [as of 5 Jun 2013]: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[It appears as though there are 2 different laboratory confirmed cases being reported during the last 24 hours -- one an 83 year old male, reported on 4 Jun 2013 on the Saudi MOH website and the other, a 14 year old female, reported on 5 Jun 2013 on the WHO GAR website. This will bring the global total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 55, and with the inclusion of the newly reported fatality in Saudi Arabia, the number of fatalities associated with MERS-CoV infection is 31.

With the myriad of reporting sites to check, and the variability in the time of posting of updates on the official sites, this moderator finds it a challenge to present an "accurate" updated count of numbers of documented laboratory confirmed cases and deaths attributable to infection with MERS-CoV. One hopes that our readership is patient with these challenges.
