Flu cases this year [2017] have doubled those from last year [2016], validating experts' fears that this season could be particularly bad.

Between [1 Oct and 25 Nov 2017], 5070 clinical lab tests were positive for the flu, up from 2510 in the same period last year [2016], from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of Americans who have contracted the illness is likely even greater, an agency spokeswoman cautioned, since most people don't go to the doctor and get tested.

This year's flu vaccine may not be as helpful as in past years. The one used in Australia was only 10 per cent effective, according to research published in October in the journal Eurosurveillance.

Researchers warned the implications for the Northern Hemisphere may not be the same, although the vaccine Australia used has the same composition as the one the US is using. As of [24 Nov 2017], about 148.2 million doses of the vaccine have already been administered in the US.

A spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur, a division of that produces about 40 per cent of the influenza vaccines distributed worldwide, cautioned the research only analyzed Australia. These findings may not reflect what will happen in the US, she said, because there is no guarantee [that] the strains that predominated in Australia will be the same [as those] that predominate here.

The effectiveness of flu shots can vary each year. The average number between 2006 and 2017 was 46 per cent. As for the outliers, 19 per cent (in 2014-15) and 60 per cent (in 2010-11) were the lowest and highest rates.

[An MMWR report published on [8 Dec 2017] analysed influenza activity in the United States from 1 Oct to 25 Nov 2017 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6648a2.htm?s_cid=mm6648a2_w). The new data from CDC indicate that, so far, this season influenza A (H3N2) viruses have been predominant in the United States -- a fact that is troubling because in previous flu seasons, H3N2-predominant seasons have been more severe, especially among young children and older adults. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against H3N2 viruses also is typically lower than VE levels against influenza H1N1 and influenza B viruses. It's not uncommon for a flu shot to have VE of about 30 per cent against H3N2 viruses.

CDC also released three reports on 2017-18 early-season flu vaccine coverage estimates among pregnant women, health care professionals and the general population (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/) . Among other things, the reports found that to date, only about 39 per cent of the US population reported getting a flu vaccine; this figure is similar to estimates from this time last season and means about 3 out of every 5 people remain unprotected [https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20171213fluupdate.html - Mod.UBA]

The flu season is under way, and although Maine so far is experiencing fewer cases of seasonal flu than most states, the predominant strain of influenza circulating in Maine and most of the US is more severe than last year [2016] and more likely to require hospitalization.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 373 cases of flu through [23 Dec 2017], the latest data available, with 99 hospitalizations. Flu is currently widespread in some southern and western states, including Texas, Alabama, South Carolina and Arizona, but has so far spared New England.

Number of reported influenza cases in Maine:
2017-18: 373*
2016-17: 5830
2015-16: 2360
2014-15: 4233
2013-14: 2029

*Through 23 Dec 2017. Flu season is from October through May.

Nationally, 13 475 flu cases were reported through 16 Dec 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last season, national numbers were about 120 000 reported cases, although the actual number is much higher because many cases of flu are not reported if the symptoms are not severe and the patients recover without seeing a doctor.

Flu season runs from October to May, and is unpredictable. Last year, for instance, there were only 52 flu cases in Maine through [24 Dec 2017] and 467 through the end of January, but cases surged in the last three months of the season. The state ended up with 5830 reported cases of flu in 2016-17, more than twice the previous year's total. A total of 40 per cent of cases required hospitalization in 2016-17, compared with 26 per cent so far this season.

Dr Siiri Bennett, state epidemiologist for the Maine CDC, said that "the large bulk of what we're seeing is influenza A (H2N3), which is more serious and more likely to cause hospitalizations and deaths, especially among those over 65 and young children." In Maine, about 55-60 per cent of flu cases in 2015-16 were influenza A, with the remainder influenza B, but so far this flu season about 80-90 per cent of cases are influenza A.

Bennett said it's difficult to say whether there will be a sudden explosion in cases - like there was last spring - or a steady stream, or if flu cases would decline this spring. "It's still too early in the season to say what flu season will be like," Bennett said. "It's certainly not too late to get vaccinated." Vaccines are widely available - at drugstores, primary care physicians' offices and some workplaces, and are usually free for patients.

Part of the calculation is how effective the vaccine is from year to year, as CDC scientists try to predict which strains of flu will be circulating.

The Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) revealed a number of people have died from the Australian flu after cases of infection more than doubled in 7 days. Public Health England reported a 156 per cent jump in cases of infection as figures revealed 1111 people were struck down with it last week.

Dr Kevin Kelleher, from the Health Protection department, said: 'There have been a few deaths already, under 10 people have died so far this year. I don't give specific numbers when it's less than 10 because people could be identified. The most important thing is that if people think they've got it is to stay at home and look after themselves.'

The so-called 'Aussie flu' is a particularly virulent strain of influenza A and is said to have triggered the huge rise in cases, along with an aggressive B subtype. Last week 522 cases of type A and 546 cases of type B were recorded in England and Wales.

UFC [Ultimate Fighting Championship] star Conor McGregor was said to have been bedridden after being hit by a bout of the Australian flu. The 29 year old shared a lengthy Instagram post saying he and 'half his family' had contracted the virus. 'Well that was a wild New Year's Eve. Half the family hit with the Australian flu virus and some even left in hospital with it,' he said in the post which has since been deleted. 'One of the most intense few days I've gone thru. Big New Year's Eve party cancelled at the last minute and I am left shaking in bed the past 2 days. I'll leave that with the rest of the bad behind me in 2017 and take with me the many great experiences I've had this year.'

The H3N2 subtype, which is a strain of influenza A, triggered 2 and a half times the normal number of cases in Australia.

The number of flu-related deaths recorded in Ireland so far is under 10, with the HSE urging people to get vaccinated against it. A further 73 people have been hospitalised. In a statement, the executive said the number of reported cases of flu had increased in the week before Christmas and that flu 'is now actively circulating in Ireland'.

The seasonal influenza (H1N1) outbreak has turned into an epidemic in Southern Punjab cities and killed 18 citizens so far since December last, while the Punjab government has declared emergency in all hospitals after the situation entered into critical dimension.

Families of victims complained that no vaccination counter could be established at Nishtar Hospital for public vaccination due to lack of resources. Health officials said that only screening counters have been established while facility of vaccination for public was not available.

"We have established only screening counters of influenza instead vaccination counters. The public should vaccine privately", Seasonal Influenza focal person Dr Attaur Rehman told The News on [Tue 2 Jan 2017].

The immediate cause of spread of seasonal influenza could not be established yet. The Nishtar Hospital doctors of medicine say that the disease is transferred man to man and the research was in progress to establish cause of its spread.

Statistics available with health department says that total 56 suspects have reported in southern Punjab districts from December to onward including 33 suspects reported in Multan, 2 in Dera Ghazi Khan, 5 in Khanewal, 6 in Muzaffargarh, 3 in Vehari, 1 in Toba Tek Singh, 3 in Lodhran, 1 in Rajanpur and 2 in Layyah.

Of the total 28 influenza suspects, patients declared positive 23 negative and laboratory test reports are awaited for 5 patients. A total of 12 influenza positive suspects died at hospitals while 6 died with negative test results in southern Punjab's nine hospitals.

The district-wise break up says 9 positive and one negative influenza suspects died in Multan. One influenza negative died in Dera Ghazi Khan and three died in Khanewal. In Muzaffargarh district, 2 influenza positive died while in Vehari one positive and one negative died. No deaths have been reported in Toba Tek Singh, Rajanpur, Layyah and Lodhran.

The official statistics have indicated that Multan ranks at top where maximum influenza suspects reported followed by Muzaffargarh, Vehari and Khanewal.

A special team [from the] World Health Organization (WHO) [has arrived] at Multan to investigate the outbreak of swine flu [A/H1N1Pdm09]. When Punjab minister for primary and secondary health Imran Nazir along with secretary health Syed Najam Shah and director general health Akhtar Rasheed reached Multan, they visited the Nishtar Hospital there.

The health authorities have warned that next 20 days are critical and the influenza vaccine has been supplied to Nishtar Hospital. Health sources revealed that a total of 40 patients had been brought to different hospitals of Multan during the last year on suspicion of seasonal influenza, out of which 23 tested positive and 14 negative while the reports of 3 others are awaited. Sources further revealed that out of 23, as many as 16 patients belonged to Multan, 2 Lodhran, 4 Muzaffargarh and 1 Vehari. Similarly, 9 deceased were from Multan, 2 Muzaffargarh and 1 Khanewal.

On the other hand, the district administration declared that emergency medical treatment arrangements for the likely influenza (also known as swine flu) patients had been made at all the public hospitals. Similarly, the district administration has also issued a strict warning to all private hospitals to shift all suspect patients of influenza to Nishtar Hospital as soon as they receive them.

Meanwhile, addressing a rally, the DC Nadir Chattha said that a massive awareness campaign had been launched to make the people aware of the disease outbreak and to save precious human lives. He said that a vaccination drive was also being launched on emergency basis while the citizens were asked to adopt precautionary measures. He said that all the suspect patients of influenza received at Nishtar Hospital were shifted to isolation ward within 4 hours after their tests. He said that the majority of the patients were over 40 years of age.

Dr Shahid Bokhari said on this occasion that every citizen would have to play his role to defeat the disease outbreak. He stressed that citizens to adopt all precautions, wash hands frequently and refrain from touching others.

The district focal person for epidemics Dr Ataur Rehman disclosed that the influenza vaccine is available at Nishtar Hospital and all the suspected or confirmed patients are being provided effective treatment. He said that the virus outbreak is likely to continue for next 20 days and then there would be a decline. He said that a massive campaign has been launched by the health department and efforts would continue till complete elimination of the disease ...

A total 777 people succumbed to swine flu [Influenza/H1N1[ in Maharashtra in 2017, of which 148 deaths were reported from the city [Pune, Maharashtra] alone.

Going by the analysis, the H1N1 virus hit the state harder in 2017 than the previous year [2016]. Barring 2015 when the virus had claimed the maximum 905 lives, the year gone-by grappled with one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Maharashtra since 2009.

The virus activity attained 2 distinct peaks in 2017, indicating its severity in the state last year [2017]. According to scientists at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV), the country's premier virology research institute, virus transmission was at an all-time high first during summer (March/April) and then during the monsoon period (August/September).

State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said, "India has been witnessing 2 peaks during transmission seasons in which one of the peaks is slightly more extended than the other one. Only difference last year [2017] was that the virus transmission was slightly more extended during both the peaks."

The scientists pegged the virus's overall positivity rate at 23 per cent in 2017. It means among the total suspected patients, 23 per cent tested positive for the infection. The rate touched an all-time high of 33 per cent in the last week of September 2017.

Michigan strain
---------------
Since 2009 swine flu pandemic, the California strain of the virus (influenza A (H1N1) pdm09) had been doing the rounds in India. Since January this year [2017], however, NIV scientists have been seeing only the Michigan strain of the swine flu virus. Experts said the new strain could be behind the increase in cases and mortality, but it is yet to be proved scientifically.

City worst hit
--------------
Pune continued to be the epicentre of the virus activity even in 2017. Among the state's 9 administrative circles (each circle comprises 5 to 6 districts and municipal corporations), Pune circle that includes Pune (PMC, PCMC, and rural areas), Satara (city and rural parts) Solapur (corporation and rural parts) recorded maximum 5456 cases and 258 deaths in Maharashtra.

Within the municipal limits of Pune Municipal Corporation as many as 703 cases and 148 deaths were recorded due to the disease in 2017.

Mumbai circle recorded 4020 cases and 32 deaths. Kolhapur circle recorded 914 cases and 87 deaths. Nashik circle recorded 1112 cases and 110 deaths. Aurangabad circle 668 cases and 51 deaths Latur circle recorded 312 cases and 10 deaths. Akola circle recorded 719 cases and 42 deaths and Nagpur circle recorded 543 cases and 123 deaths.

[It is impossible to predict exactly how the flu season will unfold this year in the United States; however, the Southern Hemisphere influenza season can provide clues as to the severity and strains that we are likely to experience. Australia's 2017 flu season was particularly concerning, as the country saw 217 559 laboratory confirmed notifications of influenza as of [24 Oct 2017] -- more than twice the number of cases that were reported in calendar year 2016. More than 50 children were hospitalized, and there were more than 500 influenza-related deaths, most of which occurred in adults over the age of 65.

The dominant circulating influenza virus in Australia this season was H3N2, a subtype of influenza A [there are 4 total types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D]. Influenza seasons where influenza A(H3N2) predominated were found by one study to have the highest rates of influenza-related hospitalizations compared with other influenza viruses. Another study found that A(H3N2) infections resulted in more severe clinical disease than other influenza viruses, including higher fevers and more severe laboratory abnormalities [https://www.outbreak observatory.org/outbreakthursday-1/11/9/2017/the-2017-18-influenza-season-predicting-the-future-by-looking-to-the-past].

The 2017-18 influenza vaccine being used in the Northern Hemisphere contains the same viral components as the vaccine used during the 2017 season in the Southern Hemisphere. In addition, the H3N2 vaccine component Australia used during its 2017 season is the same as that contained in the US influenza vaccine used during the 2016-17 flu season.

Data recorded by influenza surveillance systems in Australia between May and September 2017 were used to estimate VE of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine at preventing medically attended illness in that country, said CDC. According to those estimates, influenza VE was 33 per cent against all influenza viruses circulating in the Southern Hemisphere last season. VE against influenza A (H3N2) viruses was 10 per cent, while VE against influenza B viruses was estimated to be 57 per cent.

Even so, said CDC, the VE measured in Australia may not be predictive of what will happen in the United States this season.

During the US 2016-17 season, overall vaccine effectiveness was 39 per cent. VE against influenza A (H3N2) viruses was 32 per cent, and VE against influenza B viruses was 52 per cent.

According to CDC recommendations;
- health care professionals should continue to recommend influenza vaccine now and throughout the flu season to all unvaccinated patients ages 6 months and older who don't have contraindications;
- children aged 6 months to 8 years who had not previously received a total of two or more doses of any trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1 of this year (doses don't have to be received during same flu season) require two doses for the 2017-18 flu season. The doses should be given at least four weeks apart;
- influenza antiviral medications are important in treating and preventing the spread of influenza;
- at particular risk are patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated or progressive illness; those who require hospitalization; and those who are at high risk for influenza complications. In such cases, these medications should be given as close to the onset of illness as possible https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20171213fluupdate.html - Mod.UBA

Fresh news today from Public Health England indicates that influenza activity continues to increase across all surveillance indicators with notable increases for respiratory outbreaks and influenza confirmed hospitalisations, with influenza A and B co-circulatinghttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/671692/Weekly_national_influenza_report_week_01_2018.pdf.
