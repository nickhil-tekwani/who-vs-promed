Some Answers to the "Why The Delay" Question
--------------------------------------------
In "West Nile virus, human case - USA (New Jersey)," Martin S. Chomsky said
"The time period involved in the testing of human blood for West Nile virus
seems to take forever. Since the initial blood test was taken on 2 Oct
2000, why has it taken almost 3-1/2 months for the positive blood test to
be confirmed? Perhaps a ProMED-mail contributor or reader may have some
information that can explain the reasons behind the lengthy confirmation
process."
Whereas I have no direct information regarding this particular case, based
on previous experiences I know that there are a large number of possible
reasons for such delays, including:
(1) The attending physician may be attending to the patient and not
concerned about a specific diagnosis: the "Tunnel-vision" explanation;
(2) There is no point in conducting a neutralization test on a single serum
(acute-phase) sample positive by IgG ELISA, until one has the second
(convalescent-phase) sample in hand. The first serum (October) might not
have been available to CDC and so they simply treated the second (November)
sample as a "first" sample; seems reasonable. They then collected and
tested additional samples and tested the entire series of samples in January.
(3) Type-specific antigens are not available, else a single serum might
have been adequate to make at least a provisional serodiagnosis.
(4) Priorities change after the "mosquito season" ends.
(5) Neutralization tests take up to a week to conduct.
(6) Chanukah, Christmas, and Kwanzaa cause delays in testing.
(7) Poor communication (likely reason).
(8) Incompetence (unlikely reason).
There are probably more reasons, but as long as people consider West Nile
virus no threat or a minimal threat to the human and livestock populations,
priority will not be given to tests and they will not be done in a timely
manner. Perhaps when this virus has spread throughout the U.S. and to our
neighbors to the south and north, then funding authorities will get serious
about the need for additional research funds, albeit just a little too late.
