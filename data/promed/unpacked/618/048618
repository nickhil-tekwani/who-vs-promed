THE ELEVENTH PLAGUE
********************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

We make no apology for plugging this exciting book, which has just
gone on sale in paperback, for the following 3 good reasons:
1) It is dedicated to ProMED-mail -- see below
2) ProMED-mail stars in it, and
3) A portion of the book advance, generously donated by the authors,
has helped keep ProMED-mail alive over the last year (we may be
cost-free to you, but we have computer bills, overhead & honoraria to
pay!)
To quote Charlie Calisher's post on the hardcover edition last Feb.:
>John Marr, M.D., and John Baldwin have co authored "The Eleventh
Plague", a novel about medical terrorism... I would like to share with
our subscribers the Preface:
"The Eleventh Plague, sui generis, is fiction. But the men and women of
the Federation of American Scientists, SatelLife and World Health
Organization, who created and continue to support the concept of
ProMED, are quite real. This book is dedicated to these scientists
and to ProMED-mail. ProMED-mail may be our best hope should fact
follow fiction."<
The Eleventh Plague by John Marr, John Baldwin

Book Description [abridged]
---------------------------
Two children die of a disease thought to be nonexistent in the United
States. Within hours, thoroughbreds at the legendary Churchill Downs
are dying of a virus that cannot be identified, even by the most
expert veterinarians. Called in to solve these lethal mysteries,
noted virologist Jack Bryne discovers the two bear uncanny
similarities to the Fifth and Sixth Plagues described in the Book of
Exodus.
And the horror is just beginning...
Every month another monstrosity claims its victims. Every month
brings the reenactment of another more catastrophic plague. Soon
Bryne's own worldwide medical computer network, ProMED, is invaded by
the power behind the horrors, a diabolically intelligent serial
killer with a sophisticated knowledge of toxins and an obsession with
biblical retribution. To make matters worse, the FBI is convinced
Bryne himself is the killer...

[Any resemblance of characters in the book to real persons is, of
course, purely coincidental!
This book should not be confused with the excellent factual book of
the same title, by Leonard Cole, dealing with biological warfare -
