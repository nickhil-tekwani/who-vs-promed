Anthrax infections continue in Bangladesh
------------------------------------
The number of reported anthrax infections in Bangladesh continues to
rise, with 8 more people found to be infected. The 8 new infections
bring the total number of infections in Sirajganj and Pabna to 171,
BDNews24.com reports. All eight of the newest infections were from
the Shahjadpur Upazila [sub district] area, which has seen a total of
48 anthrax infections so far.

To fight the infections, which are believed to have stemmed from the
consumption of anthrax tainted meat, teams have been dispatched to
vaccinate cattle in Belkuchi, Kamarkhand, and Shahjadpur Upazila in Sirajganj.

No human deaths have been reported to date as a result of the anthrax
infections, which were first detected in Sirajganj on 19 Aug 2010.

The anthrax form affecting the Bangladeshi villagers is a cutaneous
form that produces black lesions on the skin. While not directly
transferable between people, anthrax spores are able to infect people
through the air. As the threat of bioterror anthrax has grown,
attention is also focused on preventing and containing naturally
occurring anthrax breakouts.

Bangladesh is the 7th most populous country in the world. The south
Asian nation also has the highest population density in the world
among countries with more than 10 million people, according to a 2005
United Nations study.

[This is increasingly odd. All the diagnosed cases to date have been
cutaneous, e.g., lesions that are normally associated with
slaughtering and butchering sick animals and handling the meat
therefrom, and no deaths. With 171 cutaneous cases, that reflects a
significant number of infected cattle, and no gastroenteric cases? In
a poor country densely packed with people? Some acute deaths may need
revisiting. There are some Indian studies that indicate that where
exposure is not uncommon some exposed individuals become immune and
therefore are not sickened when eating contaminated meat. If that is
the case here, this disease in Bangladeshi livestock must be more
frequent than the official statistics indicate. The only other
protective factor is overcooking infected meat. In retrospect, I
suspect that there may be a lot to learn from this epidemic. - Mod.MHJ]
