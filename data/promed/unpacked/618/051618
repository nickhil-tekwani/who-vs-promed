Vol. 351, No. 9107, P. 928; Weisfuse, Isaac B.

In a commentary published in the Lancet, Isaac B. Weisfuse, of the Bureau
of Sexually Transmitted Diseases for the New York Department of Health,
contends that changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in _Neisseria
gonorrhoeae_ may lead to the emergence of new forms of drug resistance and
the reawakening of gonorrhea. Reported cases of the disease have declined
over the past two decades, but it is still the second most common bacterial
sexually transmitted disease--behind _Chlamydia trachomatis_--in the United
States, with 800,000 cases reported annually. Asia, Canada, Europe, and
Australia have all identified decreased susceptibility to flouroquinolone,
the most common treatment against gonorrhea, as well as antibiotic
resistance; data also indicates the possible importation of flouroquinolone
resistance into the United States. Weisfuse notes that trovafloxacin, a new
quinolone antibiotic, has been shown to be as effective as ofloxacin in
treatment of gonorrheic cervictis and urethritis, and that it may be more
active than other quinolones against the disease. Furthermore, the
treatment is a single-dose, oral medication. Weisfuse suggests that further
research be conducted to determine the efficacy of trovafloxacin on
patients with decreased susceptibility or resistance. He also recommends
that measures be taken to counteract the spread of gonorrhea, including the
implementation of sensitive, urine-based screens and the initiation of the
Institute of Medicine's guidelines on control of sexually transmitted
diseases in the United States.
