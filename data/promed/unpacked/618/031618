The City-County Health Department in Great Falls [Cascade County, Montana] says there are now 3 confirmed cases of pertussis, often called whooping cough, among students at C.M. Russell High School [CMR].

Since 1 Jan 2014, there have been 423 cases of pertussis in Montana, with 16 of those cases in Cascade County. The Great Falls Public School District announced on Thursday, 11 Dec 2014, that 2 people at CMR had been diagnosed.

CCHD health officer Tanya Houston said that they are conducting "contact-tracing" in an attempt to find anyone who has come into contact with people that have been diagnosed. If these people have symptoms they will recommend that they contact their healthcare provider for testing and treatment. Contact-tracing is how they discovered the 3rd case of whooping cough at CMR.

The Allegheny County [Pennsylvania] Health Department today [11 Dec 2014] announced that a growing number of pertussis cases are being reported in the county. "To prevent further transmission of the disease, we would like to remind residents of all ages, but especially school-age children, to follow proper cough etiquette and hand washing techniques. This includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or sleeve and washing hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds," said Health Director Dr. Karen Hacker.

The Clinton County [New York State] Health Department has confirmed that multiple area schools have recently been affected by pertussis. On Tuesday, 2 Dec 2014, the Plattsburgh City School District sent a letter informing parents that a small number of cases of the highly contagious disease had been confirmed in more than one district building. The district wished to make people aware of the potential for exposure in an effort to break the cycle of transmission, according to Health Department public-health nurse Karen Merrill.

"Pertussis is also known as whooping cough, and that's because of the signature sound that is often heard when a person is coughing," Merrill said. "It's also known as the 100-day cough. And that's a long time to cough."

Cases of pertussis are on the increase in Western North Carolina, with 19 cases reported in Buncombe County, according to Buncombe County Health and Human Services.

Based on the CDC recommendations, Buncombe County Medical Director Dr. Jennifer Mullendore strongly recommends a one-time Tdap booster for preteens, teens and adults. It is also recommended that all women receive a Tdap booster in the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, regardless of whether they were already immunized.

Practice good health habits, like frequent hand-washing or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, can help prevent the spread of pertussis and other illnesses.

[It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
