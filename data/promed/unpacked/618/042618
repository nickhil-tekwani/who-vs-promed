Carcass of elephant sighted, anthrax suspected officials said
-------------------------------------------------------------
"Blood was oozing out of its mouth while its tusks were intact which made us believe that the 9-year-old jumbo might have died of anthrax", Sanjay Kumar Swain, divisional forest officer [DFO] of Baripada, said.

Blood samples of the deceased tusker were collected and sent to the Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI), Phulanakhara to ascertain the exact cause of death, he said.

At least 9 elephants are reported to have died in Mayurbhanj district since last month [November 2015]. In similar circumstances 2 elephants had died of anthrax last year [2015], the DFO said.

To ward off the possibility of anthrax, more than 8000 domestic animals were [vaccinated] in the periphery of Similipal sanctuary following the confirmation of anthrax in blood samples of the jumbos by the ADRI, Phulanakhara, the DFO added.

[Though very brief, the details provided indicate that this dead tusker is but a part of what is now clearly an ongoing park elephant epizootic. The location of the nearby livestock vaccination has this case in the Similpal National Park, from which we had a report on 4 Aug 2015; see 20150804.3556122. The latter 2 reports -- 20151202.3834917 and 20151207.3845799 -- were also in the greater wildlife park complex. So we can presume that the elephant epidemic is progressing possibly unaffected by any direct wildlife disease control actions.

A virtually identical report, obviously from the same official news release, reported, "A carcass of a tusker was sighted near Ambapani nullah under Dukura range inside Similipal sanctuary today" (see http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/carcass-of-elephant-sighted-anthrax-suspected/1/546041.html) confirming the elephant inside the Similipal sanctuary.

Similipal National Park is a national park and a tiger reserve situated in the Mayurbhanj district in the Indian state of Odisha. It is part of the Similipal-Kuldiha-Hadgarh Elephant Reserve popularly known as Mayurbhanj Elephant Reserve, which includes 3 protected areas, that is, Similipal Tiger Reserve (2750 sq km/1062 sq mi), Hadgarh Wildlife sanctuary (191.06 sq km/73.75 sq mi), and Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary (272.75 sq km/105.3 sq mi) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simlipal_National_Park.
