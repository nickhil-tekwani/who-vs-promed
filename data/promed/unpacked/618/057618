[Egypt reported approximately 160 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza during 2014-2015. On 7 Mar 2016, the 1st case was reported from Sohag from 25 Feb 2016.

The number of confirmed cases in Egypt since 2003 now stands at 347, and the global total is now 847.

Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.

Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt. Greater Cairo is the largest metropolitan area in the Middle East and the Arab world, and 15th-largest in the world.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) was notified of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Guangdong by the National Health and Family Planning Commission today (15 Mar 2016), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a woman aged 40 in Huizhou, Guangdong. She developed fever and cough on 20 Feb 2016 and was admitted to a hospital in Huizhou on 22 Feb 2016. She is now in critical condition. Investigation revealed that the patient had visited a live poultry market before onset of symptoms.

From 2014 to date, a total of 10 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are statutory notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

"We will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is underway. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:

* Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
* If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[Avian influenza A (H5N6) emerged in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6. Official data show that since the 1st case was discovered in 2014 through today, 15 Mar 2016, China has reported 10 cases of human infection of H5N6 avian influenza virus with 5 deaths, The 1st case was reported in Sichaun province in April 2014, the 2nd in Guangdong province in December 2014, the 3rd and 4th, Yunnan province in 2015, and the remaining 6 cases in Guangdong province in December 2015- Mar 2016. It is hoped that this increasing incidence of H5N6, albeit still low, does not portend further increase in activity.
