A Scottish drug addict has become a victim of botulism
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Glasgow have been warned of the outbreak after the
addict was diagnosed with the disease at the city's Stobhill Hospital.
Accident and Emergency units, drug agencies and city GPs have been told of
the user's illness and have been warned to be on the look out for any
similar cases.
Sayed Ahmed, a public health consultant at Greater Glasgow Health Board,
said letters had been sent to the health staff to alert them to the
"sporadic" case. He said: "This health board can confirm that wound
botulism has been identified and is currently being treated in Stobhill.
Wound botulism is an extremely rare condition and is not a transmissible
disease. There are no wider health concerns."
Dr Ahmed said there had to date been 5 cases reported in the UK, 2 of which
were in Glasgow. The last case was confirmed in the city last year.
The consultant went on: "The organism that causes botulism produces spores
which are commonly found in the environment. The spores are usually found
in soil or mud and thrive in an environment devoid of oxygen. If the spores
are either present in the injecting material or around the injection site,
and the injection is into the tissue, it creates the perfect condition for
the infection to establish itself."

"Rare" botulism case sparks concern
The disease could be spread by injecting drugs
------------------------------------------------
A man is seriously ill in a Glasgow hospital suffering from what doctors
believe is a rare form of botulism. If the disease is confirmed, he will
become only the fifth person in the UK to contract wound botulism. It is
thought the man contracted the potentially fatal disease through
contaminated heroin.
Last year, 40 addicts across the UK and Ireland, including 18 from Glasgow,
died after contracting an illness which caused severe inflammation of vital
organs from infected heroin. A health board report described an
"unprecedented outbreak of severe illness" among 60 users in Scotland,
mostly in Glasgow, between April and August 2000. And it identified the
bacterium _Clostridium novyi_ -- from the same family [genus of organisms
as wound botulism -- as the cause of the illness. Although no other cases
of wound botulism have been reported, there are fears among the city's 16
500 injecting addicts that a batch of contaminated heroin is back on the
streets of Glasgow. The man was admitted to Stobhill hospital in the north
of the city last weekend.
Doctors are still awaiting test results but are confident they have
correctly identified the wound botulism infection -- which causes slow
paralysis. The organism that causes wound botulism is commonly found in the
environment and heroin users provide it with the ideal conditions to
thrive. Health experts said this is likely to be a one-off case, and was
probably diagnosed because of the increased vigilance of doctors in the
Glasgow area.
Dr Syed Ahmed, a public health consultant at Greater Glasgow Health Board,
said: "Because it is not transmissible from person to person there will be
no implications for the wider public. There will be implications for other
drug injectors if they shared heroin with this patient, or if the batch of
heroin is contaminated. We have alerted all accident and emergency
departments and GPs. We are looking out for other cases."
Dr Laurence Gruer, an expert on drug abuse at the Public Health Institute
for Scotland, said: "The bug produces a toxin which basically paralyses the
muscles and it's one of the most powerful toxins known. Even a tiny amount
is enough to cause weakness of the muscles. The biggest risk is that it
will prevent you from being able to breathe if the muscles around your
diaphragm and ribcage fail to work. The message is that as long as you are
injecting street heroin you take the risk that it is contaminated with
other things."

[Wound botulism has been reported in injecting drug users (IDUs) in the
United States and in Europe. Wound botulism occurs after spores of _C.
botulinum_ have germinated in a wound and produce toxin leading to a
flaccid paralysis clinical picture. Association with drug injection was
first reported in 1982 in New York City (1). In 1995 there were 19 cases
reported in California associated with contaminated black tar heroin (2).
In 1998 there was an outbreak of 5 cases reported in Switzerland all
associated with illicit injection drug use.
After the outbreak of _C. novyi_ in IDUs associated with contaminated
heroin in the UK last year, there has been heightened surveillance for
unusual illness among IDUs in the UK. Continued surveillance should
identify if this was an isolated contamination by the user or if this
associated with a larger contamination of a batch presently in use in
Scotland. Additional information from official sources would be very much
appreciated as it becomes available as official information is preferable
over newswire reports.
