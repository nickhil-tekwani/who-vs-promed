Citrus canker, suspected - USA (Florida) 980702231211
Date: 6 August 1998
From: Tim Schubert <schubet@doacs.state.fl.us>

The Florida Division of Plant Industry has just updated its publication
entitled Bacterial Citrus Canker that includes a brief summary of the
recent developments in all three sites in Florida where the disease is
active. The publication can be accessed on the WWW at:
<http://www.ifas.ufl.edu/~entweb/cank377.html>
The recent developments are due to the discovery in late June 1998 of
canker in a commercial grapefruit orchard near Immokalee (Collier County)
in Southwest Florida. So far, the disease has been found at moderate
levels in one 70-acre orchard, and on three trees in an adjacent orchard.
The 70-acre orchard is in the process of being destroyed in its entirety.
In the adjacent orchard with only three infected trees, the infected trees
and all other trees within 125 feet [38 meters of the infected trees have
been removed. In the 7 weeks of inspection of other adjacent and
associated (associated by movement of personnel, equipment, etc.) citrus
orchards, no other canker has been found in the area. Genetic typing of
the pathogen in the Immokalee area (actually typing of the plasmid of the
bacterial pathogen) matches that of the pathogen which was discovered in
the Miami area (Dade and Broward Counties) in September of 1995. It has a
recognizably different plasmid from the pathogen that is now active in
Manatee County. This latest outbreak in Manatee County was first detected
in May of 1997, and appears to be a carryover from the eradication program
that took place from 1986-1992. Canker was declared to be eradicated
(after two years of no canker finds) in January 1994.
All in all, these last three years in Florida have been the worst on record
for outbreaks of exotic agricultural pests. Even in the last 12 months,
Florida plant agriculture has had: 1) five Mediterranean fruit fly finds
(Bradenton in Manatee County, Miami Springs in Dade County, Tampa in
Hillsborough County, Umatilla in Lake County, and Sebring in Highlands
County); 2) the three on- going citrus canker eradication programs
mentioned above; 3) the whitefly-transmitted tomato yellow leaf curl
geminivirus discovered first in Dade County, now in several counties
statewide; 4) the honeybee pest known as the small hive beetle (_Aethina
tumida_) discovered in St. Lucie County; and 5) the Asian citrus psyllid
(_Diaphorina citri_, one of the vectors of citrus greening) discovered in
Broward, Martin, and Palm Beach Counties.
