The number of Northeastern University students suspected of being
sick with the mumps rose to 9 this evening, with one suffering
symptoms sufficiently severe to require hospitalization, Boston
public health authorities said. The students bear the telltale signs
of the viral illness, including facial swelling, fever, headaches,
muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The germs [virus] can
spread via coughing, sneezing, or talking. All 9 students are
undergraduates, and they range in age from 18-22, said university
spokesman Mike Armini.

To contain the spread of the disease, which in rare cases can lead to
brain inflammation and deafness, Northeastern and disease specialists
from the Boston Public Health Commission have urged the ill students
to avoid crowds and stay in their rooms. Some of the students live in
on-campus dormitories while others reside off campus. "All of their
roommates, if they have roommates, are being tested," Armini said.
"And if there's a need to provide an individual room for someone,
that will be done."

In a letter, university administrators urged about 500 students to be
especially vigilant for signs of the mumps because they shared
classes with the undergraduates believed to be stricken with the
disease, a once-common scourge of childhood now seen infrequently in
the United States because of widespread vaccination.

Northeastern authorities estimate that 99 percent of the student body
is immunized, and shots are being offered to the handful who are not.
Although the vaccine provides protects most people, it fails to
provide full protection for 10 to 20 percent of those who receive it,
disease specialists estimate.

[The number of mumps cases in the university student population has
increased from 4, reported on 16 Apr 2009 (see ProMED archive number
20090417.1455), to 9 a day later. It is interesting that 9 mumps
cases in this report from Boston, Massachusetts, has created greater
concern than the 9 cases in Scotland in the report below, perhaps
because within the university student population the risk of
transmission among the susceptible cohort (mumps virus non-immune) is
greater.

In the Lothians last week, 9 cases of mumps were among the infectious
diseases recorded. The area's count made up for more than half of the
country's overall cases, with the majority understood to have
occurred in 15-24-year-olds.

Although the figure is higher than it has been for some time, it is
not thought to be high enough to cause any concern among health
chiefs.
