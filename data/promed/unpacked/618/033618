North Korea has been gripped by a mystery new intestinal 'epidemic', the country said today, 16 Jun 2022, an unusual announcement from the secretive country that is already contending with a COVID-19 outbreak and severe economic turmoil. It is unclear how many people are infected in what the official Korean Central News Agency said was 'an acute enteric epidemic' in southwestern Haeju city.

The agency didn't name the disease, but enteric refers to intestinal illnesses, such as typhoid, dysentery, and cholera, which are caused by germs in contaminated food or water or contact with the feces of infected people. Such diseases routinely occur in North Korea, where there is a shortage of water treatment facilities and the public health system has been largely broken for decades.
