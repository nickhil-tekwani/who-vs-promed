Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak hits Vancouver Island Hospital
---------------------------------------------------
Parts of Saanich Peninsula Hospital closed on Monday night because of
an outbreak of what appears to be Norwalk-like virus infection. So
far, 41 patients and 14 staff members at the hospital are sick, but
there is only one confirmed case of Norwalk virus infection. The
tests are not back to confirm that Norwalk virus is what's making the
rest sick. Until then, officials are classifying it a "Norwalk-type"
illness.
Currently, 25 patients and 6 staff members in extended care units 1
and 2 are sick, and those units are closed to new admissions. In the
hospital's south wing acute care ward, 13 patients and 7 staff
members have fallen ill. That wing is also closed to new admissions.
And in the central wing, 3 patients and one staff member are sick.
Saanich Peninsula Hospital's emergency room is still assessing
patients, but is not admitting them. Instead, patients are being
diverted to Royal Jubilee Hospital or Victoria General.
The hospital Christmas party has been cancelled this year because of
the outbreak. Staff have been asked to be even more vigilant than
usual about washing their hands. Symptoms of Norwalk virus infection
usually disappear in 24 to 48 hours. There is no treatment, except
for rest and fluids.

Toronto General Hospital Affected by Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Emergency Department at Toronto General Hospital (TGH),
University Health Network closed as of 6:00 PM today due to patients
and staff who have become ill with symptoms similar to Norwalk-like
virus infection. The Toronto Western Hospital Emergency Department
remains open.
Ambulances have been advised that the TGH Emergency Department is
closed. Patients experiencing Norwalk-like symptoms are requested to
call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 for advice, go to walk-in
clinics, or see their family physician. Symptoms include sudden onset
of diarrhea or vomiting, as well as abdominal pain and nausea.
Although quite contagious, Norwalk-like viruses are non-lethal and
are a common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in hospitals, nursing
homes, and day care centres. Usually, it is transmitted from
hand-to-mouth through contaminated hands, food, or water. Symptoms
usually last from 24 to 48 hours, and appear one or 2 days after
being in contact with the virus. The following precautions are being
taken at TGH to limit the spread of the virus: Patients with symptoms
have been isolated; all persons entering the room where symptomatic
patients are located will need to wear gowns and gloves; additional
environmental precautions are being taken by cleaning and
disinfecting hospital common areas; all patients admitted to TGH via
the Emergency Department since Friday are being closely monitored to
see whether they develop any symptoms.

[These outbreaks of presumptive Norwalk-like virus infection are
unusual in that they now appear to be occurring almost simultaneously
in general hospitals across Canada from Prince Edward Island in the
east to Vancouver Island in the west. It has not been confirmed,
however, that Norwalk-like viruses are the etiologic agents in every
case. - Mod.CP]
