The _E. coli_ [O157] that sickened at least 8 in [Rice County] came from a traveling petting zoo, according to preliminary test results released by the state on Fri 8 Aug 2014. The Minnesota Department of Health received the positive preliminary test results after taking samples from animals that were part of the Zerebko Zoo Tran petting zoo at the Rice County Fair in mid-July 2014.

The Department of Health has been investigating 8 different cases of _E. coli_ in Rice County confirmed between 9 and 24 Jul 2014, 5 of which required hospitalization. However, District One Hospital has reported that there have been 9 cases in Rice County. The only way the Department of Health is made aware of a case is if someone calls their hotline or if a doctor submits the patient's stool sample. Although the preliminary results have come back positive, the Minnesota Department of Health said there are numerous sub-strains of _E. coli_ O157:H7. Because of the sub-strains, further testing is being done, but they have confirmed that the strain that was found in each case is E. coli O157:H7.

The Department of Health said they're expecting final results early next week [week of 11 Aug 2014]. The results will include DNA fingerprinting, which will identify whether the organism found in the samples is an exact match to the strain that is making people sick. Carrie Klumb, an epidemiologist with the Department of Health, said all of the cases have one thing in common: contact with an animal.

Wally Zerebko, owner of Zerebko Zoo Tran in Bovey [in Itasca County, Minnesota], said the preliminary results are inconclusive. As the Department of Health continues to investigate and await the final results, Zerebko and his animals remain at home. "They are telling me lives are at stake, I know that," he said. "That's why I am at home and why I encouraged them to come down and test."

Zerebko brought his petting zoo to Olmsted County following the Rice County Fair where he says they had 100 times the people passing through, but he hasn't heard of any cases of _E. coli_ there. The Department of Health said its investigation is ongoing, but at this time it doesn't have any confirmed cases from the Olmsted County Fair as part of this outbreak.

[Restriction endonuclease analysis (DNA fingerprinting) of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strains isolated from the human cases and the livestock from the petting zoo will be needed to confirm the epidemiological association. That there were no cases from the Olmsted County fair could be explained on differences in the physical surroundings of the petting zoo there, how accessible hand washing facilities were, or intermittent excretion of the EHEC. - Mod.LL
