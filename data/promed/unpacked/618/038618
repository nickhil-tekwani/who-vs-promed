Sea lice outbreak behind losses at Lakeland Smolt
-------------------------------------------------
The 100 per cent-owned subsidiary of Norwegian Marine Farms ASA -- Lakeland
Smolt -- has suffered losses recently due to high mortality and reduced
growth of its salmon at one of its farms on the west coast of Shetland:
Hoganess Salmon.

Caused by an outbreak of salmon lice, farm losses incurred are estimated at
GBP 2 million (EUR 2.2 million/USD 3.2 million) in the 2nd half of 2009,
divided more or less equally between the 3rd and 4th quarters. New
estimates for harvest volumes in the 2nd half of the year are 2500 tonnes
in the 3rd quarter and 3000 tonnes in the 4th quarter.

Farmers on the west coast of Shetland will work together to improve the
coordination of salmon lice control in the area. An outbreak of sea lice
already caused devastating industry losses toward the end of 2008. With its
hatchery and head office in Holmwrangle, the fully integrated producer has
been operating within the UK salmon farming industry from 2 sites in
Cumbria since 1987. It specialises in the vertically integrated production
of high-quality Atlantic salmon from the broodfish through egg, fry, parr,
smolt, and fully grown salmon to the sale of gutted salmon and fresh fillets.

[The sea louse species _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ and _Caligus elongatus_
are the 2 species responsible for major economic losses in salmonid
aquaculture in the northern hemisphere. _L. salmonis_ is distributed around
North America, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, and Norway, whilst _C. elongatus_
is restricted to the North Atlantic and is not found in the Pacific Ocean.

_L. salmonis_ is rarely found on non-salmonids. It has a host range
covering more than 10 species of salmonid fish, including the economically
important Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), sea trout (_Salmo trutta_), and
rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) (in the UK, Ireland, and Norway), and
Pacific salmon (_Oncorhynchu_ spp.) in North America and Canada. These
crustacean parasites feed on the mucus, skin, and blood of the host,
resulting in major economic losses in salmonid aquaculture through direct
damage caused to the host and through treatment costs.
