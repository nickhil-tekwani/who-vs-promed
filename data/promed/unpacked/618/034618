Yellow fever in Senegal - WHO Update 3
--------------------------------------
As of Thu 24 Oct 2002, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 41 cases
and 4 deaths of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacke
and Bambey districts, Diourbel region and Gossas and Fatick
districts, Fatick region. A total of 33 cases were reported from
Touba where urban transmission was occurring. The increase in case
numbers from the previous update:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/october/18october2002.html>
is based on testing that was just completed. Most of the positive
results were for samples collected early in October shortly after the
immunization campaign began in Touba on 1 Oct 2002. The ongoing
immunization campaigns in Diourbel region have achieved coverage
rates of 78-94 percent (Touba = 94 percent) and the number of suspect
cases in this region is declining.
The dates of onset of illness for the 2 most recent confirmed cases
were 17 and 20 Oct 2002. Both cases were reported from Gossas
district. An immunization campaign has been planned, but additional
vaccine and operational support are needed to begin the campaign.
Surveillance has been intensified in all districts in the country,
including active surveillance in Dakar. To date, there have been no
confirmed cases in Dakar.
Laboratory testing is being performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre
at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD). The Institut de Recherche
pour le Developpement is carrying out entomological investigations,
and with IPD and WHO, has been assisting the Ministry of Health with
surveillance and epidemiological investigations. WHO is supporting
the immunization campaign with both technical assistance and vaccine
supplies.

Senegal: Yellow Fever Outbreak alarms WHO
-----------------------------------------
A yellow fever outbreak in Senegal has raised concerns among
officials at the World Health Organisation. WHO fears the disease
will spread if the government has to stop a mass vaccination campaign
for lack of funds. The organisation says 3 people have died among 32
cases of yellow fever.
All the [urban] yellow fever cases in Senegal have been reported in
and around the city of Touba which is northeast of the capital,
Dakar. WHO spokesman Ian Simpson said urban yellow fever is
particularly dangerous. "The reason why it is dangerous in an urban
setting is because if you have a population of these particular
mosquitoes and you have people living closely together, you have
yellow fever. Mosquitoes have plenty of people to bite and pick up
the infection when they have someone to bite and then they will pass
it on. And that is why it spreads quickly. It is just that
concentration of people and mosquitoes and disease all in the same
place is very bad news for yellow fever," he said. Yellow fever is
transmitted through the bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. People
who are struck with the disease turn yellow and run a high fever.
Simpson said good treatment is available. But many of those who do
not receive treatment quickly will die. "It does not kill by any
means all of the people it infects, but it does kill people and it is
a pretty nasty fever. We are simply trying to keep the numbers down
because if it is killing 10 percent of the people who are affected,
then you just have to do the math to see that if it infects a few
hundred people, you will get large numbers of people dying. And that
is clearly what we are trying to avoid," he said.
The World Health Organisation first learned about the outbreak of
yellow fever in Senegal toward the end of Sep 2002. WHO Spokesman
Simpson says the best way to prevent the epidemic from spreading is
to vaccinate every person in the affected region. The Senegalese
government began a mass vaccination campaign in the affected area on
1 Oct 2002. But Simpson said the government is running low on
vaccines and needs nearly US$1 million to buy enough vaccine to
immunise hundreds of thousands of people who are at risk.
