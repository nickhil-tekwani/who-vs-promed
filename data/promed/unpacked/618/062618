News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 69 827 people have been vaccinated, including 20 241 in Beni, 16 390 in Katwa, 7860 in Butembo, 6008 in Mabalako, 2626 in Kalunguta, 2080 in Komanda, 1911 in Goma, 1755 in Oicha, 1663 in Mandima, 1157 in Karisimbi, 877 in Vuhovi, 873 in Kayina, 842 in Kyondo, 750 in Masereka, 700 in Lubero, 599 in Mutwanga, 560 in Rutshuru, 527 in Nyankunde, 524 in Biena, 442 in Musienene, 434 in Bunia, 355 to Tchomia, 167 to Kirotshe, 125 to Nyiragongo, 114 to Alimbongo, 159 to Mangurujipa, 45 to Watsa (Haut-Uele) and 13 to Kisangani.

- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

Preventive measures in Watsa (Haut-Uele)
----------------------------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, is in Watsa, Haut-Uele province, since Tue 29 Jan 2019 to supervise the prevention activities following the detection of a confirmed case in Katwa, from Watsa, Sat 26 Jan 2019.

- He is [the confirmed case] a young trader living in Watsa who is used to going back and forth between Watsa and Butembo. In-depth investigations revealed that the trader was contaminated during his stay in Katwa and not in Watsa. However, as a precautionary measure, a team of epidemiologists, vaccinators and infection prevention and control experts were dispatched to Watsa to vaccinate their relatives and front-line health workers, as well as to decontaminate their home and the center in which he had been hospitalized.

[The case of the trader highlights the difficulty of contact tracing. Kudos to the epidemiologists for determining the point of infection. It is good the relatives were vaccinated in Watsu, even though that turned out not to be the origin of the infection, but no doubt the trader had many contacts en route between both locations. Those individuals are at risk.

Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell)
#Ebola thread: 2 more health workers have been infected, according to this week's situation report from @WHOAFRO. That makes 63 infected health workers since the outbreak began; 21 have died.

2. The number of children orphaned by this #Ebola outbreak continues to climb, according to @UNICEF's most recent situation report. The agency has helped 601 orphaned or separated children since the start of the epidemic.

4. Neat idea: Community resistance, which sometimes spills over into violence, continues to hamper the response. One approach to getting people to trust #Ebola treatment centers has been to give tours, to dispel rumors.

5. Occupancy at #Ebola treatment centers in key locations is high. Really high.

#DRC does some #Ebola vaccinating in a place called Watsa, in Haut-Uele province, after a traveling trader tests positive for Ebola. Watsa is more than 300 mi (more than 500 km) NE of Butembo, where he is believed to have been infected. A new distant front in this war would be bad.

Location in Katwa
-----------------
- Katwa continues to be the main focus of the Ebola outbreak, having recorded 65 percent (68/104) of confirmed new cases in the last 21 days.
- Several factors contributed to the significant increase in confirmed cases in Katwa this month:

Urban Delinquency: Offender groups disrupt the response by preventing the performance of important activities such as immunization, household decontamination and dignified and safe burials.

Community reluctance: Despite the involvement of customary, religious, politico-administrative and civil society authorities, many Katwa residents continue to deny the existence of the disease and refuse to follow contact and vaccination. However, significant progress in community involvement in Katwa has been achieved, in particular through greater involvement of women's associations.

Demonstrations: The protests in Beni and Butembo on 27-28 Dec 2018 paralyzed the activities of the riposte for several days. The activities were not able to fully resume until 2 Jan 2019. The graph of the alerts below [see URL] shows the significant decrease of the alerts received and investigated during this period. This prevents people infected with the virus from being quickly transferred to the Ebola Treatment Center for proper care and their contacts to protect themselves with vaccination. In addition, since the beginning of the year [2019], several days of dead city life in Butembo and Katwa have also slowed down the response in these areas.

- When the response is slow, the risk of geographical expansion of the epidemic increases due to uncontrolled displacement of patients and their contacts. Thus, after the paralysis of the response in late December 2018, contacts of confirmed cases moved, and brought the epidemic in 2 new health zones in January 2019: Mangurujipa and Kayina. The investigations revealed that Kayina's confirmed cases are members of a Katwa family who participated in the unsecured burial of one of their relatives. In this family, 21 people have already been infected.

[Dailymail, abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6645001/Two-DR-Congo-soldiers-killed-Ebola-virus-army.html

Two soldiers in eastern DR Congo have died after catching Ebola in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the region, army and health sources said on [Tue 29 Jan 2019].

"Two of our soldiers have died from the Ebola virus in Beni. Three others are under observation," army spokesperson Major Mak Hazukay told AFP. "All measures have been taken to stop the troops from being contaminated," he added.

The deaths of the soldiers brought the total toll to 459 recorded deaths, according to official figures, and highlighted the challenge of controlling the epidemic in the strife-torn east. Dr. Michel Tosalisa, in charge of the affected Beni region, confirmed 2 soldiers were among the latest Ebola victims.

- Wed 30 Jan 2019. Ebola infects 9 more in DRC as ill traveler sparks response measures
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/ebola-infects-9-more-drc-ill-traveler-sparks-response-measures
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The number of people infected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak grew by 9 today [Wed 30 Jan 2019], as health officials in the neighboring Haut Uele province took steps to prevent the spread of a disease from a resident who was exposed to the virus in Katwa.

Spike in Katwa cases continues
------------------------------
Of the 9 newly confirmed cases announced today by the DRC health ministry, 8 are in Katwa, the current hot spot where authorities face complex challenges, including insecurity, community resistance, and the after effects of a response slowdown in late December [2018] caused by election-related protests.

The other case is in Beni. Investigations are under way into 187 suspected Ebola cases. Today's developments push the outbreak total to 752 cases, including 698 confirmed and 54 probable cases.

The health ministry also said 4 more people died from their Ebola infections, 3 of them in community settings in Katwa and 1 in the Butembo Ebola treatment center. The new fatalities lift the outbreak's death count to 465.

Infected traveler in Haut Uele province
---------------------------------------
A health team has been sent to a city of Watsa in neighboring Haut Uele province after a young trader was hospitalized there after his likely exposure in Katwa, the health ministry said in its update today [Wed 30 Jan 2019], noting that Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the country's health minister, arrived there yesterday [Tue 29 Jan 2019] to oversee operations.

Haut Uele province is north of Ituri province and borders South Sudan. So far, Ebola cases in the current outbreak have been confirmed in only 2 DRC provinces: North Kivu and Ituri.

The man lives in Watsa but travels back and forth between Butembo and his hometown. An investigation into his illness suggests he was exposed to Ebola during a stay in Katwa, which is on the eastern outskirts of Butembo. Watsa is about 300 mi [approx. 500 km] north of Butembo. Healthcare teams were sent to vaccinate relatives and frontline health workers and to decontaminate the patient's home and the health center where he was treated.

Soldiers among recent deaths in Beni
------------------------------------
In a separate development, 2 soldiers with the DRC's army have died from Ebola in Beni, Agence-France Presse (AFP) reported today [Wed 30 Jan 2019], quoting an army spokesman.

The army source told AFP that 3 other soldiers are under observation and that steps have been taken to prevent illness in DRC troops.

[Haut Uele province would be a new province where Ebola virus is active in the DRC. To date, the virus has only been detected in Ituri and North Kivu provinces. This represents expansion of its activity. Preparedness efforts in the bordering country of South Sudan are in place.

- Mon 28 Jan 2019. Congo Ebola cases rise to 736 as problems noted in Katwa
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/congo-ebola-cases-rise-736-problems-noted-katwa
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Over the weekend and through today [Mon 28 Jan 2019], the DRC reported 15 more Ebola cases, including 5 earlier probable infections from Komanda, one of the areas where responders had faced security challenges.

Also, the country's health ministry shed more light today [Mon 28 Jan 2019] on factors that have fueled a steep rise in cases in Katwa, which has become the current hot spot, and South Sudan today launched a campaign to immunize health workers and frontline responders with VSV-EBOV vaccine.

Case count climbs to 736
------------------------
In the latest 3 daily updates, the latest cases were from a several locations. Of the 10 confirmed cases, 4 are in Beni, an area where cases have declined but was once the outbreak's epicenter. Two others are in Oicha, and 4 are in Katwa, the current hot spot.

The 5 probable cases in Komanda were added after investigations into deaths that occurred in November and December [2018] concluded that they were likely due to Ebola. The new cases boost the overall outbreak total to 736 cases, which include 682 confirmed and 54 probable infections. In its update today [Mon 28 Jan 2019], the ministry said health officials are still investigating 161 suspected Ebola cases.

Besides the 5 deaths in the earlier probable cases, the health ministry reported 8 more deaths, including 7 patients from Ebola treatment centers in Katwa, Butembo, and Mabalako. One of the deaths involved a patient from Oicha who died in the community. The latest deaths push the outbreak's overall fatality count to 459.

Disruptions, reluctance in Katwa
--------------------------------
In its update today [Mon 28 Jan 2019], the DRC's health ministry said several factors have led to a significant increase in cases in Katwa this month, including local groups that have obstructed response activities such as immunization, household decontamination, and safe and dignified burials.

And despite broad community sensitization efforts, many Katwa residents continue to deny that Ebola exists, the ministry said. He added, "However, significant progress in community involvement in Katwa has been achieved, in particular through greater involvement of women's associations."

Also, demonstrations related to problems with the DRC's national election in late December [2018] brought the outbreak response to a standstill for several days, the ministry said, which resulted in a large drop in Ebola alerts that officials received and investigated. As a result, people with Ebola weren't quickly taken to Ebola treatment centers for care, and contacts weren't vaccinated.

Several "dead" days since the beginning of the year [2019] in Butembo and Katwa have also slowed the Ebola response. "When the response is slow, the risk of geographical expansion of the epidemic increases due to uncontrolled displacement of patients and their contacts," it said.

After the response interruptions, people who were contacts of confirmed cases moved and brought the virus to 2 new health zones in January: Mangurujipa and Kayina. And investigators found that Kayina's confirmed case-patients are members of a Katwa family who participated in the unsafe burial of a relative. Infections have been confirmed in 21 family members.

Officials push back against assertions
--------------------------------------
In an unusual step, the health ministry in its [26 Jan 2019] update disputed some information in a [15 Jan 2019] Foreign Policy article that discussed the challenges in the DRC's outbreak.

It said the article contained some "dubious and problematic" assertions, for example, that the health workers were threatened by soldiers, gangs, arms smugglers, and rapists. The health ministry clarified that most assaults and threats on responders have come from people residents of Ebola-affected communities. It added that several Ebola cases have been detected in areas controlled by armed groups that have agreed to work with response teams to curb the outbreak.

The health ministry also said the article inappropriately linked possible sexual transmission in survivors and the use of rape as a weapon of war. It said no cases of "military rape or rape contamination" have been reported in outbreak areas and that there is no objective evidence to back up the assumption that "rapist and robber soldiers" could spread the virus.

The ministry said Ebola survivors and their families are being followed by clinical psychologists and that so far rape has not been mentioned as a source of trauma in populations affected by the outbreak.

South Sudan vaccine launch
--------------------------
In South Sudan, which has a border not far from the DRC's outbreak area, the health ministry and its partners today began vaccinating health workers and frontline responders against Ebola as part of larger preparedness efforts, according to a statement today [Mon 28 Jan 2019] from the World Health Organization (WHO) South Sudan office. Groups supporting the efforts include the WHO; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; UNICEF; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vaccination began in Yambio in Gbudue state, and health workers in the cities of Tombura, Yei, Nimule, and South Sudan's capital city of Juba--all considered high-risk areas--will also be offered the vaccine.

The country has received 2160 doses of VSV-EBOV from Merck.

Matshidiso Moeti, MD, the WHO's regional director for Africa, said in the statement, "It is absolutely vital that we are prepared for any potential case of Ebola spreading beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo." The WHO said it has deployed more than 30 staff members to support preparedness efforts in South Sudan, has helped train 60 health workers, and established 17 screening points that have screened nearly 1 million people so far.

Gavi has assisted with the Ebola vaccine stockpile and has provided USD 2 million to support WHO vaccination efforts in countries that neighbor the DRC's Ebola-affected area.

In November [2018], health officials launched a similar vaccination campaign in Uganda, one of the other neighboring countries.

[Rather than casting blame for violence inflicted on the health care workers, we need to find a way of changing community perception. As in most outbreak situations, social science is almost equally important as vaccines, treatment.

[3] Preparedness and prevention
-Thu 24 Jan 2019. Following a full simulation exercise, a joint monitoring mission is deployed in Rwanda
[All Africa, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201901240562.html

Following the Full Simulation Exercise (FSIMEX) conducted in Rwanda at the beginning of January 2019 to assess EVD readiness/preparedness and response capacity in the country, an external Joint Monitoring Mission (JMM) team comprising of WHO specialists and partners relevant to the EVD preparedness efforts in Rwanda was deployed in the country.

The scope of the JMM was to provide additional support to the Republic of Rwanda to:
1. Strengthen its preparedness should there be introduction of EVD into the country;
2. Review the preparedness and readiness activities already undertaken, this was based on the findings from the full simulation exercise (FSIMEX) conducted and the recommendations from the preparedness Joint Monitoring mission team;
3. Advocate for prioritization and support to national EVD preparedness capacity and capability to ensure operational readiness for response to a potential importation of an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) case;

Given the geographical position of Rwanda as landlocked country sharing borders with Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and DRC, POEs were determined to be critical.

The Preparedness Joint Monitoring Mission recommended that there was a critical need for more support for the Rwandan Refugee Transit Centers. A number of key preparedness measures will also have to be scaled up, not only at POEs, but also District Hospitals and Ebola Treatment Centers.

[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/01/29/actualite/sante/dr-michel-yao-tant-quon-naura-pas-controle-ebola-dans-toutes-les-zones

Dr. Michel Yao: "As long as we have not controlled Ebola in all areas, none of the areas are safe"

Dr. Michel Yao is Head of Emergency Operations for the World Health Organization (WHO) / Africa and Ebola response coordinator in North Kivu and Ituri notes that control of Ebola virus disease in infected areas will allow other unaffected provinces to be sheltered. It encourages people to follow the measures recommended by health authorities to fight Ebola.

"We must continue efforts. That means you cannot let your guard down. When it improves, we must continue vigilance, we must have the entire community aware to eliminate this epidemic. It also shows that until the epidemic is controlled in all areas, none of the areas are safe, including even those that are not in North Kivu or Ituri province, warned Dr. Michel Yao.

He also notes that this epidemic is very dangerous. "Since the beginning of this epidemic, we have about 18 health zones that are affected, including 14 in North Kivu. As for the numbers, yesterday [Mon 28 Jan 2019] we were more than 736 cases and 415 deaths. This shows an epidemic of exceptional magnitude. It is currently the biggest epidemic after that of West Africa," warned Mr. Yao.

For him, the epidemic of Ebola occurs in an exceptional context of security, but also in a context where the populations do not know the disease, in a context of reluctance or resistance even rather exceptional.

"It's a dynamic population that moves for economic reasons, but also for security reasons. There is also the acceptation of the answer. It is a scary disease and therefore people are reluctant. And this reluctance holds back an effective response. These include the non-acceptance of the secure burial, it is also the refusal of vaccination that are all measures that can control this outbreak, "he added.

According to Dr. Michel Yao, the mobility of the population favors the spread of this epidemic.

[4] Treatment: Why Couldn't My Treatment Center Save This Baby?
Date: Wed 30 Jan 2019
Source: New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/opinion/ebola-treatment-democratic-republic-of-congo.html

While promising vaccines and experimental treatments for Ebola are rapidly being added to our arsenal, they're not much use if people are too afraid to seek care.

A young mother stepped out of the ambulance into the triage area of our Ebola transit center here in the northeast of the country. She moved slowly, careful not to wake the sick baby, swathed in layers of linens, that she carried in her arms. They had been brought to the center for testing because health workers suspected the baby might have Ebola.

We are 6 months into this latest Ebola outbreak. It is the worst on record for the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the 2nd largest ever, after the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa. We've come a long way since then. An estimated USD 60 million is being allotted for this outbreak, and most patients can now expect to receive one of 4 experimental drugs as part of their treatment regimen. There is also a promising vaccine that is used to protect those most at risk of contracting the disease, like health care workers and people who have come into contact with the ill. And yet Ebola continues to find new people to infect.

According to the DRC Ministry of Health, as of [Tue 29 Jan 2019], there had been 743 reported cases and 461 deaths -- a 62 percent mortality rate. There were 14 new cases last [Wed 23 Jan 2019] alone. Six of them died at home, without having been to any Ebola treatment center.

That day when the mother and baby came to our center, I was standing on the other side of a fence that isolates the possibly contagious from the rest of us. I watched the young mother for a while, but I couldn't catch her gaze. She appeared lost in her thoughts.

We were all waiting on the medical team to see what was wrong with the baby. But moving, with Ebola, is frustratingly slow. Doctors and nurses must wear "Ebola armor" -- plastic boots, 2 pairs of gloves, a face mask, goggles, a full-body impermeable plastic suit and a thick plastic apron. Because it's as hot as a sauna inside it, they can't wear the protective gear for very long. So every time a new patient arrives, a new team has to suit up.

To partly remedy the problem, we employ Ebola survivors to help in the triage area. Thanks to their acquired immunity to Ebola, they need much lighter protection, and so can be with patients much longer. They are the ones who spend the most time with patients as they are isolated for the 3 days it takes for testing. They are the ones who take care of the children and the babies who have to be separated from their mothers for this period.

If the patients don't have Ebola, they get to go home or to the hospital for further medical care. If they test positive, they will be transferred to the Ebola Treatment Unit just down the street, where they could remain isolated for weeks.

Unlike us, unrecognizable in our scary spacesuits, survivors bring a human touch to the frightening experience. And unlike us, they know what it feels like to be sick, unable to have your family at your side. They are the ones who started helping the mother and her baby while the medical team was suiting up.

I watched as Chantal, a survivor who is also a nurse, began to carefully unwrap the baby in order to record its vital signs.

She placed the baby in the hanging scale, carefully supporting its head. But something looked awfully wrong.

"Lift the arm up and let go," I said.

The arm fell back, completely limp. I looked at Chantal, then looked at the mother. She didn't seem to have noticed anything. Or if she did, she didn't show it. The baby was carefully wrapped up again and the mother sat back down, waiting. A few minutes later, the medical team showed up, all dressed in their bright yellow suits.

It was too late. The baby was dead.

Perhaps the disease had progressed too quickly. Or perhaps the mother delayed coming. People often do, and it's hard to blame them. There are rumors that Ebola is a business run by foreigners just to make money, and that the vaccine is a kind of poison. Such misinformation pushes people to seek care from traditional healers in hopes of avoiding the Ebola Treatment Units. Sometimes they even flee when an Ebola response team's armada of SUVs, flanked by armed police officers, speeds toward their village.

Attacks from armed groups here remain, after all, a regular affair, and the presidential elections contributed to the volatility. Certain areas remain out of reach to response teams, which means new cases of Ebola can go unnoticed.

But there is more we can -- and must -- do.

While promising vaccines and experimental treatments are rapidly being added to our arsenal, this technology is not a panacea. It is, after all, of little use if people don't come to a treatment facility or come only when it's too late. We must engage better with communities. We have to recognize where people are coming from and what their fears and expectations are in order to build trust.

We also need to reconsider some of our approaches to care. We could, for example, stop building huge testing and treatment centers in favor of small, more welcoming local structures. We could initially isolate and care for some patients in their own homes while their test results are pending. We could train members of the community, survivors especially, to help with that work. And we could consider new ways to safely allow select family members to be with loved ones during their time in isolation. Mothers of young patients, for instance, could be allowed to don protective gear for regular visits, so that they don't have to feel like they're abandoning their children in order to save their lives.

That way, maybe next time, we'll be able to help that sick baby before it's too late.

[I have posted the entire opinion piece because it is not available to all readers and it is important reading. Karin Huster raises the issue of how to change the current situation to be less threatening. New approaches to treating patients must be considered, as she suggests in her article. The more reluctant people are to come to health clinics, the more difficult it is to control virus spread and the greater the death rate. The DRC outbreak calls out for rethinking how best to control movement of infected individuals and care for them before it is too late. It is heartbreaking to see babies die when possibly they could have been saved had they been treated earlier in the course of their illness. - Mod.LK]
