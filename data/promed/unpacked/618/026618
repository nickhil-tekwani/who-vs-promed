Bird flu confirmed in Crimea
-----------------------------
The H5 strain of bird flu was found in chickens and geese in 2
districts on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea, the Ukrainian
Agricultural Policy Ministry's press service said Saturday [3 Dec
2005], according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
The strain was found in the villages of Nekrasovka and Sovetskoye in
the Sovetsky district of the Crimea, and in the villages of
Izobilnoye and Emelyanovka in the Nizhnegorsky district, the news agency said.
The birds tested positive for H5 strains of bird flu, but it was not
clear whether they have the H5N1 strain researchers fear could cause
a human pandemic. Samples will be sent to laboratories in Britain or
Italy, the Agricultural Policy Ministry told Interfax.
On Friday [2 Dec 2005], mass poultry deaths were reported in villages
in the Sovetsky, Nizhnegorsky and Dzhankoi districts, Interfax said.
A total of 1500 birds have died.
Ukrainian Agricultural Policy Minister Oleksandr Baranivsky said a
crisis team of experts and scientists were working in the Crimea,
Interfax reported.
To date, the only human cases of H5N1 bird flu have been confined to
Asia, but the deadly strain appears to be spreading among migratory birds.

[The Crimea (officially Autonomous Republic of Crimea), is a
peninsula and an autonomous republic of Ukraine (see map
at
<http://www.travellersworldwide.com/Images2000/maps/crimea-map.gif>).
It borders the Kherson region from the North; the rest of the border
is the Black Sea in the South and West and the Sea of Azov in the
East. Its area is 26 100 square km with a population of 2.0 million
(2004). The capital is Simfeopol.
The Azov Sea basins, and the Crimean territory, are situated on a
main flyway of various species of migrating birds.
Seropositive swans were detected in October [2005] in Romania,
adjacent to the Ukrainian border.
Relevant ornithological information, including data from (Russian)
literature on epidemiological surveillance (which is known to have
been undertaken in migratory birds in this region during the second
half of the previous century), will help. - Mod. AS].
