EPPO report on detection of regulated pests
-------------------------------------------
[This is a new format that I have developed in consultation with
Anne-Sophie Roy, Information Officer, EPPO, for presentation of the EPPO
non-compliance reports. I hope it is more informative and easier to read
than the usual EPPO non-compliance reports The numeral at the end of each
reported non-compliance represents the number of interceptions. As
indicated in the first paragraph of the Note below, it should not be
considered an official statistic, but rather an indication of the state of
trade within the European area.
I am suggesting that acronyms for pathogens be used, but only in the case
where the same pathogen is cited more than once. The first time the name of
the pathogen is cited in a report, the complete name of the pathogen
(bacterium, fungus) is indicated, followed by an acronym in brackets. For
example, _Clavibacter michinganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (Cms) would
refer to the first citation of this pathogen. Subsequent reports citing the
same pathogen would read as: Cms..... For viruses, the name of the virus is
indicated, followed by the acronym. For example, Plum pox potyvirus (PPV)
would refer to the first instance and subsequent citations would be PPV.
I welcome your comments and suggestions. - Mod.DH]
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance (as
they are now called by FAO draft ISPM) received since the previous report
(EPPO RS 2000/186) for:
1) 2000 from the following countries: Algeria, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel,
Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom.
2) 2001 from the following countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland,
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.
Note:
Interceptions should NOT be interpreted as confirmed presence of a pest in
a country. Errors or even falsifications may occur (the origin of the
consignment may be incorrect, pest misidentified, etc.). EPPO publishes
reports on these notifications of non-compliance because they are an
indication of the practical problems that are encountered in Europe. They
can give useful indications and help countries to identify pathways (type
of commodity + origin) that may present a risk. Some interceptions might
indicate the presence of a pest in countries where it was not reported
before, but this always needs to be VERIFIED.
In most cases, interceptions occur at the time when the commodity enters
the country (seaports, airports, border crossings etc.). The commodity is
officially inspected by duly authorized phytosanitary inspectors. It may
happen that the commodity is released at the point of entry, and inspected
later at the production site to avoid unacceptable delays in trade or to
avoid damage to the plants or plant products. The commodity may also be
released but kept under surveillance waiting for the results of various tests.
All notifications of non-compliance are made in this official framework.
The aim is that the importing country informs the exporting country that
the commodity is refused entry on the basis of visual inspection and/or a
series of laboratory tests. The basis of the refusal is that it did not
comply (non-compliance) with the phytosanitary regulations of the receiving
country because the product was infected/infested with a quarantine pest
that should not be present in its territory.
