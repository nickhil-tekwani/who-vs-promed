While I am not the authoritative source you sought regarding this posting,
I can offer an anecdotal account of being on mefloquine prophylaxis during
one of my annual trips to work in Liberia and returning to the US with
falciparum malaria in March 2000.
Following treatment, I did an exhaustive search for any reports concerning
mefloquine resistance in the Upper Guinea subregion and did find a single
report listing Liberia. Unfortunately, the only citation presently at my
fingertips suggests the existence of mefloquine-resistant falciparum
malaria only in adjacent Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire as well as Burkina
Faso in late 1988 (Raccurt CP et al. 1991).
Given the sub-region's complex emergency that began in late December 1989
in Liberia, the collapsed health infrastructure since then, the porous
borders, and geopolitical entanglements among the various warring factions
still active in the subregion, the issue of mefloquine resistance is an
important and interesting topic. I too encourage an authoritative source to
provide us with more details.

Marines' Malaria Cases Show Protections Failed
----------------------------
Despite extensive preventive measures, most of the more than 200 Marines
who spent time ashore in Liberia during August 2003 apparently contracted
malaria, with about 43 of them ill enough to be hospitalized.
The malaria outbreak amounts to a stunning failure of standard protections
against a disease that the American military is unusually keen to prevent
in troops deployed to the tropics. So many Marines became sick in such a
short period of time that Navy physicians for a while doubted the illnesses
could all be due to the mosquito-borne infection.
Although the malaria diagnosis has been confirmed in only 15 percent of the
troops, they and their officers report that nearly all who spent the 2
weeks ashore reported at least mild symptoms typical of malaria. Navy
physicians and epidemiologists investigating the outbreak believe most of
the onshore troops may have been infected.
"We are extremely, extremely concerned about this," said Capt. Gregory J.
Martin, a physician at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, where all
but 2 patients are being treated. The concern is shared not only by the
military's infectious diseases and preventive medicine specialists but by
combat commanders, he said.
The outbreak occurred even though the troops were taking a drug to prevent
the disease, were instructed to use insect repellents, and were wearing
uniforms treated with long-acting insecticides.
How the Marines became infected despite these measures is uncertain,
although failure of the drug to reach adequate concentrations in the
troops' bloodstreams is a leading hypothesis.
The patients, members of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit except for
several Navy medical corpsmen, were taking mefloquine (sold as Lariam), a
standard drug used to prevent and treat malaria. West Africa is not known
to be an area with high rates of mefloquine-resistant disease, although
occasional cases have been reported there. U.S. troops in West Africa have
since switched to an alternative medication, doxycycline.
This is the most intensive outbreak of malaria in the U.S. armed services
in recent memory and the largest number of cases among Marines since the
deployment to Somalia a decade ago. All of the cases were caused by
_Plasmodium falciparum_, one of 3 types of malaria parasite and by far the
most dangerous.
The number of malaria cases in the armed services in recent years was not
available yesterday. The Army, which has the most, reported 57 cases in
2002, 52 in 2001, and 55 in 2000.
31 patients arrived at the Bethesda hospital Sunday and 10 yesterday
morning [Tue 9 Aug 2003]. 2 others are being treated at the Army hospital
in Landstuhl, Germany.
No one has died in the outbreak, but 2 patients in the Bethesda intensive
care unit have cerebral malaria, the most feared form of the disease, with
a fatality rate of about 20 percent. They are conscious, improving, and
expected to recover fully, said Lt. Cmdr. David L. Blazes, an
infectious-diseases physician treating them.
Members of the Marine unit, normally stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., went
ashore 12-14 Aug 2003 and returned to their 2 ships 10 to 12 days later.
Soon afterward, many reported common symptoms of malaria, including
headache, pain behind the eyes, and muscle aches accompanied by cyclical
fevers.
Malaria is normally diagnosed by using a microscope to look for malaria
parasites inside red blood cells. Many of the Marines were diagnosed aboard
ship that way. In some of the 43 people -- 40 Marines and 3 sailors -- no
parasites were seen, probably because the infection was partially treated
by the mefloquine, but "virtually everyone had classical symptoms" of the
disease, Blazes said.
About 30 patients who arrived at Bethesda on Sunday were put in a separate
unit because physicians feared some might have some other disease; malaria
rarely shows up in sudden, severe outbreaks. The possibilities included
Lassa fever, which is caused by a virus; leptospirosis, caused by a
bacterium; or infections arising from bacteria-like microbes called rickettsia.
"It was hard to believe that you could have almost all of a group that
large develop symptoms over a 4-5-day period and have it be malaria,"
Martin said.
Blood samples were sent to the Army's infectious diseases laboratory at
Fort Detrick in Frederick, and within 12 hours those infections were ruled out.
Nearly all the Marines said they had taken their once-a-week mefloquine
pills; a few said they had missed a dose or 2. Many had been taking it
since June 2003.
Normally, a case of malaria is considered severe if more than 3 percent of
red blood cells are infected with the parasite. Several of the Marines,
including one who reported never missing a dose of mefloquine, had more
than 10 percent of their cells infected.
Peter B. Bloland, a malaria epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said there are only a few possible explanations for
the outbreak.
"The possibilities include inadequate absorption [of the drug into the
bloodstream], people not taking it correctly, poor drug quality or actual
resistance" to the drug in the microbes, he said. The experience of Peace
Corps volunteers in West Africa, who live in areas of intense malaria
transmission for long periods of time, suggests that mefloquine-resistant
infections are rare there, he added.
"Based on what we know about failures of prophylaxis in Africa, I think the
most common explanation is inadequate blood levels [of the preventive drug]
for some reason," he said.
About 120 samples of blood taken from the Marines shortly before they
became ill will be sent to CDC to measure mefloquine levels.

More Marines Get Malaria Symptoms After Liberia Mission; Doctors Investigating
----------------------
Navy doctors are investigating what they say is an unusually high rate of
malaria among Marines who were in Liberia last month on a peacekeeping mission.
3 more patients turned up with symptoms and are being treated aboard the
USS Iwo Jima off the West African coast, bringing the number ill Wednesday
to 46, said Master Sgt. John V. Tomassi of the U.S. European Command.
That represents some 20 percent of 225 Marines and Navy personnel who went
ashore last month, a surprising number since the anti-malarial drug they
were given is normally highly effective in preventing the mosquito-born
illness. The number of confirmed cases among the 46 now stands at 18, up
from 13 Tuesday, Tomassi said.
Doctors are closely watching the rest of some 225 who went ashore, an
unknown number of whom also are reported to have complained of body aches,
one of the symptoms, said Capt. Greg Martin of the National Naval Medical
Center in Bethesda, Md.
"There are a lot of questions about this," he told a press conference
Tuesday in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, where most of the patients
were taken.
Doctors are looking into 3 possibilities for the outbreak, he said: The
strain of malaria troops got has become resistant to the drug they were
taking; troops didn't take it correctly; the drug had gone bad, or there
was a flaw in its manufacture. All going ashore are being switched to
another antimalarial in case resistance is the problem, doctors said.
The 3 new patients remaining aboard ship are a Marine, an Army soldier, and
a civilian.
Previously, 43 Marines and sailors with more serious cases had been
evacuated from their ships for hospitalization. They all had gone ashore in
Liberia from the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima and the amphibious
landing dock USS Carter Hall, officials said.
5 of those evacuated have serious cases, including 2 patients with cerebral
malaria. But all are expected to recover, said Lt. Cmdr. David Blazes, a
doctor who specializes in infectious disease and is caring for those
brought to Bethesda.
Martin said the Marines and sailors started taking the antimalarial drug
mefloquine in late June or early July 2003 in a regimen that requires
troops to begin dosing 2 weeks in advance of a deployment, then take the
drug weekly thereafter until they have been out of the risk area for a month.
The military also gives troops a repellent cream containing DEET and
mosquito netting.
Col. Jay DeFrank, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Marines, members
of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., were in
Liberia in mid-August as part of a U.S. quick-reaction force of about 150
troops. They operated from an airport outside Monrovia, the capital, for
about 10 days. Others went back and forth from the ships to land, sometimes
for as little as a couple of hours at a time.
Doctors said they are asking the patients whether they took their drugs
faithfully, whether they slept inside or out at night, and other pertinent
questions.
Of the 43 evacuated to hospitals, 41 were taken to Bethesda and 2 to the
Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany in the flights that began over
the weekend.
Officials said that as a precaution, movements of Marines ashore in Liberia
from the Iwo Jima, Carter Hall, and another ship off the Liberian coast
were being limited for the time being. About 136 American troops still are
ashore in Liberia, mostly Marines providing security at the U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia. The Iwo Jima and 2 other ships off the coast carry about 2200
Marines and about 2500 sailors.
Malaria is transmitted by mosquitos, which breed in stagnant water.
The disease infects 300 million people a year and kills at least 1 million
in Africa and elsewhere and has become increasingly resistant to drugs,
according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations
Children's Fund, UNICEF. Some 3000 African children die every day from it,
the United Nations said in a report early in 2003.
About 800 American civilians come home with malaria each year from trips
abroad, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The malaria parasite has developed resistance to the old standby drug,
chloroquine, in most of the world, rendering that drug largely useless and
leaving only mefloquine and 2 others.
Large areas of Central and South America, the Dominican Republic and Haiti,
the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania also
are considered malaria-risk areas, according to the CDC.

[As mentioned in the earlier posting on this observed outbreak of malaria
in USA troops in Liberia, it is clear that there has been a failure of
chemoprophylaxis. The question that remains is whether the failure
resulted from individuals non-compliant with recommended chemoprophylaxis
or actual failure of the chemoprophylaxis drug itself, either through
development of drug resistance on the part of the parasite, poor absorption
of the drug leading to sub-therapeutic (protective) levels or reduced
quality of drug resulting in a lower effective dose administered. The
newswire reports above seem to suggest that in fact the majority of the
observed cases gave a history of following the recommended chemoprophylaxis
with mefloquine.
Mefloquine resistance has been reported in Southeast Asian countries and in
sub-Saharan African countries. Jelinik, Grobusch and Loscher (see ref. 3)
found in vitro resistance of _Plasmodium falciparum_ in 9.6 percent of
isolates from German travellers returning from sub-Saharan African
countries. Lobel et al. (ref.4) documented 5 out of 15 prophylaxis failures
with mefloquine levels greater than or equal to 620 ng/ml in blood drawn
within 5 days of onset of illness. (Note that the Lobel paper was
published in 1998 -- 5 years ago.)
One wonders whether the recent disruption of health infrastructure in
Liberia may have led to an artificial masking of mefloquine resistance
development in the country -- one that is now coming to light in the face
of a sizable group of malaria-sensitive individuals being exposed in a
short period of time, in a situation analogous to a common source outbreak.
We await further information from authoritative sources on the results of
the investigation into the etiology of this apparent outbreak of
mefloquine-resistant _Plasmodium falciparum_.
