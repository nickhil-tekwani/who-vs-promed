3 inhabitants of the Samuhskiy district of Azerbaijan have fallen ill
with anthrax. Emergency measures for the prevention of the spread of
this dangerous illness have been carried out.
The beef market in Gandzha has been closed for 2 weeks. Sanitary
control over the sale of meat in the city has been expanded, which
shut down the illegal sale of meat. There have been no cases of
anthrax among the inhabitants of Gandzha due to timely measures
taken. The trade of meat and dairy products in the region has
decreased. Local residents refuse to buy them, being afraid of
catching anthrax.

[This report indicates that the affected area in Azerbaijan may be
much larger than is being reported. The 1st report (Anthrax, bovine -
Azerbaijan: susp 20050905.2626) had cattle affected in the "villages
of Uzunoba, Nazarabad, and Didivar of the Babeksky district in the
Nakhychevanskaya Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan." Now we have
Samudhskiy district involved, with human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
