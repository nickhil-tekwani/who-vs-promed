A spokesman for Egypt's Health Ministry says a 2-year-old child is
Egypt's 53rd case of bird flu since the H5N1 virus appeared in the
North African country in 2006. The child, from the northern province
of Menoufiya, was admitted to the hospital Friday [23 Jan 2009] with
elevated temperature and sore throat and was immediately treated with
the anti-flu drug Tamiflu, says spokesman Dr. Abdel Rahman Shahine.
The boy is in stable condition, he told the state news agency Sunday
[25 Jan 2009].

Like most of Egypt's victims of the disease, the child was in regular
contact with domestic fowl.

Egypt has had the highest number of human cases after Indonesia and
Viet Nam. On 16 Dec 2008, a teenager was the 23rd death in the
country from bird flu since March 2006.
