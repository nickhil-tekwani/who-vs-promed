Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), also known as 'blue ear disease,' is on an upward trend [in pigs]; as a result, more and more people are contracting a bacterium called _Streptococcus suis_ from pigs in North Viet Nam.

The Central Tropical Disease Hospital has admitted more than 20 people infected with the above bacterium, said Dr Nguyen Hong Ha, head of the hospital on 19 June [2012]. According to Saigon-Gpdaily, patients were rushed to the hospital in critical condition and they were suffering from serious complications such as meningitis and septicemia.

Most patients contracted the _S. suis_ bacterium after eating undercooked infected pork, blood paste, or came into direct contact with secretion from diseased pigs via open wounds or airborne tracts. Dr Ha warned people not to slaughter and eat diseased pigs.

Meantime, Dr Le Xuan Hung, deputy president of the Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology, said the Institute receives tens of people every month who have contracted the bacterium; and at time the numbers of such patients could account for about 80 percent of patients at the Institute. Many of them are hospitalized in a state of near limb paralysis or with convulsion fits. Most patients come from poor households living in unhygienic and squalid conditions, said Hung, and with very little or no awareness of how the disease is transmitted.

The blue ear disease [in pigs] has been detected in the northern provinces of Lang Son, Dien Bien, Bac Ninh, Quang Ninh, Lai Chau and Hoa Binh.

[Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis that has been reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also toxic shock if the strain produces the appropriate toxins, and less commonly bacteremia, pneumonia, septic arthritis and endocarditis.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

_S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis). In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in adult pigs.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
