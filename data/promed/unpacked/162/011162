Subject: FMD O1 virus infection detected in Paraguay

While a newspaper from Mato Grosso do Sul of Brazil
(<http://www.campograndenews.com/agropecuaria/>) and SAG of Chile
(<http://www.sag.gob.cl>) are confirming Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
strain O1 virus infection in 2 animals from San Francisco farm, Canindey
FA Department, Paraguay, according to a report issued by Panaftosa OPS/OMS
30 Oct 2002, the digital version of abc newspaper of Paraguay
reported that "there is not FMD in Paraguay" based on a
preliminary report also issued by Panaftosa and related with the results of
the 90 blood tests.
This is related to an investigation of suspected FMD in Paraguay in a farm
located close to the border with Brazil, which had brought a great deal of
attention from neighboring countries and provoked a multinational
inspection by Panaftosa experts the countries themselves in order to
address the situation.
According to the news reports, it seems Panaftosa investigation would have
produced 2 kinds of results. The I-Elisa 3 abc/eitb test conducted on 90
blood samples would have shown "a profile not compatible with recent viral
activity," but Probang tests have isolated O1 FMD virus from 2 animals
(). That would be compatible with the presence of carrier
animals on that farm. According to Internationational Zoosanitary Code of
OIE (), these results would confirm an FMD virus infection in
the San Francisco herd.

Clinical Signs Suggestive of a Vesicular Disease in Cattle in Paraguay
Laboratory results transmitted by the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease
Center
See also: 18 Oct 2002
Translation of information received on 29 Oct 2002 from Dr Eduardo Correa
Melo, Director of the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, Pan
American Health Organization:
End of previous report period: 12 Oct 2002 (see Disease Information, 15
[42], 206, dated 18 Oct 2002).
End of this report period: 29 Oct 2002.
Based on the activities of the multinational group set up at the
extraordinary meeting of the Cuenca del Plata Executive Committee of 9 Oct
2002, on the samples collected in establishments directly or indirectly
involved in the suspected foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak on the San
Francisco ranch in Corpus Christi, Canindeyu Department, Paraguay, and on
anamnesis accompanying the said samples, it is confirmed that the
reactivity profile of the 102 collected sera, obtained using the I-ELISA
3ABC / EITB(1) system, is not compatible with a hypothesis of recent FMD
viral activity in the analyzed population.
Supplementary viral isolation tests are in progress on samples of
esophageal-pharyngeal fluid, as well as ELISA for detecting antibodies to
structural FMD virus proteins and for differential diagnosis.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. EITB: electroimmunotransfer blot.
