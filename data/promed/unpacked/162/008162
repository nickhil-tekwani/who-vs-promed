A deadly viral infection suspected to be equine flu has claimed 4
horses and left many tottering. In fact, 12 are battling for their lives.

The debilitating virus affects thoroughbreds most severely. But, it
can be picked up by indigenous species of donkeys too. So, Gujarat's
wild ass is also under threat [picture at

The horse riding camp scheduled for Sunday [5 Apr 2009] has been
cancelled. A worried mounted police has raised the alarm, and
officials of the state animal husbandry department are camping in the
city, unsure as yet about potency of drugs that should be
administered to contain the disease.

Samrat, 22, a favorite with many IPS officers and amateur riders,
died on 1 Apr 2009, having contracted the infection 10 days earlier.
The other casualties are 12, 15, and 18 years old. Horses 1st started
showing serious symptoms on 31 Mar 2009.

Last November [2008], the Centre had sounded an alert when equine flu
affected close to 5400 horses across the country. This was not taken
seriously enough in Gujarat, though some preventive measures were put in place.

Interstate movement of horses has been banned for 3 months. Infected
animals have to be quarantined, as they can spread the virus in a 7-8
km radius. The virus is airborne and can also be transmitted through
vectors like lice, fleas, contaminated reins, saddles and dung.

Diseased animals show heavy nasal discharge, fever and weakness. In
thoroughbreds, the hind legs get so weak that the animal can collapse.

"We have collected blood samples of horses and will change the
prescription once we know nature of the virus," veterinarian Govind
Patel told TOI.

Police inspector JB Gohil added that the force is very concerned, as
it takes a long time for horses to recover. "A team of vets has been
camping here all night for the last few days," he said.
