China on SARS alert after virus spreads from lab
------------------------------------------------
A Chinese woman suspected to have SARS has died and 2 other people are
confirmed to have contracted the virus in a chain of infection spread from
a national research laboratory, the government said on Friday. It was the
first reported death from SARS since a deadly outbreak last year claimed
hundreds of lives worldwide. China, the country worst hit by severe acute
respiratory syndrome, set up emergency controls as it confirmed 2 other
people were confirmed to have contracted the disease.
Hong Kong, which was also badly hit last year, raised its alert level. The
local government said in a statement it had sent extra staff to the airport
and the city's railway station that receives through-trains from China to
spot ill people.
China's health ministry said a woman died, apparently of SARS, on 19 Apr
2004 after taking care of her daughter, a 26 year old medical student who
studied for 2 weeks in a disease control laboratory in Beijing before
returning home ill to the eastern province of Anhui. The daughter is one of
the 2 patients confirmed to have contracted by the disease. The other
confirmed patient, a 20 year old nurse at a Beijing hospital, had treated
the medical student, it said in a statement on its website.
The ministry quoted experts as saying the source of infection might have
been the lab, adding it had been sealed. "The investigation shows...the
patient in Beijing has epidemiological links with the confirmed SARS case
patient in Anhui," it added. A 31 year old male post-doctoral student [in
Beijing] who worked alongside [the 26 year old patient from Anhui] in the
lab was also suspected of having the disease. The cases in Beijing were the
first recorded in China's capital since it was ravaged by the outbreak last
year.
China's State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine issued a circular ordering the quarantine of anyone found with a
fever at its borders. China had learned from last year's epidemic and would
keep the public alerted, vice minister of health Zhu Qinsheng said, after
attending a meeting of health ministers from South East Asia, Japan, South
Korea, and China in the northern Malaysian state of Penang. "We learned
from the experience of last year's SARS outbreak and this time we will do
our best and immediately alert the public. We are confident that the
situation will be under control," he was quoted as saying. "We are
prepared. We are confident that SARS will not spread like it did in the
past," he told reporters.
[The patient from Beijing], a nurse from Beijing's Jiangong Hospital, was
in an isolation ward in Beijing's Ditan Hospital, the health ministry said.
Authorities have placed 188 people who had close contact with [her] under
medical observation, 5 of who have shown symptoms of SARS and been isolated
at Ditan, it said. The Beijing government said the hospital was well
prepared to deal with the case and 3 wards had been cleared and disinfected
for other possible SARS patients.
[The patient from Anhui] was in stable condition at a university hospital
in the Anhui provincial capital of Hefei and another 117 people in Anhui
were under medical observation, it said. Three of them had been isolated
with fever symptoms, the official Xinhua news agency said. SARS is a type
of atypical pneumonia that first emerged in the southern Chinese province
of Guangdong late in 2002, spread to Hong Kong, Beijing and on to more than
30 countries, infecting about 8000 people and killing nearly 800. China
confirmed 4 more cases of SARS in Guangdong early this year, the first
since the global outbreak was declared over in July. All 4 have since
recovered.

Cases of [atypical pneumonia] in Anhui and Beijing; experts [suspect]
source may be lab infection
--------------------------------------------------
A medical department news spokesperson confirmed that the medical expert
group has identified] a [case of atypical pneumonia infection] in Anhui
Province and that [Beijing province also has a case of atypical pneumonia].
[The patient in] Anhui, is a 26 year old [woman], Anhui medical college
master graduate student. During the period 7--22 March she was studying in
the Chinese Viral disease control laboratory and on 23 Mar 2004 she took
the train to return to Hefei, Anhui. On 25 Mar 2004 she developed fever and
took the train back from Anhui to Beijing. On 29 Mar 2004 she underwent a
medical examination, was found to have pneumonia and was admitted to
hospital at the [?Beijing Healthy Palace] hospital. On 2 Apr 2004 she took
the train to return to Anhui Huai Nan for treatment. On 4 Apr 2004 she was
transferred to the Anhui Medical College for continued treatment of viral
pneumonia. Beginning 31 Mar 2004, her mother continuously cared for and
accompanied her and provided nursing care.
On 8 Apr 2004 [her mother] developed a fever and was admitted to hospital
in the Anjui Medical College Hospital with viral pneumonia. On 19 Apr, her
mother worsened and died. Upon receipt of notification of this death by the
local medical department, the early warning mechanism was activated. On 21
Apr 2004, the Anhui Province Disease Control center had IgG positive blood
tests [for SARS Co-V], this was reexamined by the Jiangsu Province Disease
Control Center which also had IgM and IgG seropositivity.
On the evening of 21 Apr 2004, the Anhui Province Health Department
reported the findings to the Medical Department. On the morning of 22 Apr
2004, the Medical Department expert group rushed to Anhui. On 23 Apr 2004
the China Center for Disease Control senate compared the laboratory tests
(IgG and IgM findings). The medical department expert group reviewed the 2
patients clinical courses/presentations, the laboratory examinations and
the epidemiologic investigation and [confirmed] the diagnosis of atypical
pneumonia in the index case from Anhui [the graduate student] and referred
autopsy specimens for confirmation on the index case's mother.
Anhui Province has conducted strict disinfection of the areas of the 2
patients and has identified 117 close contacts of these 2 patients. At
present, the index case is stable, and one of her close contacts has
developed fever.
Further investigation revealed that in Beijing on 22 Apr 2004 there was a
report of a case of atypical pneumonia that is epidemiologically linked to
the index case in Anhui. The case in Beijing, a nurse, cared for the index
case from Anhui during the period 29 Mar to ? Apr when the patient was in
the Healthy Palace Hospital in Beijing. Given the epidemiologic linking of
the 2 patients, Beijing has classified the case in Beijing as a case of
atypical pneumonia [SARS] infection. Currently the case in Beijing is
afebrile. Of 188 close contacts of this case in Beijing, 5 have fever. 3 of
these 5 are close relatives of the Beijing case and 2 are from the hospital
contacts at the Earth Temple Hospital (one a patient and one a visitor
caring for a patient).
On 23 Apr 2004, Beijing reported another case of atypical pneumonia (SARS).
This patient is a 31 year old man, doing postdoctoral work at the China
Center for Disease Control Viral Disease laboratory. On 17 Apr [???], on 22
Apr 2004 he was admitted to the Earth Temple Hospital. On review of his
clinical and epidemiologic history, Beijing immediately classified him as a
case of atypical pneumonia [SARS].
In view of the fact that the index patient in Anhui and the patient from
Beijing both worked in the China Center for Disease Control viral
laboratory the epidemiological investigation is pointing towards the
laboratory as the source of infection and further investigations among the
laboratory staff are in process. The Medical Department has sealed the
China Center for Disease Control Viral laboratory and is investigating the
personnel, obtaining laboratory specimens from sampling within the
laboratory. Safety control measures are being investigated and implemented.
The medical department has requested the fever monitoring be conducted
under supervision [of laboratory staff?]. The medical department has
reported to the World Health Organization and to Hong Kong. The Red Cross
Society of China has reported this to the Taiwan Red Cross.

[From the descriptions provided in the 2 statements above, it appears as
though the original infection may have been a laboratory accident, although
more detailed information on the index case contacts/exposures prior to
onset of illness are not provided. What is not clear is whether the
laboratory contamination was from a specimen from another as yet
unidentified patient with SARS coronavirus (Co-V) infection, or from
research being conducted on the SARS Co-V. While confirmation of SARS Co-V
infection from an independent international reference laboratory is still
pending, the epidemiology described above with probable secondary cases
[including a health care worker caring for the index case and a second
laboratory researcher in the same laboratory as the index case] and a death
[in a close family member contact caring for the index case] is reminiscent
of the SARS outbreak in 2003. Appropriate isolation measures appear to be
under way now. Remembering the 2003 outbreak, a cause for concern here is
that the case currently in hospital in Anhui traveled between Beijing and
Anhui twice while apparently clinically ill. Her mode of transportation was
on a public train, and may have been associated with exposure to a wider
net of individuals during transportation. Information on the identification
of all potential contacts while in route isn't clear at this point. In
addition, we do not know whether respiratory precautions were in place for
the early part of her hospital admission. The occurrence of a case in a
hospital nurse who cared for her suggests that respiratory precautions were
not in place for the initial period of her hospitalization in Beijing. We
await further news on the epidemiology investigations and observations of
known contacts of these cases. - Mod.MPP]
