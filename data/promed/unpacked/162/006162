Health authorities will this morning [4 Jun 2014] announce an outbreak of parechovirus infection Queensland infants, with the 1st 11 cases of the virus (to be) reported in the state's history.

Parechovirus commonly causes mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms in babies, such as fever, irritability, a rash and diarrhoea. However, in some young infants, the virus can lead to more serious complications such as hepatitis or encephalitis and can be fatal.

Brisbane parents recently had to have their 5-week-old daughter resuscitated in intensive care when she started having breathing difficulties and seizures as a result of the virus (infection). Queensland Children's Medical Research Institute paediatric infectious diseases director Professor Theo Sloots said the virus "affects the brains of young children, and in severe cases can result in death." Some infected babies recover within a few days. In very young babies, the virus can cause infection in the central nervous system and lead to a sepsis-like illness, which can lead to long-term damage to brain cells. "We don't know what the long term affects are; the virus is newly recognised, and we don't know enough about it," Prof Sloots said. All 11 cases are believed to have been found in babies 6 months and under, with the 1st discovered in an infant in Bundaberg in December [2013].

The virus -- for which there is currently no vaccine -- is spread from person to person through contacts with respiratory droplets, saliva or faeces. Young babies appear to be at a higher risk. Good hygiene is the best protection against the virus, with parents encouraged to wash their hands regularly and ensure their mouth and nose are covered when coughing or sneezing. Nationally, 46 babies have been confirmed positive with parechovirus infections.

"The outbreak is Australia-wide now, and we believe there are at least 4 types of the virus, and we don't know what type is in Queensland compared to other states," Professor Sloots said.

[Human parechoviruses are members of the family of _Picornaviridae_. Although originally described as echoviruses 22 and 23 within the human enteroviruses group because of their clinical and morphological properties, they have since been shown to be distinct from this and other picornavirus groups in several features of their genome organisation, structure and replication. Human parechoviruses show genetic and antigenic heterogeneity, and a number of distinct HPeV types are known to circulate widely in human populations throughout the world.

Anyone can get infected with parechovirus. Young babies appear to be at risk of more severe disease. Parechovirus infection usually causes mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms; however, occasionally it may lead to more severe symptoms. Some infected babies get quite unwell quickly but typically recover in a few days.

In young babies, the virus can cause infection of the central nervous system and can lead to a neonatal sepsis-like illness. Children under 3 months of age are most likely to develop severe disease, but most recover after a few days with supportive treatment. Most people who get infected with parechovirus do not get sick. Some infected babies get unwell very quickly with fever. In addition to a high fever, there are a range of other signs including a red rash, irritability, diarrhoea, hepatitis or encephalitis.

Parechovirus is usually spread from person to person through contact with respiratory droplets, saliva or faeces from an infected person. Anyone can get infected with parechovirus. Young babies appear to be at risk of more severe disease. There is no vaccine to protect you from parechovirus infection. Good hygiene is the best protection. There is no specific treatment for parechovirus; treatment is supportive only. Parechovirus is not a notifiable condition. - Mod.CP
