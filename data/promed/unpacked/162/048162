Veerman fears new outbreaks
---------------------------
Minister Veerman of Agriculture is seriously considering the
appearance of new Fowl Plague [Vogelpest - - the Dutch term for
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, HPAI] outbreaks. Blood tests in
chickens should clarify the possible risks of the appearance of the
animal disease in the entire country. "I am afraid that the end of
the crisis is not yet in sight", he told the parliament Thursday.
The minister fears that, in addition to the HPAI virus present in the
Gelders Valley, a second less infectious variant is circulating. A
less pathogenic virus might develop into a dangerous one, causing the
disease to turn up in other places.
While this scenario is not yet supported by hard facts, the Minister
based his suspicions upon the Italian experience. The virus has
struck there time and again since the late 90's, leading to the
accumulated destruction of almost 20 million chickens.
In the Gelders Valley, the virus has been identified in 8 farms. 17
additional farms are "suspected". Veerman has already decided to
eliminate the poultry on about 60 farms, including the infected and
suspected ones. All the chickens (about half a million) will be
destroyed by the end of this week. Destruction capacity is sufficient
to reach this goal.
Veerman rejected the demand of VVD and LPF (political parties) to
destroy additional poultry farms. He regards the proposed measures as
sufficient. He also defended his decision to carry out the
stamping-out activities "from inside out" (first the infected farms,
then the surrounding ones).
Following a request from the parliament, Veerman will ask the
European Commission to review its AI vaccination policy. At present,
the Commission allows vaccination only as an extreme measure.
Scientists in the ministry have indicated that vaccination will
result in technical as well as financial difficulties, both
interfering with tests and compromising export of eggs.
The Cabinet Council will discuss extra financial support for the
affected poultry owners. In addition to compensation for the killed
animals, covered by both the cabinet and "Brussels", the parliament
wants compensation for losses due to discontinued exports. Minister
of Social Affairs De Geus is investigating whether the affected
farmers may be eligible for aid payments.
