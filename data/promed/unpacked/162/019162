One of the 3 teaching hospitals in town [Rawalpindi, Punjab province], Holy Family Hospital [HFH], registered as many as 4 suspects of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) within the last 10 days [approx. 10-20 Sep 2014] of which one female has been confirmed positive for the disease.

The registration of 4 suspects and confirmation of a patient has strengthened doubts that the population in the region may face a possible spike of CCHF ahead of Eidul Azha when sacrificial animals are being brought to town in bulk.

The patient tested positive for the CCHF at the HFH is a female in her 20s who is presently undergoing treatment at the hospital in isolation. The News has learnt that all the 4 patients including suspected and confirmed are residents of Tehsil Talagang in District Chakwal and have history of animal handling.

Studies reveal that the CCHF is caused by Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family transmitted to humans by the bite of _Hyalomma_ tick found on the skin of animals including goat and sheep or by direct contact with the blood of an infected animal or human. The case fatality rate ranges from 2-50 per cent. The CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo.

The disease was 1st reported in Pakistan in 1976, but the number of cases shows a dramatic rise since 2000, with 50-60 patients being reported annually. Nearly 50 cases of the disease have so far been reported from different parts of the country this year [2014], however, none of the concerned authorities has taken any precautionary measures to avoid a possible spike of CCHF.

The female patient, presently admitted at the HFH, is completely stable and out of danger, said Focal Person for Infectious Diseases at Rawalpindi Medical College and allied hospitals, Dr. Javed Hayat, while talking to The News on Friday [19 Sep 2014]. He added the patient has almost recovered and the hospital would discharge her within a day or 2.

To a query, he said the HFH registered a total of 12 suspects of CCHF this year [2014] of which 4 were tested positive. He suggested proper preventive measures should be taken while handling animals to avoid the disease.

It is better to establish water ponds carrying DEET or potassium permanganate and animals should be passed through it to clear their skin, said Dr. Hayat while responding to a query.

It is important that the CCHF is endemic in Pakistan and has claimed at least 10 lives within the last 5 months of which 3 patients were from the Punjab province while 3 are from Islamabad.
