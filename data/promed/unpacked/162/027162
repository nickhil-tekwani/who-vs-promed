Wound botulism in an injecting drug user in England
--------------------------------------------------
A 34 year old Caucasian woman with a long history of injecting heroin was
admitted recently to a London hospital with generalised - mainly proximal
- muscular paralysis, profound pharyngeal and ocular paralysis, ventilatory
failure, but no sensory loss. She responded to treatment with specific
botulism antitoxin, pending the results of assay for botulinum toxin and
microbiological culture. Other causes of neuromuscular paralysis were
excluded by electromyography studies and examination of cerebrospinal
fluid, and there was no evidence of a peripheral neuropathy. The serum
creatine kinase, a marker of primary muscle breakdown, remained normal,
making it unlikely that an acute myopathy was the cause of the weakness.
This is the first report of this rare and novel cause of wound botulism in
the United Kingdom. The patient has injected heroin subcutaneously or into
muscle for many years. On admission she was noted to have two small
needle-related lesions in the right buttock. In November 1999 she was
admitted with deep injection- related abscesses in the buttocks, which
healed well.
Wound botulism has been reported recently in Norway and Switzerland,
occurring in drug users who inject heroin subcutaneously or into muscle
(1,2). It was first described in the United States some years ago and has
been associated with the injection of 'black tar' heroin preparations (3).
Wound botulism is well known in the context of large and deep traumatic
injuries due to _Clostridium botulinum_ colonisation or infection. In the
case of needle-related wounds in drug addicts, the lesions may be small and
seemingly insignificant. Specific toxicological or microbiological
confirmation of the causative agent has been lacking in most of the cases
reported thus far (1,2).
