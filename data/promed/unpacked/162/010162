China: Guangzhou No. 8 Hospital rumored to have several dozen suspected
bird flu or SARS patients
-----------------------------------------------
On Fri 20 Jan 2007 news spread on the internet that a number of people had
been placed in isolation at Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital, possibly for
avian influenza or SARS. According to this report, several dozen personnel
were isolated, and many military hospitals in Guangzhou had mobilized to
prepare to receive serious infectious disease patients. But Hong Kong's
Department of Health said on the evening of 20 Jan 2007 that it had not yet
received any notices regarding infectious disease in China.
A man answering the main [telephone?] line of Guangzhou No. 8 People's
Hospital (formerly Guangzhou Infectious Diseases Hospital) said that the
hospital had in fact discovered suspected SARS patient[s]. But the hospital
clinic said it could not provide information about this. And the inpatient
department of the hospital's duty room stated they had not heard of the
hospital having SARS patients. A nurse in the inpatient department said
they had not been not been advised to increase precautions. According to
relevant procedures, if the hospital discovers a SARS patient, the hospital
must take emergency precautions house-wide.
Guangzhou No. 8 Hospital is a municipal clinical, teaching, research, and
preventive health hospital specializing in prevention and treatment of
infectious diseases and comprehensive liver disease treatment. It is home
to the Guangzhou Municipal Liver Cirrhosis and Hepatoma Prevention and
Treatment Center as well as the Guangzhou Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases. It is a teaching hospital for medical schools in Guangdong Province.

China (Guangzhou): reports of 10-plus cases of unknown infectious disease
denied
-----------------------------------------------
Recent reports from outside press state that there have appeared 10-plus
patients infected with an undiagnosed infectious disease. An official from
Guangzhou's Department of Health has clarified that Guangzhou has not
discovered an unknown infectious disease and that the reports from outside
are untrue.
Outside press has also reported that all the patients are undergoing
treatment at Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital. In response to this, the
spokesperson and vice director of Guangzhou's Department of Health, Yuanda
Xiong, stated on Sun 21 Jan 2007 that these were unfounded rumors. No
undiagnosed infectious disease has appeared in Guangzhou.
The director of Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital also stated that, since
the beginning of January 2007, the hospital has not admitted any patients
with epidemic or undiagnosed illness whatsoever. Guangzhou has no
extraordinary circumstances whatsoever. At the moment, the majority of
patients in the hospital are being treated for liver illness, some with
AIDS and recognized illnesses. Aside from these, there are a few patients
with malaria. Talk of so-called "undiagnosed infectious disease" is
complete nonsense.
