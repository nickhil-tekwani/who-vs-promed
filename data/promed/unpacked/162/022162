[A farmer] likened the scenes in his shed to those of a horror film, with cows quickly being paralysed, as the disease, which attacks the nervous system, took hold.

[This farmer] from Clitheroe, Lancashire, 1st saw signs of the disease on a routine lunchtime check of the herd, predominantly Holstein-Friesians, and found one cow dead in the passageway.

He said: "Another cow was floppy and weak. I rang the vet who came to do a post-mortem, and in that time another 2 had fallen.

"In just a few minutes, the floppy cow had died. It continued like that, and by Monday [4 Dec 2017], 38 were dead. I do not think anything can prepare you for it; it was absolutely horrific. Our cows are like pets to us, and to see them in such a state is heartbreaking."

Some cows were injected with an anti-inflammatory and penicillin, but [the farmer] said it seemed to accelerate the disease.

He added: "We tried to care for the cows by feeding them charcoal and even burnt toast to try to attempt to absorb the toxin, but with no success."

Other cows which showed advanced signs were euthanised, with only one cow in the affected high-yielding herd, a Montbeliarde cross, remaining unscathed.

Dry cows and the low yielders, which were housed about 15ft [about 5 meters] away at the other side of the shed were not affected.

Tests on feed have all come back negative, but [the farm owner] said it was likely silage fed to cows had been contaminated with dead game or poultry birds, which are prolific carriers of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which causes botulism.

In total, [the farmer] who farms in partnership with his father, lost 47 high yielding milkers and 3 bulling heifers out of the 80-strong herd. He is now working with his vet to source a vaccine for his remaining cattle.

[The farmer] said: "Speaking to a lot of our friends and colleagues, this is extremely rare, but it could happen to anyone, and awareness is vital. My advice would be to vaccinate. I will be vaccinating all my cattle from now on."

[Following a marked increase in the reported incidence of suspected cattle botulism in England, Wales and Ireland since 2003, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in UK's Food Safety Agency, set in 2004 an ad-hoc Group on Botulism in Cattle. The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.

One of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: "Reporting of botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease. However, clinically affected animals are likely to be investigated, and, based on the low apparent risk to humans presented by toxin types C and D, which predominate in recent UK cattle outbreaks, statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited."

They further said that if litter has been spread on silage ground, it is advisable to raise the cutting blades so that the grass is cut less close to the ground. This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land. Annexes 4 and 5 of the report present guidance to farmers on methods for the control of botulism in cattle. Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it "should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses."

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):

"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces, or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (such as heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.

"_Clostridium botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds, or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution [_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail in the original document].

"Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.

"Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog."

The preliminary suspicion of botulism in cattle may be based upon the very typical symptomatology. However, laboratory confirmation is required to exclude other possible etiologies, such as ionophores [polyether compounds] intoxication.

Botulism in animals is not notifiable in the UK, nor in most countries. Hence, the actual number of events is not available. The UK 2006 report, mentioned above, addressed (in table 1) 67 incidents, identified in cattle in England and Wales during the years 2003-2005. The authors advised farmers to report any suspicion immediately to their practitioners. Botulism is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. - Mod.AS
