Dieback disease hits coffee crops
---------------------------------
Dieback disease has hit the lush green coffee plantations in
Chikmagalur district [Karnataka] due to which the plants have now
lost the leaves and the branches have started to dry, break, and
fall, destroying large quantity of coffee crops. The experts and the
growers say that the untimely rainfall that lashed over the district
in February [2008] has caused this situation.

Dieback disease spreads in the air and hence it spreads very fast.
Further, once infected by the dieback disease all the crops will have
to be rooted out and new plants have to be planted.

Coffee grower Kavish said when such a dangerous disease has started
haunting the plantations, the Coffee Research Board has not yet felt
the need to inform and spread awareness among the coffee growers
about the disease. He says that pesticides and insecticides available
in the market at present are of low quality.

Coffee grower Bhojegowda said that though the Coffee Board had given
information about the untimely blooming of coffee flowers, they had
said that it would not hold any adverse impact on arabica crops. The
growers who paid heed to the board are now suffering as all arabica
seeds have been destroyed.

The cases of untimely drying of the plants are rampant in the region
but yet no scientist or expert has paid attention towards the same.
Further, the lemon and orange plants, which are usually planted along
with the coffee too have died.

[A disease called coffee dieback (also called leaf blight, stem
dieback) affecting _Coffea arabica_ has been reported to be caused by
the fungus _Ascochyta tarda_. However, this pathogen has so far only
been recorded in Africa and South America.

On the other hand, coffee leaf rust (CLR) caused by the fungus
_Hemileia vastatrix_ has long been a problem for arabica coffee
production in India. CLR associated defoliation and the strong
carbohydrate sink of the berries cause shoots and roots to starve and
consequently to die off. Since production of coffee occurs on year
old wood, the tip and shoot dieback caused by the rust can seriously
reduce the following season's crop. CLR is a devastating disease and
has destroyed arabica coffee plantings in many countries (for more
information on CLR see previous ProMED posts and links below). It
appears likely that CLR may be the problem referred to above.

Neither of the fungi mentioned is known to affect citrus, therefore
the deterioration of these crops in the same area is likely to be due
to another factor.
