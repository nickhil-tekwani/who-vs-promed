An additional person has been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in downtown Flushing, raising the number to 15, the city Department of Health said [Thu 2 Nov 2017].

The downtown Flushing cluster investigation was announced [Tue 24 Oct 2017], when 12 people had been diagnosed, and in the last week 3 additional confirmed cases have been disclosed, including the 15th victim. As of [Thu 2 Nov 2017], the DOH said only one person remained hospitalized.

On [Mon 30 Oct 2017] DOH held a community meeting at Flushing Town hall with
Councilman Peter Koo (D-Flushing) to answer questions and concerns about the cluster. Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett asked anyone who exhibits symptoms, which include fever, cough, chills, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion and diarrhea, to get tested.

DOH said the newly diagnosed person was not hospitalized and began having symptoms before a cluster was declared, but was only diagnosed on [Wed 25 Oct 2017].

"For this reason, we remain confident that the risk to Flushing residents continues to diminish," DOH said. "If by next week we do not see any additional cases with illness onset later than [Tue 17 Oct 2017] in downtown Flushing, we will declare the case investigation over. However, remediation of cooling towers identified during the investigation will continue as necessary."

According to the department, it has sampled every cooling tower in a 1.2-kilometer [0.74 mi] radius of the area where the DOH believes the cluster began. The agency has tested 55 cooling towers and DOH said preliminary testing indicated the existence of the type of _Legionella_ bacteria that can make some people sick in some of the cooling towers in the area. Bassett has ordered 11 buildings to immediately increase the use of chemical disinfectant to kill the bacteria or to change the biocide previously used.

According to DOH, final test results will be ready in 2 weeks and will determine the next steps in terms of full disinfection and cleaning of any cooling towers showing this specific type of _Legionella_ bacteria.

[Outbreaks of legionnaires' disease have occurred in the past several months in apartment complexes along Queens Boulevard in the adjacent Rego Park and Forest Hills neighborhoods of Queens (see ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis - USA (16): (NYC) fatal, apartment complex, RFI 20170924.5336870 and Legionellosis - USA (14): (NY) apartment complex 20170831.5287267).

The current outbreak described in the news report above is occurring in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens, which is located northeast of Rego Park and Forest Hills. A map of Queens showing the location of Flushing in relation to Rego Park and Forest Hills can be found at https://goo.gl/9X2hyu.

We are told in the news report above that preliminary testing indicated the existence of the type of _Legionella_ bacteria that can make some people sick in some of the cooling towers in the area, but we are not told what species this is or what _Legionella_ species is causing Legionnaires' disease in the 15 Flushing cases, or what the 13 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease have in common other than living in Flushing, for example, do they live in the same apartment complex, do they work in the same location, or have they visited the same locations, or have anything in common with the cases occurring in Rego Park or Forest Hills neighborhoods. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

Genotyping the clinical isolates, if available, from the 15 cases of legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. - Mod.ML
