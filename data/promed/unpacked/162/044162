[The above is preliminary information, final data to be derived from
the due update to the OIE.

For a summary of the 1st 10 Japanese FMDV-O outbreaks reported from
Japan since the start of the epizootic on 7 Apr 2010, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9155>.

The reports mention 2 different start dates of the epizootic:
According to the immediate notification of 20 Apr 2010, the epizootic
had started on 7 Apr 2010; according to the follow-up report No 1 of
23 Apr 2010, the epizootic had started on 31 Mar 2010. Clarification
will be helpful.

The results of this virus's sequencing, particularly its comparison
to the recent Chinese and S. Korean FMDV serotype O isolates, are
anticipated with interest and are requested. - Mod.AS]
