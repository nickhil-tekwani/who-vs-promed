A massive carp die-off that began in Lake Mohave in May 2009 is moving
downstream, and Lake Havasu has now seen its carp population devastated by
a virus specific only to these fish, according to the Arizona Game and Fish
Department (AGFD). The virus does not affect other fish, wildlife or
people, and the die-off is not related to water quality issues on the
Colorado River.

"I'd say 80 to 90 per cent of the carp, for sure, have died," said John
Galbraith of Angler's Pro Shop in Lake Havasu City. "I've never seen
anything quite like it. Tens of thousands have croaked. It's kind of
tapering off now. There's still a lot of fish dying, but we're past the
worst part of it, and it's not affecting anything else."

Testing proved the carp deaths in Mohave were caused by the Koi herpesvirus
(KHV), and testing of Havasu fish next week will confirm if the same
disease has spread downstream, as suspected. 1st identified in 1998, koi
herpes has spread virtually around the world. In aquaculture, the virus can
kill 100 percent of the fish in a pond or rearing facility, and mortality
rates of 80 to 90 per cent are common. Those that survive are believed to
never show signs of the virus again, but likely remain carriers the rest of
their lives.

Koi herpes is spread when healthy carp come in direct contact with infected
fish or fluids from infected fish. Water that has come in contact with
infected carp can carry the virus, which can then enter other fish through
the gills and possibly the stomach and intestines. This means the virus is
likely spreading throughout the lower Colorado River system below Lake Mohave.

Once established, the virus acts quickly in carp, with an incubation period
of just 14 days from infection to mortality if water temperatures are
between 72 and 78 F [22 to 25.5 C]. Below those temperatures, almost no
mortality occurs, and above 86 F [30 C], there have been virtually no
occurrences of die-offs. The disease attacks the fishes' gills, and the
lesions become so pervasive, they eventually cause suffocation.

While it is unknown how the virus was introduced into Mohave, there are 2
likely scenarios. One is that infected fish-pond koi or carp were released
into the lake. 2nd, goldfish, often sold as bait for catfish or striped
bass, are frequently released in the lake. While goldfish are a carp
variant, they are carriers of the virus but apparently unaffected by it.

Now that the virus is in the water system, it is highly likely it will
spread throughout the lower Colorado River and aqueduct system that brings
Colorado River water to Southern California, with Diamond Valley Reservoir
and Lake Skinner likely to be affected, probably during summer months, when
surface water temperatures rise into the range where the virus can cause death.

The 1st reports of die-offs below Havasu came from the Parker Strip stretch
of the Colorado River this week, according to Diane Williams of the Lake
Havasu Field office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), but there had
been no reports yet of carp die-offs in the Blythe and Palo Verde region.

"They're just starting to see carp die-off in the Parker strip -- under 10
fish -- but it's a sign," said Williams, referring to reports from the
BLM's 2 campgrounds and day-use facilities near that portion of the river.

The AGFD staff was certain the koi herpes virus was not a threat to public
health, and biologists said it does not affect other fish or wildlife.
Recent rumors of other fish species dying off in both Lake Mohave and Lake
Havasu are unfounded, according to game and fish staff. The massive carp
die-off is also not associated with water quality issues, which would have
impacted all species of fish in the 2 lakes.

The Bureau of Land Management and Arizona Game and Fish biologists have
monitored the shoreline at Lake Havasu and have observed the same traits in
dying and dead carp as those traits associated with the die-off at Lake
Mohave: white spots along the sides of the gills and a lack of blood in the
gills.

The clean-up effort has been massive at both Mohave and Havasu, with city,
county, state, federal, Indian reservation and private business people all
pitching in to try to keep recreational shorelines cleared of dead fish.

Carp have increasingly become a popular gamefish in southern California,
with a growing legion of anglers who pursue them (for example, there have
been more than 450 entrants in a Bakersfield carp derby this month [June
2009]), but many anglers and water agencies consider them "trash" fish and
have spent great amounts of money reducing carp numbers in their waters.
Carp can also be hard on other gamefish, eating the eggs and young fry
during and after the spawn.

Galbraith is looking forward to increased production of largemouth and
smallmouth bass, crappie, redear, bluegill, and catfish.

[Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or CyHV-3, is
a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing significant morbidity
and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_). In many countries, the
common carp is a foodfish, and also has been selectively bred for the
ornamental fish industry, where it is known as koi. Almost all countries
have reported KHV, which was 1st recognized in 1996 in England. However,
publications (Pokorova et al.) in 2005 report that Australia does not have
the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass mortality
within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass mortality, the other
common sign are white patches or necrosis of the gills. Other clinical
signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and secondary bacterial infection or
parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured fish,
inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that some fish may
be carriers.
