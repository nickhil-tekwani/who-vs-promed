Napier grass disease outbreak
-----------------------------
A disease outbreak that has ravaged acres of napier grass across [Kenya] is putting the livestock sector in uncertainty. The Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute KARI has confirmed the outbreak, warning it could raise the cost of livestock feeds. A majority of farmers in the country use napier grass to feed their livestock and the outbreak of the napier smut and stunt diseases has raised fear in the sector.

Kari's Foustine Wandera said the stunt disease has affected western parts of country and is fast spreading. He said plants affected have stunted during growth and are yellowish in colour. He warned that neighboring areas could also be affected.

"The other disease is the smut outbreak [see ProMED-mail post 20090406.1325], which has affected the highlands and this is more lethal as it reduces crop productivity by more than 90 percent," he said.

[Napier or elephant grass (_Pennisetum purpureum_) is an important fodder crop in East Africa that is often used in a cut-and-carry system. It is also used for soil stabilisation, fences, or windbreaks. Both napier stunt disease (NSD) and napier head smut have been emerging in the region since the 1990s and are posing a threat to local livestock industries.

Napier stunt
------------
Napier grass stunt disease (NSD) is caused by a phytoplasma of the 16SrXI group (Rice yellow dwarf taxonomic group, type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma oryzae). Symptoms may include yellowing and reduced size of leaves, proliferation of tillers, shortening of internodes, and stunting of plants. Losses of biomass of more than 70 percent in affected plants have been reported. The leafhopper _Recilia banda_ has been identified as a vector of the disease in Kenya and is suspected to be the main vector in the region. Its host range includes many members of the _Gramineae_ and therefore the possibility of the NSD phytoplasma spreading to other important forage grass or crop species must be considered. NSD is also spread with infected plant material and cuttings. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include phytosanitation, vector control, removal of pathogen reservoirs, and use of certified clean propagation material. Resistance breeding programmes for NSD are in progress in the region. Another member of the group, Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma, is causing a destructive disease of that crop in Africa and parts of Asia.

Napier head smut
----------------
Head smut caused by the fungus _Ustilago kamerunensis_ has a devastating impact on this crop causing serious reduction in biomass or complete yield loss. Symptoms may include stunting of plants, premature flowering, and the replacement of seeds by a black mass of spores. The existence of disease hot spots suggests that the main means of spread is through transport of infected planting material. Disease management may include fungicides (mostly too expensive for smallholders), use of clean planting material, phytosanitation, and planting of alternative fodder grasses not susceptible to the fungus (for example _Panicum_ or _Setaria_ species). While some resistant crop lines are available, the varieties most preferred by the farmers are generally more susceptible. Further development of resistant cultivars from local germplasm is important for large scale control of the disease.
