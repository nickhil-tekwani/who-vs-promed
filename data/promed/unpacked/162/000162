Russia reported more than 200 000 new COVID-19 infections on Friday [11 Feb 2022] for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The country has been gripped by a surge in cases since the start of the year [2022], fueled by the highly transmissible omicron variant. The country reported 203 949 new infections in the past 24 hours, Russia's nationwide coronavirus task force said on Friday [22 Feb 2022]. It also said 722 COVID-19 patients had died -- the highest number in 4 weeks.

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said the latest wave is in decline in the Russian capital, which has been the epicenter of the country's coronavirus outbreak and was the first place to see a rise -- and fall -- in case numbers during previous waves.

The number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 has also risen fast over the past month. Some 19 281 people were hospitalized on Friday [11 Feb 2022], the task force said -- around double the level of daily admissions being recorded in mid-January [2022].

Russia has been one of the world's hardest-hit countries by the coronavirus, as the government has largely shunned strict lockdowns and the vaccination campaign has stuttered, with 48% of the country fully vaccinated. The country has seen almost 1 million excess deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to The Moscow Times' analysis, and Russia's population recorded its largest-ever peacetime decline in 2021 -- largely as a result of COVID-19 deaths.

Russia has confirmed 13 527 845 cases of coronavirus and 338 091 deaths, according to the national coronavirus information center. Russia's total excess fatality count since the start of the coronavirus pandemic is at least 995 000. Under half the population is fully vaccinated. ...

Russians will be able to take an antibody test to obtain a coronavirus health pass from [22 Feb 2022], the Health Ministry said on Tuesday [8 Feb 2022]. QR codes will be issued to Russians who test positive for COVID-19 antibodies, regardless of their vaccination status.

Almost 12 000 children with COVID-19 are currently being treated in hospitals, while children make up about 20% of the country's total number of coronavirus cases, Russian health minister Mikhail Murashko announced on Tuesday [8 Feb 2022]. Russia's Labor Ministry has recommended that all enterprises send as many of their employees to remote work [from home? - Mod.SH] as possible due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.

[2] Antivirals
Date: Fri 11 Feb 2021

COVID drugs molnupiravir, Paxlovid await patients
-----------------------------------------
Supplies of the eagerly awaited oral COVID-19 antiviral prescription medications are slowly arriving at US pharmacies, but despite strong evidence that they can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness, federal data and experts suggest that many patients don't know about them or don't want to take them. Two oral COVID-19 antiviral medications, molnupiravir (Merck) and Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, Pfizer), have been proven to be safe, effective, and convenient treatments to take at home.

However, patients have to surmount several hurdles to get them -- including recognizing that they have symptoms of COVID-19, getting a COVID-19 test, having a positive test, securing a doctor's appointment, getting a prescription, and finding a pharmacy with a supply -- and they have to do all of this quickly. Antivirals need to be started within the first 5 days of COVID-19 symptom onset in order to produce a benefit.

"High-risk patients in the first few days after diagnosis don't realize how much sicker they're going to get, so they miss the opportunity to get better faster -- and by the time they actually do, it's too late," said Bryan Jarabek chief medical informatics officer and hospitalist at M Health Fairview in Minneapolis. ...

The antivirals are authorized for the treatment of mild or moderately ill patients at high risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Molnupiravir is indicated for patients 18 years and older owing to concerns about impeding bone and cartilage growth in children, while Paxlovid can be given to those age 12 and up.

Patients also may be reluctant to take a new, experimental drug, experts say. And Proctor said that because the drugs are prescribed under an EUA, their manufacturers are likely limited in what they can say and do. "Manufacturers play a big role in educating about their products," Proctor said. "When [a drug is] fully approved, they can be much more aggressive in educating and communicating."

[3] Genomic surveillance for variants
Date: Fri 11 Feb 2022

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106a4.htm?s_cid=mm7106a4_w


ref: Lambrou AS, Shirk P, Steele MK, et al. Genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants: predominance of the delta (B.1.617.2) and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants -- United States, June 2021-January 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2022;71:206-211. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7106a4

During June 2021-January 2022, CDC expanded genomic surveillance data sources to incorporate sequence data from public repositories to produce weighted estimates of variant proportions at the jurisdiction level and refined analytic methods to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of national and regional variant proportion estimates. These changes also allowed for more comprehensive variant proportion estimation at the jurisdictional level (that is, US state, district, territory, and freely associated state). The data in this report are a summary of findings of recent proportions of circulating variants that are updated weekly on CDC's COVID Data Tracker website to enable timely public health action. The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2 and AY sublineages) variant rose from 1% to > 50% of viral lineages circulating nationally during 8 weeks, from [1 May-26 June 2021]. Delta-associated infections remained predominant until being rapidly overtaken by infections associated with the omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA sublineages) variant in December 2021, when omicron increased from 1% to > 50% of circulating viral lineages during a 2-week period. As of the week ending [22 Jan 2022], omicron was estimated to account for 99.2% (95% CI = 99.0%-99.5%) of SARS-CoV-2 infections nationwide, and delta for 0.7% (95% CI = 0.5%-1.0%). The dynamic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2021, including delta- and omicron-driven resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the United States, underscores the importance of robust genomic surveillance efforts to inform public health planning and practice. ...

Discussion
... CDC's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program has expanded data sources and refined analytic methods to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of national and regional variant proportion estimates. These changes have enhanced the robustness and representativeness of variant proportion estimates. Nowcast modeling at multiple geographic levels has enabled more timely estimation and demonstrated an ability to monitor emerging variants, even those circulating at low levels. SARS-CoV-2 variants are expected to continue emerging; a future variant might challenge the predominance of omicron and exhibit different characteristics that affect public health and clinical interventions. Consequently, it is important to maintain SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance to ensure emerging variants are monitored and to promptly inform public health planning and practice.

[4] Vaccines for young children: pullback

COVID-19 vaccine for kids under 5 delayed as Pfizer extends trial
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In a sudden turnabout, Pfizer and BioNTech today [11 Feb 2022] announced they were delaying the application process for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for their vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years, and gathering more information on 2 to 3 doses of the vaccine.

The announcement came just days before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was set to consider the application, and a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had told pediatric vaccine providers to ready themselves for a [21 Feb 2022] delivery date of the mRNA vaccine.

"As part of its rolling submission, the company recently notified the agency of additional findings from its ongoing clinical trial," the FDA said in a statement. "Based on the agency's preliminary assessment, and to allow more time to evaluate additional data, we believe additional information regarding the ongoing evaluation of a 3rd dose should be considered as part of our decision-making for potential authorization."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20FEB11_1644697682.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB11WORLD7_1644697718.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 42 countries -- Germany (229 989), Russia (203 949), the USA (175 947), Brazil (166 003), France (131 376), Japan (98 173), Turkey (95 065), UK (58 316), Netherlands (80 610), Italy (67 478), South Korea (54 918), India (50 407), Spain (49 004), Denmark (45 202), Ukraine (41 694), Indonesia (40 489), Ukraine (41 229), Chile (41 651), Poland (35 071), Austria (32 712), Mexico (31 336), Iran (31 247), Australia (16 269), Israel (27 047), Vietnam (26 487), Portugal (24 271), Norway (23 071), Romania (22 737), Czech Republic (22 735), Switzerland (22 127), Malaysia (20 939), Slovakia (20 051), Georgia (19 968), Jordan (18 872), Greece (17 645), Argentina (16 503), Thailand (16 330), Belgium (15 242), Peru (13 564), Latvia (11 797), Hungary (11 559), and Canada (10 277) -- all reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 11 610 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 9 Feb 2022 to late 10 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 91 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 49 of the 91 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 17.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.92%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 20.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 2.35 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours, with cumulative totals of over 408.92 million cases and over 5.82 million deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
