More than 90 reports of sick raccoons in Niagara county [New York] have been made so far this year [2018] and authorities are warning residents since dogs and cats that have not been vaccinated could be infected. The primary area of the outbreak of distemper -- a highly contagious viral disease -- is in Lewiston and Porter, though confirmed sightings have happened across the county, the Niagara County Sheriff's Office said [on Thu 15 Mar 2018].

Pet owners should make sure their pets have been vaccinated. The disease cannot be passed to humans, according to authorities.

Raccoons can become infected with 2 types of distemper:
- Canine distemper in raccoons starts slowly, beginning with runny nose and watery eyes. "In its final stages, the raccoon may begin to wander aimlessly in a circle, disoriented and unaware of its surroundings. The animal may exhibit other bizarre behavior as a result of brain damage," the Sheriff's Office said.
- Feline distemper in raccoons starts suddenly with a high fever, then vomiting and diarrhea. "The course of the disease is quick, usually a week, with nearly 100 per cent mortality," according to the Sheriff's Office. Insects may play a role in the spread of the disease.

There have been no reported cases in Niagara Falls, authorities said.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen that most frequently causes outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid. Unlike in the east coast, in California terrestrial rabies is more frequent in skunks than in raccoons. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date.

"Feline distemper" in raccoons might refer to infections caused by viruses related to the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV-like viruses), a parvovirus, not a morbillivirus, and not as common in raccoons as is canine distemper. - Mod.PMB
