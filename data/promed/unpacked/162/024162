A person with measles at Blacktown Hospital was likely infectious while on 2 commercial flights. The unidentified person, who is now in an isolation ward, presented to the hospital's emergency department at 10pm on [Sun 10 Dec 2017]. They remained in the public area until 3.30am on [Mon 11 Dec 2017].

Western Sydney Local Health District said it was "highly likely" the patient was infectious while travelling on 2 commercial flights from Delhi to Bangkok and then Bangkok to Sydney from [9 Dec to 10 Dec 2017] (see below).

Western Sydney Public Health Unit director Shopna Bag said contact was being made with people who may have been directly exposed to the virus. She encouraged people to look out for symptoms including fever, sore eyes and a cough, followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash.

"Look out for symptoms over the next 7 to 18 days. If you have these symptoms you should visit your doctor as soon as possible," Dr Bag said. "Please call your doctor before visiting the surgery so that arrangements can be made to minimise the risk of spreading the infection to others. "Stay home from work or school to avoid exposing other people, such as infants, to the infection."

Dr Bag said measles is highly contagious and can be spread by coughing or sneezing.

The free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best protection against the disease; 2 doses are required for lifelong protection and it is safe to have it again if people are unsure. "Older infants, children and adults born after 1965, who have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine or evidence of previous infection with measles, are particularly susceptible to measles and we encourage them to get vaccinated," Dr Bag said.

Measles is common in some countries. People planning to travel overseas are advised to discuss with their GP whether they need the MMR vaccine, or other vaccines, prior to travelling.

[Australia was one of the 1st countries in the Western Pacific to be declared measles-free, underlining the effectiveness of the nation's comprehensive vaccination program. This report highlights the importance of being vaccinated with MMR vaccine even in a country declared free of measles because of the risk of travel-related infection.

Officials at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden are reporting a "limited" measles outbreak during the Christmas weekend, according to a hospital news release.

As of [27 Dec 2017], 8 measles cases have been reported since the 1st case reported on [10 Dec 2017]. Most of the cases found are linked to each other.

The hospital is working intensively to track patients who may have been exposed to infection. There are many who have been exposed, but few are expected to be infected.

As a result of the contagious outbreak in progress, people who are not vaccinated can get infected. They are being offered the opportunity to quickly get vaccination. Vaccination must take place within 3 days of exposure to infection, "says Anne Haglund Olmarker, Deputy Hospital Director at Sahlgrenska University Hospital.

If you suspect you may have measles, hospital officials say don't go to the emergency room. If you need to seek care, it is important to contact the staff before entering a reception, for the assessment of medical staff. People with suspected measles should not be in the waiting room in care!

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected. These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough; sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light; a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40 deg. C (approx. 104 deg. F); small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks. A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.

Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

A 20-year-old man from Belgrade has died in a hospital's intensive care unit from complications caused by measles, RTS is reporting. He is the first victim of measles in Serbia. The patient had not been inoculated against the infectious disease.

Since October [2017], a total of 630 persons in central Serbia and in Serb-majority areas in Kosovo and Metohija contracted the disease, the Public Health Institute Batut announced on [Tue 26 Dec 2017].

A total of 91 percent of those have either not been vaccinated against the disease, or have incomplete or uncertain vaccination status.

Since the measles epidemic was reported in late October [2017], there had been 259 cases in Serb and non-Albanian municipalities in Kosovo.

In early November [2017], an epidemic of the disease was also reported in central Serbia.

[Measles can be a serious illness in all age groups. However, children younger than 5 years of age and adults older than 20 years of age are more likely to suffer from measles complications. Some people may suffer from pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). They may need to be hospitalized and can die.
According to the CDC:
As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.
About 1 child out of every 1000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.
For every 1000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it.

Measles may cause pregnant woman to give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby.

On [21 Dec 2017], 2 patients [aged 25- (patient-1) and 26- (patient-2), years old], residents of Thamel, Kathmandu, presented to the outpatient department of Sukraraj Topical and Infectious Disease Hospital with a 6-day history of severe headache, fever, and sore throat. They both developed maculopapular rashes 3 days after the initial symptoms starting on the head then neck followed by trunk and upper extremities. They (these patients) were neighbors.

According to the patient-1, his nephew (13-year old) was first infected with measles, who brought this infection from his school. Several other students were also infected with measles, resulting in absence of more students from school over the last couple of days. In another words, there was a measles outbreak in that school. A total of 3 other members from the same family (patient-1) have also been infected with measles.

It is becoming more apparent that measles in adults is increasingly seen over the past few years in Nepal. However the reason for this increased incidence rates is not yet known.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun for submitting this report.

Although this report on the changing epidemiology of measles is from Nepal, it also has been noted that in Africa, the epidemiology of measles also is changing to affect older children and young adults as well as young children, i.e., less than 5 years old [See JL Goodson et al. Changing Epidemiology of Measles in Africa J Infec Dis 2011:204 (Suppl 1) S205].

During 2002-2009, the median age of confirmed measles was 36 months. In countries with greater than or equal to 50 percent aMCV1 (average of routine measles vaccination coverage) compared with low-coverage countries, age shifted to older children and young adults. The shift to older children and adults has implications for disease burden estimates and may disproportionately lower the measles mortality burden relative to the morbidity burden, because previously described case fatality ratios are lower in older cases.
