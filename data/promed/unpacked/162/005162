There is concern in Antofagasta region because of an increase in the number of cases of viral hepatitis A. According to 'El Mercurio' (one of the main Chilean newspapers), there are 74 affected persons, who may have acquired the disease because of purchasing and consuming food from street vendors.

In recent times, there has been a significant increase in arepas (sort of cornmeal rolls), pizzas and grilled beef, amongst other products, being freely sold in the streets. In this respect, Ms Lila Vergara, a local Health Officer, declared that "our hypothesis is that (the cause of the viral hepatitis A outbreak) is food consumption from unauthorized places, such as purchasing this stuff from street vendors".

[Antofagasta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antofagasta) is a port city in northern Chile, about 1100 kilometers (700 mi) north of Santiago. It is the capital of Antofagasta Province and Antofagasta Region. Formerly part of Bolivia, Antofagasta was captured by Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879-83), and the transfer of sovereignty was finalized in the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the 2 countries. - Mod.LL
