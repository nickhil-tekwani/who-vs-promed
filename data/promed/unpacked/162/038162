An expert committee has concluded that 6 people died from exposure to this
community's water, Ontario's chief coroner James Young revealed yesterday.
A total of 21 deaths were examined for possible involvement. Of those, 4
were found to have been caused by the town's _E. coli_ outbreak and 2 were
due to other
causes, with _E. coli_ a contributing factor. The cause of a 7th death
could not be
determined due to insufficient evidence, the coroner's office said.
