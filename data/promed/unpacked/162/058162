The 79th General Session of the OIE (22-27 May 2011)
--------------------------------------
The OIE national Delegates used the OIE Rinderpest Pathway to
complete the recognition of the last handful of OIE member and
non-member countries' free status, based on a strict control of their
epidemiological situation.

Resolution 18/2011, officially recognizing that all 198 countries of
the world with rinderpest-susceptible animal populations are free of
the disease, was unanimously adopted.

Official recognition of Members disease status
-----------------------------------
The delegates also approved the new list of countries and zones that
had applied for official OIE recognition of their status with respect
to the other priority diseases: bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), foot and mouth disease, and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP).

With regard to BSE, the OIE newly recognised Denmark and Panama as
having a "negligible risk" status; both countries were until now
recognised as having a "controlled BSE risk status."

Japan, Botswana, the Philippines, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and
Paraguay were recognised as being "free of foot and mouth disease,
with or without vaccination, for all or a part of their territory."

Finally, China (People's Republic of) was recognized as free of
CBPP.

Continuously developing, reviewing and updating international
standards on animal health, food safety and animal welfare
----------------------------------
Within the framework of its annual standard-setting work, the
Assembly adopted and/or updated different chapters of the OIE
Terrestrial and Aquatic Animal Health Code, among which:
- The recognition pathway for official FMD control programmes
implemented by Members [see comment];
- Inclusion of some relevant wildlife species in the disease
chapters of the Code;
- The 1st Code chapter on communication.

A global review of the world animal health situation
----------------------------------
The worldwide animal health situation concerning 118 diseases of
terrestrial or aquatic animals was examined in detail with OIE Members
during the session.

Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian influenza, rabies, oyster
diseases, and African swine fever have topped discussions.

Technical items
---------------
Two technical items on key issues of interest for the international
community in the field of animal health and welfare were debated
during the session:

1. The contribution of veterinary activities to global food security
for food derived from terrestrial animals. The study showed that
veterinarians play a pivotal role in all stages of the food chain,
namely production, processing, transport, and distribution of products
of animal origin, therefore representing major contributors to world
food security and safety.

2. Implementation of a global strategy for FMD control. Discussions
led to OIE national delegates endorsing a global strategy for FMD
control that would soon be officially launched [see comment].

Resolutions have been discussed and adopted in order to address the
concerns to be solved.

The OIE is all about science and capacity building
----------------------------------
The delegates welcomed the North-South or South-South twinning of 38
laboratories within the framework of the OIE's Twinning Programme. The
Programme encourages the exchange of competencies and experience
between existing OIE Reference Laboratories and Collaborating Centres
and candidate laboratories in in-transition or developing countries
with the ultimate objective to build a veterinary scientific community
in developing and in-transition countries, the benefit being better
diagnostics of animal diseases and better participation by Members in
the standard-setting procedures.

Furthermore, in line with OIE's continuous engagement to support
Veterinary Services to comply with OIE standards on quality, 102 PVS
(Performance of Veterinary Services) independent evaluations made by
OIE-accredited experts have been implemented worldwide to date, as
well as 37 PVS Gap analysis missions and 20 missions supporting the
modernisation of legislation.

The delegates also accredited 3 new Collaborating Centres and 11 new
Reference Laboratories, bringing the number of official centres of
scientific excellence within the OIE worldwide network to 263.

[The creation of a pathway for official FMD control programmes
implemented by Members is a commendable initiative and a complex one.
This is underlined by the high infectivity of the virus, its ability
to spread directly and indirectly, including transmission on fomites
(e.g. vehicles, footwear as well as mechanically by animals and other
living vectors), its potential for airborne transmission (under
favorable climatic conditions), etc. The multiplicity of serotypes
which do not cross-protect is another problem, as well as the
survivability of the virus in the environment under certain conditions
and the involvement of several animal species, including wildlife.

A crucial issue in such a project will be the diagnostic capabilities
of the countries involved and the rate of their transparency and their
disease reporting (immediate, periodic) records.

The OIE has commendably demonstrated its strength in enhancing
international cooperation in animal health issues and in recruiting
support for the advancement of national veterinary services; it will
be exciting to follow and support the advancement of this ambitious,
vital undertaking. - Mod.AS]
