During the 24-hour period ending at 4 p.m. on Sunday [21 Apr 2013], China confirmed 6 new cases of human H7N9 avian influenza, including 5 in Zhejiang and one in Jiangsu.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 102 H7N9 cases have been reported in China, including 20 that have ended in death.

Of the total, 12 H7N9 patients have been discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment, and the other 70 patients are being treated in designated hospitals, according to the commission.

A total of 33 cases, including 11 that have ended in death, have been reported in Shanghai. 24 cases, including 3 deaths, have been reported in Jiangsu Province, and 38 cases, including 5 deaths, in Zhejiang Province. Anhui Province has reported 3 cases, with one ending in death. Beijing has reported one case, and 3 have been reported in Henan Province.

China officially confirmed the human cases infected with the H7N9 virus late last month [March 2013].

According to the commission, China's confirmed H7N9 cases are isolated, and there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission.

Two people have died of H7N9 bird flu in east China's Zhejiang Province, bringing the total number of deaths from the disease to 20 nationwide, health authorities said on Sunday [21 Apr 2013].

A 76-year-old farmer died on Sunday [21 Apr 2013] morning after he came down with flu symptoms on 8 Apr 2013, and 62-year-old woman, a native of Huzhou City, died despite medical efforts on Saturday [20 Apr 2013] evening, after she was diagnosed with H7N9 avian influenza on 14 Apr 2013, said a statement of the provincial health department.

The department also reported 5 more cases of H7N9 bird flu infections, including the 76-year-old farmer above. The other 4 patients, including a 68-year-old female, a 58-year-old male, a 79-year-old female, and a 81-year-old male, were in critical condition, it said.

In addition, a 68-year-old retired man from Jiangsu Province was also confirmed to have caught H7N9 bird flu, bringing the total number of infected cases to 102 in the country, said a statement issued by the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Committee. He was receiving treatment in Shanghai, said the statement. He showed symptoms of high fever, cough and expectoration on 13 Apr 2013 in the city of Liyang in Jiangsu and was diagnosed with H7N9 avian influenza in Shanghai on Saturday [20 Apr 2013], it said.

The committee said 3 people on Sunday [21 Apr 2013] were discharged from hospital after they had recovered from the flu. So far, a total of 12 patients have recovered from the disease.

More people will be discharged from hospital, said Zhang Jianliang, deputy chief of the Shanghai Municipal Public Health Clinic Center, adding doctors will further track health conditions of the people discharged.

[3] Social impact

On a subway car in Shanghai, a commotion breaks out when someone spots a live chicken poking its head out of a bag tucked under one of the seats. On a highway in Zhejiang province, a motorist is so panicked by bird droppings landing on her windshield that she stops the car and calls the traffic police for help. Internet photos of dead sparrows on a Nanjing sidewalk are ordered removed by police, fearing they might go viral.

The fowl phobia gripping China is the result of a new strain of avian flu that has led to 18 [now 20] deaths and 95 [now 102] diagnosed illnesses over the last month. Health authorities are concerned because of the unpredictable nature of the virus, known as H7N9. Unlike in previous incarnations of avian flu, infected birds here are showing no signs of being sick, making it harder to stem the disease at its source.

So far, there is no evidence that the strain of flu can be easily transmitted from human to human; such transmission is an earmark of a potential pandemic. But the number of people having direct contact with birds is limited, so researchers are not quite sure how this year's [2013] patients have been getting sick. Although the earliest cases involved farmers and poultry dealers, in more than half of the more recent infections, the people had no direct contact with birds, Michael O'Leary, head of the World Health Organization's China office, said at a briefing Friday [19 Apr 2013].

Pigeon fanciers around China have canceled events. Notices have gone up in diplomatic residences around Beijing instructing people not to take children to the zoo. Tables at Beijing's most popular Peking duck restaurant are now available without a reservation. "People are scared. Nobody is buying chickens or ducks," said Li Guoli, a young man standing at a Beijing fresh market counter where the chicken legs weren't selling. At the next stall, business was so slow that the vendor was sound asleep.

15 experts from the United Nations' top health agency have launched an investigation of the outbreak, concerned that it could become far more deadly. "What we don't know is the size of the iceberg under this tip," O'Leary said. The Chinese government appears to be struggling to contain the problem, without taking steps that would result in outright panic. "It is a really challenging road to walk. You don't want to be hyperbolic and scare people, but you want to prepare for the worst-case scenario," said Myles Druckman, a vice president with International SOS, which advises companies on health issues.

As with other outbreaks in China, fear itself can prove economically devastating. The 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, caused USD 40-80 billion in financial losses. China is already seeing an effect on travel, restaurant visits and food production. Sales at KFC's nearly 5000 restaurants in China dropped about 16 percent in March 2013, according to parent company Yum Brands. Health experts advise that there is no danger in eating cooked poultry. Also trying to reassure a worried public, an official in Hunan province hosted a banquet Wednesday [17 Apr 2013] for about 150 workers at which he served only poultry: chile fried chicken, chicken wings, chicken intestines and duck eggs.

One problem is that many Chinese do not believe their government's reassurances, especially given the well-documented cover up of the SARS epidemic a decade ago. Another is that previous outbreaks of bird flu -- the H5N1 strain -- in China resulted in 30 deaths, according to the latest World Health Organization statistics. The unease has been compounded by the sight of more than 10 000 dead pigs washing up last month [March 2013] on the banks of Shanghai's main river. There have also been unexplained deaths of many ducks in Sichuan province and a few black swans in Anhui province, as well as the sparrows in Nanjing. Authorities have not tied any of the animal deaths to the [H7N9] bird flu, but they have not given clear explanations either.

Beijing authorities have now banned the sale of live birds in markets across the capital. In Shanghai and elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of chickens and other poultry have been killed as a precaution in an attempt to prevent the spread of the illness. One farmer was shown using plastic bags to suffocate thousands of ducklings. "If you have one sick bird on a farm, the farmer has to kill all of them," said Zhao Kai, sales manager of Beijing-based CECO Environmental Protection Technology, which makes an incinerator that can cremate 30 000 chickens a day. Cremation is the preferred method for disposing of the remains. "We are selling many machines these days," Zhao said. "Our business is one that is doing well."
