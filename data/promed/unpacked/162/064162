SORGHUM ERGOT (05)
===================
Date: Wed, April 30, 1997
From: O. Hotz de Baar <Oz@upthorpe.demon.co.uk>

Since Sorghum, and Sorghum ergot, do not grow in the UK I do not
have any direct knowledge of this particular disease. However I
assume that it is similar to wheat ergot that also infects wild
grasses (eg Blackgrass) and cereals in the UK.
In the posting on sorghum ergot (04), the Sorghum Improvement
Conference of North America recommends:
* Sow seed produced in ergot-free areas (to reduce the risk of
infection by eliminating primary inoculum)
Since the disease is not primarily seedborne (although ergots can
be found in seed samples) I would have thought that a gravity
separator would have been able to separate ergots from Sorghum
grain in a seed treatment plant. Indeed given the less than
perfect success rates in detecting low levels of almost anything
(a few ergots per ton for example) by seed sampling and testing
this is probably a good method of improving the sanitary quality
of seed if this disease is as aggressive as the post suggests.
* Protect seed production plots with a triazole fungicide sprayed
3-4 times at 5-7 day intervals, starting before stigma emergence
I am intrigued by the statement 'a triazole fungicide'.
Triazoles are a disparate group with very different qualities and
effectiveness against specific diseases. Some rapidly migrate to
the growing points (eg flutriafol); others are rather static (eg
prochloraz); and some are very long lasting and very wide
spectrum (eg epoxiconazole). As a result, and for this
particular disease, I would expect some to be almost ineffective
whilst others very active at particular timings. What work, if
any, has been done on timing and efficacy of the various choices
of active ingredient? At full rates this multiple dose level
seems very high indeed and certainly would be considered
excessive, with high risk of significant residues, were it to be
suggested in a UK situation.
I have seen ergots in blackgrass infesting a wheat field several
times in the UK but the wheat was unaffected. Is the ergot of
wheat the same as that of blackgrass?
