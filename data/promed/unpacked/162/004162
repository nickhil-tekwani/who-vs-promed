According to Dr Mohamed Abdel-Hamid, director general of veterinary medicine in Damietta, 3 new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been discovered in [the governorate] Damietta [Dumyat]. Necessary actions, including cattle vaccination, have been taken, They were coordinated with other agencies to establish a joint campaign including control measures to prevent the spread of infection through butcher shops and to prosecute offenders of the sanitary and quarantine regulations.

[According to this year's (2014) 2nd quarterly report on FMD issued by the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright Institute), April-June 2014, a batch of 31 samples was received from Egypt. Three FMDV serotypes were identified. FMD type O viruses were isolated from 11 samples and genotyped as EA-3 topotype. FMD type A viruses were isolated from 2 samples and genotyped as ASIA/Iran-05BAR-08. FMD type SAT 2 were isolated from 3 samples and genotyped as topotype VII. The said information as well as the relevant dendograms are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20Apr-Jun%202014.pdf.

Traditionally, the route of FMD introduction into Egypt is mainly from the south (East Africa, through Sudan; see fig. 7, page 11 of 24 in an OIE 2011 paper at http://web.oie.int/boutique/extrait/05dinardo6385.pdf). However, west-Asian strains have been identified in Egypt as well.

In view of the recent circulation of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 strain in north Africa (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria) as well as in Saudi Arabia, it will be interesting to note whether this invasive strain is currently present in Egypt; such presence is of significance regionally. Relevant information will be welcomed (new samples submitted from Egypt to WRLFMD deserve to be encouraged).

Efforts to vaccinate Egyptian livestock against FMD are described in another media report dated 3 Sep 2014, titled "Loudspeakers of mosques declare war on Foot and Mouth Disease in Qena" (see the Arabic text and picture at http://tinyurl.com/qej89cz). It relates to Nag Hammadi, north of Qena.

For the locations of the governorates Damietta (Dumyat) in Nile Delta, west of Port Said, and Qena, in Upper Egypt, north to Luxor, see map at http://www.map-of-egypt.org/map-of-egypt.gif.

The FMD situation in Egypt is in need of an update. - Mod.AS
