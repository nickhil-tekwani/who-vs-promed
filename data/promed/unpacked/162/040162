Roland Foods has recalled 6 batches each of its red lumpfish caviar and black lumpfish caviar because they might be contaminated with botulism. "Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled," Roland Foods' website recall notice says. "The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing found that the product experienced a processing issue."

Botulism can kill. As Roland Foods warns, it can also cause weakness, dizziness, double-vision, constipation, problems with speaking, swallowing or breathing.

The caviar pulled were the Black Caviar Whole Grain Lumpfish, packaged as one case of 48-2-ounce packages, batch Nos. J018803, J019622 and J020834; 2 cases of 48 2-ounce packages, batch No. 206; 2 cases of 24 3.5-ounce packages, batch No. 226; and one case of 12 12-ounce jars, batch No. 223.

The caviar pulled were the Red Caviar Whole Grain Lumpfish, packaged as one case of 48-2-ounce packages, batch Nos. J018821 and J020767; 2 cases of 48 2-ounce packages, batch Nos. 154, 155; 2 cases of 24 3.5-ounce packages, batch No. 168; and one case of 12 12-ounce jars, batch No. 175.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
