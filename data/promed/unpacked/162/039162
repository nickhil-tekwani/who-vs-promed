Authorities are employing measures to deal with a pinkeye outbreak in Bueng Kan Province after more than 1700 cases of the communicable disease were found.

Governor of Bueng Kan Mr Chalotorn Phahote has ordered local public health officers to urgently publicize pinkeye precautions, since the outbreaks typically occur most during the rainy season in big communities, crowded areas, schools, and nurseries.

Provincial public health officer Dr Paisarn Worasatit has revealed that a total of 1751 cases of pinkeye were reported during 1 Jan-25 Aug [2014], or a ratio of 418.29 to 100 000 people. Of the total number, 983 are women, while the rest are men [I presume this simply means male/female, given that most of those affected are children. - Mod.SH]. No deaths have been reported. Most cases are found in children aged 5-9 followed by those under 4 years old.

Members of the public are advised to avoid contracting the disease by washing hands often, avoiding rubbing eyes with dirty hands, and not sharing towels with others.

[This is the 1st report of conjunctivitis (pinkeye) in Thailand that ProMED has posted. Although the etiologic agent(s) responsible for the pinkeye cases are not mentioned, viruses or bacteria are likely involved.

Pinkeye is usually caused by viral or bacterial infection. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Most viruses that cause conjunctivitis are spread through hand-to-eye contact by hands or objects that are contaminated with the infectious virus. Hands can become contaminated by coming in contact with infectious tears, eye discharge, fecal matter, or respiratory discharges. Adenovirus infections are the commonest cause, but other viruses can be involved such as picornaviruses, enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24, rubella, rubeola, and herpesviruses, including herpes simplex, varicella-zoster and Epstein-Barr virus. Infectious conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) can also be spread by large respiratory tract droplets.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is highly contagious also. The bacteria that most commonly cause bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States are _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Haemophilus influenza_, _Streptococcus pneumonia_, and _Moraxella catarrhalis_. Most bacteria that cause conjunctivitis are spread through direct hand-to-eye contact from contaminated hands. People can get conjunctivitis just by touching or using something that has been infected by a person who has the eye infection. Infectious conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) can also be spread by large respiratory tract droplets. Bacterial conjunctivitis is less common in children older than 5 years of age (Most of the above information was taken from the CDC page on conjunctivitis http://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/clinical.html).
