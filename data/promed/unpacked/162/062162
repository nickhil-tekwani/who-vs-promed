The Plantation Industries Ministry will issue a special Gazette
Notification extending the new regulations imposed to control the
spread of the coconut leaf rot disease prevalent in the Matara
district [Southern Province], Ministry Secretary G. Abeywickrama said.

Kamburugamuwa and Kotawila in Matara will be named as areas affected
by the disease, and the transportation of green cadjans [woven
coconut leaves used as roofing material] from Matara to other
districts will be banned.

Police will be authorized to check the transportation of green cadjans.

[Leaf rot disease (LRD) of coconut palm is due to a complex of fungi
including up to 14 different species. The dynamics of the pathogens
are dependent on weather factors, but the main species are generally
considered to be _Glomerella cingulata_ and _Setosphaeria rostrata_.
The emerging spindle leaf is particularly vulnerable to LRD. Symptoms
are blackening and shriveling up of the distal ends of the leaflets
in the spindle and also in some of the younger leaves. The affected
portions break off giving the affected leaves a fan-like appearance.
Subsequently, each new leaf gets infected until all fronds in the
crown show symptoms. The reduction in leaf surface adversely affects
the yield of nuts and the overall vigor of the palm. Disease
management includes removal of all severely affected fronds followed
by fungicide treatments. Research on biocontrol of LRD using
bacterial strains is being undertaken.
