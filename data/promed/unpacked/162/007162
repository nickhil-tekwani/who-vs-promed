PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2009 (08)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include some other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data
on other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease), are included also since
they may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Sep 2009 -- new confirmed case of vCJD
Date: Mon 7 Sep 2009

<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


One new case of vCJD has been recorded by the CJD surveillance unit
in Edinburgh. The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD
cases now becomes 165. A total of 4 definite/probable patients remain
alive, bringing the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases to 169.

Although one new case vCJE have been recorded during the past month,
this is still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17
in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one
in 2008, and so far one in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2009
------------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 7 Sep 2009 in the UK so far this year [2009], there have
been 95 referrals, 38 cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial
CJD, one case of iatrogenic CJD, 3 cases of GSS, and one case of vCJD.

Since the update in the preceding month [August 2009], the previously
suspected case has become a confirmed case, and another suspected
case of vCJD has been identified. So far in the 1st 8 months of 2009
there have been 939 referrals, 39 cases of sporadic CJD, 7 cases of
familial CJD 2 case of iatrogenic CJD, and one confirmed case of
vCJD. There is currently one case of suspected vCJD (no details available).

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable cases of vCJD have now
been recorded in France since 1997. The 24 confirmed cases comprise
12 females and 12 males. All 24 are now deceased. Their median age
was 36 (between 19 and 58). 6 are resident in the Ile-de-France and
18 in the provinces. All the identified cases are Met-Met
homozygotes. No risk factor has been identified. One of the 24 had
made frequent visit to the United Kingdom.

Not updated since 15 May 2009: During the period 1 Jan 2009 to 15 May
2009 there were 116 referrals, of which 66 were classified as Prion
disease, comprising 37 cases of sporadic CJD, 14 of familial CJD, and
no cases of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD. (N.B. The prion disease category
includes cases where the type determination is pending, but where
vCJD has been excluded).

[4] Proposed vCJD testing by coroners
Date: Wed 19 Aug 2009
Sourec: BBC Health News [edited]
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8207034.stm>


Coroners reject plea over vCJD
------------------------------
There have been more than 160 [164] definite or probable cases of
vCJD [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] in Britain. Coroners are
refusing to test for an infection which causes vCJD -- despite
government pleas that it could help protect the public, the BBC has
learnt. Scientists said the checks during post-mortem examinations
could help find out how many people in the population have the
infection without knowing it. This would help decide whether current
measures to protect blood transfusion and surgical patients are
sufficient. But coroners claimed doing such tests could undermine
their neutrality.

vCJD arose in the population in the 1980s as a result of eating beef
from cattle infected with BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy].
Since then 164 people have died of the disease -- however scientists
still do not know how many people could be carrying the disease
without showing any symptoms. And it may well be that the cases so
far are of those who are particularly sensitive to the disease and
many more could die.

The body responsible for advising ministers on the issue -- the
Spongiform Encepalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) -- told the
government 2 years ago that it was important to find out how many
people were silently carrying the infection. The only reliable way of
doing that, they said, would be to ask coroners to test the brain and
spleen of young people during autopsies so that they could be tested
for the presence of the infectious agent known as a prion.

According to a member of SEAC, Professor John Collinge, systematic
testing was needed to establish how many more people were likely to
get the disease and whether the current measures to protect the
spread of infection through blood transfusion and surgery were
appropriate. "I would hope that they would be able to help with this
because I don't see any other way for us to get this information at
the moment."

The Coroners' Society of England and Wales refused to comment. But
the BBC has learnt that the organisation has argued that the sole job
of coroners was to identify the deceased and establish the cause of
death. The society has told officials that if they were to request
consent from relatives to carry out research it would compromise
their neutrality and breach the trust they have built up with the
public. The organisation is also concerned that if they were to agree
to this request it would be the thin end of the wedge and lead to
more requests for them to carry out research.

Dr Michael Powers, a QC and expert in coroners' law, said: "There are
acts and rules which govern what coroners can and can't do. This
would be an added extra, outside their legal framework." But he added
it could also be a question of money. "It may well be that it could
be done but for it to be done the coroners would have to be given
more resources than they are presently being given."

But the Department of Health said it hoped to begin a pilot scheme
later this year to try out a system that it hoped would address many
of the coroners' concerns. A spokesman said: "The Health Protection
Agency is running the pilot with the co-operation of NHS [National
Health Service] Bereavement Services and NHS Blood and Transplant's
consent team. "Some coroners have agreed to participate in the pilot
study and appropriate funding will be made to them and to the other
organisations incurring additional costs."

[5] Sporadic CJD variants
Date: Sat 15 Aug 2009
Source: Arch Neurol. 2009;66(2):208-215
<http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/2/208?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=sporadic+CJD&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT>


Title: Characteristics of Established and Proposed Sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Variants
Authors: Brian S. Appleby, MD; Kristin K. Appleby, MD; Barbara J.
Crain, MD, PhD; Chiadi U. Onyike, MD, MHS; Mitchell T. Wallin, MD,
MPH; Peter V. Rabins, MD, MPH

Background:
-----------
The classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Heidenhain, and
Oppenheimer-Brownell variants are sporadic CJD (sCJD) phenotypes
frequently described in the literature, but many cases present with
neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting that there may be additional
sCJD phenotypes.

Objective:
----------
To characterize clinical, diagnostic, and molecular features of 5
sCJD variants.

Design and setting:
-------------------
Retrospective analysis, The Johns Hopkins and Veterans Administration
health care systems.

Participants:
-------------
A total of 88 patients with definite or probable sCJD.

Main Outcome Measures:
----------------------
Differences in age at onset, illness progression, diagnostic test
results, and molecular subtype.

Results:
---------
The age at onset differed among sCJD variants (P=.03); the affective
variant had the youngest mean age at onset (59.7 years). Survival
time (P.001) and the time to clinical presentation (P=.003) differed
among groups. Patients with the classic CJD phenotype had the
shortest median survival time from symptom onset (66 days) and those
who met criteria for the affective sCJD variant had the longest (421
days) and presented to clinicians significantly later (median time
from onset to presentation, 92 days; P=.004). Cerebrospinal fluid
analyses were positive for 14-3-3 protein in all of the affective
variants, regardless of illness duration. Periodic sharp-wave
complexes were not detected on any of the electroencephalography
tracings in the Oppenheimer-Brownell group; basal ganglia
hyperintensity was not detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging
in this group either. All of the Heidenhain variants were of the
methionine/ methionine type 1 molecular subtype.

Conclusions:
----------------
The classic CJD phenotype and the Heidenhain, Oppenheimer-Brownell,
cognitive, and affective sCJD variants differ by age at disease
onset, survival time, and diagnostic test results. Characteristics of
these 5 phenotypes are provided to facilitate further
clinicopathologic investigation that may lead to more reliable and
timely diagnoses of sCJD.

[Some comments extracted from a commentary provided by Terry
Singeltary Sr.: "The findings of this and previous studies by these
authors provide support for the existence of 5 sCJDvariants that
differ by clinical presentation, disease course, and diagnostic test
results. Although sCJD is known to have a range of clinical symptoms,
our findings indicate that clinical clusters of cases may be
delineated by differences in initial symptoms. It is also significant
that the sCJD variants differ with respect to age at symptom onset
and survival time, indicating a difference in disease pathology
and/or expression. Differences in survival time not only imply
differences in the natural history of the illness but also suggest
the possibility of differences in the underlying pathologic process
of the illness. Clinical sCJD variants may be a reflection of PrPSc
type and PRNP codon 129 genotype as previously reported. Individuals
who display features of an sCJD variant may also have unique genetic
or other disease-altering variables (e.g., age) that modulate illness
characteristics.

"There are several limitations to this study. Because retrospective
analysis only captures the reported findings of a case, it is
possible that symptoms were overlooked or inaccurately recorded. It
is difficult to ascertain what the impact or direction of such
information biases may be, but it is reasonable to conclude that
predominant symptoms are unlikely overlooked.

"Much progress has been made in the neuropathological and molecular
characterization of human prion diseases within the last several
years, allowing us to distinguish disease etiology in cases of vCJD,
fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker [GSS}
disease. Prion diseases that share neuropathological and molecular
features also share similar clinical phenotypes in the form of
symptom presentation, diagnostic study results, and illness duration.
As was the case with vCJD, the etiologies of nonsporadic cases of
prion disease have been discovered by pairing atypical clinical
characteristics with neuropathological findings. Further information
about sCJD can also be gleaned in this fashion and similar methods
will likely continue to extend our knowledge of prion diseases as a whole."
