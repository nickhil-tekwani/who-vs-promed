[The following quoted from a research letter titled "African swine fever virus, Siberia, Russia, 2017", available at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/4/17-1238_article:

"African swine fever (ASF) is arguably the most dangerous swine disease worldwide. ASF virus (ASFV) is highly virulent for domestic swine and remains a global threat because no effective vaccine is available to eradicate the disease. The emergent potential of ASF has been demonstrated by its spread into Russia. In the 10 years since ASF was first diagnosed in the Caucasian region of Russia, the disease has reached Palearctic regions and is spreading into western Europe.

In 2017, the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor) reported, that during 2007-2017, more than 1000 ASF outbreaks resulted in deaths of about 800 000 pigs in 46 regions across Russia. Production of backyard swine industry decreased by almost half, from 1119 tons of pork in 2007 to 608 tons of pork in 2017. However, highly industrialized pig farms showed increased production every year during this same period, despite the ASF epidemic."
