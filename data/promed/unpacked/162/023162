Report of _Tomato chlorosis virus_ in Turkey
--------------------------------------------
A tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) plant showing severe interveinal
leaf chlorosis with brown necrotic flecks was supplied by a
commercial tomato greenhouse located in Fethiye, Mugla, Southwestern
Turkey. The symptoms were similar to those described for infection of
tomato by _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) and _Tomato
chlorosis virus_ (ToCV) criniviruses. During a limited field survey,
similar symptoms and the presence of whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_
Genn. and _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ Westw.) as potential virus
vectors were observed on tomato plants in various greenhouses in the
same region, suggesting possible TCIV or ToCV infection. Leaf samples
were taken from symptomatic and non-symptomatic tomato plants from 4
different greenhouses in the same area.

Total RNA from 8 symptomatic and one non-symptomatic tomato plants
were tested for the presence of TICV and ToCV by a previously
reported method using RT-PCR [Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction) for the detection of criniviruses. This was followed by
virus-specific PCR. A negative result [no PCR product] for TICV was
observed in the non-symptomatic or symptomatic plants. Conversely, a
positive result [a 463 basepair DNA PCR product] was obtained from
all symptomatic tomato samples. No PCR product was observed in the
sample from the non-symptomatic plant. These results suggested that
the symptomatic plants were infected with ToCV.

The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product showed 99 percent identity
with the corresponding gene of ToCV isolates from Florida, USA,
confirming the diagnosis of ToCV. To our knowledge, this is the 1st
report of ToCV in Turkey.

Tomato chlorosis virus: A first report in Mayotte Island
--------------------------------------------------------
In November 2005, a survey of symptomatic greenhouse tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) plants was conducted on Mayotte Island,
an island located in the northern part of the Mozambique Channel.
Yellow leaf symptoms were observed on the lower and middle leaves of
tomato plants from the northern (Koungou), western (Chiconi and
Combani) and southern (Chirongui) regions. A flame-like pattern of
the discoloured leaves and the similarity of the symptoms to the
first description of _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV, _Crinivirus_) on
tomato in 2004 in Reunion Island suggested the possible involvement
of the same virus in Mayotte Island.

Symptomatic leaf samples were collected from tomato plants from one
greenhouse from each of the 4 affected regions. Total RNA was
analysed for the detection of a potential crinivirus by RT-PCR. PCR
products of the expected size (419 basepairs) were observed for all
samples. A total of 3 PCR products were sequenced and found to have
99 percent nucleotide identity with each other. Their highest
nucleotide identities were between 98 and 99 percent with
corresponding sequences of ToCV isolates from France, Spain, Italy
and Reunion. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV from
Mayotte Island.

[ToCV (genus _Crinivirus_, family _Closteroviridae) has been reported
from Europe, Taiwan, Japan, South Africa, Reunion Island and a number
of locations in the Americas. It has been placed on the alert list of
the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Besides tomato, it
has also been reported to affect capsicum and some solanaceous weeds
which may serve as pathogen reservoirs, as well as some ornamental
and weed species in other families.

Tomato plants infected with ToCV show an irregular chlorotic mottle
that develops first on lower leaves and gradually advances toward the
growing point. Interveinal yellow areas on leaves also develop red
and brown necrotic flecks. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and
flowers, but fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of
photosynthetic area. Significant yield losses occur as a result.
Other symptoms include rolling of lower leaves and thickened crispy
leaves, while the upper leaf canopy appears normal. Symptoms take 3-5
weeks to develop and severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms
may be confused with nutritional problems and are also similar to
those of _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV), a related
species in the genus _Crinivirus_.

ToCV is transmitted by whitefly vectors (_Bemisia tabaci_,
_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ and _T. abutiloneus_) in a
semi-persistent manner. Insects remain infectious for 2-3 days, and
viruliferous whiteflies may be spread on plant material or by air
currents. Like most members of the _Closteroviridae_, ToCV is
unlikely to be seedborne. Outbreaks are usually associated with high
vector populations and have been described as epidemics. Incidences
of up to 70 percent symptomatic plants have been reported. Disease
management of whitefly transmitted viruses is difficult and includes
vector control, removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use
of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance, and clean
planting material.
