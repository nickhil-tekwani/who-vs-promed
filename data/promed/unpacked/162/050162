Champaign County health officials say that one person has died of a rare infectious disease called tularemia. According to Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde, tularemia can be spread by tick or deer fly bites, or through contact with infected cats or rabbits. However, the disease cannot spread from human to human. The district declined to identify the victim.

The disease, also called rabbit fever, can lead to problems such as difficulty breathing. About 15 percent of cases are fatal. In 2011, the Illinois Department of Health reported 5 cases of tularemia. In 2012, 4 cases were reported.

Local health officials confirm that a man has been hospitalized for tularemia. It is believed that he may have been exposed to the disease while mowing a property outside of Windsor. The patient became sick with tularemia in July 2014, according to the Larimer County Department of Health and the Environment, and was hospitalized in early August 2014 after 2 courses of antibiotic treatment offered no improvement. He was released after several days and is expected to make a full recovery.

Tularemia was found in a Fort Collins rabbit in early July 2014, and is suspected at South Table Mountain Park in Jefferson County. Tularemia is a bacterial infection most frequently transmitted to people who have handled infected animals -- especially rabbits, hares, beavers, and muskrats. It is not considered contagious from person to person.

The latest USA statistics on tularemia (CDC: Tularemia -- United States, 2001-2010. MMWR 2013; 62(47); 963-6 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6247a5.htm) indicate that a total of 1208 cases of tularemia were reported during 2001-2010. The median number of cases per year was 126.5, with a range of 90-154 cases per year. Of these 1208 reported cases, 64 percent were categorized as confirmed and 35 percent as probable. Median age of patients was 39 years (range: 1-92 years), and 68 percent were male. Average annual incidence was 0.041 cases per 100 000 persons. By age group and sex, annual incidence was highest among children aged 5-9 years (0.071) and among men aged 65-69 years (0.11). Cases were reported from 47 states. 6 states accounted for 59 percent of reported cases: Missouri (19 percent), Arkansas (13 percent), Oklahoma (9 percent), Massachusetts (7 percent), South Dakota (5 percent), and Kansas (5 percent). Among the 10 states with the highest incidence of tularemia, all but Massachusetts were located in the central or western USA. Certain strains of _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies _tularensis_ (also known as type A) are associated with more severe disease and a greater risk for death. Mortality is less than 2 percent overall but ranges up to 24 percent depending on the strain.

As a category A bioterrorism agent despite not being transmissible from person-to-person, in a fact sheet on tularemia (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/tularemia/tularemia.html), WHO has estimated that 50 kg (110 lb) of tularemia bacteria -- released into the air over a city of 5 million people -- would cause very serious problems. WHO believes such an attack would cause about 250 000 cases of severe illness, and 19 000 deaths, a case fatality rate of about 7 percent.

Mortality is highest related to primary pneumonic or septicemia (typhoidal) with secondary pneumonia presentations and a state such as Illinois with a low incidence of disease might contribute to mortality as it may not be considered early. Of note, however, in the MMWR article cited above, the cases from Illinois were centered in central Illinois where Champaign County is located. - Mod.LL]
