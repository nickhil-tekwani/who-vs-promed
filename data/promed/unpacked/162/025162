Re:
> The statement [that the outbreak is caused by Hantaan virus is
wrong. Maybe Alex has confused hanta and Hantaan (which is not so
rare). Bashkirian HFRS is caused by Puumala hantavirus, carried
by the bank vole _Clethrionomys glareolus_.
I am so sorry for the misprinting. Really, Dr. Heikki Henttonen is
right. Bashkirian HFRS -- hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(also known as NE: nephropathia epidemica) -- is caused by the
Puumala strain of hantavirus, which was confirmed by both
serotyping and PCR.
