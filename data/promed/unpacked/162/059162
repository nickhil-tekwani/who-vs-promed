HANTAVIRUSES, MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS: RELEVANT? (03)

Ref. Dr. Calisher's comments on hantaviruses, rats and mice, we were
considering the possible occupational hazards encountered by our
environmental officers who crawl into the depths of cargo holds in ocean
freighters to issue deratting certificates, as required by International
Health Regulations. While we recognize the rodent specificity of these
viruses, we wondered about the likelihood that the Chilean/Andean
rat-associated strains (or other strains causing pulmonary syndrome) might
"jump ship" to the ocean-going _Rattus_ species. We are not too excited
about catching a bunch of rats to look for a possible "needle in a hay
stack." Would anyone care to comment or share information?

[One of the prime objectives of CDC-supported hantavirus studies in New
Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado in the U.S., and of studies done by others in
the U.S., has been to look for hantaviruses that have "jumped species". No
evidence of that, thus far. Molecular studies of genomes of hantaviruses
that might have crossed species have provided scant evidence that this
occurs, and in the rare instances when some evidence has been obtained it
seems only very closely related rodent species may provide a milieu for
such reassortment. Jumping from one mammal species to a phylogenetically
distant mammal species has not been seen. Keep in mind that hantaviruses
stimulate production of nice antibody responses but such antibody does not
neutralize to any extent. Thus, it is possible that a rodent persistently
infected with a hantavirus might become infected with another, different,
hantavirus, and reassortment of the viral RNAs (large, medium, and small)
could occur. If anyone else would care to speak to this very important
issue, we would welcome their input. -- Mod CHC]
