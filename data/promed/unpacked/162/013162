You were concerned about compensation for the farmer in Wisconsin whose herd was depopulated after a doe tested positive for CWD. WDATCP does indeed provide indemnities for farmers for their animals following depopulation; in this case, it appears that it was provided with state funds. It would be nice if you could reflect this in an updated e-mail. I would recommend contacting Dr. Paul McGraw, the WI state veterinarian at WDATCP, if you would like more information about how indemnities work following depopulation.

[It is nice to know that Wisconsin is offering a buy-out, or some type of compensation, generally known as indemnity, for the depopulated animals, as per ProMED-mail post 20151120.3807796. - Mod.TG
