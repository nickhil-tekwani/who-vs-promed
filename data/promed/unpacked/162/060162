Information on recalls and product withdrawals associated with the horse meat investigation, updated 19 Feb 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Synopsis
--------
Beef products from France, processed in Luxembourg, with raw material from Romania, via the Netherlands have been found to contain a significant percentage of horse meat, based on DNA tests. The adulterated beef products have been distributed to Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. French authorities believe that the French company, Spanghero, knowingly shipped the adulterated beef products, which were manufactured by Comigel in Luxembourg, and have suspended Spanghero's health certificate. Spanghero's management vigorously denies the allegation.

On 18 Feb 2013, France announced a partial lifting of the suspension, allowing Spanghero to produce minced meat, sausages and ready-to-eat meals, but not to stock frozen meat.

In a separate incident, frozen beef burgers from Ireland also have been found to contain horse meat, based on DNA tests. The frozen beef burgers were distributed to Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The UK Food Standards Agency initiated raids on 2 establishments, with subsequent arrests and seizures of evidence. This police action may be related to a 3rd horse meat adulteration involving Farmbox Meats (Aberystywth, Wales) and Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse (Todmorden, West Yorkshire). Approvals for both plants were suspended.

Countries throughout the EU have announced stepped-up testing for horse meat in foods that are labelled "beef" or "100 percent beef". The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has expanded its testing program to include foodstuffs that contain beef as a major ingredient, including minced meat, prepared meat dishes, gelatine, beef dripping, stock cubes, and steak. FSA issued its 1st summary report of industry test results on 15 Feb 2013 [see ProMED-mail post 20130215.1544791]. Companies reporting positive test results for horse meat included ALDI, Co-operative, Findus, Rangeland, and Tesco.
