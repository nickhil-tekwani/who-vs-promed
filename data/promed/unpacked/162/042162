[1] Japan: Olympics
Date: Sat 19 Jun 2021

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has cancelled all public viewing sites for the summer Olympics, diverting some venues to be COVID-19 vaccinations centres instead.

Foreign spectators are banned from attending the games, delayed by a year due to the pandemic, but the government and Tokyo 2020 organisers have for months held off on deciding whether to allow Japanese spectators into the stadiums.

The ban on public viewing, announced on Sat [19 Jun 2021], follows the metropolitan government's decision this month [June 2021] to scrap plans for a public viewing site in Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo, converting the venue to a vaccination centre.

"I believe these are necessary measures, when looking from various perspectives, for a successful Olympic and Paralympic Games," Koike told reporters after meeting with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

They are to talk on Mon [21 Jun 2021] with the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee.

Japanese medical experts said that banning spectators at the Olympics was the least risky option for going ahead with the event while floating the possibility that venues could hold up to 10 000 fans in areas where "quasi-emergency" measures, such as shorter restaurant hours, have been lifted.

Polls show most people in Japan are opposed to holding the games, concerned about tens of thousands of athletes, officials, and media descending on the country.

On Sat 19 Jun 2021, a new survey revealed that Japanese businesses also echoed the reservations of the population. Kyodo news agency said that 64 per cent of the 9163 businesses polled by the Tokyo Shoko Research between 1-9 Jun 2021 were in favour of cancellation or another postponement. The main reservations cited were fear of rising infection numbers and a slow vaccine rollout.

Earlier this month [June 2021], about 10 000 of the 80 000 volunteers who signed up to help at the Olympic and Paralympic Games quit, broadcaster NHK said, citing organisers.

However, local organisers, the Japanese government, and the International Olympic Committee are determined to stage the games, amid strict hygiene and with some 80 percent of the athletes to be vaccinated ahead of the games.

[80% of the athletes vaccinated is very good, but there are also coaches, companions, judges, Japanese spectators, and others. The event remains risky. The officials could demand a rapid PCR test as people enter the stadium; or they could use sniffer dogs who are able to detect infected people. - Mod.LK]

The U.S. is entering a new phase of the Covid-19 pandemic as people settle back into normal life thanks to vaccines, but public-health authorities are preparing for Americans to live with the disease lurking in the background for the long run.

Many health professionals believe that reaching herd immunity is a distant goal, due both to highly varied vaccination rates in the U.S. and uncertainty about just how much Covid-19 must be suppressed to effectively stop its spread.

Instead, they are focused on how to make it a manageable disease, with steps like close surveillance and rapid response to outbreaks in a partially vaccinated population. Calls for masks and social distancing could return, too, in efforts to control future flare-ups, health authorities say.

"I think our experience historically is that we will find a new normal living with this disease," said John Brooks, chief medical officer of the Covid-19 response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The question is, what is that new normal going to look like?"

[We live with many communicable diseases where vaccines exist (e.g., influenza, measles), and others where there is no vaccine (e.g., malaria, HIV). COVID falls in the 1st category. Individuals will choose to be vaccinated or take their chances with their own health and be a public health risk to others. And life will go on, likely with occasional flare-ups as new variants circulate. It will be important to maintain intensive surveillance accompanied by frequent sequencing to monitor the situation. - Mod.LK]

[3] Afghanistan (Kabul)
Date: Thu 17 Jun 2021
Source: NPR [abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007625010/a-covid-outbreak-at-the-u-s-embassy-in-kabul-has-sickened-114-people-and-killed-1


The U.S. Embassy in Kabul says that it is suffering from a major COVID-19 outbreak that has largely confined staff to their quarters and is disrupting many of its operations. Earlier this week, the embassy announced that it was suspending in-person visa interviews for Afghans who had worked for the U.S. military.

In a note sent to staff, seen by NPR, the embassy says 114 people "have COVID and are in isolation; one has died, and several have been medevaced." The note goes on to say that military hospital ICU resources are at full capacity and that the embassy has been forced to "create temporary, on-compound COVID-19 wards to care for oxygen-dependent patients." Most of the cases involve individuals who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated.

"We are saddened by the deaths of many valiant Afghans who have been sickened by this pandemic, and we in fact grieve the passing of an embassy local staff member," said Ned Price, the State Department's spokesperson.

The embassy requests staff to get vaccinated, stay 6 feet from others, suspend the use of pools and gyms, and it demands strict mask compliance from staff. "Wear your masks, correctly! We are seeing a lot of noses."

Failure to comply could see staff on the next flight home. The embassy asks them to make sure others are following protocols and to report those who aren't.

Eric Rubin, who heads the American Foreign Service Association -- the State Department's union -- says he's hearing from members who are "very concerned that their safety has been endangered by fellow employees who have chosen not to be vaccinated."

"Our understanding is that there is enough vaccine at every embassy and consulate in the world for anyone who wants to get it," Rubin told NPR.

The State Department does not disclose how many people are at the embassy, but it is one of the U.S.'s largest. The embassy reportedly faced a smaller coronavirus outbreak in June 2020.

[4] Cardiac problems
Date: Thu 17 Jun 2021

https://tinyurl.com/8ajjrrxc


More than 300 cases of heart inflammation after Covid-19 vaccinations have been reported in young people, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Thu 17 Jun 2021.

"The case are rare," she said. "Over 20 million adolescents and young adults [have been] vaccinated in the United States."

Still, the cases of either myocarditis or pericarditis, which involve inflammation of the heart or the surrounding tissue, are higher than what would be expected for this age group.

The CDC's independent advisory group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will meet next week to review the cases.

The group will discuss the latest research and safety data on myocarditis following shots but is not expected to make any changes to Covid-19 vaccination recommendations. The shot from Pfizer-BioNTech is the only one authorized so far for children ages 12 through 17, though young adults 18 and older can receive either Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson's vaccines.

It remains unclear whether the vaccines are the cause of the heart problem, though the CDC has said that evidence for a link is growing stronger.

Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the meeting should result in a "clear understanding of the current risks for either children or young adults" from the vaccine.

During the briefing on Thu 17 Jun 2021, Walensky said the CDC has asked "clinicians to be on the lookout for and report patients with symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination."

Symptoms can include fever and fatigue, as well as shortness of breath and chest pain. Most cases have not been serious.

"The vast majority have fully resolved with rest and supportive care," Walensky said.

Indeed, "people who have had this side effect tend to have had mild or minimal symptoms that resolve within several days," said Dr. Katie Passaretti, medical director for infection prevention at Atrium Health in Charlotte.

Next week's gathering of experts "is yet another demonstration of our ongoing efforts to keep safety central in everything we do," Walensky said. "Getting vaccinated is our way out of this pandemic."

[5] Lambda Variant of Interest

[A]
Date: 18 Jun 2021

https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lambda-covid-19-strain-who-finds-new-variant-of-interest-in-south-america-101623989602402.html


The World Health Organization (WHO) announced earlier this week that Lambda, a new variant of interest of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has been found in Peru. The new Covid-19 variant, which was 1st detected in August last year [2020], accounts for around 81% of the cases reported since April 2021 in the country, according to WHO. Moreover, the Lambda Covid-19 variant is now prevalent in as many as 29 countries, most notably in South America where it is believed to have originated.

According to a report by Xinhua news agency citing World Health Organization officials, the Lambda Covid-19 variant has been dubbed a global variant of interest due to its elevated presence in South America.

The variant was also reported in countries like Chile, where it accounted for 32% of all submitted sequences in the preceding 60 days. The Lambda variant was also reported in neighbouring countries in South America, such as Argentina and Ecuador. WHO suspects mutations present in the Lambda Covid-19 variant might show increased transmission and resistance to antibodies.

Meanwhile, the Delta Covid-19 variant, 1st identified in India, was classified as a "variant of concern" by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this week. Previously, the Delhi Covid-19 strain was only considered a "variant of interest" by the US CDC, but its status was changed to a "variant of concern" after assessing the Delta variant's high transmissibility, among other factors. Along with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19, a few other variants circulating in the United States have also been classified as variants of concern, a CDC statement published on Tue 15 Jun 2021 read. These include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) Covid-19 variants.

The Delta variant, which was dubbed a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 10 May 2021, accounts for around 9.9% of all Covid-19 cases in the United States, the CDC estimates. However, to date, no variants of high consequence have been identified in the country, the public health body explained in its statement.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wed 16 Jun 2021 that a new variant of COVID-19, named Lambda, had been identified in 29 countries and, notably, in South America, where it is believed to have originated.

1st identified in Peru, the Lambda lineage was classified as a global variant of interest on Mon 14 Jun 2021 due to an "elevated prevalence" in South America, the WHO said in its weekly update.

Lambda has been rampant in Peru, where 81 percent of COVID-19 cases since April 2021 were associated with this variant, authorities reported.

In Chile, it was detected in 32 percent of all submitted sequences in the last 60 days, only outclassed by the Gamma variant, which was 1st identified in Brazil. Other countries such as Argentina and Ecuador have also reported elevated prevalence of the new variant.

The WHO reported that the Lambda lineage carries mutations that might increase transmissibility or strengthen the virus's resistance to antibodies.

However, evidence is too limited for the moment, the Geneva-based organization said, and more studies are required to understand better the Lambda variant.

Variants of interest, unlike variants of concern that have made headlines in newspapers worldwide, are monitored by health organizations but are not proven yet to be significant threats to public health.

The most recent example is the Delta variant. It was 1st identified in India and was labelled as a variant of interest until 11 May 2021, when its rapid spread around the world prompted the WHO to classify it as a variant of concern.

[SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant, also known as lineage C.37, is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was 1st detected in Peru in August 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) named it the Lambda variant (variant of interest), on 14 Jun 2021 [https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/].

1st samples of the Lambda variant were detected in Peru in August 2020, and by April 2021, over 80 percent of new cases of COVID-19 in Peru were from the new variant. By June 2021, the Lambda variant had begun to spread through South America and was detected in 29 countries in total, especially in Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. The WHO designated the Lambda variant as a "variant of interest" on 14 Jun 2021 [https://www. cnbc.com/2021/06/16/who-says-delta-covid-variant-has-now-spread-to-80-countries-and-it-keeps-mutating.html].

In mid-June 2021, 90.6% of new COVID-19 cases in Arequipa and 78.1% of new cases in Cusco were the Lambda variant according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health.

After categorization in the variants of interest, the WHO will closely monitor Lambda in terms of transmissibility and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. WHO then will make a call on whether it should be moved to the variant of concern list.

According to the limited data available so far, WHO reported that the Lambda variant carries mutations that might increase transmissibility or strengthen the virus's resistance to antibodies. However, presently, the evidence isn't strong enough to draw any conclusion, and the WHO plans to conduct new studies to understand more about the new virus strain. - Mod.UBA]
