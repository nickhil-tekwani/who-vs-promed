Polluted water claims 10 lives in Karachi
-----------------------------------------
At least 9 children and a woman lost their lives after consuming
contaminated water in Muslimabad, Landhi Town.
Reports said that around 700 people, mostly children, were affected and
provided medical aid at different hospitals and at a camp set up by Landhi
Town and Edhi Center near Shumaila Public School, Muslimabad, Landhi.
Most of the victims resided in Bharamdas B Wali Gali and adjacent streets
of Union Council Muslimabad, Landhi Town. Talking to The News, Naib-Nazim
Landhi Town Dr Bakhat Rahim said people of the area have been getting
contaminated water for the last 2 days, and on Fri, 27 Jun 2003 he received
confirmed information about the deaths.
"It may be possible that the toxic sewage of the industrial area got mixed
in the pipelines of potable water," he said. He said that they had also
informed the Water and Sanitation Department that the area people were
getting contaminated water but they never responded.
The dead included a 22-year-old mother and her 2.5-year-old son, a
6-year-old, and 2 children aged 4 years.
Rizwan Edhi said the Edhi volunteers were providing medicines to the
affected people. He feared that the death toll might climb. Medical
Superintendent of Sindh Government Hospital, Korangi 5, Dr Nizamuddin
Memon, confirmed that the affected people consumed unhygienic and
contaminated water. He said that at least 17 people, including 7 children
and 10 women and men, were admitted to the hospital and now their condition
was stable.

1730 still suffer from water-borne disease: Death toll stands at 7
----------------
The death toll in the outbreak of a gastrointestinal disease which started
on Wed, 25 June 2003 in Landhi Town stood at 7 on Sat, 28 Jun 2003.
According to some residents of UC-2, Landhi Town, as many as 1700 people
have been suffering from gastroenteritis after consuming water contaminated
with sewage. Others claimed that more than 2000 were affected.
Officials of the Town Health Office, Landhi, told Dawn that 1730 patients
had been treated at the camp set up by the Edhi Foundation.
Dr Aslam Pervez, the Town Health Officer, said the patients who had become
too weak and needed intensive care were shifted to the Sindh Government
Hospital Korangi No 5, Landhi Medical Complex, the SESSI Hospital, in the
town, and the Jinnah Post-graduate Medical Center.
A total of 74 patients were treated at the Government Hospital Korangi No
5, said its medical superintendent. 31 were admitted there by the evening
of 28 Jun.
A spokesman for the provincial labor ministry told Dawn that 400 patients
had been treated at the Sessi's hospital and about 90 are still admitted
there. 3 patients have been admitted to the JPMC, as their condition is
stated to be critical.
Dr Shakeel A. Siddiqui of the hospital said the disease responsible for the
7 deaths was most definitely gastroenteritis. He said the stool and urine
samples of one patient had been tested at a pathological laboratory
nearby. "Results show that the patient is suffering from infection in the
stomach and intestines," he said. Elaborating, he said there were traces of
pus and blood in the samples.
In response to a question, Dr Siddiqui said the test had been ordered to
exclude cholera. Some of the patients brought to his hospital had fever, he
added. "This also indicates that they were suffering from gastroenteritis."
Meanwhile, all the patients who were approached by Dawn for comments on
Saturday were of the opinion that it was contaminated water which had
caused the problem. MPA Maulana Ehsanullah Hazarvi, Nazim of Muslimabad
Javed Azeem and Naib Nazim Javed Ali said the problem was an old one, and
the authorities had been informed of the situation in the area at least a
couple of months ago.
An official of the water and sanitation department said investigations into
the problem were underway. He went on to say that the pipes in the affected
locality had not been laid by the staff of his department.

[It is difficult to know what may have caused the illness and deaths in
these people, as no clinical signs are given. However, contaminated water
could indicate a contamination with chemicals from a treated sewer, or raw
sewage. These people could have been affected with any number of bacteria
such as _E. coli_ or Salmonella.
If anyone has more information or an authoritative cause of these illness
and deaths, ProMED-mail would appreciate the information.- Mod.TG]
[I agree with Mod. TG that there is not enough information to have a good
handle on the etiology of this large outbreak. If fever was associated
with the outbreak and, as suggested, there was purulence and blood in the
diarrhea, then an invasive illness such as shigellosis or amoebiasis would
be high on the list. Illnesses associated with preformed toxins such as
staphylococcal or clostridial food poisoning do not present with fever or a
dysentery-like picture, nor does cholera. - Mod.LL]
