Meeting at the Beni City Council on the management of the massive displacement of populations from Mangina to Beni
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The Deputy General Coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic, Dr Justus Nsio Mbeta, participated on Mon 10 Feb 2020 in the meeting chaired by the Mayor of the city of Beni, on the development a contingency plan for the situation of displaced people from Mangina to Beni. This meeting took place in the presence of some delegates from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA);
- the meeting was convened at the request of the General Coordination of the Response to the Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic, which expressed its concern at the situation of the displaced, which must be well managed in order to avoid the importation or exportation of the epidemic by contamination or the reinfection of displaced persons upon their return to their area, given that Beni remains the only area affected by the Ebola virus today;
- for this purpose, the deputy general coordinator of the response asked that the needs of the displaced be identified and that they be located in their places of accommodation in order to raise their awareness of the need to observe the standards for the prevention of Ebola virus disease;
- the Town Hall presented 2 challenges linked to this situation, namely: the lack of family members in Beni for some displaced persons and the refusal of other displaced persons to stay overnight in the cantonments;
- the Town Hall of Beni plans, on occasion, to organize a strong awareness campaign in order to persuade Beni households to welcome the displaced who have no shelter;

- for OCHA, experience shows that in the far north, given past experiences in the cantonment, displaced people can be followed individually in their respective households. He announced the availability of some partners to support the city of Beni to fight displacement. They are awaiting the Emergency Plan validated by the competent authority;
- 3 recommendations resulted from this meeting, namely: establish a rapid assessment which will give reliable statistics on the basis of which needs will be identified, make tents available quickly to be able to accommodate these displaced persons, and set up committees capable of drawing up a plan signed by the Mayor, allowing humanitarian partners to align.

Vaccination
-----------
- As of 7 Feb 2020, 11 653 people have been vaccinated with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas in Karisimbi and Goma.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 292 248 people have been vaccinated with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.
- Approved 22 Oct 2019 by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa and 23 Oct 2019 by the National Ethics Committee, the 2nd vaccine, called Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN- Filo, is produced by Janssen Pharmaceuticals for Johnson & Johnson;
- this new vaccine complements the 1st, rVSV-ZEBOV, a vaccine used until then (since 8 Aug 2018) in this epidemic, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, after approval by the Ethics Committee on 20 May 2018=, was recently pre-qualified for certification.

Monitoring at entry points
--------------------------
- Since the start of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement ) at health checkpoints is 149 361 451;
- to date, a total of 109 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) have been established in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect the country's major cities and avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[Ebola appears to be simmering at a very low level with few new cases and few deaths in the community. But we must not lose sight of its ability to explode if attention lapses on following safe practices. Vaccination must continue and support needs to be sustained, even in light of the expanding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) threat. - Mod.LK]

WHO Ebola emergency committee to meet tomorrow [12 Feb 2020]
------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola emergency committee will meet tomorrow [12 Feb 2020] to discuss the latest Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak developments and assess if the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern under International Health Regulations. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, announced the meeting today [11 Feb 2020] at the start of a media briefing that primarily addressed the COVID-19 novel coronavirus outbreak.

The meeting will be the emergency committee's 6th; its last meeting was held in the middle of October [2019]. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or as needed to assess the latest developments. At the media briefing today [11 Feb 2020], Tedros said though the world is now focused on coronavirus, "we cannot and must not forget Ebola."

He said, however, that health officials are encouraged by the current trend; only 3 cases were reported over the past week, and no cases have been reported in the past 3 days. "But until we have no cases for 42 days, it's not over. As you know, any single case could reignite this epidemic, and the security situation in the eastern DRC remains extremely fragile." According to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, the outbreak total remains at 3431 cases, 2249 of them fatal [N.B. CMRE report from 10 Feb 2020 states 2253 deaths -- see report above -- but WHO AFRO dashboard states 2249]. Outbreak responders are still investigating 441 suspected cases.

The WHO's African regional office said in its weekly outbreaks and emergencies report today [11 Feb 2020] that the main hot spot is Beni in North Kivu province, but ongoing insecurity in other areas is still a concern. The agency added that continued access and heightened vigilance are needed to keep case investigations and contact tracing going.

We are still in full response mode. Yesterday alone [10 Feb 2020], 5400 alerts were investigated, almost 300 samples were analyzed, more than 700 people were vaccinated and almost 2000 contacts were followed. So still it's a massive response."

Only 1 new Ebola case recorded in past 4 days
---------------------------------------------
According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard, only one new case of Ebola has been recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since 6 Feb 2020, raising the outbreak total to 3431 confirmed cases. The WHO also noted 123 probable cases, and 441 suspected cases still under investigation.

Since the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces began in August 2018, 2249 people have died from Ebola.

Over the weekend [8-9 Feb 2020] the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the single case reported was from Beni, the current hot spot for the virus.

The CMRE also updated vaccine totals, with 11 313 people having received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to date, and 290 516 having received Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV.

[3] WHO guidelines

Pregnancy and breastfeeding during an Ebola virus outbreak: New WHO guidelines
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding in an Ebola outbreak face similar challenges as other population groups, but they have specific health needs which must be met.

As the 2nd largest Ebola outbreak in history continues in the Democratic Republic of Congo, WHO has released new clinical guidelines for healthcare providers supporting pregnant or breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola virus disease.

Improving clinical care and reducing mortality
----------------------------------------------
Clear and coherent guidance is needed to meet the combined needs of women requiring Ebola treatment, pregnancy care, and management of complications.

Information on how to protect breastfeeding children and other members in the community from transmission of the disease is also critical.

Limited scientific evidence on how to best manage these needs has previously been a challenge for affected countries. In addition, misconceptions that pregnant women have a higher mortality rate than other populations with Ebola may in some contexts have put pregnant women at risk of not receiving standard care.

WHO's Guideline on the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola virus reviews existing evidence and provides a single set of recommendations on the care continuum for women exposed to, diagnosed with, or recovered from Ebola. This will enable healthcare providers, emergency response teams and health policy-makers to improve prevention and treatment measures in an Ebola outbreak.

Obstetric care at an Ebola Treatment Centre
-------------------------------------------
Optimal supportive care should be offered to all pregnant women with Ebola. Likewise, they should be offered experimental treatment and vaccination under the same conditions as non-pregnant populations.

Ebola virus disease does increase the risk of miscarriage and early labour, requiring close clinical management at Ebola treatment centres. It is important to engage both obstetric providers and those trained in Ebola response.

This dual expertise is also important because early Ebola and pregnancy-related symptoms can overlap. Pregnant women should be prioritised for testing to confirm an Ebola infection.

Ebola virus can persist in pregnancy related fluids as well as breastmilk. If healthcare providers are not clear on how to manage Ebola infection risk, they may be less willing to provide care. This stigma can be life-threatening for women who experience complications during delivery.

The new WHO guidelines advise healthcare workers on how to protect themselves while caring for pregnant women with Ebola virus disease. This includes induced labour or surgical procedures, which carry greater risk of transmission in cases of acute infection. Any invasive treatments should be carried out in full personal protective equipment.

Breastfeeding recommendations in an Ebola outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
WHO recommends that women with suspected or confirmed Ebola immediately stop breastfeeding and are prioritised for diagnostic testing. Any child exposed to Ebola through breast milk should be placed into safe care, closely monitored for symptoms over a 21-day period and fed with an appropriate breast milk substitute.

The guidelines strongly recommend that breastfeeding is only restarted following 2 consecutive negative tests of breast milk, separated by 24 hours.

A breast milk substitute should be used even if infection is confirmed for both the mother and her child. Exceptions can be made for infants under 6 months of age who are already infected, if breast milk substitutes are not feasible, affordable, sustainable or safe and separation cannot be implemented safely.

Women's health and rights in a disease outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
A disease outbreak does not change women's and adolescent girls' fundamental human right to sexual and reproductive healthcare, including evidence-based care during pregnancy and childbirth.

Women need support to make informed reproductive health care choices for themselves and their children. Women living in an Ebola outbreak should have access to all relevant reproductive options, regardless of economic, cultural, racial or religious status, including contraception and safe abortion to the full extent of the law.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women across affected communities need equitable and respectful care that considers the risks they face and supports the choices they make.

Accessing the guidelines and further research
---------------------------------------------
These guidelines are now available online and may be freely downloaded from https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330851/9789240001381-eng.pdf. The executive summary will be available in French.

WHO will closely monitor new data as it emerges, as there is still a pressing need to prioritise ongoing research related to Ebola virus transmission.
