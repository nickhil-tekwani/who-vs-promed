Further laboratory tests following a routine veterinary investigation
at 2 poultry premises in East Anglia have now confirmed that the
avian influenza virus present is H6N1.

The H6 virus type has been isolated in domestic poultry and wild
birds in Europe over the last few years.

Animal Health began the investigation late on Tuesday evening [24 Feb
2009] and is waiting for further laboratory tests to determine
whether the virus is high or low pathogenicity, and these results are
not expected for some days.

To date, there is no evidence that avian influenza of the H6 type has
been found to be highly pathogenic, but this possibility cannot be
ruled out until the further laboratory tests are complete.

Restrictions remain in place on the premises while the investigation
continues. No further precautionary restrictions are considered
necessary in the area at present.

Routine veterinary investigations into notifiable diseases occur on a
regular basis. It is a legal requirement to notify the Animal Health
agency of the possibility of such diseases whenever these cannot be
ruled out by a vet or an animal keeper as part of the diagnosis of
illness in animals or birds.

Tests on turkeys at 2 farms have confirmed the birds have a low-risk
strain of bird flu called H6N1.

The flu, affecting birds at Bernard Matthews' breeder farms at
Yaxham, near Dereham, and Ubbeston, near Halesworth was quickly ruled
out as the deadly H5 or H7 strain of avian influenza. But it is
thought to be the 1st time birds in Britain have been affected by
this particular strain.

Last night [27 Feb 2009], the company said tests had confirmed the
birds had the H6N1 virus, one of low risk to humans. A Bernard
Matthews statement said: "This is a virus type that has been isolated
in both wild birds and commercial poultry flocks in Europe over the
last few years."

Defra started tests for bird flu on Arran Farm at Yaxham and at
Ubbeston on Tuesday [24 Feb 2009] after the firm brought it to their
attention. Workers had noticed an unusual drop in egg production
levels. The Health Protection Agency said staff did not have to be
treated.

The 2 farms remain under movement restrictions. None of Bernard
Matthews Farms' other operations have been affected.

[The pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses is defined according to
criteria detailed in OIE's terrestrial animal health Code. Highly
pathogenic viruses are those which have an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 in 6-week-old chickens, or, as an
alternative, cause at least 75 percent mortality in 4 to 8-week-old
chickens infected intravenously.

Results of the testing in the UK laboratory are expected within a few
days. If the current H6 strain is, as expected, found to be of low
pathogenicity, the event is not regarded as notifiable. According to
the Code, the only notifiable low pathogenicity AI strains are H5 and
H7. - Mod.AS]
