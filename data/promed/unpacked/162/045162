Updated Information for Travelers about Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus:
(Released 23 Apr 2004;Updated 14 Jul 2004)
--------------------------------------------------
In recent weeks, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE;
<http://www.oie.int>) has received reports of confirmed highly pathogenic
avian influenza A (H5N1), a serious viral infection, among poultry in
Indonesia (28 Jun), Vietnam (1 & 12 Jul), Thailand (7, 9 & 13 Jul), and
China (6 Jul). No associated human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection has been reported during this period. In response, the 4
countries have instituted control measures and increased surveillance for
H5N1 virus among poultry. Along with South Korea, Japan, Cambodia, and
Laos, these 4 countries were previously affected by widespread H5N1
outbreaks among poultry that were reported from mid-Jan 2004 through Mar 2004.
While it is unusual for humans to contract influenza virus infections
directly from poultry or [wild] birds, rare human infections and outbreaks
caused by certain avian influenza A viruses have been reported to the World
Health Organization (WHO). During the H5N1 outbreaks among poultry in Asia
earlier this year, Vietnam and Thailand reported 34 human infections with
H5N1 viruses, including 23 deaths and references below). All patients with
confirmed H5N1 were severely ill, and many had a history of exposure to
sick or dead poultry. Field investigations at that time showed no
conclusive evidence of human-to-human transmission of the disease.

Although the H5N1 poultry outbreaks in South Korea and Japan have been
controlled, the degree to which outbreaks in Vietnam, Thailand , Indonesia,
Cambodia, Laos, and China have been controlled is uncertain. For this
reason, CDC continues to recommend the measures that were detailed in a
health update on 10 Jun 2004, which specifies enhanced surveillance for
suspected H5N1 cases among travelers with severe unexplained respiratory
illness returning from H5N1-affected countries.
<http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/han/archivesys/viewmsgv.asp?alertnum=00204>
Travelers to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, and China are
advised to follow standard health recommendations for that region and, as a
precaution, avoid places such as poultry farms and bird markets where live
poultry are raised or kept, and avoid contact with sick or dead poultry. As
with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important and appropriate
preventive practices is careful and frequent hand washing. Cleaning your
hands often using either soap and water or waterless, alcohol-based hand
rubs removes potentially infectious materials from your skin and helps
prevent disease transmission.
Travelers returning with an illness from any area of the world are reminded
to seek prompt medical attention. For more information about CDC health
recommendations for travel to Asia, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/seasia.htm> and
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/eastasia.htm>.
On 8 Jul 2004, WHO issued a summary of recently published research findings
on H5N1, indicating that the virus may be widespread in domestic ducks in
southern China, has been found in wild birds as well as poultry, may be
causing increasingly severe illness in humans with each outbreak, and
remains a serious threat to human health. The summary also makes
recommendations to countries about measures to prevent and control the
disease. For details, see

A Comment on Vaccination Policy
-------------------------------
One cannot emphasize enough that vaccination of those involved in culling
is in addition to, not in place of, protective clothing, masks and goggles.
Vaccination would provide only partial protection from infection with a
drifted strain. Subclinical infection with a drifted strain may be enough
to allow a shift to occur. Neither vaccination, protective clothing, nor
antivirals are 100 percent effective. For this reason prophylactic
antivirals (to which the virus is not resistant) should also be provided to
the workers.

[It is my understanding that the principal aim of vaccination of those
involved in culling of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus-infected poultry,
using the current human (H1N1/H3N2) vaccine, is not only to provide some
limited cross-protection, but rather to reduce the potential for
simultaneous infection of susceptible individuals by both avian and human
strains of influenza virus. The intention is rather to reduce the potential
for generation of novel strains by reassortment of genome subunits between
human and avian virus, producing viruses that may be the precursors of
human epidemic and pandemic influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
