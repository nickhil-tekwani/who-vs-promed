This is in reply to the request made concerning ONN fever in Uganda. We
had earlier on sent a message to CDC, Fort Collins (USA) about our progress
at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). Recently we collected
samples from Mbarara and Kabalore Districts and two strains were isolated.
I had to wait until the tests were done before replying.
Indeed ONN fever is present in southern and southwestern Uganda in the
districts of Rakai, Masaka, Mbarara, Sembabule, Kabarole and probably
Mubende. At UVRI we are interested in investigating the rate of spread,
the focus areas, the morbidity rate, the demographics of infected and
uninfected populations, and vector species involved other than _Anopheles
gambiae_ and _A. funestus_. However, we reported earlier (in the CDC
report) we lack the needed funds to carry out such investigations. A
proposal had been presented to [the Uganda government and to CDC, but we
have not received any feed back. We would be very happy [if collaborating
institutions, individuals or funding agencies would help us to carry out a
full investigation.
In Jan/Feb 1997 we [were joined by a CDC/WHO/KEMRI team for three weeks
and we carried out investigations; however, during that period the epidemic
had decreased. As of the beginning of the present rains it seems to be
increasing and the spread is continuing.
At UVRI, the leading investigators are Dr. J Lutwama and Dr. L Rwaguma.
[It would be a shame to allow a rare opportunity like this to pass. Perhaps
CDC, WHO or other internationally-recognized organizations will be able to
find some funds to complete these studies. -Mod. CHC
