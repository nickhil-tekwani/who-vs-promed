Cattle producers from Cordoba and Sucre [Colombia] will export cattle
to Lebanon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following several months of negotiations, Colombian cattle producers
succeeded in obtaining approval to export live cattle to Lebanon.
Cordoba and Sucre will be the 1st departments [equivalent to
state/province] to send animals for slaughter to that country.

Among the requirements, the exported animals should be certified as
free from FMD and bovine tuberculosis. They should also be subjected
to treatments against endoparasites and ectoparasites (internal and
external parasites).

The cattle destined for Lebanon must be loaded at the port of
Barranquilla between 20 and 22 Feb 2010. The expectations of the
industry are focusing on this new market after the closure of exports
to Venezuela, which was until last year [2009] the main buyer of
Colombian cattle.

According to Gustavo Vergara, manager of Cogasucre [Sucre Livestock
Marketing], one of the leading marketers of livestock in the country,
said that if this new negotiation yields excellent results, lots of
close to 8000 young bulls (less than 3 years old) are to be exported
to Lebanon every 3 months. "It would be about 32 000 animals annually,
excellent figures for the departments of Cordoba and Sucre," said
Vergara.

To avoid loss of weight during the voyage, the vessel was fitted with
pens for up to 16 animals, where they will have water and food
supplements.

Upon arrival in Lebanon, the livestock will be unloaded and
transferred immediately to the ranches where they must stay at least
75 days for recovery and then sent to slaughter.

[Other diseases to be taken into consideration in relation to
international trade in ruminants are bluetongue and other
(_Culicoides_-borne) orbiviruses. _Culicoides_ vectors are known to be
prevalent in the Middle East; Middle Eastern countries are major
importers of live ruminants. Some BTV serotypes in the Americas,
Africa, Australia, Europe, and distant parts of Asia are exotic to the
Middle East. The serotypes known to have been identified in Colombia
are BTV 12, 14, and 17 (Refs 1 and 2). Other orbiviruses, namely
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD_ serotypes 1 and 2, were reported
there as well (Ref 1).

The risk of pathogen movement to receptive ecosystems (where efficient
vectors may be present and active at the time of arrival), depends
upon several factors, including the seasons prevailing in the source
and target regions within the exporting and importing countries during
the export period, and the duration of the transportation. The risk
can be minimized by various measures, including tests, as well as by
taking into consideration the said factors. - Mod.AS]
