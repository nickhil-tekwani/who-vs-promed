The current outbreak of leishmaniasis -- a parasitic disease that is relatively common in dogs but rarely seen in humans even though it is endemic in Spain -- that has been affecting Fuenlabrada since July 2009 is far from over, according to the most recent data issued by the Epidemiology Service in the Public Health Council.

So far this year [2012], 35 new cases have been reported between January and March 2012, according to an internal report dated last 17 Apr 2012. However, the situation is better compared to last year [2011], since in the same time period, 54 cases were notified. These figures contradict what Ms. Paloma Martin, Head of Order and Inspection, recently declared. She said that "the situation is within the normal range," and that "there is nothing new [about this outbreak]."

The Public Health Council has been reluctant to offer information about this outbreak. Just recently, and after a delay that took several months, they published a report about diseases that must be obligatorily reported for year 2010, describing an epidemic in southwestern Madrid for that year.

Knowing that the only official figure was the one brought up by technicians in Public Health in an international meeting on leishmaniasis -- 240 cases were officially recognized with this distribution: Fuenlabrada (201), Leganes (26), and Getafe (13) -- an internal report dated last 10 Apr 2012 updated the number of affected persons to 266 people.

Of these 266 cases, 41 percent correspond to visceral leishmaniasis, the most severe condition within its group, since it affects both the liver and the spleen. It is a lethal disease if left untreated, and it has a very long incubation period, between 2-6 months.

The remaining cases, 59 percent, correspond to cutaneous leishmaniasis, a condition that causes ulcerative lesions on the skin. 58 per cent of those infected with the parasite, which is transmitted by a small mosquito vector, have been male patients. The most recent data include Humanes within the municipalities affected by the current outbreak, adding this place to Fuenlabrada, Getafe, and Leganes. Humanes reported 4 cases in 2012.

Mr. Antonio Alemany, General Director of Primary Care, states a difference between notified cases and those who started showing symptoms in 2012. According to his data, for only 14 of 35 notified cases, their symptoms started between January and March 2012, so the remaining cases correspond to laboratory-confirmed diagnoses of prior patients who may even be cured by now.

In any case, both groups of patients became infected last year [2011], since the activity period of _Phlebotomous_ mosquitoes coincides with the hot season, between May and October. These insects die during winter, but newer generations are born next summer. These newborn mosquitoes will not be infected until they eat a blood meal from an infected animal. Then, they become vectors capable of transmitting the disease when biting a human being.

Both Health and Environment Councils are working hard in order to control animals considered to be reservoirs (hosts or harbours) for the parasite.

Traditionally, dogs have been considered the main reservoir, but during this outbreak, it has been found that many hares living in Bosquesur have become secondary reservoirs.

The community declared the affected area -- Fuenlabrada and its surroundings -- to be an "emergency area" in order to allow an "exceptional hunting season for hares and rabbits," considering that "there is an excessive number of these animals." The Public Health Council did not offer any data yesterday [2 May 2012] about the number of captured and killed animals. Some weeks ago, this figure was 150 animals.

[A recent study looked at hospitalized patients with leishmaniasis during a 12-year period (1997-2008) and identified 2028 individuals. The average hospitalization rate was 0.41/100 000 inhabitants. 1/3rd of them were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The incidence of hospitalization in the adult population with leishmaniasis co-infected with HIV increased with age, peaked at 35-39 years of age, and subsequently declined. In the pediatric population, all leishmaniasis cases occurred in HIV-negative children. Incidence of hospitalization was highest in Madrid and in the Mediterranean coast (Gil-Prieto R et al. Epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Spain based on hospitalization records (1997-2008). Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2011;85:820-5).

The reservoir of _L. infantum_ in Spain is considered to be dogs, and it is important if hares also host lesihmania. - Mod.EP
