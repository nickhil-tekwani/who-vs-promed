The equine influenza outbreak in Japan has affected more horses.
Japanese media, quoting local government officials, report 114 horses
kept at Kanazawa Racetrack had been infected with the horse flu
virus. The disease, while not fatal, is extremely contagious.
Officials made the discovery after learning that a handful of horses
at the facility had been among the 29 infected in the original
outbreak in mid-August [2007]. A decision was made to examine the 529
horses at the track, and the additional cases were identified.
Japanese racing has been severely restricted in a bid to stop the
spread of the disease, which has not affected the local industry for
35 years. An outbreak in 1971 halted racing for 9 weeks.
Cancellations last Friday [17 Aug 2007] alone are estimated to have
cost the industry 1 billion yen, or USD 8.7 million.
The outbreak has cast a shadow over Japan's defence of the Melbourne
Cup. Last year's [2006] winner, Delta Blues, and runner-up Pop Rock
are being held at an unaffected facility well away from the outbreak,
but their travel to Australia will depend upon whether Japanese
authorities can contain the disease.
Meanwhile, Australian authorities say they are confident an upper
respiratory illness affecting 3 horses being held in quarantine
facilities is not equine influenza.
All horses being held have been tested for the disease, and the
results were negative.
