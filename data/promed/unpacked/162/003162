A horse in Tuscola County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) according to a press release from the Tuscola County Health Department.

According to the release, as of [27 Sep 2020], EEE has been confirmed in 34 animals in 14 counties, 32 in equines, and 2 in deer. Barry County has 1 confirmed human case.

There is a vaccine available for horses, but the one in Tuscola County was unvaccinated, according to the Department of Agriculture and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

There is no vaccine for humans.

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, the release states, and has a 33% fatality rate in people who become ill.

"People can be infected with EEE from one bite of a mosquito carrying the virus," the release reads. "Persons younger than age 15 and over the age of 50 are at the greatest risk for severe disease following infection. More than 25% of the nation's EEE cases last year [2019] were diagnosed in Michigan."

The MDHHS says mosquitoes carrying EEE most commonly are found flying from dusk to dawn. They don't like cold temperatures, so with temperatures expected to drop in the area over the next week, the risk of infection will likely fall.

People can protect themselves by doing the following:
- Use repellant when outdoors. Use insect repellant that contains DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin/clothing. Permethrin can also be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow instructions.
- Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants.
- Install and repair window screens to keep the mosquitoes out.
- Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs near you. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels and tires. Change your pet water frequently.

State health officials are urging Indiana residents to protect themselves from mosquito bites following reports of a probable case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a LaPorte County resident and the detection of the virus in horses in northern Indiana.

As of 14 Sep 2020, 2 horses in LaGrange County and 1 horse in Kosciusko County have tested positive for EEE virus. Because there is suitable habitat for mosquitoes throughout the area, residents of all northern Indiana counties should take precautions.

In 2019, northern Indiana experienced a significant outbreak of EEE virus activity, resulting in 14 horse cases, 1 fatal human case, and 1 positive mosquito sample.

"Eastern equine encephalitis virus disease is rare in humans but can cause permanent complications and even death," said State Health Commissioner Kris Box, MD, FACOG. "While all Hoosiers are at risk for mosquito-borne diseases, northern Indiana residents need to be especially vigilant right now."

State health officials recommend that all Hoosiers take the following steps to prevent mosquito bites:
- Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are active (especially late afternoon, dusk to dawn, and early morning).
- Use an EPA-registered insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or 2-undecanone on clothes and exposed skin.
- Cover exposed skin by wearing a hat, long sleeves, and long pants in places where mosquitoes are especially active, such as wooded areas.
- Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out of your home.

You can eliminate mosquito breeding sites from your property by doing the following:
- Discard old tires, tin cans, ceramic pots, or other containers that can hold water
- Repair failed septic systems.
- Drill holes in the bottom of recycling containers left outdoors.
- Keep grass cut short and shrubbery trimmed.
- Clean clogged roof gutters, particularly if leaves tend to plug up the drains.
- Frequently replace the water in pet bowls.
- Flush ornamental fountains and birdbaths periodically.
- Aerate ornamental pools, or stock them with predatory fish.

While rare, the EEE virus can cause serious illness and has a fatality rate of around 33 percent or higher in people. Many individuals who recover may still experience long-term complications. Symptoms of EEE virus include chills, fever, body aches, and joint pain.

Some people develop a more severe form of the disease affecting the nervous system and causing encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.

People who are younger than 15 and older than 50 are at the greatest risk of severe disease if infected with EEE virus. People who think they may have EEE virus should visit a healthcare provider.

Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, DVM, said 3 horses -- one located in Iberville and 2 in Lafourche parishes -- have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"Mosquitoes are out in force right now. The hot and wet conditions exacerbated by storms such as Hurricane Laura [August 2020], increase the number of mosquitoes that could be carrying diseases," said Strain. "Like humans, horses are infected by being bitten by mosquitoes. That is why it is so important to vaccinate your horses to help prevent them from getting sick. It is not too late to do so."

According to Strain, if a mosquito bites an infected bird, small mammal, or reptile, EEE or West Nile virus (WNV) can be spread to horses, dogs, cats, and humans. These mosquito-transmitted diseases can cause inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord.

Common signs can include fever, loss of appetite, weakness, loss of coordination, and circling. The disease can often result in death.

EEE primarily causes disease in the equine species such as horses, mules, donkeys, and zebras. However, a number of other animals such as pigs, llamas, bats, reptiles, amphibians, and rodents can also be infected. Humans can also be infected by EEE.

WNV primarily affects birds, but can also infect bats, horses, cats, dogs, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels, domestic rabbits, alligators, and humans.

Prevention includes removing standing water where mosquitoes breed and using mosquito repellents that are safe for animals and humans. Horses, donkeys, and mules can also be vaccinated. There is no vaccination approved for people. Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian regarding proper vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk.

Veterinarians are required to call the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry if they suspect EEE or WNV in a horse as they are reportable diseases.

The Oneida County Health Department reports a horse in Oneida County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis. The presence of an EEE positive horse confirms there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus capable of spreading the virus to people and other animals.

EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans.

This report follows 2 human cases of EEE confirmed in the state this year [2020] in residents of Eau Claire County and Chippewa County, and reports of several other EEE cases in horses in northern and western regions of Wisconsin.

Prior to 2020, only 3 human cases of EEE had been reported in the state between 1964 and 2019. The presence of an EEE positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can spread the virus to people and other animals.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick. Those who do become ill may develop fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe resulting in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death.

There is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE illness available for people.

Signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Even though temperatures have cooled off, as long as mosquitoes are active, the risk of EEE and other illnesses spread by mosquitoes can continue through much of the fall.

Since EEE virus is known to be circulating in Oneida County, residents and visitors should be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites.

If you own a horse, vaccination against disease is one of the best methods of protection. The injection is a combination of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalopathy (WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), and tetanus. Some combination vaccines may include Venezuelan equine encephalopathy and equine influenza. The injection is repeated in approximately 2-3 weeks. In areas where the mosquito season is prolonged, the vaccine should be repeated approximately every 3-4 months as immunity to EEE wanes relatively quickly.

Use of equine approved sprays to control flies and mosquitoes is recommended in addition to vaccines. Use of fans in the barn is also a deterrent to mosquitoes as they are not strong fliers. Keeping your horse inside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are more likely to be out in higher numbers can aid in protecting your animal.

Remember to remove standing water from old tires, flower pot catch basins, and any other areas where standing water may promote mosquito breeding. Remember to change the water bucket in horse stalls once or twice daily. The water should also be changed once or twice daily for other pets, including the water in bird baths.

If mosquitoes are in the area, you need to protect yourself as well as your pets. Remember to limit outdoor activity at dusk and dawn, wear light colored clothing, long sleeves, and long pants to protect yourself. Use mosquito repellents for human beings. There is no vaccine for human beings. - Mod.TG]
