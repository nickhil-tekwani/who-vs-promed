Outbreak at a glance
--------------------
Measles is endemic in Somalia with cases reported every year. In 2022, between epidemiological weeks 1 and 9, a cumulative 3509 suspected measles cases have been reported from 18 regions in the country. Response activities are ongoing, with WHO providing technical support on surveillance, vaccination, laboratory, case management, training of healthcare workers and risk communication. Given the low levels of vaccination coverage and a high prevalence of both malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency among children aged under 5 years, the overall risk for measles at the national level is assessed as very high. This risk is further aggravated by a complex humanitarian crisis caused by conflict and droughts, and related displacements.

Outbreak overview
-----------------
Between 2 Jan and 5 Mar 2022, a cumulative 3509 suspected measles cases have been reported from 18 regions in the country, largely from drought-affected districts. Of these 18 regions, 6 regions including Bay (1194 suspected cases), Mudug (796 suspected cases), Banaadir (559 suspected cases), Bari (277 suspected cases), Lower Shabelle (121 suspected cases) and Gedo (141 suspected cases) reported the highest number of measles cases. Between 2 Jan and 5 Mar 2022, a total of 249 samples were collected and tested at 4 laboratories in the country (in Garowe, Hargeisa, Kismayo, and Mogadishu). Of these samples, 57% (142 samples) tested positive for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM); 81% were less than 5 years of age.

Measles is endemic in Somalia, and the annual number of cases has varied substantially in recent years. The largest measles outbreak in recent years was recorded in 2017 when 23 039 suspected cases were reported in 118 districts across all 6 federal states and the Banaadir Regional Administration of Somalia. In the ongoing epidemic in drought-affected districts, a total of 2596 suspected measles cases were reported to WHO in 2020, while a total of 7494 suspected measles cases were reported in 2021.

According to the WHO-UNICEF national estimates of immunization coverage, coverage with the 1st dose of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) is suboptimal in Somalia, estimated at around 46% for the last 10 years. The measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (MCV2) was introduced to the routine immunization program in November 2021 -- but it is not yet introduced in Somaliland.

Epidemiology of measles
-----------------------
Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths.

Public health response
----------------------
The overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:

- Suboptimal vaccination coverage through routine immunization and lack of recent supplemental immunization activities (SIA). The last SIA was conducted more than 2 years ago.
- High levels of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency in the context of food insecurity leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 4.5 million people in 71 districts in the country face food insecurity.
- Shortage of essential medical supplies for the management of reported cases of measles.
- An overstretched healthcare system with limited capacity to respond to the current outbreak.
- Limited access to primary healthcare services for the high proportion of people displaced due to drought.
- Delays in detection and response to alerts due to suboptimal integrated disease surveillance system and lack of reporting in the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN), which will likely lead to pockets of undetected transmission.
- Limited laboratory capacity, as only 4 laboratories in the country are conducting confirmatory measles testing.

The overall risk at the regional level was assessed as moderate due to the unrestricted movement of people between Somalia and neighbouring countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti) where vaccination coverage is also suboptimal.

The overall risk at the global level was assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place.

WHO advice
----------
Vaccination: Enhanced routine measles vaccination for children and conducting outbreak response mass immunization campaigns are key strategies for effective control of the epidemic and reducing mortality.

WHO urges all Member States to:
- Ensure that routine immunization coverage with MVC1 and MVC2 is at least 95%.
- Conduct high-quality mass measles immunization campaigns in countries with low vaccine coverage, optimizing opportunities for integration.
-Ensure high-quality measles case-based surveillance as a critical strategy for outbreak control, early detection and confirmation of measles cases to ensure timely and proper case management to reduce morbidity and mortality and enable implementation of appropriate public health strategies to control further transmission.
- In countries that are in the elimination phase, provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to stop transmission.
- Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children above 6 months of age diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (2 doses of 50 000 IU for children <6 months of age, 100 000 IU for children 6-12 months of age, or 200 000 IU for children 12-59 months of age, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).

https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria-posts-record-12341-measles-infections-in-12-months/


Nigeria posted a record 12 341 cases of measles in past 12 months, with global incidence increasing by 79% in the first 2 months of 2022, according to latest report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF).

The 2 global agencies in a statement yesterday [27 Apr 2022] said Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia had been confirmed as countries with largest outbreaks. A breakdown shows that Nigeria, with 12 341 reported cases in the last 12 months, is closely followed by Somalia with 9068 infections, Yemen 3629, Afghanistan 3628, and Ethiopia with 3039 incidents.

Both organisations said a spike in infections between January and February this year [2022] was a disturbing sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases and could trigger larger outbreaks, with millions of children at risk.

The United Nations agencies said pandemic-related disruptions, increasing inequalities in access to vaccines and diversion of resources from routine immunisation were exposing many children to vaccine-preventable ailments. Danger for large outbreaks has increased as communities relax social distancing and other preventive measures against COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic.

Almost 17 338 were reported in the 2 months under review globally, compared to the 9665 cases in the corresponding months. UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell, said: "Measles is more than a dangerous and potentially deadly disease. It is also an early indication that there are gaps in our global immunisation coverage, gaps vulnerable children cannot afford.

"It is encouraging that people in many communities are beginning to feel protected enough from COVID-19 to return to more social activities. But doing so in places where children are not receiving routine vaccination creates the perfect storm for the spread of a disease like measles."

In 2020, 23 million children missed basic childhood vaccines through routine health services, the highest since 2009 and 3.7 million more than 2019 figures.

As of April 2022, the agencies report 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks worldwide in the last 12 months. Most of the cases were reported in Africa and the East Mediterranean region. The figures are likely higher as the pandemic has disrupted surveillance systems globally, with potential under-reporting.

Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: "The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunisation services. Health systems have been overwhelmed, and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases, including measles. For many other diseases, the impact of these disruptions to immunization services will be felt for decades to come."

A total of 132 people have lost their lives due to contracting measles, out of 6259 cases recorded as of 24 Apr 2022 throughout the Republic of Congo, Congolese Health Minister Gilbert Mokoki said Thursday [28 Apr 2022]. According to the minister, the region of Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of the country, is the epicenter of the epidemic, with 5488 cases reported including 112 deaths since the beginning of 2022. "Most of these deaths occurred among people admitted late to care centers," the Congolese health minister said.

The Health Ministry has implemented actions to raise awareness among the population of the presumptive signs of measles and early use of the health service, said the minister. The Congolese government has taken measures to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and routine vaccination. "The government is taking all necessary measures to respond to these health emergencies and urges the population to use the nearest health services in the face of any suspected case of measles," Mokoki said.

Last April [2021], the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that several African countries could experience an outbreak of measles amid stalled vaccination against the viral disease due to disruptions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

[4] Measles as a warning

A nearly 80% jump in the number of measles cases worldwide could trigger larger outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease, the World Health Organization and UNICEF warned on Wednesday [27 Apr 2022]. Almost 17 338 measles cases were reported worldwide in January and February 2022 compared to 9665 during the first 2 months of 2021, largely due to insufficient vaccine coverage, according to the organizations.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted immunization services, health systems have been overwhelmed, and we are now seeing a resurgence of deadly diseases including measles," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. "Now is the moment to get essential immunization back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines."

The Guardian reports that officials fear that outbreaks of other diseases could follow. "Measles is what we call the tracer, or the canary in the coal mine, that really shows us where those weaknesses in the immunization system are," Christopher Gregory, UNICEF's senior health advisor for immunization, is quoted as saying, adding that yellow fever could surge next after rising cases were reported in Africa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Measles cases surge nearly 80% in wake of COVID chaos, with fears other diseases could follow."

"The coronavirus pandemic has interrupted vaccination campaigns for non-COVID diseases around the world, creating a 'perfect storm' that could put millions of children's lives at risk, the UN's children's agency UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.

"Measles is a disease caused by a virus that attacks mainly children. The most serious complications include blindness, brain swelling, diarrhoea, and severe respiratory infections. Vaccination uptake of at least 95% is the best way to avoid it spreading, though many countries fall far short of that goal -- Somalia is at just 46%, according to the UN data.

"Globally, more than 17 300 measles cases were reported in January and February (2022), compared with about 9600 during those months last year (2021), according to new data from the UN agencies. There have been 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks in the 12 months to April, most of them in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the data showed."

"There are also fears that the war in Ukraine could spark a resurgence in the country after it recorded Europe's highest rate of measles between 2017 and 2019. [Christopher] Gregory [senior health adviser in UNICEF's immunisation section] said that it had been very difficult to keep track of any disease in Ukraine since the war began, adding that the biggest concern was 'what we could be missing.'

"The UN agencies said that 57 vaccination campaigns in 43 countries postponed at the start of the pandemic had still not been completed, affecting 203 million people -- most of them children. COVID also continues to pile pressure on healthcare facilities and drag staffing and attention away from vaccination for longstanding deadly diseases. 'The impact of these disruptions to immunisation services will be felt for decades to come,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.

"'Now is the moment to get essential immunisation back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.'

"Gregory said it was time to put childhood immunisation on 'at least the same level of priority as finishing COVID vaccination.'"

Note that among other vaccine-preventable diseases that may surge, there already are increasing numbers of cases of yellow fever reported in Africa (see, for example, ProMED post Yellow fever - Africa (08): Uganda, WHO 20220427.8702872). A total of 13 African countries reported new yellow fever outbreaks in 2021, compared to 9 in 2020 and 3 in 2019, according to WHO Africa (https://www.afro.who.int/news/vaccine-preventable-disease-outbreaks-rise-africa). - Mod.LK]
