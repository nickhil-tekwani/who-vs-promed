The original version of this column was amended to reflect an error on the University of Guelph's Kemptville campus accepting specimens for testing.

Bad news always travels fast.
It started a week ago when our daughter came home from working at Bob-T Tack Shop ... Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is in North Glengarry and she had been talking to a woman whose horse had been confirmed with it after it was euthanized and the brain sent for examination. This was quickly followed by random conversations with our horse vet who operates out of Vankleek Hill, a local media story, and information from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit and the human implications of EEE in this newspaper [Cornwall Standard Freeholder], all of which confirmed the story.

At this point the number of horses either confirmed or highly suspect of having EEE appears to be 17, all cases but 3 in North Glengarry. Those 3 are in South Glengarry. The University of Guelph is no longer accepting specimens for testing for free as they have now deemed the area to be active with EEE. The Kemptville campus continues to accept specimens for an undisclosed fee.

A bit more than a slight outbreak it would seem though the number of unvaccinated horses is probably at a high right now with the economy being tight and various charity refuges pushing their horses and ponies of dubious and/or unknown history on unknowledgeable and uninformed horse lovers who either don't know or can't afford yearly vaccinations.

EEE, an acute inflammation of the brain, raises its head every year in small hot spots around eastern North America. It is carried by birds and 2 species of mosquitos which feed on the birds' blood spread it, which is why consistent fly spray and mosquito reduction/eradication programs are so vital. The cycle is halted by a hard frost which kills the mosquitos, but the disease lives on in the birds for next year.

Horses first show signs 1 to 3 weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The 1st sign is usually a very high fever, as high as 106 deg F [41.1 deg C] which lasts 24 to 48 hours (a horse's normal temperature is about 100-102 deg F/37.8-38.9 deg C). As the brain becomes infected, the horse shows sensitivity to noise and has periods of unexplained excitement or restlessness. As the disease progresses a horse may exhibit any or all of the following: drowsiness, droopy ears, circling, aimless wandering, head pressing, inability to swallow and stumbling or abnormal gaits. The final sign is paralysis and death, usually within 2-4 days of the 1st clinical signs. Mortality can be as high as 90 percent in an outbreak, but most caring owners have their horses euthanized well before the disease takes them naturally. It is just too hard to watch one's friend and companion suffer.

Obviously, there is no cure for EEE nor its close relative Western equine encephalitis (WEE), however there is a good vaccine available which offers your horse or pony a much better chance when the disease is in your area and its use is commonplace among all responsible horse owners. A yearly shot (2 the 1st year, as a booster is required 6 weeks after the 1st) using a common combined vaccine protects your horse against not only EEE and WEE, but also rabies, tetanus and West Nile (WNV) -- all 3 of which are also incurable -- as well as equine flu and rhinopneumonitis -- both curable, but treatment and recovery is long and expensive.

While it may seem expensive, about CAD 98 [USD 90] per horse per year plus the cost of the vet visit, it can save your horse from a horrible death and save you, the owner, from the guilt trip of "If only I had...." In the long run, a small price to pay for insurance against these horrible diseases.

[Animal owners need to be responsible and take care of their animals, especially including vaccines to prevent these diseases. Many of the diseases mentioned in the article are fatal to the horse, but rabies, especially, is preventable. Furthermore, rabies is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from the horse to the human through saliva or a bite (which happens with some rabid horses), and is a fatal disease in almost all human beings.

If you own a horse, protecting it from EEE, WNV, rabies, tetanus, equine flu and rhinopneumonitis are fundamental responsibilities, as surely as feed, water, and shelter.
