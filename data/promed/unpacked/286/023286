A suspected anthrax death led the Delhi Zoo to close its rhinoceros enclosure for public view on Tuesday [1 May 2012].

Fears of anthrax were sparked when doctors conducting the postmortem of a young male Indian rhinoceros, who died on Friday [27 Apr 2012] night, recommended that samples be tested for anthrax infection as a possible cause of death. Zoo officials, however, said the chances of the cause of death being anthrax infection are slim, as the workers and other animals in the enclosure have not developed any symptoms of the disease. The other animals of the enclosure have been isolated as a precautionary measure.

"The animal's blood samples, along with samples of food, have been sent for testing to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly [See [2] below.]. The results are awaited. The other rhinos of the enclosure have been isolated as a precautionary measure and are being observed. We have not noticed any symptoms in the other animals or the zoo workers. It is highly unlikely that the cause of death was anthrax, but we are awaiting results of the tests for confirmation," said R A Khan, curator of Delhi Zoo.

The 3.5-year-old rhino, named Junior Raja, the only male among the 3 rhinos at the zoo, died on Friday [27 Apr 2012]. A post-mortem examination was conducted on Sunday and the body cremated after samples were taken. The results of the anthrax test are expected to come in 4-5 days, zoo officials said.

"A team from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases was called in, and all their recommendations have been put in place. The entire cage has been disinfected, and all the employees are being administered antibiotics to resist any possible infection," Khan said.

On Tuesday [1 May 2012] morning, officials closed off the path that leads to the rhinoceros enclosure, although the zoo is open. "We are prepared to contain the disease if it is detected. Anthrax is a controllable disease, and all precautions have already been taken. There is no cause for worry," the curator said. He said Delhi Zoo has not received any animals in exchange that could have brought in the infection.

With the initial findings of National Zoological Park confirming anthrax as the cause of death of the young rhino, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has issued an alert to zoos across the country. The CZA has also issued an immediate action plan for the Delhi Zoo and instructed it to come up with a detailed action plan about its preparedness to deal with the crisis.

A team comprising veterinary doctor of the zoo Dr N Panneer Selvam, Dr NVK Ashraf of the Wildlife Trust of India, zoo consultant Dr Mangola and zoo laboratory assistant Rakesh Sharma was conducting the post-mortem of the dead rhino. The initial report submitted by the Delhi Zoo to the CZA says: "Initial microscopic examination from the blood confirms the presence of anthrax."

The food and blood samples of the animal have been sent to the national referral centre of the CZA, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly. Meanwhile, the CZA has written to the chief wildlife wardens of all the states and union territories and to all zoo directors and curators across the country to closely monitor the health of their animals and to ensure that their animals were healthy.

The zoos all over the country have been advised to put in place a preventive action plan, identify risk factors, and closely monitor the health of all inmates. "This is a precautionary measure by the CZA. The other zoos need to be more watchful to ensure that the animals remain in good health," said Dr BK Gupta, Monitoring Officer of the CZA.

A separate action plan has also been sent to the Delhi Zoo, where the rhino died. In the letter to the Delhi Zoo, member secretary of the CZA BS Bonal has instructed the Delhi Zoo to come up with a detailed action plan in preparedness in case of a possible outbreak of anthrax. The zoo has been asked to take assistance from IVRI, to disinfect its premises, and ensure that the infection did not spread to other animals or staff at the zoo.

Delhi Zoo authorities have been instructed to burn the carcass of the rhino after wrapping it in a thick plastic sheet with adequate disinfectants to avoid spread of infection. The CZA has also directed the Delhi Zoo to spray disinfectants at constant intervals to keep the scavengers and flies away from the zoo to contain infection. "We have asked the Delhi Zoo to pull up their socks and put their plan in action. We have asked the zoo to close the rhino enclosure and constantly monitor the 2 rhinos currently living in it," added Bonal.

[At this time, it appears that the initial clinical diagnosis has been confirmed on the basis of a stained blood smear. These, in experienced hands, are usually reliable, but it is always wise to have laboratory confirmation.

In the early decades of the 19th century, all UK diagnoses of anthrax were based on stained blood smears; as a veterinary student in the 1950s, every vet I "saw practice" with had a spirit lamp, slides, stain, and a microscope with him on farm visits. But when the British government insisted on laboratory confirmation at the newly established Central Veterinary Laboratory at New Haw, the annual incidence of this disease dropped by 20 percent.

Anthrax has been diagnosed in a range of wildlife species in zoos and in the bush [see: M.E. Hugh-Jones & V. de Vos. 2002. Anthrax and wildlife. O.I.E. Scientific & Technical Review 21 (2): 359-383] but rarely in rhinoceri; see below for a confirmed case in Assam in 2008 and one in Kenya in 2001.

How this Delhi rhinoceros acquired this singular infection -- no other animals in the Delhi zoo were affected, or so it would appear from the reports -- makes it very puzzling. The commonest zoological garden cases arise in carnivores and scavenger species carelessly fed on dead animals provided by knackers/renderers. But rhinos are grazers. If it were from a contaminated feed, there would have been other cases. If it were from contaminated groundwater, there would have been parallel cases. This leaves us with the possibility of flies coming from feeding on an infected carcass in the neighborhood of the zoo. Indian towns and cities are the perfect example of "rus in urbis" [country in the city], as they are rife with livestock. On this topic, there is an interesting paper from Kerala of a similar event, this time in a jaguar: P. K. Abdulla, P. C. James, S. Sulochana, V. Jayaprakasan, R. M. Pillai, 1982. Anthrax in a Jaguar (_Panthera onca_), The Journal of Zoo Animal Medicine, Vol. 13, No. 4 (December 1982), p. 151. Here, they claimed that the meat fed had been tested and certified, plus no other carnivores in the zoo were affected.

In the meantime, we await the results of any investigations by the veterinary authorities in Delhi and of the laboratory confirmation.
