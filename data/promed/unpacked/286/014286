Julie Beardsley's comment on the impact of changing food practices by
tradional practioners has a parallel example in New Zealand. The only
known cases of botulism ever to be recorded here occurred following
consumption of a traditional Maori food. The food known as "tiroi"
consists of mussels and puha, a green leafy plant. After varying degrees
of cooking (depending on the preparer) the two ingredients are combined,
sometimes with added salt, and placed in a jar for several days. It is
not known at this stage if any significant fermentation takes place. The
cases followed consumption of tiroi made by a nurse who had gone to some
length to ensure that the food was prepared hygienically and stored
refrigerated with air excluded. These factors may have provided the
ideal condition for the botulism, in contrast to the traditional methods
and conditions.
