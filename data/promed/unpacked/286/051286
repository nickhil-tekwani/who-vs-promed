Ferrero has recalled some of its products and the HSE and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have issued public health warnings.

A total of 5 people who became ill in Ireland due to a salmonellosis outbreak linked to Kinder chocolate products had to be hospitalized, according to a report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Kinder products have been recalled across Europe due to links to a significant _Salmonella_ outbreak at Italian confectionery company Ferrero's factory in Belgium last December 2021.

In an update published on [Tue 12 Apr 2022], the ECDC said there have 150 cases across Europe linked to the outbreak. The majority of infections are among children younger than 10, the ECDC said, with many of them requiring hospitalisation. The reported number of cases more than doubled within 3 weeks, from 57 cases in 5 countries on [18 Mar 2022] to 150 cases in 10 countries on [8 Apr 2022.] The increase is "most notable" in France, Ireland, and the UK, the update added.

There have been 15 confirmed cases in Ireland, of which 33% were hospitalized. In the UK, 65 cases have been confirmed with 43% of these being hospitalized, while in France, there have been 25 confirmed cases, with about half being hospitalized.

According to the ECDC, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium was detected in a buttermilk tank at the factory in Arlon in Belgium during the manufacturer's own checks in December [2021]. After implementing hygiene measures and negative _Salmonella_ testing, it then distributed the chocolate products across Europe and globally. However, at the end of March [2022], upon the availability of sequencing data, scientists linked human cases to Belgium through advanced molecular typing techniques.

Ferrero has since recalled some of its products and shut the factory while the HSE and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland issued public health warnings. Ferrero has extended its recall of Kinder products to include all best before dates. Specific products it listed for recall include Kinder Surprise (20g and 100g); Kinder Mini Eggs (75g); Kinder Egg Hunt Kit (150g); and Kinder Schokobons (all sizes).

[It is curious that the hygiene measures and negative _Salmonella_ testing done still resulted in this large outbreak. The initial internal source appears to be a buttermilk tank and indeed _Salmonella_ can be spread by unpasteurized dairy products. The products have been recalled in North America and parts of Asia but no cases in these areas have yet been reported. The high number of hospitalizations in this outbreak suggests the potential for a more virulent strain but many mild cases may go unreported. - Mod.LL
