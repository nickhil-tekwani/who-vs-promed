One horse in Tom Green county, Texas was confirmed positive for vesicular stomatitis [VSV], with 5 others exposed.

The USDA reported a rescue facility with 2 horses and 4 donkeys on site has a positive horse for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

One horse presented with lesions of unknown onset date, and there are no reported movements or contact with outside animals within the past 6 months. The affected horse has been isolated from the other animals, and the premises is currently quarantined. Epidemiological investigation on this premises is ongoing.

As was previously reported, vesicular stomatitis virus was confirmed in the U.S. for the 1st time in 2019 in horses on a Kinney County, Texas premises on 12 Jun 2019. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the virus on that premises as the Indiana serotype.

Information for this report was provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center.

[On 24 Jun 2019, the NVSL confirmed VSV infection (Indiana serotype) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a lesioned horse on a 2nd premises located in Tom Green County, Texas. The epidemiological investigation on the 2nd premises is ongoing, and the PCR-positive result meets case definition for a subsequent case of VSV in an affected state. The 2nd affected premises is located nearly 200 miles due north of the index premises. The index premises was also Indiana serotype.

VSV-Indiana serotype has not been diagnosed in the U.S. since 1998; all VSV cases from 2004-2016 have been VSV-New Jersey serotype. [North Carolina Veterinary Newsletter]

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease caused by 2 distinct serotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus: New Jersey and Indiana. Vesiculation, ulceration, and erosion of the oral and nasal mucosa and epithelial surface of the tongue, coronary bands, and teats are typically seen in clinical cases, along with crusting lesions of the muzzle, ventral abdomen, and sheath. Clinical disease has been seen in cattle, horses, and pigs and very rarely in sheep, goats, and llamas. Serologic evidence of exposure has been found in many species, including cervids, nonhuman primates, rodents, birds, dogs, antelope, and bats.

Vesicular stomatitis is seen sporadically in the USA. Outbreaks historically occurred in all regions of the country but since the 1980s have been limited to western states and occur seasonally, usually May through October. Outbreaks occurred in the USA in 1995, 1997, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2012. The largest outbreak in the past decade occurred in 2005 and affected nine states. Vesicular stomatitis viruses are endemic in South America, Central America, and parts of Mexico but have not been seen naturally outside the Western hemisphere. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals with clinical disease (those with lesions) or by blood-feeding insects. In the southwestern USA, black flies (_Simulidae_) are the most likely biologic insect vector. In endemic areas, sand flies (_Lutzomyia_) are proven biologic vectors. Other insects may act as mechanical vectors. Exposure to insects that carry the virus is often associated with nearby moving water sources such as creeks or rivers or irrigation of pastures. Experimental studies have shown that feeding of infected insects on mucosal surfaces and non-haired areas of the body were more often associated with development of lesions at those sites than if insects fed on haired areas of the body. The prevalence of clinical cases in a herd is generally low (10-20 percent), but seroprevalence within the herd may approach 100 percent. Viremia has not been detected in livestock species that exhibit clinical signs of vesicular stomatitis, although experimental studies have shown transmission of virus, presumably via lymphatics, between co-feeding black flies on cattle. Virus is routinely isolated from active lesions in affected animals, and these lesions serve as a source of virus spread by direct contact and contamination of shared feed and water stations. Many vertebrate species have serologic evidence of exposure and may serve as reservoirs of infection. No definitive reservoir or amplifying host of vesicular stomatitis viruses in the USA has been identified.

No specific treatment is available or warranted. Cachexia can be avoided by providing softened feeds. Cleansing lesions with mild antiseptics may help avoid secondary bacterial infections. Management factors suggested to reduce risk of exposure to the virus include limiting time on pasture during insect season, providing shelters or barns during insect feeding times, and implementing other procedures that reduce animal contact with insects, such as application of insecticides. This should include application to the inner surface of the pinna, where black flies feed. If livestock need to be kept on pasture during outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis, then keeping them pastured away from moving surface water (such as streams, irrigation canals, or rivers) may reduce the risk of exposure to _Vesiculovirus_. Affected animals should be isolated, and movement of other animals from the affected premises restricted. Vesicular stomatitis is a reportable disease in most areas, including the USA, so state and federal animal health officials must be notified when it is suspected. Commercially produced vaccines are not available in the USA, but vaccines for livestock are available in some Latin American countries.

This VSV season looks like it may be starting off with a rush, with 2 cases confirmed 200 miles apart in approximately 24 hours.

Use appropriate fly and mosquito sprays intended for horses to help your animal avoid these biting insects.

As a reminder, if you are traveling, consult your veterinarian, who may contact the state of destination to see whether their import requirements have changed due to VSV now being found in the United States. Many states are requiring additional statements being added to export Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI or ICVI), and some states are requiring permit numbers. - Mod.TG
