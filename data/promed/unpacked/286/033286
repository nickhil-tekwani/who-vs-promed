I have never seen monkeypox, but I have seen rare cases of smallpox and plenty of chickenpox in adults, particularly on dark skin. All smallpox lesions appear about the same stage of development from vesicles to large umbilicated lesions: one crop -- all lesions at the same stage of development. The umbilicated lesions tend to be very large in diameter.

Chickenpox lesions, on the other hand, appear in crops -- about 5 or 6 crops are common. The accompanying photograph [not included here] is typical of chickenpox, showing at least 5 crops or lesions in 5 stages -- all in one picture. That is typical, but then the descriptions I have read and pictures seen of monkeypox tell me that lesions of the 2 closely resemble each other.

The flowery description of the early vesicle of chickenpox as a "dew drop on rose petal" is never seen on dark skin, only on fair skin. That applies only to the 2nd stage of rash, and the dew drop is the small vesicle that progresses to "pustule" stage. So the appearance of lesions does not help in distinguishing between the 2 -- monkeypox and varicella.

We need virological confirmation to break the tie. However, epidemiology helps.

The rapid spread and high contagiousness are more like varicella than monkeypox. Senegal is not a monkeypox-prone country, going by past experience. While there is panic, apparently death is either rare or absent -- that almost rules out monkeypox.

All in all, while waiting for virology, clinically this is varicella -- and I agree with the "Whitecoat" conclusion. In India, varicella affects adults more often than in temperate countries. The median age of varicella in Europe and North America before vaccination became popular was in pre-school age, whereas in India it was in adolescence. My own varicella case was when I was 25. Annual outbreaks of varicella used to be a feature in our hospital before the wide use of varicella vaccine.

[ProMED thanks Professor T. Jacob John for his valuable comments. We agree that the most likely diagnosis is chickenpox. We have been informed that material has been sent to the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal, and are looking forward to a final diagnosis. - Mod.EP
