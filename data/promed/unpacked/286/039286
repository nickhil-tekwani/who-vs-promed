The prairie wolf found dead near Lawrenceville was rabid, but testing
suggests he got the disease from a rabid raccoon -- a far more common
carrier of the fatal disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Wednesday
[9 May 2007] that a coyote found dead on the property of its Lawrenceville
facility had tested positive for a strain of rabies commonly associated
with raccoons. [Commonly called the raccoon strain of rabies. - Mod.TG] CDC
didn't suggest that the animal had spread the disease, but wanted to remind
the public of the danger of rabies with raccoons, foxes and -- as recently
discovered in [the city of] Norcross -- coyotes are becoming more common in
the suburbs.
That doesn't mean homeowners need to start shooting every coyote or raccoon
on sight; but it does mean people need to be careful around wild animals
and ensure their pets don't bring home rabies, said Cherie Drenzek, a
veterinarian with the Georgia Division of Public Health. "Wildlife rabies
is endemic to Georgia, meaning we have a lot of it," she said. "Wild
animals should be left alone, and, because our domestic animals form the
barrier between wild animals and humans, it is important that pets get
vaccinated."
She said the state identifies about 300 wild animals a year as infected
with rabies -- and in the last 5 years, only 5 of those have been coyotes.
That doesn't necessarily mean that it is uncommon for coyotes to have the
disease, but the state only tests wild animals that have come into contact
with humans or domesticated animals, which may explain why more cases of
rabies have been found in raccoons, skunks, and foxes. "We'll probably see
more," she said. "As the suburbs sprawl, coyotes are more likely to
encounter people."
CDC suggests that anyone bit or scratched by a wild animal should wash the
wound and [consult a] doctor. A vaccination in a series of 5 shots given
over 28 days can prevent the rabies virus from developing into the fatal
disease that infects the central nervous system.
