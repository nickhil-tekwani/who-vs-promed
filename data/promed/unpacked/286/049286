Six childcare centres and 2 kindergartens in Singapore have been identified as hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) clusters.

The 1249 cases of HFMD from [29 Jul-4 Aug 2018] is also the highest reported in a week this year, almost 1.5 times the 868 cases at the same time last year [2017], according to Ministry of Health figures. There have also been slightly more cases caused by the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), a more virulent strain behind the recent deaths of 2 children in Malaysia.

In an update on its website last [Fri 10 Aug 2018] MOH [listed] the 6 childcare centres and 2 kindergartens with HFMD clusters [see source URL above]. None of them has been closed due to the outbreak.

A cluster occurs when a pre-school reports more than 10 HFMD cases or an "attack rate" higher than 13 per cent and a transmission period of more than 16 days. The attack rate refers to the proportion of children enrolled who are infected.

Replying to queries by The New Paper last [Fri 10 Aug 2018], MOH said the HFMD coxsackievirus type A remains the predominant strain in Singapore, as in previous years.

But its spokesman also said there has been a "slight increase" in the proportion of cases from the EV-A71 strain.

The spokesman also said the ministry is monitoring the HFMD situation in Malaysia.

The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) also issued an advisory on [1 Aug 2018] to remind all pre-schools to exercise vigilance and maintain good hygiene practices.

There is currently no cure for HFMD, with doctors treating only its symptoms such as fever and mouth ulcers.

Fatal infections are rare, with 8 reported cases since 2000, all caused by EV-A71, The Straits Times reported earlier this year [2018].

Dr Asok Kurup from the Infectious Disease Care clinic said that while EV-A71 can cause neurological disease, it is not a new strain and is not more infectious than other strains.

Dr Jacqueline Chung, senior principal of St James' Church Kindergarten, said: "We send out an advisory whenever a case occurs reminding parents to check their children for symptoms of HFMD.

"We also step up the cleaning of our premises. Teachers play their part by raising the children's awareness of their personal hygiene. We are thankful that parents have been understanding and cooperative."

"It is really tough and almost impossible to avoid cross infections in such environments.

"Simple things like washing of hands, not putting their fingers into the mouth, carrying hand sanitisers around is important in maintaining good hygiene."

Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a genotype within the species enterovirus A, genus _Enterovirus_, family Picornaviridae. The virus is one of the most common etiologies of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in children. EV-A71 associated disease is usually mild with children typically recovering within 4-6 days. However, the virus has been associated with fulminant disease during large outbreaks in many parts of the world.

Abstract
--------
"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) was first identified in California in 1969 and described in 1974 by Schmidt et al. Since then it has been implicated in more than 10 small and large outbreaks worldwide. Wide epidemic of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), generally benign, occurred in Japan in 1973 and 1978. Important outbreaks with brain stem encephalitis and high mortality rates have been described in Europe in the 1970s (Bulgaria and Hungary in 1975 and 1978 respectively), in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998 and in Asia-Pacific region, including China and Korea. Recently, EV-A71 epidemics have been reported in European countries, such as the Netherlands, France, Spain. EV-A71 infection causes hand-foot-mouth disease, herpangina, fever, and usually resolves spontaneously and do not need specific treatment, however, can sometimes induces a variety of neurological complications, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema, and acute flaccid paralysis that can be fatal. In this review we focus on enterovirus A71 infections, summarizing that one's occurred in Europe which have raised particular concern about the potential emergence of EV-A71 as a worldwide health threat." - Mod.LK]

Hospitals across the country are reporting outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease, a contagious disease caused by a group of viruses. Symptoms of this highly contagious viral disease include fever, red sores of the hands, mouth, and feet, and sore throat.

Children under the age of 5 that attend daycare or preschool are especially susceptible to hand-foot-mouth disease.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is more of a concern in the summer. Sore throats and blisters in the mouth could prevent kids from eating and drinking. Dehydration is the most commonly reported complication of the disease.

Adults can contract hand-foot-mouth disease, but it is more common in children who have not yet developed an immunity to common viruses. There is no treatment for hand-foot-mouth disease. Symptoms can be managed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Hand-foot-mouth disease typically runs its course within less than a week. Keep your child away from other children if they develop a fever or blisters. The disease spreads easily, resulting in localized outbreaks.

Virginia is seeing a rise in hand-foot-mouth disease this summer [2018], with as many as 10 cases a night being reported in one emergency room.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is spread through nose and throat secretions, feces, and blister fluid. According to the Center for Disease Control, parents should wash their hands thoroughly after changing diapers, avoid touching your face, avoid sharing utensils with sick children, and refrain from hugging or kissing sick children.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a very common ailment that affects hundred of thousands of people every single year.

Part of the reason it's so very common is that it is highly contagious, and can spread easily from contact with saliva or mucus. Though the symptoms of the virus are usually mild, there can be serious side effects, especially in people with weakened immune systems from another illness or from age.

In some rare cases, HFMD can lead to serious brain infections like meningitis and encephalitis.

More commonly, kids who don't shake the symptoms for a few weeks may lose some of their fingernails or toenails.
