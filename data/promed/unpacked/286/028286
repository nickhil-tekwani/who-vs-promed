Florida's fourth human case of West Nile virus encephalitis confirmed
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: The Florida Department of Health announced today that the
fourth human encephalitis case caused by the West Nile virus (WNV) has been
confirmed. The case is a 73 year old woman from Sarasota County, who is
believed to have contracted the disease while visiting Marathon in the
Florida Keys last month. A medical alert is now in effect for Monroe County.
According to acting state epidemiologist Dr Steven Wiersma, it is not
unexpected that this virus has been found in south Florida. "Although it
might seem unusual that WNV has now been found in the extreme southern part
of Florida, this is consistent with migratory bird patterns. We will
intensify our surveillance for human and dead bird cases in south Florida
and will continue to provide regular updates." So far, there have been 4
confirmed human cases of WNV encephalitis and 2 confirmed cases of Eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) in Florida.
The medical alert is currently in effect for 34 Florida counties, including
Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval,
Escambia, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Holmes, Jackson,
Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Monroe, Nassau,
Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Wakulla, Walton,
and Washington counties.

Marathon case may be sign virus is spreading faster
---------------------------------------------------
The mosquito-borne West Nile virus [WNV, which has set off medical alerts
all over northern Florida, infected a woman while she was vacationing in
Marathon, state health officials said on Fri 24 Aug 2001. The 73 year old
woman, who developed symptoms of West Nile encephalitis after returning
home to Sarasota County, had visited Marathon in July, where health
authorities believe she was infected. The woman was admitted to hospital in
Sarasota on 5 Aug 2001 suffering from confusion, swollen lymph glands,
headaches, and a high fever. She recovered and was discharged a week later.
The time-frame in which doctors think the woman contracted the virus
(between 8 and 23 Jul 2001) may be a sign that WNV is spreading faster than
state health experts originally predicted. "It may be that [the virus has
been in the Keys and other places in South Florida for a while without us
picking it up," said Carina Blackmore, a regional epidemiologist with the
Florida Department of Health.
The Sarasota woman is the fourth person in Florida to contract encephalitis
as a result of the virus. Health officials confirmed the first case, a 73
year old man, in Madison County on 23 Jul 2001. There are other signs,
state health officials say, that the virus, which is passed from mosquitoes
to birds and back then passed on to animals and humans, may have arrived in
Florida earlier than they had originally surmised. The first bird tested
positive for the disease in Florida in Jefferson County, in North Florida,
last month. But, after WNV showed up in humans, researchers went back and
tested a red shouldered hawk found dead in Leon County on 2 Jun 2001. In
mid-to-late July, the hawk was tested and came back positive for the virus.
"We now know we had virus activity in the state possibly as early as early
June or maybe earlier," Blackmore said.
Friday's announcement, made after state medical tests came back Thursday
confirming the woman was infected, were not a surprise to those who have
been tracking the virus. "We know that bird migration is important for the
spread of this virus, and the Keys are a staging ground for the southerly
migration of these birds," said Dr Steven Wiersma, acting state
epidemiologist. "That leads us to believe that it would make sense that the
virus would be amplified in the Keys."
