International plant health body adopts new global standards
-----------------------------------------------------------
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)'s governing body, the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM) adopted new global standards to help ensure that the international trade in plants and seeds is safer. The rapid growth in agricultural trade via online marketplaces is making it harder to ensure that all shipments are free from bugs and diseases.

Of particular concern is the threat of pest transmission posed by seeds. Unlike other agricultural products destined for consumption, seeds are for planting, [thus] there is a greater risk that any pests they carry could establish themselves and spread. Addressing these risks presents a highly complex task. By proposing approaches to risk assessment and testing, the new standard will help harmonize the international seed trade.

The IPPC is the only organization to set government-recognized plant health standards. "These standards, which are built on consensus, are the most effective way to prevent the introduction and spread of plant pests to new environments, and avoid devastating impacts on plants as well as biodiversity, food security and trade," said Jingyuan Xia, IPPC Secretary.

The CPM further considered guidelines for a regulatory system and a series of treatments that stop pests from burrowing into wooden packaging and methods to stop fruit flies.

[Worldwide, there are many examples, past and current, of devastation of agricultural and environmental systems by introduction of plant pathogens or new strains of existing pathogens. Exotic pathogens often have an ecological advantage since natural control factors and host resistance are absent from the new environment. Eradication of pathogens that have become established is hardly ever successful.

Many incursions have been, and are, due to reckless commercial interests, political short sightedness or public indifference. Strict and science based biosecurity systems on both national and international levels are vital to limit additional disasters and protect the planet's plant life as the basis for any animal and human life.
