Bovine TB has been identified in pigs kept on 3 farms in Wales in
recent months, highlighting the fact that pigs are also susceptible to
the disease. According to the Welsh Assembly, investigations are
underway to establish whether any other pig herds linked to the
incidents are infected.

Animal health officials say that pigs kept outdoors in areas where TB
is prevalent in cattle and wildlife are likely to be at increased risk
of exposure to infection than those which are housed. Compared with
infected cattle, however, pigs are far less likely to transmit
infection to other animals. Although pigs can be skin tested, TB
testing of pigs is not undertaken routinely, with slaughterhouse
surveillance being the main way of detecting the infection.

The carcasses of all slaughtered pigs are routinely examined by Food
Standards Agency staff at abattoirs and Veterinary Laboratories Agency
premises when lesions suspected of being due to TB are detected in a
carcass.

Further infected pigs have been identified on the farms concerned by
follow up TB testing.

There is a legal obligation on herd owners and vets to report any
suspected cases of TB to their local animal health office.

A leading vet says the rare case of a pig with bovine TB in Cornwall
does not mean the industry is on the verge of a major outbreak.

Government vets are still examining the source of the disease in 2
pigs and some piglets on a farm near Bodmin. But Andy Biggs, president
of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said the evidence so far
showed the disease had been confined to the farm.

There is no risk of bovine TB spreading to humans.

Bovine TB in pigs is so rare that the State Veterinary Service only
made it a notifiable disease last month [June 2011].

Mr Biggs said the most likely source of infection was from the pigs
eating an infected dead animal. He told BBC's Farming Today programme:
"The likely route would be oral because of lesions on the head of the
pigs, and an infected wildlife carcass would seem to be the logical
route of entry into those pigs. Badgers are in the frame, but there
has been other work with other wildlife vectors. I don't want to point
the finger at badgers." He said it was "highly unlikely" that the
disease, which is widespread among cattle in the West Country, would
spread to the wider pig population. He said: "It sounds like a point
source infection. It is a very rare occurrence, but we can use it as
an indicator that the wildlife reservoir of bovine TB is such now that
it is spilling over into other species."

The Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra)
is looking at a number of possible sources, including infected
wildlife and unpasteurised milk from other farms.

Farmer Martin Appleton has been forced to slaughter his herd of
Gloucester Old Spots, and animal movements from his farm have been
placed under restriction.

He said: "It is very confusing. I don't understand where it came from
or how we got it."

[Although cattle are considered to be the true hosts of _M. bovis_,
infections have been reported worldwide in many domesticated and
non-domesticated animals.

The incidents of _M. bovis_ infection in non-bovine domestic animals
and wild deer in Great Britain, as confirmed by laboratory culture
since 1997, is presented at
http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/tb-otherspecies.pdf.
The following data, related to domestic non-bovine animals, in which
the incidence seems to be increasing, have been extracted from the
said official statistics:

Animal/2001/2002/2003/2004/2005/2006/2007/2008/2009/2010
Domestic cat/0/2/2/6/13/14/15/18/26/23
Domestic dog/0/1/0/1/0/0/1/1/3/2
Domestic pig/0/1/8/1/12/2/5/10/23/29
Alpaca/0/0/2/1/0/1/4/13/68/43
Sheep/0/1/0/3/2/0/0/1/5/13

The table also includes data on confirmed infections in deer (farmed,
park, wild), llama, goat, ferret and farmed wild boar. Cases in feral
wild boar have also been observed in the UK (archived post 20100522.1703).

As correctly stated in item 2 above, pigs appear to be infected
primarily by the ingestion route ("per os"). In addition to _M.
Bovis_, pigs are known to be infected by _M. avium complex_ and _M.
intracellulare_ .

Cats are also primarily infected by ingestion, but can be infected
also by the respiratory route or via percutaneous transmission in
bites and scratches. - Mod.AS]
