[The suspected FMD cases in wild boar, reported to be suspected in 20181201.6175417, have been confirmed.

The involvement of wild boar in FMD outbreaks affecting livestock along Israel's northern borders has long been suspected/hypothesized. Their population is particularly dense in the northern Galilee, the Golan heights, and the northern part of the Jordan Valley (namely, on both sides of Israel's borders with southern Lebanon, southwest Syria, and northwest Jordan). The current event is the 1st since 1992, when clinical cases were readily observed in wild boar, followed by virus isolation.

Porcine animals, wild boar included, are regarded very prolific FMD virus amplifiers and a possible source of airborne spread of the virus, which, in certain weather and surface conditions, may reach relatively long distances.

In April 1987, the Kimron Veterinary Institute carried out experimental infection trials in wild boar and domestic pigs, with a field strain of FMD virus serotype O. The animals were clinically affected. The domestic pigs recovered; the wild boar died (Annual Report of the Veterinary Services for 1987, page 101, Hebrew).

In the current event, it has not been established if wild boar were the source of infection in cattle or vice versa. The possible role of wild boar in FMD epidemiology in the eastern Mediterranean region, where FMD seems to present a seasonal pattern, is of concern to all countries in the region, warranting further studies. - Mod.AS
