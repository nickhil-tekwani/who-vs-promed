[Tunisia has not experienced outbreaks of FMD since 1999; its policy includes annual mass vaccinations of large and small ruminants. According to Tunisia's annual report for 2013, 3 731 517 sheep and goats and 413 651 cattle have been vaccinated during that year. In the past, cattle were annually vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine and small ruminants with a monovalent (FMDV-O) vaccine. Information on the strains included in the vaccines applied during 2013 will be helpful.

The rapid spread of the disease observed during the recent 10 days is concerning and may be indicative of deficient vaccination performance or the introduction of an FMDV serotype/strain against which the routinely applied vaccine is not protective. In the absence of serotyping results, it is not clear which vaccine strains are included in the "Vaccination in response to the outbreak."

Tunisia's geographical location is of significance to Europe. During the recent (8th) Joint Permanent Committee (JPC) meeting of the Animal Health Mediterranean Network (REMESA), held in Valetta, Malta (27-28 March 2014), it was reported that Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have been supplied with antibody detection ELISA kits (24 kits to Tunisia, 18 kits to Morocco, 15 kits to Algeria) according to their requests and surveillance programme 2014, for a total of 25 000 samples.

Serotyping and genotyping results of the Tunisian FMDV are anticipated at the soonest. - Mod.AS
