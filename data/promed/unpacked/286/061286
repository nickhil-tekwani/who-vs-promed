Cultivation of [peanut] crops has gradually dropped in Benue State. Saa Gbue, state chairman of National Groundnut Producers, Processors and Marketing Association (NGPPMA), blames poor yielding variety, lack of modern equipment and inability to control diseases affecting the crop.

A farmer says that the challenges are enormous, listing access [to] good seedlings and control of groundnut disease as crucial problems. The disease results in poor harvest and affects value of the crop.

The crop remains an important food in Nigeria. Farmers began to suffer hardship while the diseases infecting the crop aggravated over the years.

The disease, says Gbue, changes the colour of the seed, makes it bitter and rotten soon after harvest, thus reducing its value. He expressed confidence that if the federal government's initiative to introduce science-based innovations is successful, it would rapidly increase production.

[It is unclear from this report whether the problems are perceived to be due mainly to one major disease or an accumulation or interaction of several pathogens.

A large number of fungi are known to affect the crop; several viruses, nematodes, and a few bacterial/phytoplasma pathogens can also cause major diseases of peanuts. Low yielding crop varieties are also blamed above, and seed transmitted pathogens may have to be considered to play a possible role in this.

In order for management strategies to be able to be designed for the area, it will be vital to determine the cause of the problems, in particular which pathogen(s) may be involved.
