At least 22 cases of typhoid fever have been confirmed here in the Marshall
Islands capital of Majuro, and health authorities have issued repeated
warnings to local residents in an effort to halt further spread of the
potentially deadly illness. Doctors from the United States' Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention arrived here earlier this week to assist the
Ministry of Health in identifying the source of the typhoid.
The first case of typhoid was confirmed in mid-March 2006. But in June, the
number of cases began a sharp increase. There are typically 1 or 2 cases of
typhoid a year in the Marshall Islands, but the outbreak of at least 22
confirmed cases has been a great concern to health officials.
Public health's Dr Zachraias Zachraias said that, so far, the ministry has
been unable to identify the cause of the typhoid. Patients coming to Majuro
Hospital with typhoid have ranged in age from young children to adults and
from many different parts of the island with no common source of exposure,
he said. "We have cases from downtown to the airport (a 9-mile stretch of
the island) and we have not been able to find a single connection between
any of them," said Zachraias. "They are all different ages from 7 months to
30 years old. 4 are students, but they don't go to the same school."
Zachraias said that ongoing testing of food handlers was continuing, but
restaurants do not appear to be the source so far. Health secretary Justina
Langidrik said health officials are working with the Environmental
Protection Authority to implement strict requirements for individuals who
serve food to the public to have updated health certificates and regular
monitoring of the public water systems.

[The source of this outbreak is unclear at this point. The Republic of the
Marshall Islands consists of 29 atolls and 5 isolated islands. After almost
4 decades under US administration as the easternmost part of the UN Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence
in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association. A map of the islands showing
their location in of the Pacific can be found at:

The Eastern Cape health department has confirmed 2 deaths from typhoid in
Mqanduli. Officials from the health department have visited the area and
warned residents of the dangers of typhoid, and the precautions they should
take.
They have advised that all water should be boiled before drinking. Sizwe
Kupelo, the spokesperson for the Eastern Cape health department, says
further steps have been taken to prevent the disease from spreading.
