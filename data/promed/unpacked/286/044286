Suspicion of H5N1 in Blijdorp zoo withdrawn
-----------------------------------------------
Dr Veerman, the Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Safety, has
decided today [25 Aug 2006] to revoke the suspicion of avian influenza
infection in the Blijdorp zoo [Rotterdam]. Final results of laboratory
investigations of samples from the 2 northern hawk owls found dead in the
zoo have been obtained today. According to their outcome, it could not be
confirmed with certainty that the birds died due to H5N1.
The initial suspicion of H5N1 was raised at the beginning of August 2006,
following tests which were carried out within the avian influenza
surveillance undertaken by the Wild Life Health Centre (Erasmus MC
Rotterdam/Utrecht University). Further investigations at the Lelystad
Laboratory [The Central Institute for Animal Disease Control, CIDC]
confirmed the above initial suspicion. However, the investigators have not
been able to isolate the virus.
The [Dutch] Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority has sent various
[additional] samples from birds in the Blijdorp zoo for [laboratory]
investigations. The avian influenza virus could not be detected in any of
these samples, including the ones coming from the direct vicinity of the 2
dead young owls.

[According to the information released by the Blijdorp zoo in Rotterdam
(see archived post 20060814.2276), there were 4 AI suspected birds, all
deceased or culled. They were young Northern Hawk Owls [_Surnia ulula_,

<http://www.schmoker.org/BirdPics/Photos/Owls/NOHO58.jpg>]
born in May 2006 after the last vaccination of the zoo animals. The 1st 3
animals had their initial clinical signs on 27 Jul 2006, 31 Jul 2006 and 7
Aug 2006, respectively. These birds died on 9 Aug 2006, triggering the
investigation. On 10 Aug 2006, the 4th bird got sick.
The current news release mentions investigations in 2 birds. Results
pertaining to tests (if carried out) of the other 2 allegedly involved
birds and the postulated cause of death of all 4 if H5N1 is excluded will
be helpful in the final accomplishment of the investigation of this unusual
event. - Mod.AS]
