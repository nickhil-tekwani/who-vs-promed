France has declared it was "certain" that sarin gas had been used by the Assad regime in Syria's civil war after the United Nations said the conflict had reached "new levels of brutality."

Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said tests carried out by a French laboratory proved sarin had been used on multiple occasions.

It is believed to be the 1st time a Western nation has said chemical weapons have definitely been used in Syria. Sarin gas is a potentially fatal nerve agent that can prevent victims from breathing.

Mr Fabius said tests carried out by a French laboratory confirmed that sarin gas has been used multiple times and at least once by Syrian government forces and their accomplices. He said that there was "no doubt" that at least in one case, the regime and its allies were responsible for the attack.

He said a Paris laboratory had tested samples recovered from the country and found "localised" attacks in 2 towns, Jobar and Saraqib. The samples have now been handed over to the UN.

"These tests show the presence of sarin in various samples in our possession," Mr Fabius said. "France is now certain that sarin gas has been in Syria several times."

[Sarin is a clear, tasteless, colorless, odorless liquid in pure form. It may be released as a vapor and spread rapidly into the environment.

Sarin was originally developed as a pesticide in Germany, functioning much like an organophosphate insecticide, with similar clinical signs after exposure. Many organophosphate pesticides are regarded as nerve agents because of their profound effects on the nervous system.

When released as a gas sarin is heavier than air and will settle into low lying areas, constituting a greater exposure hazard. As gas or vapor it may cling to the clothes of people and continue to off-gas for some time. Vapor is also harmful to exposed skin and to mucus membranes, especially those of the eyes.

Exposure may not be noticed as sarin is odorless, tasteless, and water soluble. Consequently exposure may occur by inhalation, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms may begin within seconds to hours as the amount of exposure will influence the time to clinical signs.

Clinical signs of sarin exposure may be similar to those of other intoxications. Signs of organophosphate and of sarin poisoning include runny nose, lacrimation, eye pain, blurred vision, and pinpoint pupils. Other signs include excessive sweating, drooling, coughing, and tightness of the test, rapid breathing, either a slow or fast heart rate, low or high blood pressure, weakness, headache, confusion, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, increased urination, muscle twitching, and even convulsions. There may be loss of consciousness with high dose exposure, convulsions, paralysis, and respiratory arrest leading to death.

Sarin blocks the acetylcholine esterase, the enzyme needed to stop the nerve activation. Consequently the continuous activation of the nerves presents with these clinical signs.

Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) are antidotes for nerve agent toxicity; however, to be effective, 2-PAM Cl must be administered within minutes to a few hours (depending on the agent) following exposure. There is also generally no benefit from giving more than 3 injections of 2-PAM Cl. Atropine should be administered every 5 to 10 minutes until secretions begin to dry up.
