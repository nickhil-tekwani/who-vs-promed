Recent European and African Influenza (H5N1) Viruses [edited]

The abstract of the paper said:
"To better understand the ecology and epidemiology of the highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus in its transcontinental spread, we
sequenced and analyzed the complete genomes of 36 recent influenza A
(H5N1) viruses collected from birds in Europe, northern Africa, and
southeastern Asia. These sequences, among the 1st complete genomes of
influenza (H5N1) viruses outside Asia, clearly depict the lineages
now infecting wild and domestic birds in Europe and Africa and show
the relationships among these isolates and other strains affecting
both birds and humans. The isolates fall into 3 distinct lineages,
one of which contains all known non-Asian isolates. This new
Euro-African lineage, which was the cause of several recent (2006)
fatal human infections in Egypt and Iraq, has been introduced at
least 3 times into the European-African region and has split into 3
distinct, independently evolving sublineages. One isolate provides
evidence that 2 of these sublineages have recently reassorted."
Selected sentences from the results:
The evolutionary relationships provide clear evidence that 3 distinct
clades, labeled EMA [European-Middle Eastern-African] 1-3, are
circulating in the European and African region. These clades clearly
share a common ancestor in Asia. The 3 clades may represent separate
introductions or, alternatively, a single introduction from Asia into
Russia, Europe, or another Western site that has subsequently evolved
into 3 lineages. More data will be required to pinpoint when and
where the 3 clades split apart. All previously reported European and
Middle Eastern isolates belong to EMA-1.
Our results show that EMA-2 has spread to Europe and that EMA-3 has
spread to both Europe and the Middle East. These results agree in
part with a recent study that reported 3 distinct introductions of
influenza (H5N1) into Nigeria. Our analysis, based on all available
HA [hemagglutinin] sequences indicates that the Nigerian isolates
fall into just 2 clades, EMA 1-2, that likely resulted from at least
2 introductions of influenza (H5N1).
EMA viruses isolated from humans are thus quite distinct from the
recent large clusters of human cases in Indonesia and China, which
fall into separate clades containing none of our samples. The EMA
isolates are also distinct from other human cases in Southeast Asia,
which fall into the clades (V1 and V2) containing our Vietnamese
samples.
