SHIGELLOSIS - AUSTRALIA (SOUTH AUSTRALIA)

Thirteen out of 32 persons from two states who attended a lunch after a
funeral in Adelaide on 2 Jun 1998 became ill with diarrhea. Most had onset
of illness within three days but one case occurred eight days after and one
28 days after the lunch. The person whose illness commenced eight days
after was the sister of one of the early onset cases and it was her
boyfriend who became ill after 28 days. The duration of illness ranged from
three to 10 days (mean=6.2 days) with reported symptoms in addition to
diarrhea being abdominal pain (11), vomiting (7) and macroscopic blood in
the stool (3).
Only one person had a history of recent travel outside Australia before the
funeral. This had been a medically uneventful trip to the Philippines six
weeks previous. Similarly in the two months before the funeral one person
had returned from southern Queensland, one from a trip to Western Australia
and the Northern Territory and one from Western Australia only. Of these
travelers only the third had suffered any illness during their travel.
Six people came from Melbourne to Adelaide to attend the funeral. Most of
the food for the function was purchased the day before from the
refrigerated counter of a retail outlet, transported for 20 minutes in the
boot of a car and then refrigerated overnight in the kitchen of the flat
where the lunch was served. During that night one item (sliced ham) was
removed from the fridge and some of it used. The remainder of the ham was
returned to the fridge. The person who handled the ham during the night had
recovered earlier that week from a diarrheal illness contracted in the
Kimberleys. The cause of this diarrhea had not been determined. _S. sonnei_
biotype G was grown from the stool of three of the cases (onset 2 days
(n=2) and 8 days), _S. sonnei_ not biotyped from one case (onset 28 days
after the funeral) and _S. dysenteriae_ type 2 from the stool of one other
case (onset of diarrhea 1 day after the funeral). None of the other cases
provided a stool specimen.
A cohort study implicated only the sliced ham of the foods served at the
funeral lunch as a possible vehicle for this outbreak. Even including a
probable secondary case (8 day incubation) who did not eat ham as a primary
case and counting one of the early cases (who was not completely certain
that she had eaten the ham) as a non-consumer, the relative risk was 2.77
(95% confidence limits 1.05-7.27). With these conservative case definitions
the attack rate for ham eaters was eight out of 13 (62%). The more likely
situation with the late onset case as a secondary case and accepting the
history that the uncertain persons belief that she probably had eaten ham
gave a relative risk of 5.46 (95% confidence limits 1.40 -21.27).The attack
rate with these definitions was nine of 14 (64%).
The retailer from whom the ham was purchased is a large supplier which
turns over multiple legs each week. Inspection of this premises two weeks
after the funeral by an environmental health officer of the Adelaide City
Council revealed no poor food handling practices. Laboratory cultures of
ham collected at that time did not grow _Shigella_. If there had been a
problem at or before the retail stage we would also have expected more
metropolitan cases of _Shigella_ notified unrelated to the funeral.
Our suspicion is that the person recently recovered from diarrhea acquired
in the north west of Australia who handled the ham the night before the
funeral contaminated it. This person also consumed the ham but did not
suffer further illness.
Some person-to-person transmission at the lunch was also possible. The meal
was served to a large group of people in a very small flat and one person
reported that the hand towel in the bathroom became sodden from hand wiping
during the afternoon. The multiple _Shigella_ isolates, especially in a
metropolitan outbreak, are surprising but it seems unlikely that there
would be multiple sources. Nevertheless the one isolate of _S. dysenteriae_
came from a person who did not eat ham and who had a flu-like illness on
the day of the funeral but developed prolonged (10 days) of diarrhea the
day after.
This is only the second _S. dysenteriae_ type 2 infection notified in South
Australia since 1990. By contrast in 1997 and 1998 _S. sonnei_ biotype G
has been the commonest _Shigella_ notified. Before 1996 most cases of _S.
sonnei_ biotype G were acquired overseas but only four of the 30 notified
so far in 1998 had recent travel histories outside Australia.
