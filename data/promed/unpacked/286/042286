Alabama Department Of Public Health Confirms Eastern Equine
Encephalitis Cases In Horses In Baldwin, Escambia And Washington
Counties
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health has confirmed 3 positive
cases of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses located in
Baldwin, Escambia, and Washington Counties. Public Health receives
positive case reports from the Alabama Department of Agriculture, and
the agencies work together to identify areas of arboviral disease
within the state.

Previously, the Baldwin County Health Department announced that a
sentinel chicken from the Elberta area tested positive for Eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE). In June [2010], EEE was detected in
sentinel chickens in the Orange Beach area and in July in the
Magnolia Springs area. "With many people enjoying outdoor activities,
it is important that residents take every effort to reduce their
exposure to mosquitoes," said Associate Public Health Veterinarian
Dr. Dee W. Jones. "Keep your mosquito repellent with you at all times
when you are working or participating in recreational activities
outdoors."

EEE, West Nile virus (WNV) and other mosquito-borne viruses are
transmitted by mosquitoes after they feed on birds. The same
mosquitoes can then infect mammals, particularly humans and horses.
Humans and horses can sometimes become seriously ill from the
infection.

Transmission to humans and horses can be decreased by persons taking
steps to avoid mosquitoes and by the use of WNV and EEE vaccine in
horses. According to Jones, although there is no vaccine available
for humans, vaccination for horses is very important in preventing
infection in these animals.

Since mosquitoes are commonly found throughout much of Alabama,
health officials offer practical strategies for the mosquito season:

Personal Protection: Clothing And Aromatics

- Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothes to help prevent
mosquitoes from reaching the skin and to retain less heat, making
yourself less "attractive" to mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are more
attracted to dark colors.

- When possible, wear long sleeves and long pants.

- Avoid perfumes, colognes, fragrant hair sprays, lotions and soaps,
which attract mosquitoes.

Personal Protection: Repellents

- Follow the label instructions when applying repellents. Permethrin
repellents are only for clothes -- not for application on the skin.

- When using repellents avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nasal
membranes. Use concentrations of less than 10 percent when applying
DEET-containing products on children.

- Apply DEET repellent on arms, legs and other exposed areas but
never under clothing.

- After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.

- Citronella candles and repellents containing citronella can help,
but their range is limited. Herbals such as cedar, geranium,
pennyroyal, lavender, cinnamon and garlic are not very effective.

Horse owners alerted to Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis
--------------------------------------------------------
Infected horse reported in Keith County; no horses in Perkins County
have contracted the virus. Nebraska Agriculture Director Greg Ibach
is encouraging horse owners to visit with their veterinarian about
vaccinating their animals against Eastern equine encephalomyelitis.

A case of the mosquito-borne virus was diagnosed this week in a Keith
County horse. There have been no cases reported in Perkins County,
according to Shannon Jensen, DVM at Perkins County Veterinary
Hospital.

Jensen explained many ranchers and horse owners in the county get a
4-way vaccination each year that includes encephalomyelitis (sleeping
sickness). The disease can be prevented, and if a horse gets it, it's
because they've not been properly cared for, she explained. [Although
a 4-way vaccine is not specific sounding, it usually includes
Venezuelan, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis (VEW), and West
Nile virus. There are also vaccines that Venezuelan, Eastern and
Western encephalitis and tetanus (VEWT). Most likely this article is
referring to the one with West Nile in it. - Mod.TG]

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a viral disease of the
equine species that is transmitted primarily by infected mosquitoes.
It affects an animal's central nervous system.

"This case serves as a reminder to equine owners to visit with their
veterinarian regarding measures that can protect their animals from
disease," agriculture director Ibach said.

State Veterinarian Dennis Hughes said vaccines are available to
protect against EEE, and it is not too late in the season to consider
this option. "Vaccination will help prevent the horse from
contracting the virus, and if they do get it, improve their chances
of survival," Hughes said. Some clinical symptoms of EEE-infected
horses include fever, loss of appetite, weakness, lack of
coordination, irritability and abnormal sensitivity to light and
sound.

Dr. Jensen said the signs are similar to West Nile Virus and there is
no specific treatment.

Horse owners are encouraged to take general mosquito-control
measures, such as eliminating pools of standing water.

Hughes said owners also may consider moving animals indoors during
dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.

Other preventative measures include: avoid turning on lights inside
the stable during evening and overnight; remove birds that are in, or
close to, the stable; and use mosquito repellents.

Humans also can contract the EEE virus through the bite of an
infected mosquito. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services
Public Health Veterinarian Annette Bredthauer said human cases are
rare, but can be severe causing hospitalization and even death.

People should take general precautions to protect themselves from
mosquito bites, such as wearing insect repellent, wearing protective
clothing, especially during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most
active, and eliminating standing water to reduce mosquito breeding
sites. More information on EEE can be found at
<http://www.agr.ne.gov> under the Animal Health section.

To report suspected cases of EEE, contact a local veterinarian.

2 horses die in western Ohio from rare mosquito-borne disease
-------------------------------------------------------------
State officials say 2 horses have died in western Ohio from a rare
viral disease that also can strike humans.

The state Agriculture and Health departments report in a statement
that the 2 horses died Monday [13 Sep 2010] on a Mercer County farm
of Eastern equine encephalitis. Officials say the deaths are the 1st
reported in Ohio since 1991 for the disease that is transmitted by
mosquitoes.

There are no known human infections associated with the cases this
week. Human infections are very rare but can be serious.

Infected horses experience symptoms including paralysis, impaired
vision, difficulty swallowing, hanging their heads, and grinding
their teeth. They often die within 3 to 5 days. There is an effective
vaccine.

[Mosquitoes carry disease. It is a simple fact. The diseases they
carry can affect human beings and horses. There is no place far
enough north, or east or west or south that cannot have mosquitoes
that transmit diseases. Owning horses is a commitment and part of
that commitment means having the animals vaccinated to prevent them
dying of a disease that is preventable. It is also important to have
the animals vaccinated a 2nd time. The protective titer for Eastern
equine encephalitis wanes after about 6 months.

Eastern equine encephalitis, commonly referred to as EEE, is a virus
disease of wild birds that is transmitted to horses and humans by
mosquitoes. The virus is found near wetland habitats along the
eastern seaboard from New England to Florida.

The virus responsible for EEE attacks the central nervous system of
its host and horses are particularly susceptible to the infection.
Onset is abrupt and horse cases are almost always fatal. Signs
include unsteadiness, erratic behavior and a marked loss of
coordination. There is no effective treatment and seizures resulting
in death usually occur within 48-72 hours of an animal's 1st
indications of illness.

We also need to protect ourselves. These articles detail several
methods of protecting yourself.

the disease in people.
