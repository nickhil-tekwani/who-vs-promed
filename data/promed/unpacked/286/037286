[Cases continue to occur, especially in Taif and Riyadh. Since the beginning of November (2014), there have been 7 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia, of whom 6 where from Riyadh and one from Taif. It appears as though there may be continuing transmission in the healthcare environment; while one of today's (5 Nov 2014) cases did not have a history of co-morbidities, it appears as though she may have had contact with the healthcare environment, as it is under investigation.
