A potentially fatal hog virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea [PED], has been found in the United States for the 1st time, government and private industry officials said on [Fri 17 May 2013], posing a new threat for the country's struggling pork producers.

PED, an incurable condition that causes diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration in hogs, has been identified in Iowa, the largest producing state, and possibly beyond. The severity of the outbreak is not yet known. The virus exists in much of the world but has not previously occurred in the western hemisphere.

The USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories has detected the virus in the Iowa hog population, a Department of Agriculture spokesman said. Cindy Cunningham, spokeswoman for the National Pork Board in Des Moines, Iowa, said: "It may be a little bit more widespread than just with Iowa at this point ... we're still trying to understand that and determine where it all is."

Hog futures in Chicago fell sharply on [Fri 17 May 2013] as rumors swirled the disease had been detected in Iowa and Minnesota.

PEDV is not a food safety concern and does not affect humans, the USDA spokesman said.

Officials with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) held a call with livestock industry representatives on [Fri 17 May 2013] to discuss the situation. There are currently no interstate trade restrictions related to PEDV for US hogs and pigs.

PEDV has been seen in England, much of Europe, China, Taiwan, and South Korea, according to Iowa State University.

"We don't know the orientation of this particular disease (PEDV) and how it first got here to the United States," Cunningham said. Tom Burger, executive director of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, said his group was getting "conflicting reports" on how the virus might have arrived.

There is no effective treatment for the virus other than good care and the provision of adequate water to combat dehydration, according to the university. Sanitary and quarantine measures can help to slow the spread of the virus.

"All ages of the swine can be affected. But the most severe clinical signs are seen in the very young and nursing baby pigs, the baby pigs that are still nursing," said Burger.

The current outbreak could be short lived. Pig herds typically develop a strong immunity to the virus over 2 to 3 weeks, at which point the virus disappears spontaneously.

Depending on how widespread the incidence, the virus could tighten US pork supplies in about 5 to 6 months by causing the deaths of baby pigs, said Steve Meyer, president of the consulting firm Paragon Economics. But Meyer said exports of US pork would probably not be affected.

US pork producers have been fighting back from record-high feed costs that followed the historic 2012 drought, which hurt their operating margins.

Grain prices are headed down, giving incentives to producers to expand their herds.

[This coronaviral diarrhea affects pigs of all ages and clinically resembles transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE).

The porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus is not related to any other member of the _Coronaviridae_. Pigs are the only known host. Antibodies to the virus have not been found in wild pigs or in other animal species. Infections have been seen in most European countries and in China. Large epidemics occurred in Europe in 1969; no antibodies have been found in sera collected before 1969. Since then, the virus has become widespread and endemic in several European countries, and acute outbreaks have become rare. On large breeding farms, the virus persists in consecutive litters of pigs after weaning and after they lose their immunity from antibody in the milk. On these farms, the virus may be associated with weaning diarrhea. In Belgium, the virus is most frequently associated with diarrhea in feeder pigs, which develops shortly after they are gathered from different breeding farms and assembled in large fattening units. The virus was demonstrated in fecal material in 80 percent of these groups. Epidemiologic data from other countries are scarce. Spread of the virus mainly occurs directly through infected pigs and indirectly through virus-contaminated fomites and via transport trucks.

The pathogenesis and immune mechanisms are similar to those reported for TGE. Oral infection results in viral replication in the epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi. Cells on colonic villi also become infected. No other tissue tropisms have been shown. Virus is excreted in the feces.

Diarrhea is the only direct virus-induced clinical sign observed. An acute outbreak on a susceptible breeding farm resembles a TGE outbreak and is characterized by watery diarrhea in pigs of all ages. However, as compared with TGE, the incubation period is longer (3-4 days), not all the litters of suckling pigs may become sick, and mortality in neonatal pigs is lower (average 50%). Also, the disease within the farm spreads more slowly. In all outbreaks, signs are most consistently seen in feeders, finishers, and adults, which appear to be most susceptible because outbreaks often start in these age groups. Older pigs are more lethargic and depressed with PED than with TGE. Sick pigs appear to have colic.

Acute outbreaks in susceptible finishing pigs are characterized by watery diarrhea, but a markedly increased number of acute deaths may be seen, particularly in pigs infected toward the end of the finishing period and in stress-sensitive breeds. Death may even occur during the incubation period.

Clinical differentiation from TGE is difficult. TGE in its typical epidemic form causes a rapidly spreading diarrhea in animals of all ages with high mortality in neonates. With PED, the diarrhea spreads at a slower rate, and although diarrhea is seen in most of the litters, some litters may remain healthy even in the absence of immunity. Morbidity is 100 percent in older pigs, and they are severely sick. Acute deaths in adults and finishing pigs due to muscle necrosis and occurring during an outbreak of diarrhea are typical of PED and are not seen with any other infectious diarrhea.

Laboratory diagnosis in neonates is made by direct immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of small intestine or colon. ELISA to detect viral antigens in feces or intestinal contents is more useful for older pigs. Antibodies can be detected in paired serum samples through ELISA-blocking.

No specific treatment is available. Measures taken during an outbreak are of a general nature. Pigs with diarrhea should have free access to water, and finishing pigs should have feed withheld for 1-2 days.

On breeding farms, in the face of an outbreak, spread of virus to the farrowing house can be prevented temporarily by sanitary measures and, if performed together with a deliberate infection of pregnant sows, losses in neonates may be lowered. No vaccine is available.

Until recently this disease was not present in the Western Hemisphere. I am uncertain if this is a disease that requires reporting to the OIE or not, as immunity seems to develop very quickly.
