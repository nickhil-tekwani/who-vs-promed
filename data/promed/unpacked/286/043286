[To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes under the WHO update. Information from the Worldometer data which as yet is not available as "a frozen time" at the source URL for when we access the data will still be presented so a more current case count by countries with high activity can be searched by those who wish to see the data. Recognizing there are subscribers who do not wish to see these data I am reorganizing the post so the Worldometer table is the last post, in which case one can stop reading without having to wade through numbers of lesser interest. - Mod.MPP]

[1] China (Wuhan): testing results

The Chinese city of Wuhan [Hubei Province], where the novel coronavirus outbreak began, has found no new cases of people suffering from COVID-19 after testing almost its entire population, and 300 asymptomatic carriers of the virus, officials said on Tuesday [2 Jun 2020].

Authorities launched the vast testing campaign on [14 May 2020], and reached 9.9 million out of 11 million people, after a cluster of new cases raised fears of a 2nd wave of infections. China does not count people who are infected with the virus but do not show symptoms of the disease as confirmed cases.

Officials told reporters in a briefing that there had been no new confirmed cases, and said the asymptomatic carriers had been found not to be infectious; masks, toothbrushes, phones, door handles, and elevator buttons that they touched had no traces of virus.

The central city, capital of Hubei province, was placed under a lockdown on [23 Jan 2020]. It was lifted on [8 Apr 2020]. Wuhan was the hardest hit Chinese city and accounts for the majority of the 4634 deaths and 83 022 infections reported in mainland China. The cost of the city-wide testing effort was about 900 million yuan (USD 126 million).

The northeastern city of Mudanjiang in Heilongjiang province will also launch city-wide virus testing, the local government said on its website, after finding over a dozen asymptomatic cases.

[An AFP (Agence France-Presse) report mentions that over 9.8 million people were tested between 14 May 2020 and 1 Jun 2020] and that none of the asymptomatic cases had "been found to have infected others." (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/667190-wuhan-tests-nearly-10m-people-finds-only-300-infections). Another report by NHK mentioned that the testing was pooled to increase efficiency (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200603_01/).

A Xinhua report mentioned 9 899 828 people were tested. Lu Zuxun, (professor with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology) said that all 300 asymptomatic cases were quarantined. All of the identified 1174 close contacts tested negative but were also quarantined. Li Lanjuan, (a renowned Chinese epidemiologist) mentioned no live virus was cultured from the phlegm samples and throat swabs of the asymptomatic carriers. And mentioned that the total number of nucleic tests done in Wuhan was 10.9 million. (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-06/03/c_139108984.htm).

These additional media reports fill in the answers to questions I had ... how 9.8+ million tests were done in 16 days, and most importantly, how they concluded the asymptomatic carriers were not infective. My caution to interpreting this to be "all clear" is that there has been a false negative testing rate with the nucleic acids tests, some maybe due to inadequate samples, others may be due to periodic viral shedding, and others due to a lower sensitivity of the testing (higher false negatives).

For an excellent review of the challenges with the PCR testing for the SARS-CoV-2 , see an April 2020 paper by the ASM (American Society of Microbiology), False negatives and reinfections: the challenges of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, available at https://asm.org/Articles/2020/April/False-Negatives-and-Reinfections-the-Challenges-of.

In any event, time will tell if there are more clusters surfacing with difficult to trace chains of transmission in Wuhan. - Mod.MPP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-healthcare (such as community) settings.

Methods
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to [3 May 2020], with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047.

Findings
Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and 6 continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in healthcare and non-healthcare settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m [3.3 ft] or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.38; risk difference [RD] -10.2%, 95% CI -11.5 to -7.5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2.02 per m; Pinteraction=0.041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34, RD -14.3%, -15.9 to -10.7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (such as reusable 12-16-layer cotton masks; Pinteraction=0.090; posterior probability greater than 95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.39, RD -10.6%, 95% CI -12.5 to -7.7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.

Interpretation
The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m [3.3 ft] or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and healthcare settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

[Takeaway message, a meta-analysis literature review supports the recommended social distancing (preferably 2 meters/6.6 feet or more) and use of masks (with N95 respirators best in the hospital setting) to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 2 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- During the [1 Jun 2020] media briefing, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in services for treatment of non-communicable diseases in many countries. The COVID-19 response must be inclusive of the healthcare needs of people living with these diseases.

- WHO has published a new operational guidance on maintaining essential health services, which provides recommendations for practical actions that countries can take at national, subregional, and local levels to reorganize and safely maintain access to high-quality, essential health services during the pandemic.

- Transporting COVID-19 medical supplies to those in need requires timely decision-making and trouble-shooting skills. The Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean document a week in the life of logistics expert coordinating massive shipments of medical supplies to Yemen.

- WHO's support to countries in securing medical products for COVID-19 treatment is highlighted in the 'subject in focus' [available at the source URL above].

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 57.2% of the global newly reported cases and 42.9% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 40.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil 25.4%, Peru 13.6%, Chile 8.5%, and Mexico 4.9%.

The European region reported 14.3% of the global newly reported cases and 43.0% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period (a major increase from yesterday 1 Jun 2020, suggesting there was weekend reporting artifact). Russia reported 54.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 9.7%, Belarus 5.2%, and Turkey 5.1%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14.1% of the global newly reported cases and 6.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 24.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 18.6%, Saudi Arabia 11.7%, Qatar 9.5%, Egypt 8.7%, and Oman 4.9%.

The African region reported 3.4% of the global newly reported cases and 1.5% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 43.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon at 12.7%, Nigeria at 10.7%, Ghana at 4.9%, Congo DR 3.8% and Algeria 3.1%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of the global newly reported cases and 0.2% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 49.9% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore at 36.9%, Japan at 4.2%, and Malaysia and South Korea at 3.4% each.

The South East Asia region reported 10.0% of the global newly reported cases and 6.1% of global fatalities. India reported 72.1% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.0%, Indonesia 4.1%, and Nepal 2.1%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 2 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas continues to increase, as does South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean who are both approaching a parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. The Americas greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]
