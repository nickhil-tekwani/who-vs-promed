2000/154 Tomato Chlorosis Crinivirus in Portugal [edited]
---------------------------------------
Unusual symptoms were observed in a protected tomato crop of the
Experimental Station at Patacao, in Algarve (southern Portugal) [in 1998]
and in commercial tomato crops in 1999. Affected plants showed chlorotic
mottle and interveinal chlorosis. High populations of _Bemisia tabaci_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) were also present. PCR analysis [demonstrated
the] presence of tomato chlorosis crinivirus (EPPO Alert List). Most
samples collected in Algarve in June 1999 were only infected by tomato
chlorosis crinivirus, whereas those collected in October in the same areas
were infected by both tomato chlorosis crinivirus and tomato yellow leaf
curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). [The virus was not associated
with] tomato samples with yellowing symptoms from central and north
Portugal. This is the first report of tomato chlorosis crinivirus in
Portugal. The status of this virus in Portugal can be described as:
Present, only in one area (Algarve).
