France's health ministry said late Friday [10 May 2013] that 3 suspected infections of the new deadly SARs-like coronavirus tested negative, following the 1st confirmed case in the north of the country. One additional suspected case is still being studied.

France's health ministry said Friday [10 May 2013] that the 3 suspected cases of a new SARS-like virus in northern France had tested negative, adding that a 4th case needed "further investigation."

The 4 people who were tested for the recently discovered deadly coronavirus, which so far has killed 17 people in the Middle East and one in the UK, had been in contact with an infected 65-year-old man, so far the only confirmed case in France.

The 3 people cleared of infection were medical staff of the Douai Hospital Centre, where the patient was initially treated. The as yet still suspected case is that of another man who had shared the same hospital room.

The unnamed patient, who is thought to have been infected with the virus during a trip to the United Arab Emirates in April 2013, has been moved to a specialised unit in the city of Lille. He is undergoing respiratory assistance and blood transfusions, doctors said.

French Health Minister Marisol Touraine announced that he is travelling to Lille on Saturday [11 May 2013] to investigate the possible outbreak.

The virus, known as nCoV-EMC, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which started in Asia and swept through the world in 2003, killing 775 people.

[It is comforting to confirm a lack of transmission of this nCoV to health care practitioners caring for an infected patient. We await further information on the results of testing of another patient who shared a room with the infected patient. Looking at the profiles of the 33 confirmed cases thus far, one wonders whether a prerequisite for serious disease related to exposure to the nCoV are pre-existing co-morbidities leading to reduced immunological responses.

For a map of France showing the cities where the patient was hospitalized (Valenciennes, Douai, and Lille), see http://www.map-france.com/cities/. All 3 cities are located in the Department of Nord, in the Region of Nord-Pas de Calais (see map of France with Departments at http://www.map-france.com/departments/), located in the northernmost portion of France.
