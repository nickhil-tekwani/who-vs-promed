Bulgaria's Food Safety Agency reported on Friday [21 Oct 2022] an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu) type A virus at a commercial farm.

The virus was detected on a farm for laying hens in the village of Krivo Pole, in Haskovo [Khaskovo] region, the agency said in a statement.

Measures have been taken immediately to eradicate the outbreak, and a total of 19 000 hens on the farm will be culled, it said.

This is the 3rd bird flu outbreak at the same farm over the past 3 years, said the agency.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has analyzed on 21 Oct 2022 samples submitted from a commercial poultry flock in Rogaland. The samples have been examined with a PCR and are positive for HPAI H5N1.

The herd was euthanized yesterday [21 Oct 2022] following a decision made by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, based on suspicion of serious infectious disease after rapidly increasing mortality.

The affected farm is within the control zone established by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority in connection with an outbreak of Newcastle disease in another poultry herd in Rogaland at the end of September (ProMED post 20221002.8705909).

The Veterinary Institute has recommended a movement ban and hunting ban in this area now to reduce the risk of spread from wild birds to poultry. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has now introduced hunting bans in addition to zones around the farm.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected for the 1st time in wild birds in Rogaland in 2020 (subtype H5N8).

In 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected for the 1st time in 2 commercial poultry flocks in Norway. The 2 farms were close to each other in Rogaland.

[Norway experienced a considerable number of HPAI H5N1 cases in wild birds during the last (2021/2022) HPAI outbreak season, which continued -- similarly to other northern European countries -- into the summer months, longer than during previous years. Their distribution, in Norway, during the said season, is presented in DEFRA'a 'Updated Outbreak Assessment #33,' dated 21 Sep 2022, Map 3: "HPAI outbreaks (from WOAH) in poultry, captive, and wild birds across Europe, 1 Jun 2022 to 21 Sep 2022." To visit the map, please go to page 10 of the document, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1106041/HPAI_Europe_33_21_September_2022.pdf.

No cases in wild birds have been reported from Norway during the recent 4 weeks, in difference with several maritime European countries, such as Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and others, where the number of infected wild birds has started increasing. For example, in Great Britain (GB), since the beginning of October 2022 and the start of the 2022/2023 HPAI outbreak season, there have been 39 confirmed cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds, again spanning a range of waterfowl, seabirds, and raptors.

In southern or landlocked European countries, the HPAI outbreak season is yet in a low gear. In Bulgaria (item 1 above), no cases in wild birds have been reported yet. Bulgaria is situated on the flyway of migrating birds, flying southward from its north/north-east. The DEFRA map (see above), which presents outbreaks and flyways, may be helpful in illustrating the situation. - Mod.AS]
