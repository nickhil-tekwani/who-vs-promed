[As the map at the end of the OIE WAHID report or
on Healthmap.org clearly shows, these 2 farms are
at opposite sides of the country.

Given that disease is usually transmitted by
biting flies (tabanids) or by contaminated
materials such as needles, hoof trimmers, etc.,
it would appear to be late in the season for
transmission by biting flies. A quick scan of the
dates on our previous posting in Europe supports
this hypothesis. However, any information on how
the outbreak occurred could proved to be very instructive.

For further background see my commentary in
posting 20070604.1801 or Mod.TG's commentary in 20040613.1590. - Mod.PC]
