The Chief Medical Officer of Liberia has confirmed reports of an outbreak
of yellow fever in Nimba County. Dr. Nathaniel Bartee said medical reports
from Nimba indicate that seven persons have already died of yellow fever.
He said a World Health Organization and Health Ministry assessment team
discovered that yellow fever was prevalent in Nimba. Dr. Bartee told STAR
radio yesterday 20,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine have been sent to
Nimba County to combat the disease. He said the Health Ministry plans to
administer 1,800 doses in the county. The Chief Medical Officer, however,
said the yellow fever epidemic is common in Liberia in the rainy season.
