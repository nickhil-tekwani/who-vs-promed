The Food Standards Agency, with Public Health England and local authorities, is investigating an outbreak of a particular strain of salmonella, called _Salmonella_ Gold Coast, which is known to have caused 18 cases of illness.

The investigation has identified potential links between the outbreak and the consumption of whelks from independent shops, market stalls, and mobile seafood vans, largely in the East Anglia area. As part of this investigation, Lynn Shellfish Ltd of King's Lynn (formally known as Heiploeg or Heiploeg and Lynn Shrimpers) has issued a recall of all batches of frozen and chilled whelks.

Anyone who has recently purchased and consumed whelks and is displaying the symptoms of food poisoning, such as diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and fever, should contact their GP. None of the affected product remains on sale. However, if you have whelks in your fridge or freezer from independent shops, market stalls, and mobile seafood vans in the East Anglia area, you should not eat them but instead throw them away.

Details of the affected product:

[Whelk (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whelk) is a common name that is applied to various kinds of sea snail, many of which have historically been used, or are still used, by humans for food. Although a number of whelks are relatively large and are in the family _Buccinidae_ (the true whelks), the word whelk is also applied to some other marine gastropod mollusc species within several families of sea snails that are not very closely related. The common name "whelk" is also spelled welk or even wilks. The word originated from the Proto-Germanic root "weluka," which may come from the Proto-Indo-European root "wel-," meaning to turn or revolve. The species, genera and families referred to by this common name vary a great deal from one geographic area to another.

As with previous outbreaks associated with seafood, it is likely that contamination of the sea snails occurred after harvesting. - Mod.LL
