The President of the National Health Foundation (Funasa), Mauro Ricardo
Costa, reported that as of yesterday [21 Jan 2000 13 cases of yellow fever
(YF) had been confirmed in Brazil: 5 acquired in Alto Paraiso, Goias State,
6 in other cities of Goias & 2 in Tocantins State, with 50 suspect cases
pending confirmation.
To prevent the spread of the disease, 60 million doses of vaccine will be
distributed to 22 000 health posts country-wide, while the Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation (Fiocruz) will double its monthly vaccine production from 5m to
10m doses.
Starting next week, permanent vaccination posts will be established in all
ports, airports and bus terminals, to vaccinate travellers going to the
areas at risk: Goias, northern Mato Grosso State, northeastern Sao Paulo
State, west Maranhao State & northern Minas Gerais State. "We want to
extend vaccine coverage to 95% of the population in endemic areas", said
Mauro Costa. Hard-to-reach areas in the north of Brazil [e.g. Amazonia
will be vaccinated by the armed forces beginning next week. In 1999, 14m
people were vaccinated against YF in Brazil, & 12m in 1998.
YF vaccination will also be included in the campaign to vaccinate persons
over 65 years old [against the flu, beginning in April 2000, and in the
childhood vaccination program.
The vaccine must be taken 10 days before travelling to an endemic area, is
valid for 10 years, and its efficacy is 98%.
