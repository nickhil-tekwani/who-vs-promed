Disease hits endangered chicks
-------------------
Scientists are investigating a mystery disease killing endangered Shy
Albatross [_Diomedea cauta_ chicks on a Bass Strait island.
Tasmanian Nature Conservation Branch project officer Sheryl Hamilton
said today the disease was threatening the recovery of colonies on
Albatross Island. She said the Shy Albatross - who were misnamed,
because they happily followed fishing boats - bred in only 3 places
in the world, Albatross Island and 2 inaccessible islands off the
Tasmanian south coast.
The Albatross Island birds, which once numbered about 20 000 pairs,
were hunted almost to extinction for their feathers and eggs. Others
were killed by longline fishing as they ranged as far as South Africa.
The albatross had gradually recovered to about 5000 pairs, until the
disease struck about 10 years ago. Ms Hamilton said the disease
varied from year to year and hit some colonies worse than others. But
at its worst, the breeding success rate was cut from 40 per cent to
10 per cent, an unsustainable loss because the birds lay only one egg
a year.
A team including Ms Hamilton and microbiologist Kay Humphreys from
Sydney's Taronga Zoo recently completed the first full-scale
investigation on the ground. "Chicks that looked perfectly healthy
would die in a few hours," Ms Hamilton said.
It would be several months before all the samples taken from the
island were analyzed, but the disease appeared to be bacterial rather
than viral, she said.
