A total of 34 plantation workers from a rubber estate here in Segamat
are suspected to be down with chikungunya fever.

While many received outpatient treatment for the mosquito-transmitted
fever, at least 14 have been warded at the Segamat Hospital since the
outbreak was detected about 12 days ago in Bukit Datuk Estate. Many
of the workers have been suffering from fever, rashes and joint
pains. This is the 2nd major outbreak in the state over the past 3
months.

In April 2008, several villagers in Kampung Ulu Choh and Kampung Paya
Mengkuang near Gelang Patah had contracted chikungunya [virus
infection]. On the latest outbreak in Segamat, state Health
department director Dr. Mohd Khairi Yakub said, "14 were admitted,
but as of now we have 2 or 3 people still warded for observation. We
have also taken at least 12 samples and have sent it for further
tests to confirm whether it was chikungunya fever," he said.

He urged the public not to panic. "The situation is under control,"
he said, adding that the fever was not life-threatening.

Dr. Mohd Khairi said a medical team had been sent to the area to
conduct house-to-house checks to treat the sufferers after it came to
light on 16 Jun [2008] that several workers were showing symptoms of
chikungunya [virus infection].

The estate management was cleaning up the area, as there were a lot
of mosquitoes in the area. State Women, Family, Community Development
and Health Committee chairman Dr. Robia Kosai advised people to keep
their living and work surroundings clean.

"Unlike dengue fever, Chikungunya is not fatal," she said, advising
anyone who was down with fever to seek medical treatment immediately.
The health department officials were fogging the area while the
estate authorities had carried out a campaign to clear the estate of
potential mosquito breeding grounds.
