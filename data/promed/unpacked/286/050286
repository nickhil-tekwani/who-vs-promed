New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Whiteleg shrimp (_L. vannamei _) / 98 / 98 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: 9 Aug 2020: An on-land farm introduced juveniles of whiteleg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) that were imported from Thai [Thailand]. The inspection at the destination for imported aquatic animals by the prefecture (for 6 months) was started. 8-13 Oct 2020: The prefectural experimental station conducted field survey at the farm and PCR test for several pathogens in shrimp. As a result of nested PCR, AHPND was detected from the shrimp on 13 Oct 2020. 16-18 Oct 2020: Fisheries Technology Institute, which is in charge of confirmatory diagnosis in aquatic animals, confirmed the positive result for AHPND by nested PCR and sequencing of the PCR product. 19 Oct 2020: Killing of all shrimp in the farm and disinfecting the farm by sodium hypochlorite were started. *Said farm is an on-land farm with a recirculation filtration system. And no juveniles introduced on 9 Aug 2020 have been distributed to other places.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; traceability; quarantine; stamping out; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Okinawa Prefectural Fisheries Research and Extension Center (local laboratory) / Whiteleg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei _) / Nested RT-PCR / 13 Oct 2020 / Positive
Fisheries Technology Institute of Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency (national laboratory) / Whiteleg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei _) / Gene sequencing / 18 Oct 2020 / Positive
Fisheries Technology Institute of Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency (national laboratory) / Whiteleg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei _) / Nested RT-PCR / 18 Oct 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following is extracted from https://www.cabi.org/ISC/datasheet/121558:

Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), initially referred to as early mortality syndrome (EMS), is a shrimp disease caused by some pathogenic strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and likely some pathogenic strains of other _Vibrio_ species in the _Vibrio harveyi_ group. AHPND emerged as a new disease in 2009; it has resulted in severe mortality in farmed penaeid shrimp and significant economic losses in Southeast Asia and Mexico.

AHPND most frequently occurs within the first 30 days after stocking a newly prepared shrimp pond. Infected shrimp show lethargy, slow growth, an empty stomach and midgut and a pale to white atrophied hepatopancreas.

AHPND has caused severe mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp throughout Southeast Asia and Mexico. Countries reporting AHPND include China, Viet Nam, Thailand, the Philippines and Mexico.

In addition, from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment in Australia (https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/acute-hepatopancreatic-necrosis-disease.pdf):

This disease affects mainly _Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei_ and _Penaeus monodon_. It may also be problematic in _Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) chinensis_. Kuruma prawns are unaffected but may act as carriers. Live polychaete worms may also act as vectors for specific virulent strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ when used to feed broodstock prawns.

In 2019, AHPND was reported in Taiwan; see the report below in the See Also section. - Mod.CRD
