A cholera outbreak in northeastern Cambodia has killed 54 villagers and
left another 827 infected with the deadly bacteria, health officials said
today.
Cholera cases were first reported in northern Ratanakiri province in
mid-April and quickly spread, Dr. Gerry Pais of Health Unlimited said by
telephone from the provincial capital of Banlung.
"Unless we can bring it under control soon, we could have many more
casualties," he said.
Poor road conditions and long distances between villages have frustrated
efforts to stop the epidemic.
Cholera [is caused by a deadly bacterium that flourishes in human waste
and spreads quickly in crowded areas with poor sanitation. Symptoms include
severe vomiting and diarrhea.
Pais said despite Ratanakiri's low population density, a combination of
poor hygiene and a tendency for villagers to eat together allowed the
bacteria to spread.
Health officials hope to control the outbreak in the next few days.
Rehydration treatments and antibiotics are being used to treat the sick,
and villages are being taught preventive measures, Pais said.
One of Cambodia's least populated provinces, Ratanakiri is known for its
dense and mountainous jungles that were a critical link in the Ho Chi Minh
Trail during the Vietnam War.

Health officials in northeastern Cambodia made an urgent appeal Thursday
for medicine to fight a cholera outbreak that has killed 61 people.
Antibiotics and intravenous serum have been flown into Ratanakiri province
from the capital, Phnom Penh, but provincial health adviser Dr Gerry Pais
said the supplies received fall far short of the need. "We are going to run
out of medicine," warned Pais, who works for the aid agency Health
Unlimited.
Cholera cases were first reported in the remote province last month and
spread quickly. By Thursday, 861 cases had been diagnosed in 21 villages
and health officials fear there could be many more.

Disease outbreaks reported, 21 May 1999
The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Rottanakiri
province in the north-eastern part of the country. Four districts in this
province, which is one of Cambodia's least populated areas, have been
affected to date. The outbreak started on 16 April and a total of 874 cases
with 56 deaths was reported up to 16 May.
Lack of good hygiene and sanitation facilities, as well as difficulty in
sending supplies because of poor road conditions in the area, are
contributing to the spread of the epidemic. The Ministry of Health is
providing oral dehydration salts and antibiotics and is also organizing
health education campaigns for the affected and surrounding villages.
Cholera is endemic in Cambodia and 1,197 cases and 66 deaths were notified
to WHO in 1998.
