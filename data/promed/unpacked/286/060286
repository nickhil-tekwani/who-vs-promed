Rio Grande do Sul state government issues alert for yellow fever
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Death of howler monkeys indicates that YF virus is circulating in the region
Target to vaccinate people not vaccinated in the last 10 years
The Health Secretary of Rio Grande do Sul state has issued a YF alert
to townships in the NE Region of the state. The objective is to
prevent an outbreak by vaccinating everyone in the area who has not
been vaccinated in the last 10 years -- mainly children and people
who have recently moved there.
Acording to the newspaper "Zero Hora", howler monkeys have been found
dead during the last 2 weeks in rural parts of the townships of
Itacurubi & Santo Antonio das Missoes. The State Center for
Monitoring & Health has sent personnel to the area to collect
specimens from dead monkeys to send to the Instituto Evandro Chagas,
in Para state [the national reference center for YF and other arboviruses].
Since 2001, when the 1st occurrence of monkeys dead from YF was
reported [in the region], the population has been vaccinated [see
ProMED archives below].

[Travelers to that part of the state on business or pleasure, take
note. A YF shot only takes effect 10 days after
vaccination. Unvaccinated people falling ill with YF and being
hospitalized in a major city which is having an outbreak of dengue
-- which is transmitted by the same mosquito -- pose a real risk of
starting an urban epidemic far from this jungle focus.
