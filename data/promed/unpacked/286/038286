----------------------------------------------------------------------
With relation to the moderator's comment that the putative viral agent responsible for wobbly possum disease [WPD] "has not been positively identified and characterised," I'd like to point the readers to our recent publication (Dunowska et al, Vet Micro, 2011: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.013, in which we have shown the initial data suggesting that the WPD virus is a novel nidovirus, most closely related to the members of the current family Arteriviridae.

[M Dunowskaa, PJ Biggsa, T Zhengb, and MR Perrott in Veterinary Virology, online 25 Nov 2011 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.013) described identification of a novel nidovirus associated with a neurological disease of the Australian brushtail possum (_Trichosurus vulpecula_) . The novel virus was isolated from tissues of wobbly possum disease (WPD)-affected possums by means of a combination of next generation sequencing and traditional molecular methods. The proportion of possums positive for the novel virus by PCR was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) among animals with WPD than clinically healthy possums, strongly suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in WPD. Analysis of the partial genomic sequence of the putative WPD virus indicated that it is a novel nidovirus, most closely related to the current members of the family Arteriviridae.

The putative WPD virus is most closely related to members of the family Arteriviridae. Members of the family Arteriviridae include equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The arteriviruses are highly species specific, but share many biological and molecular properties, including virion morphology, a unique set of structural proteins, genome organization and replication strategy, and the ability to establish prolonged or true persistent infection in their natural hosts. However the diseases associated with these viruses are diverse and not indicative of their relationships. - Mod.CP]
