An administrative subdivision of Zavkhan province in western Mongolia is under quarantine for an indefinite period after a suspected case of bubonic plague was reported on Thursday [3 Sep 2020], local government said Friday [4 Sep 2020].

A 38-year-old resident of Tosontsengel soum has showed symptoms of high-grade fever and swollen glands after eating marmot meat last week. He is now under isolation at a local hospital. So far, at least 25 people in close contact with the person have undergone quarantine at a local hospital.

Up to 17 of all 21 provinces in Mongolia are now at risk of bubonic plague, according to the country's National Center for Communicable Diseases. Although hunting marmots is illegal in Mongolia, many Mongolians regard the rodent as a delicacy.

A total of 18 suspected cases of bubonic plague have been reported across the country so far in 2020, with 4 confirmed by laboratory test results. A 42-year-old man died of the bubonic plague in Khovd Province in August 2020 while a 15-year-old boy died of the plague in Govi-Altai Province in western Mongolia in mid-July 2020.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream, which can occur even without a clear bubo. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (such as Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. The description in the cases does not described where the swollen lymph nodes were; if they were in the neck, it is possible that the patient has pharyngeal plague, as described below:

Abstract
--------
Between late January and early February 1997, an outbreak of plague, associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, occurred in the Jordanian village of Azraq ad-Druze, which lies about 50 km (31 mi) west of the border with Saudi Arabia. The 12 cases who presented at hospital were initially assumed to have tularemia, and all were successfully treated with gentamicin. When, however, their sera were tested for evidence of _Yersinia pestis_ or _Francisella tularensis_ infection (using hemagglutination, enzyme immuno-assays for specific IgM or the F1 antigen of _Y. pestis_, and micro-agglutination tests), all 12 were found to have anti-_Y. pestis_ IgM. Three dogs shot near the Saudi Arabian border were also found seropositive for antibodies against _Y. pestis_. Eleven of the 12 patients reported that 2-4 days before their symptoms appeared, they had eaten the meat cut from the carcass of the same camel, either raw (10 cases) or cooked (one case). All 12 patients were diagnosed as cases of pharyngeal plague (the 1st cases of plague reported in Jordan for more than 80 years), caused by _Y. pestis_ that most had acquired when they ate raw meat from a camel that was infected with the pathogen.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French "marmotte," from Latin _mures monti_ -- "mountain mouse." - Mod.LL
