The office of Environmental Surveillance of the Secretariat of Health of the Federal District (SES-DF) found another dead monkey, suspected of yellow fever, on the morning of this Tuesday (10 [Nov 2020]). The animal was found in a condominium in the Botanical Garden.

On Monday (9 [Nov 2020]), an agency confirmed the death of another monkey due to the disease. The animal was found in the Sao Sebastiao region last week. After confirmation, SES-DF mobilized a vaccination action against yellow fever in the region.

The animal was sent to the laboratory of the University of Brasilia (UnB) for analysis of possible infection by the disease. According to the Secretariat, the death of a "non-human primate" is one of the main signs of circulation of the virus in the region's forests.

The Director of Environmental Surveillance, Edgar Rodrigues, stated that it was a surprise to find another animal in those conditions in such a short period of time. "It's worrying. But I can't say yet that it had yellow fever virus until UnB checks whether it is positive or not."

According to the Health Secretariat, a confirmed case on Monday [9 Nov 2020] was the 1st death of a monkey from yellow fever in the DF this year [2020]. So far in 2020, 9 suspected cases [in monkeys] were reported, but none was positive for the disease," says the official.

According to the latest bulletin from the Ministry of Health about monitoring monkey deaths, 69 dead animals were collected for testing without confirmation of a positive case of the disease. The last occurrence of this disease was registered in 2016.

According to information, the DF has not registered cases of the disease in humans in 2019 and 2020. In 2018, the Federal District had 2 confirmed cases; however, they were people infected in Sao Paulo.

The vaccine coverage for this disease is 62.9%, according to the government. The vaccine is given as a dose at 9 months of age and a booster at 4 years.

Prevention

Yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease can be passed to humans when they enter a forested area without having been vaccinated and are bitten by these mosquitoes that circulate in the wild.

The main symptoms are fever and chills, intense headache, back pain, muscle pain, vomiting, and weakness. The disease can also lead to death.

In order to avoid reproduction of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the vector of the virus, and consequently, reduce attacks of this mosquito, the Ministry of Health has put together a series of recommendations:
- Use protective screens with holes of maximum 1.5 mm [0.02 in] in the windows of the house.
- Leave doors and windows closed, especially at sunrise and sunset.
- Keep the land clean and free of materials or debris that could be breeding grounds.
- Cap tubs and water tanks.
- Keep gutters clean.
- Always keep bottles upside down.
- Keep trash bins tightly covered.
- Leave drains clean and with screens applied.
- Clean weekly or fill plant pot dishes with sand.
- Clean animal water dishes with a brush or broom.
- Clean all decoration accessories that are outside the house, and avoid the accumulation of water in tires and gutters.
- Place electrical repellents near windows; use is contraindicated for allergy sufferers.
- Citronella candles or diffusers can also be used.
- Avoid perfumed hygiene products as they can attract insects.
- Remove water accumulated in the service area, behind the washing machine, etc.

[Finding a monkey dead of yellow fever (YF), assuming that tests confirm this, is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern, based on historical analysis of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Occurrence in the Federal District is not surprising either. Cases in monkeys and humans have occurred there before. Vaccine coverage of 62% in the human population is not adequate to prevent people from becoming infected and initiating ongoing transmission in an urban human-mosquito-human cycle. - Mod.TY
