Newcastle disease (ND) in Australia - Emergency report No 2
-------------------------------------------------------
The following report, dated 12 May 2002, has been forwarded to us from the
office of the chief Veterinary Officer in Australia, confirming the outbreak
of ND near Meredith in Victoria, Australia.

Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory.
Date of initial detection: 08 May 2002.
Estimated date of first detection: 18 Mar 2002.
Geographical location: Near the town of Meredith, Victoria.
No of outbreaks: 1.

Total number of animals in the outbreak:
Susceptible: 250 000 Cases: Up to 40 percent drop in egg production over 4-6
weeks. Destroyed: 0. Slaughtered: 0.

Description of the (newly) affected population: The outbreak has occurred in a
poultry layer (egg production) enterprise comprising of 9 atmospheric-controlled
rise sheds, each shed containing between 22 000 and 25 000 birds.

Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL)
in Geelong, Victoria.

Diagnostic test used: Serology, virus isolation and DNA sequencing;
immunohistochemistry and IPCI results pending. [ICPI= Intracerebral
pathogenicity index;
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00036.htm> - Mod. AS]

Casual agent: Virulent Newcastle disease of Australian origin (amino acid
sequence of F cleavage site SGGRRQRRF and a 9 amino acid extension at the HN
gene, indicating that the virus is identical, or almost identical, to the 1999
Mangrove Mountain isolate of virulent ND virus of Australian origin.

Origin of infection: Mode of introduction to farm unknown, epidemiological
investigations continuing.

Mode of spread: There has been no evidence of spread of virulent Newcastle
disease from the infected property.

Other epidemiological details: The infected flock is near Meredith, Victoria,
approx. 75 kms west of Melbourne. This flock, which experienced a marked drop
in egg production and a mild increase in mortality, has been quarantined and
poses no immediate threat to other poultry operations. Immediate action has
been taken to:

1.quarantine the suspect flock;

2.collect the necessary epidemiological information to assist investigations
concerning the potential for spread;

3.arrange for testing of 2 layer flocks in Victoria identified as having contact
with the suspect flock; these flocks remain healthy with no clinical or
serological evidence of Newcastle disease;

4.proclaim a 3-km radius Restricted Area (RA or Infected zone), and a 10-km
radius Control Area (CA or Surveillance Zone) around the infected property;
there are no other commercial poultry flocks within the RA, and five broiler
flocks within the CA;

5.undertake surveillance in the restricted and control areas.

Strict controls have been implemented to ensure that there is minimal risk of
disease spread from the infected property and further information will be
provided within the next few days.

The rest of Victoria and Australia outside of the CA continues to remain free
of Newcastle disease. No additional quarantine or movement restrictions have
been imposed by other Australian States and Territories, beyond those imposed
by Victorian authorities.
