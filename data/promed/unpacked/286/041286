Eight children die from encephalitis in southern Vietnam
HANOI, Feb 11 - Eight children have died from encephalitis in the
southern province of Kien Giang, hospital officials said on Thursday.
The eight children, aged from one to four years old, died within days of
being admitted to the hospital, experiencing high fever and convulsions and
falling into a coma.
An official from Kien Giang provincial hospital said four more children had
been hospitalized one of whom is in critical condition.
At least one of the children died from Japanese encephalitis, a particularly
[virulent strain of the mosquito-borne virus that is often fatal to
children.
Doctors are still awaiting results of blood examinations of the seven other
deaths and the four hospitalized victims.
Most Vietnamese cannot afford the costly vaccine against Japanese
encephalitis, which costs upwards of 80 dollars.
