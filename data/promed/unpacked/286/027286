Ministry of Health announcement
-------------------------------
A case of polio (child paralysis) was discovered in a 4-year-old child in Jerusalem who was not vaccinated against polio as part of routine vaccinations. The source of the disease, in this case, is a poliovirus that has undergone a change and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated.

The most important means of preventing polio is to adhere to routine immunizations at the recommended time, according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health. It is recommended that routine immunizations for those who have not yet done so be completed as soon as possible.

The Jerusalem District Health Bureau has opened an epidemiological investigation and will contact the child in close contact to provide specific instructions. Based on the findings of the investigation, further recommendations will be decided.

It should be noted that the virus is found in sewage samples in the area, a finding that happens occasionally, but so far in similar incidents in the past, there have been no clinical cases.

A case of polio (child paralysis) was discovered in a 4-year-old child in Jerusalem who was not vaccinated against polio as part of routine vaccinations. The source of the disease, in this case, is a polio vaccine that has undergone a change and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated.

Polio is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus is contagious and is transmitted from person to person (especially in children). The virus enters the body through the mouth and is excreted in the feces. There are usually no signs of illness and only 1 in 1000 people (who are not vaccinated) will develop symptoms symptomatically with paralysis [the range of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) to infected has been cited as a high of 1 in 50 infected to a low of 1 in 1000 infected - Mod.MPP].

The Ministry of Health will continue to update the public as needed and the investigation will progress.

[ProMED would like to thank Yaakov Dickstein for alerting us to this case.

The machine translation of the Ministry of Health announcement is the only source that definitively mentions the virus involved is a vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). All other reports reviewed stopped at saying it was a mutated virus. Reading between the lines to reconstruct the event, environmental sampling identified a VDPV in Jerusalem. Active surveillance was initiated and presumably samples were obtained on individuals in the area (perhaps with a focus on unvaccinated individuals).

The prior event in Israel occurred in 2013 and involved a wild poliovirus first identified in environmental samples (ES) in Southern Israel (Rahat) taken in my June 2013. The virus was mentioned to be related to a WPV1 isolated in an environmental sample in Egypt in January 2013 which in turn was genetically similar to a virus identified in Sukkor, Sindh province Pakistan. At the time of identifying the positive ES in Israel, the country exclusively used IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine). Over the course of the following months, positive ESs were found in Israel moving northward, but no AFP cases were ever identified. As the virus kept circulating in the country OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) was reintroduced into the vaccination schedule in Israel to interrupt the transmission of the WPV.] (see links below to the ProMED coverage of the events in Egypt and Israel in 2013, for additional details)

Questions that come to mind now are:
Which cVDPV is implicated? VDPV1, VDPV2 or VDPV3? Is this VDPV a circulating VDPV? Is it genetically related to cVDPVs from another country or is a locally evolved cVDPV? Does the infected 4-year old child have an AFP illness? Has contact tracing identified other infected children in Jerusalem? Is there a known history of travel or contact with travelers? Is environmental sampling ongoing in the West Bank and Gaza strip as well? Have routine immunization activities been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or is the vaccination status of this child a function of vaccine hesitancy on the part of the parents? Information on additional findings from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
