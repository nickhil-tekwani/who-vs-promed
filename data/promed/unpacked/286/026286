Follow-up report No. 2
Summary of a fax received on 13 September 1999 from Dr Gardner Murray,
Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Primary Industries and Energy,
Canberra:
End of previous report period: 30 August 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[34, 124, dated 3 Sep 1999).
End of this report period: 13 Sep 1999.
Low virulent virus has been retrospectively isolated from a broiler farm
adjoining the initial infected farm described in the emergency report (see
Disease Information, 12 [33, 121, dated 27 August 1999) in samples taken
at the time of depopulation for processing. Virulent virus has also been
isolated from samples from one of the seven sheds only. There was no
evidence of clinical Newcastle disease in these birds. The entire
production from this farm (approximately 100,000 broilers) has gone for
domestic consumption only.
The farm will remain in quarantine and not be repopulated until
disinfection procedures have been conducted.
