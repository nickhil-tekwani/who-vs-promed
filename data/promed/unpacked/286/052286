[With the addition of this newly confirmed case, Saudi Arabia has now reported 762 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 324 deaths (case fatality rate 42.5). Similar to yesterday's (12 Oct 2014) newly confirmed case, according to the information available, the only potential risk factor was a history of pre-existing co-morbidities suggesting possible periodic exposure to the healthcare system where there may have been exposure to other MERS-CoV infected individuals. The most recent previously reported MERS-CoV infected individual reported in Riyadh was announced on 25 Sep 2014 in a 60 year old Saudi male who also was not a healthcare worker, did not have a history of animal exposure, but did have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities.

A map showing the location of today's (13 Oct 2014] confirmed case can be found at the source URL above.
