"Rabbit Fever" case confirmed
-----------------------------
State health officials have confirmed a case of tularemia, or "Rabbit
Fever," in a 4-year-old Newton [a western suburb of Boston, Massachusetts
boy and suspect 2 more cases of the rare bacterial infection. All 3 cases
have been traced to Martha's Vineyard [an island vacation spot off the
coast of Massachusetts. The boy apparently contracted the illness when he
was bitten by a tick while visiting the island, said health officials. He
is being treated with antibiotics. The 2 other suspected cases, which were
apparently contracted by breathing soil dust, are more serious because they
involved pneumonia.

uncommon, so the connection of the pneumonic form of tularemia to
inhalation of dust (or aerosols) suggested above may not be correct. - Mod.ES
