Oyster harvesting from lucrative Tomales Bay beds, one of the West Coast's
richest mollusk spots, has been suspended indefinitely as health officials
investigate why 110 people became sick beginning in early May. An unknown
contaminant was passed on to diners who complained of diarrhea, cramps,
vomiting, low-grade fever and chills. All Tomales Bay oysters were off the
market by May 15.
"We haven't had a California oyster in more than two weeks," said Steve
Sancimino of San Francisco's venerable Swan Oyster Depot. Sancimino and
other restaurants are getting oysters from Puget Sound, British Columbia
and other points in the Northwest. Even the Tomales Bay farmers are buying
oysters out of state to resell to customers so they won't turn to other
suppliers.
Officials are surprised that the contaminated oysters come from one of the
cleanest bodies of water on either coast. Tomales Bay, 37 miles northwest
of San Francisco, is considered ideal because it's usually free of
industrial contaminants and large vessels are too large to enter. Tomales
Bay oysters account for more than 80 percent of the $2.5 million-a-year
Marin County shellfish industry.
Health officials say manure runoff from nearby dairy farms may be the
source of contamination, but that usually happens after a rainstorm and
these oysters were harvested during a dry period. It could also be human
sewage dumped from a boat or a leak from a building, said Christopher
Wogee, the state's lead specialist for seafood safety.

[If the oyster harvesting was stopped on May 15th there should have been
adequate time to get, at least, a working identification of the cause by
now. Can any of our West Coast members inform us as to the nature of this
pathogen? - Mod.MHJ
