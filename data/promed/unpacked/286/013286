[BTV serotype 4 seems to have widely spread throughout Greece and southern Bulgaria, affecting almost exclusively sheep. This is not surprising: since sheep are known as the clinically affected species concerning most BTV serotypes. Infection in cattle and goats is common but known to remain subclinical (serotype 8 is an exception).

In the absence of vaccination, losses in sheep may be heavy, particularly in breeds known to be more susceptible. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue still rising in Italy
--------------------------------
A spate of bluetongue outbreaks has been reported across southern and central Italy in cattle and sheep.

According to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE], the 17 outbreaks hit sheep the hardest, killing 54 animals from 54 cases.

Two cases were confirmed in cattle, leaving 117 animals susceptible.

The report, dated 5 Aug 2014, is the latest update since 5 outbreaks were reported in similar locations in mid-July [2014].

The biggest farm to be infected was in Anagni, near Frosinone in the Lazio region, with 6 cases and 789 animals classed as susceptible following confirmation from the Teramo National Laboratory.

The worst hit regions were Calabria in the south west, Campina, and Lazio.

The outbreaks are the latest in ongoing surveillance efforts following confirmation of the disease in sheep in September last year [2013].

[For the details of the 17 new outbreaks covered in Italy's follow-up report no 16 of 5 Aug 2014, please see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15776. The report includes an interactive map.

This epizootic is caused by BTV serotype 1.

To view all BTV outbreaks in south Europe reported during 2014, please see OIE's global BTV map at http://tinyurl.com/o9hon45 (click on the cluster, zoom in). The observed apparent absence of outbreaks in Turkey is misleading; most likely, BTV-4 is currently circulating in this country as well. - Mod.AS]
