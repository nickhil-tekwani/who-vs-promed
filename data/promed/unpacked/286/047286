"Anthrax heroin" kills drug user in Kent
----------------------------------------
A drug user in Kent has died in hospital after injecting heroin
contaminated with anthrax, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed.

The agency said it was the fifth case of a drug user in England becoming
ill with anthrax, which is a severe bacterial infection.

[This death has been confirmed for me by a British HPA colleague, so this
young lady, previously reported, has unfortunately died. But there has been
a confusion. Originally it was announced on 4 Nov 2010
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/ProductsServices/LocalServices/SouthEast/SouthEastPressReleases/Kent/seast101103anthraxupdate/>)
but given a 3 Nov 2010 date and was identical with a prior release on 3 Nov
2010 except for a change in the title and the opening paragraph. This 4 Nov
2010 news release has since been deleted from the NHS website
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/>. Thus the need for confirmation. It will be
interesting to see if the strain associated with this recent death in south
east England is the same as those seen earlier this year in Scotland and
elsewhere.

In discussing these cases with my UK colleagues having to deal with sick
injecting drug users, it is now appreciated that injection anthrax has
joined the mix of aerobic and anaerobic infections associated with them.
Thus these patients are started on an empiric antibiotic cocktail of
penicillin G + flucloxacillin + ciprofloxacin + clindamycin + metronidazole
until a specific agent or agents have been identified. At which point the
treatment can be narrowed down, and then the emphasis shifts to supportive
therapy, which with injection anthrax can involve repeated radical
debridement and blood transfusions. - Mod.MHJ]

Shooting up -- infections among injecting drug users in the United Kingdom 2009

An update: November 2010
------------------------
Key messages:
- Needle and syringe sharing has declined in recent years, but almost a
fifth of injecting drug users continue to share.
- Infections are common among injecting drug users. Around a half of
injecting drug users have been infected with hepatitis C, a sixth with
hepatitis B, and about a third reported a symptom of a bacterial infection
(such as a sore or abscess) at an injecting site in the past year.
- The prevalence of HIV infection among those who have injected drugs
remains low and is estimated to be 1.5 per cent overall in the UK. However,
it varies across the country from 0.6 per cent in Scotland to 4.1 per cent
in London.
- The prevalence of HIV infection among current injectors has increased
from 0.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent over the past decade, and is now similar
to the level found in the early 1990s.
- The uptake of HIV testing is improving, with three quarters of injecting
drug users now reporting that they have had a test; however, almost a third
of injecting drug users with HIV remain unaware of their infection.
* The vast majority of HIV-infected injecting drug users in contact with
specialist HIV treatment services are receiving antiretroviral therapy.
