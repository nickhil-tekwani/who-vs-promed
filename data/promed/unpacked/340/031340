Your comments on exotic pet diseases on ProMED were most interesting [see
Exotic disease risk, traveling pets - UK 20040519.1332]. I cannot believe
how close some of the observations, reported in the Telegraph, are to
observations that a group in Edinburgh, and others, predicted (and that we
reported and enlarged upon) back in 1998. What I wrote at the time can be
found in the following publications. I can't say we didn't warn them. At
the time, these concerns were largely ignored, except by us.
I would now like to know whether sand flies did jump the Channel, and,
also, what the risk is of kennel-ticks becoming enzootic, with those 2
diseases that they carry.

I must admit that I didn't pay too much attention to their concerns at the
time. - Mod.MHJ]

Is it true, as posted, that there is no approved, or known, treatment for
leishmaniasis in dogs?

[I referred this question to my more knowledgeable colleague Tam Garland,
who replied: "Since leishmaniasis is an obligatory intracellular parasite,
host defenses are dependent on T-lymphocyte activity. T-lymphocyte regions,
in the lymphoid organs, become depleted, and B-cells proliferate in
response to infection. Without T-cell support, macrophages cannot kill the
amastigotes, and the parasite proliferates. Proliferation of B-lymphocytes,
histocytes, and macrophages results in lymphadoneopathy and
hepatosplenomegaly. Exuberant B-lymphocytes generate a large number of
circulating immune complexes (CIC), which deposit on the walls of blood
vessels causing vasculitis, polyarthritis and glomerulonephritis. In
canines, CIC deposition in the kidneys results in renal failure, which is
the main cause of death in leishmania-infected dogs. Cats are rarely
clinically affected.
The primary clinical findings are cutaneous involvement, although
dermatologic abnormalities, in the absence of other signs of disease, are
rare. Weight loss, and muscle atrophy, are the most common signs of
visceral involvement.
Diagnosis is based on finding amastigotes free, or in macrophages, in
giemsa-stained smears from lymph nodes or bone marrow (see below). Biopsy
material from liver or skin is also useful, as is serologic testing (IFA,
CF, ELISA). Serology is often used to verify the presence of antibodies but
does not prove, or disprove, active disease. Since dogs rarely
spontaneously eliminate the parasite, a positive titer should indicate
current infection.
Canine leishmaniasis is resistant to therapy. Most clinicians feel that the
dog never will eliminate the infection, and that re-treatment will be
necessary. The drugs of choice are pentavalent antimonials.
It should be remembered that leishmaniasis is zoonotic and a public health
concern, and care should be taken in both handling and treating canine cases.
All in all, treatment is generally not recommended, usually unrewarding,
and can take a toll on the animal." - Mod.MHJ]

[With the help of Colin Hamilton <quaff@dip.demon.co.uk> at QUAFF, I was
able to locate some Defra statistics on dogs and cats entering the UK.
These can be found at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/pets/procedures/stats.htm>
The numbers of cats recorded entering the UK:
in 2000 (11 months only): 2048
in 2001: 3562
in 2002: 4429
in 2003: 5979
The numbers of dogs entering the UK:
in 2000 (11 months only): 12 501
in 2001: 23 160
in 2002: 36 662
in 2003: 48 593
Taking the summer vacation months of May through Sep inclusively, the
number of dogs entering the UK:
in 2000: 6520
in 2001: 11 545, up 77 percent over 2000
in 2002: 18 829, up 63 percent over 2001
in 2003: 25 060, up 33 percent over 2002
In a few years, the dog numbers will level off.
While these numbers must include non-vacationing animals, and though they
give no idea of the time-density of risk with the vacationing dogs, the
reported perceived number of cases of canine babesiosis indicates a simple
incidence rate of around one to 2 percent of returning dogs. The true
incidence must await proper studies, perhaps, by UK veterinary graduate
students learning something about surveillance. - Mod.MHJ]
