It is not surprising to see the disease spreading to Bannerghatta Biological Park (Bangalore, Karnataka) as the park is within 100 km [62 mi] from [Kolar district in Karnataka] where an FMD outbreak is continuing. The park attracts thousands of tourists every day and one of the major roads to Bangalore passes through the said district. Further, one can take private vehicles into the park without many restrictions. Foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious and can become airborne and transmission by fomites is not uncommon.

This is monsoon season in India and Bangalore and surrounding areas have been affected by heavy rains during the last one month. An outbreak of FMD in nearby areas in cattle, large number of tourists visiting the park, and the moist weather conditions are the right mix for the outbreak to happen. Another source of virus could be the meat brought into the park for feeding the carnivores in the zoo, as well as safari.

Indicating domestic animals as the source of infection, endangering captive susceptible wild animals, is common knowledge (and often expressed by wildlife protectionists). The captive animals could possibly be partly protected, in a country like India, by 2 actions: indirectly by FMD control (vaccinations, biosecurity) of the farm animals, and directly by vaccination of the zoo animals (a tricky and expensive but feasible undertaking); even if both applied, success will be limited as long as the disease continues to be endemic. - Mod.AS
