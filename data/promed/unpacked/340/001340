[In November 2021, the first rhinotracheitis outbreak was confirmed in Kazakhstan.

"Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed worldwide but has been eradicated from a number of European countries and others have active eradication programs.

"Inactivated and attenuated live vaccines are available. The vaccines protect cattle clinically in case of infection and markedly reduce the subsequent shedding of field viruses. Although vaccination may not prevent field virus infection of individual animals, the spreading of wild-type virus in infected herds is efficiently reduced. The vaccines must not induce disease, abortion, or any local or systemic reaction, and must be genetically stable. BoHV-1 glycoprotein E deleted mutant marker vaccines are now generally available (live or inactivated) and can be used as part of a DIVA [Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals]) strategy."

IBR/IPV does not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
