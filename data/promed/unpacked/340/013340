I would like to agree with Dr. Robinson that the disease reported in
squirrels by the Ottawa Citizen is most likely to be a poxvirus infection
usually called "fibromatosis". As a disease, there is some resemblance
between this disease in squirrels and myxomatosis in European rabbits, as
there is between canine distemper in dogs and measles in people. They are
not the same disease, and the term "myxomatosis" for the disease in North
American squirrels is neither appropriate nor correct.

Contrary to the September 24 Ottawa Citizen report extracted in
ProMED-mail, the disease affecting gray squirrels (_Sciurus carolinenesis_)
in Ottawa is not myxomatosis, though it is a related member of the
Leporipox group, squirrel fibroma virus, or squirrel pox.
The infection is common in gray squirrels in eastern North America, and it
occasionally causes small outbreaks in juveniles, which is what seems to be
going on in Ottawa, based on my perusal of the news article on the Ottawa
Citizen web site. The term myxomatosis was applied to the disease by a
local rehabilitator, who also compared the disease to smallpox in humans,
though she did correctly point out that it was not a threat to people.
Although the virus will infect groundhogs (Marmota monax), this disease is
not considered a threat to animals other than gray squirrels.
The virus is transmitted by biting arthropods, and typically it causes one
or two fluctuant to firm cutaneous nodules which resolve spontaneously.
The most spectacular signs are multiple fungating cutaneous lesions, which
may ulcerate, and can prove fatal, often with complications.
Intracytoplasmic inclusions containing poxvirus are evident in epithelial
and connective tissue elements in the skin, and in the lung, lymph nodes
and kidneys in some cases.
There has been little published recently on this disease. Those interested
might consult M.N. Novilla et al., 1981. Systemic phycomycosis and
multiple fibromas in a gray squirrel (_Sciurus carolinenesis_). Journal of
Wildlife Diseases 17: 89-95 for an entre to the limited literature on
squirrel fibromatosis.
[It is just great to get these things straighten out. It appears we have
consensus from west to east; even John Cullen down south here in North
Carolina thinks it is likely to be fibromatosis. Thanks to all for the
information. - Mod. pc]
