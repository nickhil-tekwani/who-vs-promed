Human Infection with Avian I influenza A (H5N1) Virus in Asia;
Released 23 Sep, updated 5 Oct 2005
-----------------------------------
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ministry of Health in
Indonesia has reported the 4th laboratory-confirmed human case of avian
influenza A (H5N1) in Indonesia. The patient, a 27-year-old woman from
Jakarta, developed symptoms on 17 Sep 2005, was hospitalized on 19 Sep, and
died on 26 Sep. Preliminary investigations have indicated that the patient had
direct contact with diseased and dying chickens in her household shortly
before the onset of illness.
Indonesia has reported outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) among poultry
since June 2004. In July 2005, the 1st laboratory-confirmed human case of H5N1
infection in Indonesia was reported in a 38-year-old man who later died. His 2
young daughters also died of a severe pneumonia illness compatible with H5N1
infection; the 8-year-old daughter tested positive for antibodies to H5N1
virus and is therefore considered a probable H5N1 case by WHO.
The 2nd laboratory-confirmed case, reported on 19 Sep 2005, occurred in a 37-
year-old woman from Jakarta who became ill on 31 Aug and died on 10 Sep 2005.
The source of her infection is still under investigation; however, she was
reported to live in an area where chickens and ducks are present. Laboratory
specimens from poultry in the area are being tested.
The 3rd laboratory-confirmed case, reported by the Ministry of Health on 22
Sep 2005, occurred in an 8-year-old boy who was hospitalized for observation
and treatment.
In response to the most recent deaths, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, in
collaboration with WHO, has launched an epidemiologic investigation and
heightened surveillance for cases. Close contacts of the most recent cases are
being traced and monitored. In addition, some persons with respiratory
symptoms or possible exposure to H5N1 are being hospitalized for observation
and considered as suspect cases by the Ministry of Health until diagnostic
tests either confirm or rule out infection.
In addition, on 19 Sep 2005, the Ministry of Health of Viet Nam reported a new
laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to
WHO. This infection occurred in a 35-year-old man from Ben Tre Province in
southern Viet Nam; he became ill on 25 Jul 2005 and died on 31 Jul. Since mid-
December 2004, 64 human cases of H5N1 have been reported in Viet Nam, of which
21 were fatal.
During 2005, outbreaks of H5N1 among poultry have been confirmed in Cambodia,
China, Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, Russia, and Kazakhstan; poultry
outbreaks were also reported in Malaysia and Laos during 2004. Since Jan 2004,
116 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) have been reported to date: 91 in
Viet Nam, 17 in Thailand, 4 in Cambodia, and 4 in Indonesia, resulting in 60
deaths. CDC remains in communication with WHO and continues to closely monitor
the H5N1 situation in countries reporting human cases and animal outbreaks.
Most cases of H5N1 infection in humans are thought to have occurred from
direct contact with infected poultry in the affected countries. Therefore,
when possible, care should be taken to avoid contact with live, well-
appearing, sick, or dead poultry and with any surfaces that may have been
contaminated by poultry or their feces or secretions.
Transmission of H5N1 viruses to 2 persons through consumption of uncooked duck
blood may also have occurred in Viet Nam in 2005. Therefore, uncooked poultry
or poultry products, including blood, should not be consumed.
The threat of novel influenza subtypes such as influenza A (H5N1) will be
greatly increased if the virus gains the ability to spread from one human to
another in a sustained fashion. Such transmission has not yet been observed;
however, a few cases of limited person-to-person spread of H5N1 viruses may
have occurred. For example, one instance of probable person-to-person
transmission associated with close contact between an ill child and her mother
is thought to have occurred in Thailand in September 2004. More recently,
several clusters of human H5N1 cases in Viet Nam are being investigated for
possible person-to-person transmission of H5N1 viruses. So far, spread of H5N1
virus from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and
transmission has not been observed to continue beyond one person.
H5N1 infections in humans can cause serious disease and death. An inactivated
vaccine to protect humans against influenza A (H5N1) is not yet available, but
one is undergoing human clinical trials in the United States. The H5N1 viruses
currently infecting birds and some humans in Asia are resistant to amantadine
and rimantadine, 2 antiviral medications commonly used to treat influenza. The
H5N1 viruses are susceptible to the antiviral medications oseltamavir and
zanamavir, but the effectiveness of these drugs when used for treatment of
H5N1 virus infection is unknown. For more information about antiviral drugs
for influenza, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/treatment/>.
CDC has not recommended that the general public avoid travel to any of the
countries affected by H5N1. Persons visiting areas with reports of outbreaks
of H5N1 among poultry or of human H5N1 cases can reduce their risk of
infection by observing the following measures:
Before any international travel to an area affected by H5N1 avian influenza,
visit CDC's Traveler's Health Web page on Southeast Asia to educate yourself
and others who may be traveling with you about any disease risks and CDC
health recommendations for international travel in areas you plan to visit.
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/seasia.htm>
For a list of affected areas and other information about avian influenza, see
this website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>.
Be sure you are up to date with all your vaccinations, and see your doctor or
health-care provider, ideally 4-6 weeks before travel, to get any additional
vaccination medications or information you may need.
Assemble a travel health kit containing basic 1st aid and medical supplies. Be
sure to include a thermometer and alcohol-based hand gel for hand hygiene. See
the Travelers Health Kit page in Health Information for International Travel
for other suggested items. Identify in-country health-care resources in
advance of your trip. Check your health insurance plan or get additional
insurance that covers medical evacuation in case you become sick. Information
about medical evacuation services is provided on the U.S. Department of State
web page Medical Information for Americans Traveling Abroad, at
<http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1185.html>.
During travel to an affected area, avoid all direct contact with poultry,
including touching well-appearing, sick, or dead chickens and ducks. Avoid
places such as poultry farms and bird markets where live poultry are raised or
kept, and avoid handling surfaces contaminated with poultry feces or
secretions. As with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important
preventive practices is careful and frequent handwashing. Cleaning your hands
often with soap and water removes potentially infectious material from your
skin and helps prevent disease transmission. Waterless alcohol-based hand gels
may be used when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled.
Influenza viruses are destroyed by heat; therefore, as a precaution, all foods
from poultry, including eggs and poultry blood, should be thoroughly cooked.
If you become sick with symptoms such as a fever, difficulty breathing, or
cough, or with any illness that requires prompt medical attention, a U.S.
consular officer can assist [American citizens] in locating medical services
and informing your family or friends. Inform your health care provider of any
possible exposures to avian influenza. It is advisable that you defer further
travel until you are free of symptoms, unless your travel is health-related.
After your return monitor your health for 10 days. If you become ill with
fever and develop a cough or difficulty breathing, or if you develop any
illness during this 10-day period, consult a health-care provider. Before you
visit a health-care setting, tell the provider the following: 1) your
symptoms, 2) where you traveled, and 3) if you have had direct contact with
poultry. This way, he or she can be aware that you have traveled to an area
reporting avian influenza.
