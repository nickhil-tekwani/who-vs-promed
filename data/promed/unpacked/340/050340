More than 20 howler monkeys [_Alouatta_ sp.] have been found dead in April
2001 in forests in the municipalities of Santo Antonio das Missoes &
Garruchos, in the Missoes region of Rio Grande do Sul [RGS], Brazil. The
cause is suspected to be either yellow fever or poison.
Specialists from [the virus laboratory of] the Evandro Chagas Institute at
Belem, Para, the RGS state health secretariat and Ibama [forestry
department] are investigating. Yellow fever vaccination has been carried
out among residents of the
area near the Rio Uruguai and of the forests inhabited by howler monkeys.
[Deaths in howler monkeys in South America have historically indicated the
emergence of a new sylvan yellow fever outbreak, transmitted between
monkeys by _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes. Humans become tangentially infected
when working in or travelling through forests where a monkey epizootic is
occurring. Under the International Health Regulations, this occurrence of
suspected yellow fever should have been reported already to the World
Health Organization. - Mod.JW]
