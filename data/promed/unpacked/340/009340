Iraq: inadequate sewage disposal blamed for hepatitis E outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
2 boys happily play with pieces of plastic rubbish near a long puddle
of smelly green water that stands alongside a street in Sadr city,
east of Baghdad, seemingly oblivious to the potential health problems
they face. Ali, 11, says his mother constantly cleans the cement in
front of his house trying to keep the water at bay. Ali's mother's
attempts to keep things clean might be able to keep one family
healthy. But, the puddle of standing water, and others like it
nearby, is probably the culprit in more than 100 recent cases of
hepatitis E virus infection, a viral illness that feels like a bad
case of flu, commonly transmitted through human waste.
The outbreak was confirmed by Health Ministry officials (at the end
of March 2004) in this poor neighborhood, said Buthaina Ghanem,
public health officer for the communicable diseases department of the
UN World Health Organization's (WHO) Iraq office, working from Amman.
Omar Mekki, a medical officer at WHO-Iraq, working from Amman, told
IRIN that the Rustamiya sewage plant in central Baghdad, looted last
April 2004, still has not been fixed. Frequent power cuts stop water
pumps that keep sewage from flooding the streets. Even worse, the
sewage can get sucked into drinking water supplies once the pumps
start again, Mekki said. "The main sewage treatment plant is still
not working. It dumps one and a half tones of sewage into the Tigris
river everyday," Mekki said. "You can see it's pure sewage; the water
is black." With hot weather on the way, the ailing power grid will be
further strained as millions of Iraqis resort to air conditioning to
keep cool.
As the high season for diarrheal disease approaches in Iraq, WHO and
US Center for Disease Control officials are trying to remind people
to disinfect their water, Ghanem said. Officials recently passed out
chlorination tablets and put up posters reminding families to boil
their cooking water for at least 5 minutes, she said. "It's under
control now," Ghanem said. "But hepatitis is everywhere. We're
struggling to keep it within a normal range." So far in 2004,
cholera, also often transmitted by water, has also been kept at bay,
Ghanem said.
WHO officials are mandated to monitor water quality, but, the raw
sewage problem is so enormous, it's impossible to measure, Mekki
said. Water quality "upstream" to the north of Baghdad is not that
bad, but communities south of the capital bear the brunt of the
sewage. Private contractor Bechtel Corp. was given the job of
repairing the Rustamiya sewage plant, according to Jan Kellett,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Iraq press officer in
Amman. Poor security in the neighborhood apparently has kept Bechtel
from finishing the project, Kellett said. Bechtel officials were not
immediately available for comment. New sewage trunk lines are being
installed in the east Baghdad neighborhood of Gasiliya by UNDP,
Kellett said.

[Hepatitis A and E viruses are enteric viruses that are commonly
transmitted by contaminated water supplies. Hepatitis A virus
infection is vaccine preventable, but no vaccine is currently
available for control and prevention of hepatitis E virus infection.
There is no substitute for provision of clean water. - Mod.CP]
