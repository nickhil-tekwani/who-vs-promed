According to concerned departments of the Municipal Committee of Liuyang in
Hunan Province, around 15 Sep 2005, 95 students at Shuangshi Middle School
fell ill in Shegang Village, Liuyang City. Through evaluation by the
municipal center for disease control and the health bureau, food poisoning
and intentional poisoning have basically been ruled out. Early conclusions
point to flu. At the moment, aside from 17 students in relatively serious
condition transferred to downtown hospitals for treatment, most students
have already been discharged and returned to school.
It is understood that on the morning of 15 Sep [2005], concerned
departments in Liuyang City received a telephone report from Shuangshi
Middle School saying that 65 students had taken ill with fever, headache,
dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms. These students were
quickly brought to hospital. Clinical analysis and lab results indicated no
signs of poisoning. As of 2:00 PM that day, the number of ill students rose
to 95. According to the Liuyang Municipal Health Bureau, after the outbreak
Liuyang selected 80 health care workers to provide care, temporarily
opening wards with extra shifts for doctors and nurses to give ill students
immediate treatment.

[The article above does not mention respiratory symptoms, but does seem to
suggest a common source exposure with sudden onset; the apparent majority
of cases had onset on the same day, and it is mentioned early on that food
poisoning was ruled out as the etiology. Hence, given the brief description
of the illness given above, one wonders if this might be a norovirus
outbreak. It is not uncommon for people to refer to a norovirus-like
illness as "stomach flu".
Given the high degree of concern for unusual "flu-like" illnesses as an
alert to the possible introduction of a new pandemic influenza strain,
there is heightened interest in reporting these suspect types of outbreaks.
Though the above outbreak does seem to be more likely gastrointestinal than
respiratory, clearly more information is needed before drawing firm
conclusions. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the above
outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
