The sudden and inexplicable deaths of dozens of birds is probably linked to a disease, says an Icelandic ornithologist.

"Everything points to a disease or some other contagion at work when many adult birds die within a short period of time," said Gunnar Thor Hallgrimsson, an ornithologist and the director of the Southwest Iceland Nature Research Institute, to Visir.

Gunnar points out that in other countries, mass bird deaths are more common, and are usually the result of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, better known as the organism which causes botulism.

"There is no reason to rule out this possibility, even though [botulism] is not known to be present in Iceland," he said, cautioning that further investigations would be needed to get to the bottom of the case.

As reported, close to 100 dead birds -- most of them eiders, kittiwakes and cormorants -- have been found dead near a nesting area in Frotharrif, located on the Snaefellsnes peninsula in west Iceland [Westland region]. Samples of the birds will be sent to the US for further analysis, but for now, the cause of the die-off remains a mystery.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

Outside North America, the 1st outbreaks of botulism in wild birds were recorded in Australia in 1934, in Russia in 1957, and in Europe in 1963, 1st in Sweden and shortly after in Denmark, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. Botulism was also confirmed in South Africa (1965), New Zealand (1971), Japan (1973), Argentina (1979) and Brazil (1981). (For more information, see: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/PDF/pub07_waterbirds_part4.2.3.pdf.)

Although no evidence is presented to support the argument that this episode may be due to botulism, an outbreak investigation considering the possibility is warranted. - Mod.PMB
