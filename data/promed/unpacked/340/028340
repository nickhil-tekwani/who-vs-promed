Fresh sprouted microgreens associated with a _Salmonella_ outbreak were distributed more widely than originally thought. Canadian officials report the recalled sprouts were sent to Nova Scotia in addition to Ontario and British Columbia. The wider distribution of the Sunsprout brand sprouts is of particular concern because the recalled products have a shelf life through 13 Oct 2020. This is the 4th recall notice related to the microgreens, all of which include alfalfa sprouts.

"This recall was triggered by findings by the CFIA during its investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak. The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products," according to the updated recall posted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). "Public Health Ontario is investigating an outbreak of human illness associated with consumption of these products."

The product subject to the new recall is:

Brand / Product / Size / UPC / Codes
--------------------------------------
Sunsprout / Micro - Greens Alfalfa / 100 g / 0 57621 13511 6 / All best before dates up to and including BBOCT13.

[The number of cases and the serotype of the pathogen are not stated.

A number of significant pathogens, including _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, have been linked to transmission from ingestion of a whole variety of different kinds sprouts in the USA and elsewhere.

The following is a relatively recent review on outbreaks caused by sprouts:
Dechet AM, Herman KM, Chen Parker C, et al: Outbreaks caused by sprouts, United States, 1998-2010: lessons learned and solutions needed. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2014; 11(8): 635-44. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25076040/]

Abstract
--------
"After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the USA, affecting 1330 reported persons. 28 outbreaks were caused by _Salmonella_, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and one by _Listeria_. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprouts disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprouts safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden, but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation." - Mod.LL
