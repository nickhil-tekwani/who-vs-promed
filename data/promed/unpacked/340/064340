Foot and mouth disease in Botswana: Follow-up report No. 3

Information received on 1 Jun 2006 from Dr Musa Fanikiso, Director of
Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:

End of this report period: 1 Jun 2006.

Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype SAT2.

Date of start of the event: 11 Apr 2006.

Laboratories where diagnostic tests were performed:

1) Botswana Vaccine Institute, Gaborone. - complement fixation test;
RT-PCR were positive for serotype SAT2
2) Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom (OIE/FAO reference laboratory
for foot and mouth disease) RT-PCR was positive for serotype SAT2

Source of outbreaks or origin of infection:
- illegal movement of animals; contact with infected animal(s) at
grazing/watering; fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.).

Vaccination in response to the outbreaks (updated information): In
Selibe Phikwe district (zone 7), 101 290 cattle were vaccinated
inactivated trivalent SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 FMD vaccine.

Other details/comments:

- The disease is still confined to zone 7 ("infected zone").

- Sequence analysis and molecular epidemiological studies conducted
by both the Botswana Vaccine Institute and Pirbright Laboratory
(United Kingdom) showed the virus isolates were 96.41-97.14 percent
identical to the Botswana 2002 (Matsiloje) and Zimbabwe 2001
outbreaks. R-value comparisons showed that the field isolates
analysed were antigenically related (81.33-81.48 percent identical
and r-values 0.21-0.26) to the vaccine strain and therefore the
current vaccine is likely to confer protection against the disease virus.

- Primary vaccination is completed and booster vaccination is
scheduled from 1 to 15 Jun 2006. Repeat vaccination will be done in
September 2006.

- Active surveillance by examination of 12 808 cattle in zones 6 and
9 showed no evidence of the disease. At the report period, 1388 sera
samples (1192 from zone 9 and 196 from targeted surveillance in the
rest of the country) tested negative on solid-phase blocking ELISA
test for SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 at the Botswana Vaccine Institute.

- Movement control inside the country was lifted except for zones 6,
7, 8 and 9.
