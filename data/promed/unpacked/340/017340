Dr Myrna Cabotaje, the Department of Health Cordillera Administrative
Region (CAR) director, has warned citizens of the northern region
about how the mosquito-borne disease [virus], dengue fever, has
spread during the dry spell caused by El Nino. She went on to say
that people should not be lax in protecting themselves from
mosquitoes, and reminded citizens to be vigilant to prevent breeding
areas for the mosquitoes by keeping tight lids on water containers
and consistently clean their surroundings.

Dengue fever has increased by 10 percent from the same time last year
[2009] in the Cordillera Administrative Region.

A dengue fever outbreak in Malang regency, East Java, has killed 5
people over the past 3 months, local health authorities said Friday
[19 Mar 2010]. The 5 fatalities were part of the 550 people infected
by the dengue virus during that period, said the head of the Malang
Health Office for communicable disease prevention, Mulyatim Koeswo.
Out of the 550 infected people, 382 were infected in January [2010],
he said.

"Dengue fever attacks residents in 8 subdistricts of the regency
every year," Koeswo told Antara state news agency. East Java is one
of the most vulnerable provinces in Indonesia. During this year's
rainy season, dengue fever has also killed 4 residents from
Mojokerto, East Java.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that bites by [dengue
virus] infected female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes can transmit the
dengue virus to human beings.

In addition to dengue fever, about 700 people in Malang had also
suffered from chikungunya [disease], a viral disease caused by an
Alphavirus virus, which is also spread by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes, he said.

Both dengue fever and chikungunya disease hit locals during the rainy
season, in-line with the breeding season of the _Aedes_ mosquitoes,
he said.

[3] India (Kerala)
Date: Thu 18 Mar 2010
Source: The Times of India, Indo Asian News Service (IANS) report [edited]
<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thirupuram/Kerala-records-268-dengue-cases-in-2010/articleshow/5698150.cms>


Nearly 270 cases of dengue have been reported in Kerala this year
[2010], catching the authorities unaware as the mosquito-borne
disease [virus] usually spreads during the monsoon.

According to the latest report from the Kerala health department, the
state capital has accounted for 215 of the 268 dengue cases that have
been reported in state-run hospitals, while the figure is expected to
higher because there is no compilation of records from the numerous
private hospitals in the state. Ernakulam has reported 21 cases while
the remaining 12 districts have reported 32 cases between them.

Authorities are surprised as the fever has arrived months before the
monsoon, when the density of mosquitoes multiplies at a rapid pace.

Speaking to IANS, Thomas Mathew, who heads the department of
community medicine at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, said
that a recent study showed that 75 percent of the areas that have
reported the fever face water shortages. "The main reason for this is
that all these areas which reported a high rate of dengue cases face
a serious water shortage. There are areas under the
Thiruvananthapuram Corporation where water comes only once a week and
hence people are forced to store water and it is here that mosquitoes
breed," Mathew said. "The perception that dengue is associated with
the rains is wrong because the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases has in a study pointed out that it is endemic in nature," he
added.

Health minister PK Sreemathi Tuesday [16 Mar 2010] called a
high-level meeting to take stock of the situation. The meeting
decided to form a joint coordination committee of various departments
and to launch a campaign to spread awareness among the people,
officials said.

[This is an excellent example of how the necessity for household
water storage due to lack of a constantly available supply can create
situations for _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue virus vector, to breed
irrespective of rains.

[4] Madagascar ex Comoros
Date: Fri 19 Mar 2010
From: Jean-Michel Heraud <jmheraud@pasteur.mg> [edited]


The National Reference Laboratory (NLR) for Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic
Fever Virus at the Institut Pasteur from Madagascar wishes to report
what we believe to be the 1st case of dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) in
Union of the Comoros and probably in the Region. After developing
dengue-like illness, 2 scientists in a return from Moroni (Union of
The Comoros) visited the NLR. One of them had mild symptoms (fever,
headaches, myalgia) but the other one had more also dengue-like
syndrome (fever, headaches, arthralgia, myalgia) but also more severe
symptoms (hematuria, and rash). No malaria was found. Blood was
collected (sera) and molecular negative and serological analyses were
performed. IgM assays were positive for dengue and West Nile [virus
antibodies] for both sera. PCR confirmed DENV-3 viremia in one serum
[sample]. The virus is under investigation by the NLR.

Dengue activity is usually reported in East Africa and Islands of
South West Indian [Ocean] and during recent outbreak of chikungunya
[virus infection] in this region, co-circulation of DENV-1 was
notified in Toamasina (Madagascar) (Emerg Infect Dis 2008 Jul; 14(7),
[available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/7/1135.htm>]). The Union of the
Comoros reported an outbreak of dengue/DHF in 1993 due [dengue virus]
serotype 1 and in relation with high density of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes [Ann Soc Belge Med Trop 1994, 74(3): 217-29 [abstract
available at
<http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3391963>]. DENV-3 has
recently caused unexpected outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) in Sri Lanka, East Africa (Mozambique, Kenya and Somalia) and
Latin America (Emerg Infect Dis. 2003 Jul; 9(7):800-9; [available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no7/03-0038.htm>]).

Madagascar built a sentinel network which aims to monitor all fever
and in particular (malaria, arboviruses, and influenza). With this
information we need to intensify surveillance for further suspect
cases.

[5] Japan ex Tanzania
Date: Fri 19 Mar 2010
From: Tomohiko Takasaki <takasaki@nih.go.jp> [edited]


On 9 Feb 2010 and 10 Mar 2010, 2 imported dengue cases from Tanzania
were confirmed in Japan. The 1st case was a 55-year-old male who
stayed in Tanzania from 20-27 Jan [2010] and returned to Japan on 29
Jan [2010]. On 31 Jan [2010], he developed high fever (39 deg C [102
deg F], rash, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 98
000/microL). Dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) genome was detected in the
serum sample by real-time PCR and the virus was isolated. The
isolated DENV-3 demonstrated 99 percent homology with that previously
(GenBank No. AB447989) isolated from the patient who returned from
Cote d'Ivoire in 2008 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20080818.2573).

The 2nd case was a 23-year-old female who stayed in Dar Es Salaam,
Tanzania from 3-25 Feb [2010]. She returned to Japan on 28 Feb [2010]
via London. On 4 Mar [2010], she developed high fever (39 deg C [102
deg F]) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 40 000/microL),
leucopenia (WBC 1800/microL), and slight transaminase elevation (AST
154U/L, ALT 73 U/L). DENV-3 genome was detected in the serum sample
by real-time PCR. Anti-dengue IgG and IgM antibodies were positive.
Isolation of DENV is in progress.

Both cases were negative for chikungunya virus by RT-PCR.

We believe that there are the 1st 2 confirmed dengue fever cases
caused by DENV-3 among travelers to Tanzania. It is possible that
DENV-3 is being actively transmitted in Tanzania, although no dengue
outbreaks have been reported.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to the health professionals above for this
timely information. ProMED receives very few dengue outbreak reports
from Africa, so this report indicating dengue virus transmission in
Tanzania is most welcome, and we urge other health professionals with
1st-hand information of dengue virus transmission in Africa to submit
reports to ProMED as well.

A pregnant woman died from DHF in Honduras, raising the death toll
from the disease in the Central American country to 4 this year
[2010], the Health Ministry said. The 19-year-old woman was from
Jutiapa, a city in the Caribbean province of Atlantida, and died at a
hospital in the region several days ago.

The Health Ministry had confirmed Thursday [18 Mar 2010] that a
17-year-old boy from Orica, a city in the central province of
Francisco Morazan, died at the public Teaching Hospital in
Tegucigalpa, becoming the 3rd person to die from hemorrhagic dengue
in Honduras this year [2010]. A teenager and a man died from the
mosquito-borne disease [virus] in February [2010].

Health officials have registered 3124 cases of classic dengue this
year [2010], while 172 DHF cases, including the 4 people who died,
have been confirmed. Some 500 other people are believed to have
contracted DHF in Honduras this year [2010], health officials said.

Last year [2009], 4 adults and 8 children died from DHF in Honduras.
Honduras reported at least 367 cases and 9 deaths from DHF in 2008,
while classic dengue cases totaled more than 16 000.
