Top End residents and visitors are urged to cover up against mosquitoes following a recent case of Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] acquired in a remote Arnhem Land community.

"February to July marks the main risk period for the potentially fatal MVE, with the carrier being the common banded mosquito, _Culex annulirostris_," Vicki Krause, director Centre for Disease Control said.

Virus testing in sentinel chickens has indicated MVE [virus] activity in Katherine in January [2018] and Kunjin virus activity in the Darwin region in March [2018].

While numbers of the common banded mosquito are relatively low in urban areas, elevated mosquito numbers can occur in rural Top End areas at this time of year within 5 kilometres [3.106 mi approx.] of freshwater creeks, flood plains and swamps.

Since reporting began in 1974, a total of 37 MVE case have been notified in the NT, with the last case reported in the Katherine region in May 2015.

The current case is making a recovery in hospital.

MVE is a rare disease, but can potentially be fatal. The symptoms can include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor, seizures (especially in young children) and in some cases the disease can progress to delirium, coma, permanent brain damage or death.

People most at risk include campers, infants and young children residing near mosquito-breeding areas. People in remote Top End communities and anyone visiting parks and recreation areas where mosquitoes may be active are also at greater risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease, including MVE.

To minimise the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes, people should:

- use a protective repellent containing 20 per cent DEET or Picaridin as a supplement to protective clothing when outdoors in mosquito prone areas

- wear light-coloured clothing with long sleeves, long trousers and socks, between dusk and dawn in areas where mosquito bites are likely

- avoid outdoor exposure around dusk and at night near areas of dense vegetation and other areas of high mosquito activity

- use mosquito-proof accommodation and camping facilities at night

- use mosquito coils, mosquito lanterns and barrier sprays containing bifenthrin in patio and outdoor areas near houses

- ensure children are adequately protected against mosquitoes.

[Although this is just one single case, it does mean that MVE virus is circulating in the area and there is a risk that more cases could occur. Residents of the area are wise to follow the above recommendations to avoid mosquito bites. Murray Valley encephalitis virus occurs across Australia, but human cases are sporadic to rare, but can be severe. Wet weather in the Northern Territory can result in extensive breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. The use of sentinel chickens mentioned above is a standard method to provide an early warning system for transmission of several arthropod-borne viruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus. MVE-positive chickens can lead to efforts for vector control and to warn the public about the risk of infection and measures to avoid mosquito bites.
