PLANT PEST CLASSIFICATION: EUROPEAN PLANT PROTECTION ORGANIZATION
=================================================================
Date: Monday, 14 April 1997
From: Ian M. Smith <Smith@MHS.eppo.fr>

[Because ProMED-plant frequently posts reports from the European
and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), which
refer to A1 and A2 quarantine pests, I asked Ian M. Smith, the
Director-General of EPPO, if he would explain the A1/A2
classification. Dr. Smith kindly sends us the following post -
Mod. PKA]
Broadly, EPPO divides plant pests into "quarantine pests" and
"non-quarantine pests". The former are absent from areas of
concern (at national or subnational level) and justify plant
quarantine measures to prevent them from being introduced into
those areas. The latter are either present in the area of
concern (so that plant quarantine measures are not needed), or
irrelevant to it (a banana pest in Finland), or unimportant
(falling below a threshold of economic impact which has not been
exactly defined and in any case varies according to the authority
concerned). [While ProMED-plant reports on plant diseases, FAO
and EPPO use the term pest as defined in the International Plant
Protection Convention to encompass all biotic agents that are
harmful to plants, including viroids, viruses, fungi, bacteria,
nematodes, arthropods and weeds - Mod. PKA]
EPPO tries to identify the most important quarantine pests for
its region (which is all of Europe, the Mediterranean and
Russia). The A1 pests are a group of about 200 which are absent
from all that region; there is agreement between the Member
Governments that they should be kept out by plant quarantine
measures. The A2 pests are a group of about 100 which are
present in a limited number of countries in the region; there is
agreement between the Member Governments that those in whose
territories they are absent may take measures to keep them out.
As a result of the EPPO recommendations, individual Member
Governments have basically established their own lists, which
take account of EPPO recommendations but not necessarily in every
respect.
The EPPO Reporting Service constantly monitors the literature and
other sources for new information about the listed quarantine
pests, and particularly for changes in their geographical
distribution. Every year a few pests are added to the lists, in
reaction to new discoveries, new outbreaks, changes in
agricultural practices, etc. The process of PRA (pest risk
analysis) is used to decide whether to add a pest to the list.
There are hundreds, or thousands, of unlisted quarantine pests
for the EPPO region. For one reason or another, they simply have
not attracted attention (yet). If, because of a change in
circumstances (new trade, new crops cultivated), they attract
attention, they may be candidates for the lists. In any case, if
an unlisted pest (confirmed to be absent from the importing
country) is found in an imported consignment at import
inspection, it will very probably justify measures (refusal,
treatment, destruction) on the basis of an immediate PRA. In
other words, it is treated as a quarantine pest. If it is not
seen again, probably no further action will be taken. If it
appears regularly, a process will start which could lead to
inclusion on the national or EPPO lists.
EPPO also monitors anything that seems interesting about such
non-listed pests. They are, potentially, the "new" pests.
