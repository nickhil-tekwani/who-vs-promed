Two cases of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease reported in Malaysia
------------------------------------------------------------
MALAYSIA: A 15-month-old baby from Changlun, Jitra near Alor Setar, is
[ill with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) after a 2-month stay in
Singapore. Kedah State Health and Unity Committee Chairman Datuk V.
Saravanan said the boy, was diagnosed with the disease last Sunday, 2 days
after returning from the Republic of Singapore. The child was admitted to
hospital after a blood test confirmed he had HFMD virus. His condition is
stable [according to a news agency report. The child and his 4-year-old
brother were taken by their mother to Singapore to visit their father who
is working there. The 3 of them stayed in the Republic for 2 months.
Realizing that there was an HFMD outbreak in Singapore, the child's mother
decided to take her children back to Kedah. However on 8 Oct 2000, the
boy's mother found that there were rashes on his hands and mouth, and the
boy was admitted to the Alor Setar Hospital. This child is the first HFMD
case reported in Kedah state and the Kedah Health Department had taken
steps to ensure the disease did not spread in the state.
In Kuala Terengganu, the Terengganu Health Department confirmed that a
10-year-old boy in Kemaman had contracted HFMD. The boy was found to have
ulcers in his mouth, [as well as reddish spots on his palm and soles, when
he sought medical treatment at a government clinic. He was given outpatient
treatment as his condition was not serious. So far this boy is the only
HFMD case reported in Terenganu State.

[This report states that the diagnosis of HFMD in the 2-year old child in
Kedah State was confirmed by a blood test. Information on the nature and
specificity of this test are important, since a first report from Singapore
suggests that both Enterovirus 71 and an undefined Coxsackie virus are
circulating in this epidemic. -Mod.CP
