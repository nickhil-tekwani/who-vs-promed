In Alagoas state, 15 cases of Zika virus have been registered, distributed in 7 municipalities: Maceio 7 cases, Mata Grande 3 cases, and Arapiraca, Delmiro Gouveia, Maribondo, and Santana do Ipanema each with 1 case.

The cases were confirmed [as Zika virus infections] by the Instituto Evandro Chagas, Para state. The Institute is a national reference laboratory for Zika and chikungunya virus tests, as recommended by the Ministry of Health, to provide these services for the north and northeastern states that do not have laboratories able to carry out tests on these collected samples.

"The transmission of [Zika] virus did not occur in individuals who traveled outside the state, as one might imagine. That occurred within the state," said Cleide Moreira, Director of Epidemiological Surveillance of SESAU [Alagoas State Secretariat of Health]."

[Zika virus continues to spread to other localities in Brazil. There are no barriers to stop its spread to other areas where dengue virus is also transmitted, because these viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito vector. A clinical diagnosis is complicated by the similarity of symptoms between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections. It is good to see the national reference laboratory playing this important role in diagnosis.
