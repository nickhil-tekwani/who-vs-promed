New _Plasmodium vivax_ infected patient in Greece
-------------------------------------------------
I would like to announce that we had from 19 Sep 2011 a new case of
malaria with _P. vivax_ in a patient who lived in Greece for the last
3 years and returned 3 weeks ago. He worked in the south, in the same
region as the previous patient
(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19954),
in the Leimonas village, near Skala and Elos.

The traveler had no history of travel to any malaria-endemic areas.
The patient was a citizen from Romania and was admitted and diagnosed
at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious and Tropical Diseases Dr V
Babes in Bucharest.

[The last patient was reported from Romania on 1 Aug 2011, and the
present case adds up to 8 cases of _P. vivax_ infected in Greece since
June 2011. The patients were infected in 2 areas: Euboea and the
Evrotas river basin.

It is disturbing that new cases continue to appear. We speculated
earlier that the cases resulted from migrant workers from endemic
areas being asymptomatic gametocyte carriers, but as new cases
continue to be found, local reservoirs in these 2 regions must be
considered.

Surveys of blood films, perhaps seropositivity for malaria antibodies
and investigation of sporozoites in the local _Anopheles_ population
would help define the situation.

ProMED-mail will be happy to publish further information. - Mod.EP]
