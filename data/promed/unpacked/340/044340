Brazil: 4 Rocky Mountain spotted fever deaths reported in Campinas
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Municipality of Campinas in São Paulo State confirmed 2 more deaths of residents from Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), bringing the total to 4 in 2022.

The following is the list of the fatalities:
Female, 36 years old: onset of symptoms on 28 Jul 2022. The probable site of infection is in the South region. She died on 4 Aug 2022.
Female, 45 years old: 1st symptoms on 1 Jul 2022. The probable site of infection is in the East region. She died on 5 Jul 2022.
Male, 66 years old: onset of symptoms on 24 Jun 2022 and died on 30 Jun 2022. Infected, probably, in Sousas.
Male, 18 years old: died on 24 Apr 2022 (1st case)

According to health officials, the coldest and driest months, which consist of the dry season, are the ones with the highest transmissibility of spotted fever.

According to the Ministry of Health, spotted fever is an infectious, acute febrile disease of variable severity. It can range from mild and atypical clinical forms to severe forms, with a high fatality rate. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by a bacterium of the genus _Rickettsia_, transmitted by tick bites.

In Brazil, 2 species of rickettsiae are associated with clinical pictures of spotted fever: _Rickettsia rickettsii_, which produces the serious disease registered in the North of the State of Paraná and in the states of the Southeast region and _Rickettsia_ sp. Atlantic Forest strain, which is recorded in Atlantic Forest environments, producing less severe clinical conditions.

In Brazil, the main vectors and reservoirs are ticks of the genus _Amblyomma_, such as _A. sculptum_ (_A. cajennense_) known as star tick, _A. aureolatum_ and _A. ovale_. However, potentially, many other species of ticks can be reservoirs of the bacteria that cause spotted fever, such as the dog tick.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the primary cause of this illness, which is also known as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. _R. parkeri_ and _R. akari_ may also be involved. The organisms, which are tickborne, are distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog or other animal. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (a flat rash with small raised bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric (small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin), involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpurae usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
