With regards to the outbreak of equine infectious anemia in Kentucky, there is a vaccine for EIAV and the veterinarians should make use of it. An EIAV vaccine has been developed and manufactured by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (HVRI), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). Dr. Yiming Shao (<yshao08@gmail.com>) has been cooperating with HVRI for development of AIDS vaccine candidates based on the success of the EIAV vaccine. The president of HVRI, Dr. Xiangang Kong, has recently been informed of the situation in Kentucky. If veterinarians want to know more about the EIAV vaccine product, Dr. Kong can be reached at <xgkong@hvri.ac.cn>.

[While this sounds promising, as a veterinarian I could not find that this vaccine is marketed. I sought the assistance of the USDA and received the response below. - Mod.TG]

Regarding the above-mentioned vaccine:

1st, the Virus Serum Toxin Act requires that all vaccines sold or distributed within or from the United States be licensed. The USDA, APHIS, Veterinary Services, Center for Veterinary Biologics would be happy to evaluate data regarding the vaccine if or when it's submitted for licensure.

2nd, it should be of special interest to your audience that in the Li et al., 2003 article (page 7248) in the section "Commercially available diagnostic assays," the authors state: "These reactivities demonstrated that horses inoculated with the EIAVUK[delta]S2 can be detected by the more sensitive diagnostic assays that are the basis of USDA and other national regulatory policies to control EIAV infection, suggesting a need for diagnostics that can distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected horses."

That is, vaccinated horses would be seropositive on tests currently used to detect EIA infection in national control programs.

If additional information is desired, please don't hesitate to let us know.

[I wish to thank Dr. Levings for his rapid response to my query about this vaccine.

It would seem that the vaccine developers have neither licensed the product in the United States, nor have they invested in technology that would make this a DIVA vaccine. A DIVA vaccine has a marker or a gene deletion such that, with appropriate testing (often developed by the vaccine manufacturer), it can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA).

Consequently, this vaccine is not available for use in the EIA cases in Kentucky, or anywhere else in the United States at the moment. - Mod.TG
