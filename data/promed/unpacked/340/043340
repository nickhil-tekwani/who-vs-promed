A new Cornell University study finds North American white-tailed deer -- shown in 2021 surveys of 5 states to have coronavirus infection rates of up to 40% -- shed and transmit the virus for up to 5 days once infected. "It's a relatively short window of time in which the infected animals are shedding and are able to transmit the virus," said Dr Diego Diel, associate professor and director of the Virology Laboratory at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine's Animal Health Diagnostic Center.

The study, published in PLoS Pathogens [see reference below], also identified that the virus develops and replicates in the deer's respiratory tract, lymphoid tissues -- including tonsils and several lymph nodes -- and in central nervous system tissues. "Virus replication in the upper respiratory tract -- especially the nasal turbinates [nose structures] -- is comparable with what is observed in humans and in other animals that are susceptible to the infection," Diel said, "and I think that's probably one of the reasons why the virus transmits so efficiently." As with humans, the virus spreads between deer through nasal and oral secretions and aerosols.

The findings are critical for guiding epidemiological and immunological studies of the COVID-19 virus in wildlife to determine if deer can act as reservoirs that maintain the virus in nature independent of humans. Last year [2021], researchers traced multiple introductions of the virus that causes COVID-19 from people into deer populations in several US states.

Identifying target tissues where the virus replicates during infection could also provide useful information for those who hunt deer. While there is currently no evidence that humans have caught COVID-19 from deer, epidemiologists and others are concerned that hunters could become infected while harvesting an infected kill.

"Given the broad practice of deer hunting in the US, knowing the sites of virus replication is important to minimize the risks of exposure and transmission from these wild animals that could be potentially transmit the virus back to humans," Diel said.

White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) is the cervid most widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. The ACE2 receptor (where SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter the cell) of white-tailed deer is very similar to that of humans. This work expands the experimental study conducted by the same group and reported in ProMED post 20210116.8108967, published in the Journal of Virology (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.00083-21).

Many wild white-tailed deer populations across USA and Canada were found infected at high prevalences with several SARS-CoV-2 variants. These consistent findings strongly suggest that following the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from humans, transmission is occurring among deer in the wild at a rate that makes deer populations a suitable compartment where the virus may be maintained and evolve, and then perhaps spill back to humans or other animals as a new variant. This new evidence shows that viral evolution is taking place in white-tailed deer, and it also suggests spill-back may be occurring. The significance of this new variant to public health largely depends on its transmissibility and pathogenicity in humans, so surveillance and research efforts should prioritize the production of data relevant to those traits. - Mod.PMB
