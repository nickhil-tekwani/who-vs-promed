Paraguay confirms 1st death from yellow fever in 100 years
----------------------------------------------------------
Paraguay?s Ministry of Public Health confirmed Tue 5 Feb 2008 the 1st
death from yellow fever in 100 years. It was a 24-year-old man who
lived in a rural area near San Estanislao 200 km north of Asuncion
(the capital), in forested San Pedro department. There are 4 more
suspected cases. The area has been quarantined, destruction of
mosquito habitats and YF vaccination of 50 000 people in the area are
being carried out.

Specialists in the Ministry of Health suspect that forest fires in the
area last year [2007], which destroyed thousands of hectares, forced
the migration of monkeys and vector mosquitoes into more populated
areas. The Director of Epidemiological Surveillance said that the
last case of YF in the country was more than 30 years ago, and the
last death from YF was in 1904.

[There is a serious intrusion of YF into the transition zones in the 3
countries Paraguay, Brazil & Argentina. Ciudad del Este, on the Rio
Parana ? see 2nd map below -- is where the 3 countries meet, and is
the location of the Iguassu Falls, where monkeys suspected of having
died from YF have been found ? see ProMED ref. below.
