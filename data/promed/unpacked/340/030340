Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 28 Jan 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 3 Feb 2021
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Peste des petits ruminants virus
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Bufai, Prachantakham, Prachin Buri
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Goats / 76 / 76 / 55 / 21 / 0
Affected population: a breed of the goat in this case is pygmy goat.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 100 / 72.37 / 72.37/ 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: The source of the outbreak tends to be the introduction of peste des petits ruminants virus from imported pygmy goat (exotic species) from Western Africa. The infected goats have shown respiratory signs, cough, abundant eye discharges, and diarrhea. The morbidity rate is 100% and the mortality rate is 72%. This herd was quarantined in an isolated premise which within 1 kilometer [0.62 mi] radius from the infected premise has no ruminant farm. Moreover, there is no animal movement on this farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; quarantine; stamping out; zoning; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / Goats / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 3 Feb 2021 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st time that peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is reported to occur in Thailand. According to the epidemiological comments: "The source of the outbreak tends to be the introduction of peste des petits ruminants virus from imported pygmy goat (exotic species) from Western Africa."

"PPR was first reported in 1942 in Ivory Coast. Since then, the disease has spread far beyond its origin in Western Africa. In the past 15 years, its dissemination has been exponential and PPR is now present in over 70 countries across Asia, Africa, and the Near and Middle East, having reached Europe in 2016 (Georgia)." (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/distribution/)

"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle, and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible, although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established.

"The clinical disease resembles rinderpest in cattle. It is usually acute and characterized by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea, and pneumonia, and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes, particularly in the mouth. At necropsy, erosions may be noted in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The lungs may show interstitial bronchopneumonia and often secondary bacterial pneumonia. PPR can also occur in subclinical form.

"PPR must be confirmed by laboratory methods, as bluetongue, foot and mouth disease and other erosive or vesicular conditions, as well as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, can cause clinically similar disease.

"There are no known health risks to humans working with PPRV as no report of human infection with the virus exists." (extracted from OIE Terrestrial Manual Chapter 3.7.9 Peste des Petits Ruminants [Infection with Peste des Petits Ruminants] https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.09_PPR.pdf).

"PPR has severe negative socioeconomic impacts on the income of livestock farmers and, in particular, the livelihoods and food security of the most vulnerable rural communities, notably of women." (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/distribution/). - Mod.CRD
