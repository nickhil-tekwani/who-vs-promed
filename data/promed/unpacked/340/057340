2 Feb 2017: New scoring system predicts Ebola severity
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/p-nss012517.php
[Researchers have developed a new scale, described in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, which can help predict which patients are most at risk of dying from EVD [Ebola virus disease].
The researchers found that malaria co-infection, extremes in age, and delayed healthcare seeking behavior were all associated with mortality. Additionally, symptoms including disorientation, hiccups, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, shortness of breath, and muscle aches were all predictors of death. By combining these factors into statistically weighted disease scores, the researchers were able to predict death at triage with 91% accuracy and predict death after triage with 97% accuracy.

[Being able to predict outcome of Ebola virus infection may assist doctors when difficult choices need to be made with scarce resources. However, human genetics will likely also play a role in outcome. Nonetheless, these researchers were able to predict death at triage with 91% accuracy and predict death after triage with 97% accuracy. Those are impressive figures. - Mod.LK]

3 Feb 2017 Queensland AU: Queensland-led team develops effective economical Ebola treatment
https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2017/02/queensland-led-team-develops-effective-economical-ebola-treatment
[An effective and economical treatment for Ebola patients has been developed by an international team led by Queensland researchers.
The post-exposure treatment made with antibodies from horses could be used in the next Ebola outbreak.
The research was led by UQ School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience's Professor Alexander Khromykh and QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute's Professor Andreas Suhrbier.
"This is a cost-effective treatment that can be used in low-income countries in Africa where equine production facilities are already in operation for producing snake-bite antivenin," Professor Khromykh said.
"It's the 1st time that equine antibodies have been shown to work effectively against Ebola infection.
"The research resulted from a strong collaboration between Australian, French and Russian scientists and a local QLD [Queensland] company."]
[Immunotherapy by passive treatment with antibody of animal origin has been used for over 120 years to treat bacterial and viral infections. Equine antibodies are notably used in rabies treatment. A paper considering this approach with Ebola virus disease was published in 2015, J-PChippaux et al.Post-exposure treatment of Ebola virus using passive immunotherapy: proposal for a new strategy. J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis. 2015; 21: 3. Published online 2015 Feb 15. doi: 10.1186/s40409-015-0003-1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336475/. - Mod.LK]

Funding
------
3 Feb 2017: Ebola grant expanded from USD 12 million to USD 24 million
http://www.knopnews2.com/content/news/Ebola-grant-expanded-from-12-million-to-24-million-412682343.html
[A USD 12 million grant awarded in 2015 to establish the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC) has been doubled to USD 24 million to allow for a variety of expanded services, including creation of a special pathogens research network.
The grant awarded to the co-leads of NETEC -- the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Emory University in Atlanta, and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue in New York City -- will run in tandem with the original 5-year grant. Funding is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.]

AFC invests USD 205 million in Guinea
http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2017/02/afc-invests-205m-in-guinea/
[According to Chief Investment Officer of Africa Finance Corporation [AFC] Oliver Andrews, AFC is developing African economies that have suffered conflict and crisis. For example, we were instrumental in the reconstruction of Cote d'Ivoire, following the country's civil war, through investments such as Henri Konan Bridge and, in Liberia, we financed the post-Ebola rebuilding of certain fuel import and storage facilities damaged by the country's long running civil conflicts. Equally, investment in Guinea's infrastructure will help to rebuild and diversify the economy following the Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] crisis.]
