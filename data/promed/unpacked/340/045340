2nd anthrax outbreak hits Chobe area
------------------------------------
Buffalo and elephants continue to die, as the 2nd outbreak of anthrax has
hit the Chobe area, extending to Pandamatenga and Nogatshaa. Kasane-based
wildlife officer Sennye Neo-Mahupeleng told the Botswana Press Agency
(BOPA) that, in the past 2 weeks, 31 elephants have died in the
Poha-Nogatshaa area, while, in the Pandamatenga area, 21 buffalo and 2
elephants have died. But she said her department is still investigating the
cause of death in the Pandamatenga area. "The incidents of death along the
Chobe river front between Sedudu and Ngoma have since gone down, as there
were days when no mortality was recorded," she said.
A total of 830 carcasses have been destroyed to date. The most affected
animals are buffalo, with 725 deaths, and elephants, with 60 carcasses found.
She said that, due to limited resources, the department could not dispose
of 17 carcasses, as they were in water, and the Namibians took other
carcasses across the border. Mahupeleng said the disposal measures in place
are burning and burying of the carcasses. Vehicles that enter the park are
sprayed with formalin as they leave the park to reduce the risk of
spreading the disease.
The 1st outbreak of anthrax was in September of this year [2004]. At that
time, wildlife officials found 19 buffalo carcasses that tested positive
for anthrax infection. Mahupeleng observed that the newly affected areas
have few tourist activities taking place, so there is no need to close
them. "In fact, the department does not have camping sites in these areas,"
she said. She said the area along the river front is now closed to avoid
interference from visitors and to allow for daily scouting for carcasses
and for burning and burying.
The Department of Wildlife warns people against eating meat from animals
that have died through mysterious circumstances, as the disease can be
passed to humans.
