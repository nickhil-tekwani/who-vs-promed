Plague update: suspected pneumonic plague cases recorded in DRC
---------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to a report on a plague outbreak in Ituri province in northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officials say they are investigating a cluster of deaths due to suspected pneumonic plague were recorded in the health zone of Fataki, Ituri province. The cluster, which began on 22 Apr 2021, has resulted in 19 suspected pneumonic plague cases, including 11 deaths were recorded in 2 health areas (Bu-Kachele and Bule) of the Fataki health zone.

The patients presented with headache, fever, chills, coughing sometimes with blood, dyspnea, and vomiting blood. An investigation was conducted during which suspected cases were identified and samples taken to be shipped to the Institut National de Recherche Biom√©dicale (INRB) in Kinshasa for confirmatory testing.

Pneumonic plague, which is the most severe form of plague caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, can be transmitted between people through breathing airborne droplets or through contact with the patient's bloody sputum. The severe lung infection has a high mortality rate, but it can be cured if treated with antibacterial drugs at an early stage.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. It is the pneumonic form of infection that can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
