We also used mouse brain killed JE vaccine with 3 shots. You can review
our publication in J. Med. Virol 44(2):122 by Ku et al (l994). We found
that Beijing strain was better than Nakayama for Chinese children living in
city, rural area and isolated islands. Regarding the JE vaccine in China,
Dr. Tsai and Dr. Jeff Chang at CDC know more about [this. If you have
further questions, please contact them.
Happy New Year of the Tiger.

[Ted Tsai (DVBID, CDC, Fort Collins replied: "The vaccine mentioned by
Henry Wilde is the live attenuated SA14-14-2 JE vaccine developed and
produced in China. The involvement of US researchers, mainly through Scott
Halstead's efforts, has been to perform further evaluations of safety,
effectiveness and immunogenicity - essentially to validate the published
Chinese results with more fully characterized studies. It clearly is a
safe and effective vaccine; however, it is produced and available only in
China. A Korean company is seeking licensure of the vaccine in Korea with
hopes of distributing it there and, potentially, internationally; however,
it is unclear when that approval process will be completed. As far as cost
is concerned, the vaccine's cost is government subsidized in China so,
although I've been quoted a cost of 3 cents per dose for public health
programs in China, the real cost, if the vaccine were to be produced in a
free market system under internationally acceptable standards, is bound to
be higher. Please see "Vaccines" - edited by Plotkin and Mortimer. I
wrote the JE vaccine chapter. The third edition of the book is in press."
Thanks to Ted for this knowledgeable response.
Thanks also to C.C. for her input but I must correct one small assumption.
It may be the Year of the Tiger in China but it is the Year of the Bronco
in Colorado (and Green Bay). - Mod.CHC
