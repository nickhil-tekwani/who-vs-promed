On 11 Sep 2013, a slaughtered cow from Appenzell Outer Rhodes was diagnosed with tuberculosis at post mortem inspection. The official veterinarian immediately put restrictions on the farm of origin. Meanwhile it was confirmed that the animal tested positive for _Mycobacterium caprae_. Skin tests [tuberculin] on the farm gave positive results on more animals, which will be slaughtered.

A total of 10 animals tested positive and have been slaughtered already. Organ samples will be tested for the bacterium. A further 10 animals gave an inconclusive result and will be slaughtered as well to prevent transmission of disease. The remainder of the herd tested negative. There is no connection with recent confirmation of [bovine tuberculosis] bTB in the West of Switzerland.

Further investigations will look into the possibility that the animal might have become infected with "deer tuberculosis" during the summer of 2011 when it had been put out to grazing (transhumance) in Vorarlberg (Austria).

A search for contact farms is ongoing and investigations are underway to identify the origin of the infection.

The farm is under restrictions, which will only be lifted after 2 clear [negative] tuberculin tests are obtained. So far no other farms in the region are affected.

Humans can become infected when drinking raw [unpasteurised] milk or through contact with an infected animal but the risk is low. Milk from the affected holding has not been processed for food.

Cattle from Liechtenstein and Switzerland might have become infected with the disease in Vorarlberg (Austria). There is a possibility that the animals became infected through contact with wildlife at Lech in [the valley of] Montafon. 4 animals tested positive of which 2 have already been slaughtered.

There is only a small risk for humans.

Switzerland obtained its status as a country officially free of bovine tuberculosis in 1960. Since 1980, the control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has been reduced to passive abattoir surveillance, in line with OIE's requirements as specified in chapter 11.6 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm).

Isolated cases of bTB, partly due to reactivation of human _Mycobacterium bovis_ infections with subsequent transmission to cattle, have been noticed in Switzerland over the years. After the absence of bTB since 2000, 2 outbreaks, caused by _M. bovis_ spp. _bovis_ (_M. bovis_), were reported in March 2013 from west Switzerland: the 1st one related to a single dairy cow in the canton Fribourg; the 2nd one related to a single dairy cow in neighbouring canton Vaud, which originated from the index farm in Fribourg and therefore was not regarded a spread of the infection. The current case, on the opposite (eastern) side of the country, has been caused by _M. bovis_ spp. _caprae_ (_M. caprae_).

According to information published by Switzerland's Federal Veterinary Office (FVO), to investigate the possibility that the animal might have become infected with _M. caprae_ during the summer of 2011 while grazing in Vorarlberg (Austria), systematic sampling of other cows, which were grazing in the Vorarlberg Alps during the same period, has been undertaken. This relates to around 104 live animals spread over 27 farms in 5 eastern Swiss cantons and in the Principality of Liechtenstein.

No bTB cases have been reported from Liechtenstein to the OIE, at least since 2002; the last year of occurrence is not known. Austria reported, during 2012, 3 outbreaks in Tyrol. During January-June 2013, 2 outbreaks were reported from Tyrol and 2 from Vorarlberg. Germany reported 6 outbreaks during 2012; locations not given. No report is yet available for January-June 2013.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is caused primarily by _Mycobacterium bovis_ spp. _bovis_ (_M. bovis_) and, to a lesser extent, by _Mycobacterium bovis_ spp. _caprae_ (_M. caprae_).

According to chapter 2.4.7 ("Bovine tuberculosis") of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, "Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_ and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis. In countries with tuberculosis eradication programmes, clinical evidence of tuberculosis in cattle is seldom encountered because the intradermal tuberculin test enables presumptive diagnosis and elimination of infected animals before signs appear."

Switzerland, similarly to its mentioned neighbouring countries, maintains its status as "officially bTB free", since "_M. bovis_ infection was not present in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle for 5 consecutive years". Switzerland's cattle population (OIE 2012 data) is 1 570 344 head in 41 000 establishments.
