Resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) found in some European influenza virus
samples
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary results from a survey of antiviral drug susceptibility among
seasonal influenza viruses circulating in Europe has revealed that some of
the A (H1N1) viruses in circulation this winter [2007-2008] are resistant
to the antiviral drug, oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu). So far, 148
samples of influenza A(H1N1) viruses isolated during November and December
[2007] from 10 European countries [see comment below - Mod.CP] have been
tested by the EU funded VIRGIL [European surveillance network for vigilance
against viral resistance.] Of the 148 samples, 19 showed evidence of
resistance to oseltamivir.
Of the samples that tested positive for resistance to oseltamivir 12 came
from Norway. This was from a total of 16 virus samples sent for testing.
Given the initial indication of a high level of resistance to oseltamivir
in the A H1N1 viruses circulating in Norway, late last week [21-27 Jan
2008] once the information came to their attention, the Norwegian
authorities notified their EU partners and the World Health Organization
(WHO) of this situation. The Norwegian Public Health Institute also
published an advisory notice to doctors and the public on its website that
evening.
Experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),
the European Commission, and WHO are currently assessing the significance
of the data from the VIRGIL network. An interim joint assessment will be
published in the coming days, based on the limited data currently available.
At this stage it is impossible to say what the level of resistance is in
influenza across Europe. However from the limited data, the proportion of
influenza viruses exhibiting resistance to oseltamivir must be significant,
but not as high as in Norway. People who become ill with the oseltamivir
resistant strain of A(H1N1) do not appear to become any [sicker] than
people infected with "normal" seasonal influenza. That said, it should be
remembered that any influenza A can cause severe disease or death in
vulnerable people (older people, those with debilitating illnesses, and the
very young).

[The Summary Statement of the ECDC Risk Assessment -- 27 Jan 2008 --
Emergence of seasonal influenza viruses type A/H1N1 with oseltamivir
resistance in some European Countries at the start of the 2007-2008
influenza season -- indicates that Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom
are the other countries in addition to Norway that have detected
oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza virus.
The full Summary Statement reads: "Ordinary seasonal influenza viruses with
significant resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) have been
detected within the earliest part of this winter's influenza epidemics in
Europe. The viruses are known as influenza A/H1N1 (H274Y), and they were
fully sensitive to other influenza antivirals. These viruses have been
detected by a European research and surveillance project known as VIRGIL
(<http://www.virgil-net.org/>), which has been undertaking routine
surveillance for resistance in circulating influenza strains since
2004-2005. H1N1 viruses are predominant in this winter's epidemics
worldwide, and these resistant viruses are a new phenomenon this winter. A
limited amount of specialist testing has been undertaken for 10 countries
and a proportion of A/H1N1 viruses detected in 4 countries Denmark, France,
Norway, and the UK, have been found resistant to oseltamivir. Overall in
Europe the proportion with oseltamivir resistant is around 13 per cent but
the proportions resistant are variable with Norway showing a markedly high
proportion resistant (12 of 16). If the 16 Norwegian viruses are excluded
the proportion with resistant would fall to around 5 per cent. Data from
Norway indicate that these viruses were transmitted in the country. To date
there are no reports that they are making people any more ill than do other
influenza A viruses. Normally A/H1N1 viruses as a group cause milder
disease than some other human influenza viruses. However it must be
realised that all influenza A viruses are potentially lethal for vulnerable
individuals (the old and the very young and those with chronic debilitating
conditions). It also needs to be remembered that antiviral resistant is a
relative not absolute term. Patients ill with viruses that are deemed
resistant in the laboratory often still seem to benefit when they receive
antivirals." - Mod.CP]
