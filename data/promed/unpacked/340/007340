Bird flu back in West Java
--------------------------
Bird flu has resurfaced in Indonesia, killing at least 21 000
chickens on farms in West Java over the last 2 months, an official
says.
The head of farm animal health at the West Java Animal Husbandry
Office, Musni Suatmodjo, said on Wednesday [2 Mar 2005 that] avian
influenza, or bird flu, had spread to 5 regencies and municipalities
in the province. He identified them as Cirebon regency and
municipality, Subang regency, Indramayu regency and Sukabumi regency.
Musni said Cirebon municipality had the most reported cases of bird
flu, with about 12 000 chickens killed by the H5N1 and H7N1 viruses.
"The affected area is smaller than in 2004. In early 2004, (the bird
flu) spread to 10 areas. We hope to reduce the number of cases this
year," he said in Bandung.
According to the World Health Organization, avian influenza is an
infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza
virus. The disease, which was 1st identified in Italy more than 100
years ago, occurs worldwide. 15 subtypes of influenza virus are known to
infect birds, but to date all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have
been caused by influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7.
Musni said that during 2004, bird flu was reported in 10 areas in West Java
and killed about 1.6 million [out] of 6 million farmed chickens in the
province, or 25.3 percent. He said he was confident 2005's bird flu outbreak
would be less severe, maybe killing just 10 percent of farmed chickens in the
province. "We have prepared 50 million doses of vaccine to stop the spread
of the virus in 2005," he said...
According to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations, which were announced during a recent
28-nation conference on bird flu in Vietnam, bird flu cost Asian
farmers and agricultural industries 10 billion USD in 2004.
Vietnam has been hit hardest by the 2004 outbreak of the virus, which erupted
across much of Asia at the end of 2003 and has killed [at least] 46 people:
33 Vietnamese, 12 Thais and a Cambodian. Almost every person who has fallen
ill with bird flu is known to have caught the virus from contact with sick
birds. But according to the FAO, while Vietnam has borne the brunt of the
recent outbreak, the H5N1 virus is now also endemic in Thailand, Indonesia
and China.

["Resurfacing" is an ambiguous description of the disease situation
in Indonesia. As recently indicated (see 20050130.0327), Indonesia's
last avian influenza case was recorded on 13 Dec 2004. According to
the current reportage (allegedly from an official source), bird flu
has been killing chickens on farms in West Java over the last 2
months. This might mean that the outbreak has been continuing without
an interval but remained unreported.
According to OIE's data, the 4 countries suffering the highest number
of HPAI outbreaks since the beginning of the panzootic in Dec 2003,
are (in brackets -- accumulated number of outbreaks as of 25 Feb
2005): Viet Nam --1764; Thailand -- 1077; Indonesia -- 169; China --
50. The respective dates of their last follow-up reports to the OIE
are: 22 Feb 2005; 24 Feb 2005; 6 Oct 2004; 6 Jul 2004. Absence of
report does not necessarily indicate the absence of disease. - Mod.AS]
