The contagious Congo virus claimed the life of another young man on [Sun 2 Sep 2018], K.H., from Piro Khel village of Landi Kotal division, Khyber Pakthunkhwa (KP). The death was the 2nd case of Congo virus in the region after the 1st case of S.S., a 20-years old young man, who died of virus in Islamabad hospital on [Sat 1 Sep 2018].

According to the details, K.H.was admitted to Hayatabad medical complex initially, from where he was referred to Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. His precarious condition did not improve and he passed away in Peshawar on [Sun 2 Sep 2018] morning. It is worth mentioning that the ill-fated K.H. was the attendant of 1st affected S.S., who died in Islamabad hospital.

The local administration while taking the precautionary measures closed 3 private schools and a market in the affected village to preclude the spread of the fatal virus. The health officials urged the residents of the affected area to strictly follow the safety measures, especially, those people who have animals in their houses.

Officials at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on [Sun 2 Sep 2018] confirmed 2 more Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] patients being treated at the hospital, saying that they are treating 4 confirmed and one suspected patient at the moment.

JPMC Executive Director Dr. Seemin Jamali told The News that A.N., 22, is the latest patient to be tested positive for CCHF. She was brought to them from New Karachi, but she hails from Azad Kashmir capital Muzaffarabad, from where she had arrived in the city on [23 Aug 2018].

A 34-year-old man had died due to CCHF at a private hospital in Karachi on [Sat 1 Sep 2018], said Sindh Health Department officials, adding that so far this year 9 patients -- 6 from Karachi and 3 from Balochistan and other parts of the country -- have died at different hospitals in the city.

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease that is mainly contracted by the people who deal with cattle and livestock. Experts say it is highly contagious and half of the patients die due to the largely lethal disease despite receiving symptomatic and anti-viral treatment.

Dr. Seemin said that on [Sat 1 Sep 2018], 22-year-old P.P. from Safoora Goth also tested positive for CCHF, adding that he is being kept in an isolation ward at the hospital.

"At the moment we have 4 confirmed patients: 2 from Quetta, Balochistan, and 2 from Karachi," said Dr. Seemin, adding that they have another man who is suspected to have contracted the viral disease, but it could only be confirmed after lab results.

Health department officials said there are some more suspected patients being treated at private hospitals in the city whose lab results are yet to be received, adding that the health department would issue an update on the cases today [Mon 3 Sep 2018].
