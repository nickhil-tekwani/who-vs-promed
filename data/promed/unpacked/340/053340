Subject: Newly published research on prions
Considering the amount of ProMed mail related to prions, I
thought the list members might be interested in a new
publication from Springer "Current Topics in Microbiology
and Immunology" series (no. 207) entitled "Prions Prions
Prions" edited by S.B. Prusiner of the Departments of
Neurology and of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University
of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. The book
contains ten articles. If anyone would like the Table of
Contents, I will be happy to mail it to them privately to
avoid copyright infringements.

Subject: BSE Info Available to ProMED Subscribers
The ProMED discussions related to BSE and CJD suggest that there is
a need for accurate information on the subject. While I cannot shed
light on the unknown aspects of those diseases, colleagues with
Veterinary Services of USDA:APHIS have produced some documents that
might be of interest to anyone concerned about BSE and its implications
for the U.S. ProMED subscribers interested in obtaining a packet of
such information should send an e-mail message to
nahms_info@aphis.usda.gov
They should identify the subject of the message as "Request for BSE
Information" and include their complete name, postal address, and
telephone number in the body of the message.
Thanks.
Randy Crom
P.S. I think that Cervidae (mule deer and elk) need to be included in
the list of animals known to suffer from a spongiform encephalopathy
(chronic wasting disease).
