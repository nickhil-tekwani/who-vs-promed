Baron von Rosen: plan to poison army horses
Anthrax in sugar cube proves wartime plot
A RELIC found in the archives of a police museum in Norway has proved that
Germany was prepared to use germ weapons during the First World War.
A sugar cube containing a phial of anthrax is all that remains of an
attempt by a Swedish aristocrat, working under German orders, to poison
horses and reindeer used to carry British arms across northern Norway to
the Russians.
The cube was among 19 found in the luggage of Baron Otto Robert Karl von
Rosen, who was arrested with two companions in Karajok, near the Finnish
frontier, in January 1917. Suspicious of a "hunting party" wandering around
a remote area of northern Norway in winter, the police investigated and
found that tins labeled "Swedish meat" in the baron's luggage contained
dynamite.
They also found that the party had Russian, Finnish and Norwegian cash, a
pistol, bottles of poison, maps of northern Finland, and the mysterious
sugar cubes. Baron von Rosen was taken to Kristiana (now Oslo) for
questioning.
When the curator of the Trondheim museum rediscovered two of the cubes with
a label declaring them to contain anthrax, he immediately sent them to the
Norwegian Defence Microbiological Institute in Oslo. Anthrax is a bacterium
fatal to animals and man which survives for many years in the form of
spores.
The Oslo laboratory passed the cubes, only one of which still contained a
phial, to the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down,
Wiltshire. There, a team led by Richard Manchee tested to see if the phial
did contain anthrax and if the spores were still viable. They report in
Nature that the phial contained a brown lid. Two tests, one chemical and
the other genetic, confirmed that the phial had indeed contained anthrax
bacilli, though they were on the brink of extinction.
Three weeks after his arrest and after diplomatic pressure from Sweden, the
baron was released and put on a train back to Stockholm. It is not clear if
he ever managed to kill any animals.
