Re the moderator comment:
[...5 additional cases have been reported outside the UK, namely N. Ireland,
Norway, Liechtenstein (one case each), and Switzerland (2 cases, including
the current one).<
Northern Ireland is, of course, part of the UK. This sentence should read:
"4 additional cases have been reported outside the UK, namely Norway,
Liechtenstein (one case each), and Switzerland (2 cases, including the
current one)."
