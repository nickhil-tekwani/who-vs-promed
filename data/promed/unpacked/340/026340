I am aware that until recently, vaccinations against common diseases were in the realm of pediatrics and adult physicians or internists were familiar only with a few vaccines given under defined conditions -- flu, herpes zoster, pneumococcus. Therefore the language of primary and booster doses is relatively unfamiliar to them.

We are considering only "non-replicating vaccines" here. Several pediatric vaccines are given as 2 or 3 doses for primary vaccination at intervals of 4 weeks (WHO EPI) or 1 month or 2 months (UK, USA). Booster dose is given about 1 year later. For DTP, we never called the 2nd dose given 2 months after the 1st as booster. Even the 3rd dose 2 months after the 2nd was not called booster. For the J&J vaccine, similarly, 2nd dose given after 2 months of the 1st is not booster, but expanded primary vaccination. So we need to define what a booster dose is.

A rough and ready definition is a dose given 6 months or more after the previous dose is a booster. More than 6 months could be 1, 2, 5, 10 years or even more.

On the other hand, any dose given after 1 or 2 months is part of primary series. Between 2 and 6 months, we need a working definition to name a dose as primary or booster. My definition or cut off will be minimum 4 months for booster. The rationale is simple: immunity wanes fairly rapidly after primary vaccination, unless boosted. After at least one booster, immunity is long-lasting. The development of long-lived plasma cells and memory cells are best stimulated after a long interval of priming. That interval is roughly a minimum of 4 months.

This may sound hair-splitting or nit-picking -- but remember "words are not only vehicles to convey ideas, but often its drivers". In science communication, precision of meaning and words is important.

[ProMED thanks Dr. John for raising the point of what defines a "booster" dose. In the case of the CIDRAP report posted in COVID-19 update (325): pediatric cases, J&J booster, UN General Assembly, WHO, the 2nd J&J dose was referred to as a booster. But Dr. John pointed out that since it was given 56 days after the 1st dose, it technically should not be referred to as a booster, but rather part of the primary series. Dr. John suggests that 4 months should be the cutoff for the primary series vs the booster. I agree words are important so that everyone clearly understands the concept.]

You Might Want to Wait to Get a Booster Shot
There are no simple rules for timing on a third jab--but maybe don't rush it.

...the nation's summer wave of COVID infections seems like it's beginning to pass. Cases and hospitalizations are trending slightly downward. Now that we have more clarity about whether (and which) Americans need booster shots -- and given that so many people are already getting boosters, eligibility be damned -- more questions loom: When, exactly, should those people get those shots? Is it better to load up on extra antibodies as soon as possible, or should people wait until COVID rates start to rise again?

Here's a simple starting point: If you're already eligible for a 3rd shot because you're immunocompromised, get it on the sooner side. The CDC recommends at least a 28-day wait after your second mRNA dose, while 2 experts told me that the best window is 4-5 months after. In many immunocompromised people, the 1st 1 or 2 shots might not have triggered a strong enough response in the body to provide lasting protection. For them, the booster shot isn't meant to fill in the cracks of your shield against the virus; it's meant to create that shield in the 1st place.

Things get squishier for vaccinated people with relatively healthy immune systems. They'll already be flush with newly minted B and T cells, which lie in wait to produce antibodies and attack the coronavirus. Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told me that the longer those cells mature in the body, the more prepared they are to fight off the invader. Delivered too early, another dose of the vaccine could end up "restarting something that was already working," he said. Ellebedy recommended delaying any booster shots by at least 6 months from your initial course of vaccination. 8 months is better; even a year would be fine.

At the same time, booster shots do increase the measurable level of antibodies in the blood, pretty much whenever they're received. The clinical benefits of this spike for fully vaccinated people remain unclear, though some preliminary evidence suggests that an antibody surge could reduce your chances of getting sick, or of transmitting the delta variant to other people -- at least until your antibody levels wane once more.

Most people's antibody levels peak a few weeks after their initial COVID-vaccine shots. If that holds true for boosters, too, then you might be tempted to time your next injection for 3-ish weeks before you'd most want to be protected. Maybe the virus surged in your county last December, and you're afraid it'll do the same this year, so you decide to get your booster around Veterans Day. Maybe you want to make sure you don't infect Uncle Dave at Thanksgiving, so you make an appointment for Halloween.

The problem is, "a few weeks" is just an average. Muge Cevik, a virologist at the University of St. Andrews, told me that different people develop antibodies at wildly different rates. In general, young, healthy people's immune systems work quickly and can start to approach their peak antibody levels in as little as 7 days. Older people, or those with compromised immune systems, can take weeks longer. Given that we don't know how long those spikes last, these differences could be crucial.

Also, predicting when you'll be in the most danger requires predicting when transmission in your community will be at its highest, which is nearly impossible to do with any precision. "It is very likely we will see another surge" this winter, Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, told me, but identifying the specific week or month when cases will peak in a given place just isn't feasible. (Even a winter surge isn't a sure bet: "At the moment, we don't really have a consistent seasonal pattern," because all of our surges have been shaped by behaviors like masking and distancing, Cevik said.) Popescu also pointed out that the rise of at-home testing and the decline of mass-testing sites could make it harder to detect smaller upward ticks until a surge is fully upon us.

Still, the mere likelihood of a winter surge does make it reasonable to wait, at least a bit. Cevik worries that if a large number of people rush out to get their extra shots, their antibodies will have faded by the time they're needed most, and a winter surge could see even more breakthrough infections. Cevik advised her own parents, whom she described as being "in clinically vulnerable groups," to get their boosters at the end of September or in October [2021]. Young people with healthy immune systems could stand to wait until November or early December [2021]. (This advice comes with exceptions: If you're, say, a nurse on a COVID ward in a county where cases are spiking, getting a booster now might be prudent.)

Ultimately, the dynamics of transmission in your area may be more important than the details of your personal vaccine schedule. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, would rather see boosters distributed sparingly and strategically to communities that show signs of an impending surge. While everyone else waits, vaccine makers could update their formulas to better protect against delta and set up randomized controlled trials to gather better data on how their original doses and boosters are performing.

On an individual level, Dowdy told me, there's probably minimal harm in eligible people getting 3rd shots now. But vaccine makers might have a new shot in a few months, designed around circulating variants, or even an intranasal option that can stop infections sooner. Once the government announces that tens of millions of people should get a booster now, persuading them to do so again in a few months, when a better option is available, could be difficult. And those who decide to get a booster now might find they're ineligible for a 4th shot when that better option comes. Case rates might seem scary now, but this pandemic has proved time and again that things can certainly get worse. "I think it's important to not just say, should I get a booster or not?" Dowdy said, "but rather, would I prefer to have a booster now or save the opportunity for later?"

[More on the timing of the vaccine dose, which is a good segue to Dr. John's comment. In this report, it states the "CDC recommends at least a 28-day wait after your second mRNA dose" to receive a booster (for immunocompromised individuals), but this should not be referred to as a booster since it is too soon following the 2nd dose in the primary series. However, immunocompromised individuals may have weaker immune response to the primary series making them more vulnerable as their antibody wanes. - Mod LK]

[3] Booster policy
Date: Fri 24 Sep 2021
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/24/biden-covid-19-boosters-pitting-white-house-against-scientific-advisers/


The White House's chaotic, contradictory messaging on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots has given Americans whiplash. But more concerning, experts say, is that it risks undermining President Biden's campaign pledge that he would listen to the scientists and adhere to official approval processes.

The administration's latest move -- a midnight Friday [24 Sep 2021] decision to expand booster eligibility -- puts the spotlight on Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who overruled her own advisory panel of scientists to make the call. Now, she finds herself caught between the White House, which had been pushing for the expanded eligibility for months, and an advisory body of experts that recommended booster shots only to a smaller part of the adult population -- and that the CDC has almost never overruled.

The communications debacle comes as millions of Americans are seeking clarity about whether it's safe to get a 3rd shot, and whether doing so will help keep them safe from Covid. It has highlighted tensions between the White House, its scientific agencies, and their outside advisers. For many, the move was reminiscent, too, of the Trump administration's chaotic pandemic-response communications and frequent hostility toward its own public health officials.

"It's been muddled, mixed, contradictions galore," said Eric Topol, a physician-researcher who founded the Scripps Research Translational Institute. "It's been checkered by political issues, rogue FDA scientists, infighting among leadership groups of the different agencies and the White House. It's really been troubling."

Despite the communications debacle, Topol defended the administration's eventual decision to give most Americans access to booster shots, handed down at 1 a.m. Friday [24 Sep 2021] by Walensky. So, too, did an array of public health leaders, like Brown University School of Public Health Dean Ashish Jha and former CDC Director Tom Frieden.

There's sound data for people over 60 to receive a booster, Topol said, though he criticized the White House for leaving people who received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines in the dark -- the only booster currently authorized is Pfizer's.

Others, though, have questioned the caliber of the data being used to support giving boosters at this point. And many question whether the chaotic rollout will do more harm than good. The poll presented Thursday [23 Sep 2021] to the CDC's advisory panel revealed that a 1/3 of people who are still unvaccinated say the need for a 3rd shot would make them less likely to agree to get any doses of Covid vaccine.

One concern about the rapid rollout is that there's little data available to support the booster shots' safety in younger populations -- particularly for men under 30, a tiny fraction of whom developed myocarditis, or heart inflammation, after receiving 1st or 2nd COVID-19 doses.

"It is worrisome to me that anybody less than 30 is going to be getting a 3rd dose without any clear evidence that that's beneficial to them and with more than theoretical evidence that it could be harmful to them," said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Offit also expressed concern that in overruling the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Walensky may have damaged efforts to persuade more unvaccinated adults to be vaccinated against Covid. It's likely, he said, that people in highly vaccinated regions, like New England, will receive a 3rd dose while those in relatively unvaccinated regions, like the South, will remain unconvinced.

"It's not hard to scare people who've already gotten 2 doses that they should get another dose," he said. "I'm sure that you can get them to get 10 more doses."

Whether or not the chaotic process will spur additional vaccine hesitancy, it has highlighted tensions and confusion between the White House, federal science agencies, and the advisory panels that exist to guide their decision-making.

The process kicked off with a shifting timeline from President Biden himself: On 18 Aug [2021], he said Americans would be eligible for boosters 8 months after their 2nd dose. On 26 Aug [2021], the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House was considering changing the timeline to 6 months. The CDC called the story "misleading" -- but a day later, Biden announced that the timeline might in fact shift to 5 months.

Then the FDA and CDC's scientific advisory panels weighed in.

Last week, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of scientists who advise the FDA on vaccine approvals, recommended approving boosters for a dramatically smaller population than Biden first outlined: Only those over 65 and at high risk from COVID-19....

When the FDA authorized the booster shot, however, it brushed aside its advisers' recommendation, adding in any American at added risk of exposure to COVID-19, like teachers, doctors, or grocery store workers. Days later, ACIP, the CDC advisory panel, also recommended scaling back the Biden administration's plans, recommending the shots only for the 65-plus population. But on Thursday [23 Sep 2021], Walensky disregarded her own advisers, too, ruling that the younger, at-risk population could receive the shots as well.

More broadly, the administration's disregard for the advisory boards may call into question whether the administration is "following the science," as promised .

It's extremely rare for the CDC to buck ACIP's recommendations on vaccination guidelines. It's believed that a CDC director has only deviated from the committee's guidance once before, during a 2003 controversy over how widely the George W. Bush administration should roll out to health workers and first responders a controversial smallpox vaccine that was also linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. ACIP member Sarah Long, who voted against the recommendation that Walensky nonetheless approved, called the move "disheartening in a way."

"I do not want to do anything now to add confusion to an already confusing situation for the public," said Long, a professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine. "Having said all that ... I want to say that this is almost unprecedented. A surprise, would be putting it mildly."

Grace Lee, the ACIP chair, voted for the recommendation that Walensky reinstated. She said the vote was close, Walensky had to make a decision and it is in her purview to overrule the committee.

"I respect that she has to make a call that's difficult. And no matter what the call was that she made it would have been challenging either way. There was no winning in this situation, honestly," said Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine.

In a statement, Walensky defended the decision, arguing she believed the decision would "do the greatest good" despite the lack of clear data and continued uncertainty.

Though she had clearly rejected the advice of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, the agency attempted to cast Walensky's decision in a different light.

"The CDC director did not override or disregard ACIP. She agreed with the committee and added the 4th recommendation. This was her decision and she was not influenced by outsiders," a CDC spokesperson told STAT shortly after Walensky's statement was issued.

And while there is more recent precedent for FDA regulators defying their scientific advisers, as happened this year with the controversial approval of an Alzheimer's drug, the administration's actions also represent a contradiction of Biden's longtime campaign pledge: that he would defer to "the experts."

In a 2020 interview with STAT, Vivek Murthy, one of Biden's top pandemic advisers and now the surgeon general, identified 2 key groups whose guidance should help steer vaccine approval decisions.

"The scientists that we need to hear from are the staff scientists at FDA who have been doing this for decades," he said. He later added: "The other group we need to hear from is the external advisory committee, VRBPAC. That is a group of scientists that understands how to evaluate vaccines."

Instead, though, the administration's recent moves have pitted it against recommendations from VRBPAC and the ACIP, a tension that hasn't gone unnoticed by former government officials.

"I think that staffers are scratching their heads ... at both agencies," Norman Baylor, president and CEO of Biologics Consulting and a former head of the FDA's Office of Vaccines, told STAT.

[The decision regarding booster dose depends on age of individual, health status, i.e, whether they are immunocompromised, whether they were previously infected, which primary vaccine they received, i.e., Pfizer or other, variants in circulation, and risk due to degree of contact with sick individuals. The decision is made even more difficult by the sparsity of data. A 3rd vaccination appears to be safe -- see Mofaz, M. et al. (2021) "Self-reported and physiological reactions to the third BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (booster) vaccine dose". medRxiv. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.15.21263633. But the need for it remains under debate.

As extracted from https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210916-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-third-vaccine-dose:

"...there is not yet any evidence that waning immunity is leading to more deaths in healthy people -- though in some parts of the world it might put pressure on health services, if more people become seriously unwell.

Maria Elena Bottazzi, professor of paediatrics, virology, and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, takes the view that current rates of hospitalisation provide a stronger argument for increasing vaccination rates overall, rather than providing 3rd doses.

'I think the real question, in the context of the fact that certain areas of the world are still needing 1st and 2nd doses,' says 'is what is the real evidence that indicates that we should start adding a 3rd dose - and when is it appropriate, which populations should we prioritise.'

So, what evidence is there that booster shots work?

Again, it helps to turn to the Israel, which experimented with booster doses long before the rest of the world. One study of fully vaccinated over-60s found that those who had received a booster dose 5 months after their second shot had much more potent immunity -- they were over 11 times less likely to be infected with Covid-19, and 19 times less likely to develop severe illness than those who had not received the 3rd dose. Likewise, Pfizer's own data shows that booster shots can restore their vaccine's efficacy to 95%. And there are other scraps of evidence from around the world.

In a recent trial of booster shots in organ transplant recipients, an international team of scientists found that providing an extra dose of the Moderna vaccine led to a significant jump in several markers of immunity, compared to receiving a placebo.

'As far as I know, it's the only randomised-controlled trial to look at a third dose,' says Atul Humar, a senior scientist at Toronto General Hospital Research Institute. 'And it showed a very convincing benefit.' Though the study didn't track the patients' disease outcomes, 60% of those who received the 3rd dose reached the threshold for protective levels of neutralising antibodies, versus just 25% in the placebo group.

Another hint at the immunological benefits of a 3rd exposure to the COVID-19 spike protein comes from India, where a study of vaccinated healthcare workers -- which is yet to be peer-reviewed --recently found that their levels of antibodies declined significantly after 4 months, unless they had been infected with the virus naturally, which the researchers suggest may have acted as a kind of booster (though of course, this is not recommended).

An (even more) complicated picture
However, even if waning immunity is a major global problem that booster shots can help to overcome it, there are still many things left to work out. In fact, the more you look at the detail, the more complicated it all becomes.

For example, what should a booster programme look like?

In Israel, where most people's first 2 vaccinations were by Pfizer, this is the vaccine that has been used so far for booster doses. The UK government is also currently planning to exclusively use the Pfizer version -- however, the majority of the population received the Oxford/AstraZeneca for their 1st and 2nd doses.

For 1st and 2nd doses, studies suggest that mixing and matching different COVID-19 vaccine technologies can provide superior immunity to having the same one twice. However, though the UK began a trial on mix-and-match booster vaccines back in May [2021], there is not yet any data to confirm that this works or is a good idea.

'Again, it's like so many other things -- you know that expression, we're trying to build the aeroplane while we fly it, and doing it all as fast as we possibly can,' says Altmann.

While Altmann suspects that boosting with mRNA-based vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna -- which sneak mRNA containing the instructions to make the COVID-19 spike protein into cells, showing them what to look out for -- work well, he does have mild concerns about the wisdom of boosting with another kind, the viral vector.

In contrast, vaccines like the Oxford/AstraZeneca rely on a virus -- in this case, a chimpanzee adenovirus -- to smuggle the code for the COVID-19 spike protein into our bodies. And there's a theoretical possibility that reinfecting yourself with an (inactivated) virus several times could be a bad idea.

'We've never been there before... there's quite a big chance that you're going to induce inhibitory antibodies against the vaccine itself, and stop the vaccine working,' says Altmann, who explains he's curious to know whether the UK's vaccine advisory committee -- the JCVI -- have taken this into consideration.

Another question is whether the immunity we gain from booster programmes might last longer if they were designed with updated versions of the vaccines - such as those that can recognise new variants like delta...." (Byline: Zaria Gorvett). - Mod.LK]
