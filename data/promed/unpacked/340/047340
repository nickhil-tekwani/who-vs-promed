The United States embassy in Malaysia warned its citizens to watch out for the
dengue-carrying Aedes mosquito as the number of deaths and cases reported
looked set to hit record levels.
"Because the number of dengue cases has significantly exceeded expected
levels, and due to the fact that we are just now entering the rainy season, we
recommend that you take measures to prevent the presence of the Aedes mosquito
around your house or building," it said in a statement.
"The US embassy in Kuala Lumpur is closely monitoring the current outbreak of
dengue fever," it said, citing a Malaysian government announcement on
September 29 that it was on "high alert" over the outbreak.
Fatalities from dengue in Malaysia reached record levels in 2004, when 102
people died, and the health ministry has warned the toll could be higher this
year if efforts are not stepped up to eradicate the virus-carrying mosquito.
Latest official figures released Monday showed Malaysia had confirmed 74
dengue deaths in the first 9 months of 2005, compared to 72 deaths over the
same period in 2004. A number of states in recent weeks have recorded a
doubling or tripling of dengue cases reported.

The Health Ministry has slapped 6 hospitals in the country with notices for
allowing Aedes [mosquitoes] to breed.
Also, over the last 5 days, there were 576 suspected dengue cases, 19
suffering dengue haemorrhagic fever. There were 3 deaths during this period.
The Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control division director Dr
Ramlee Rahmat said today the 6 hospitals and 5 schools were among the 13 332
issued with notices between 1 Jan and 6 Oct 2005. The schools are in Selangor,
Malacca & Sarawak.
The notices carry a maximum fine of RM500 [USD 133] each under the Destruction
of Disease Bearing Insects Act 1975 (DDBIA). Those who violate the directive
to clean up the premises are liable to a fine of RM500 daily under Section 23
(c) of the same Act.
"Construction sites still continue to be the highest breeders of the Aedes
mosquito," said Dr Ramlee.
On dengue deaths, Dr Ramlee said 3 people died within the last 15 days,
bringing the death toll to 75.
The victims were a 44-year-old poultry trader from Bayan Baru in Penang who
died on 3 Oct 2005, a factory worker, 40, from Temerloh, Pahang who died on 26
Sep and a 36-year-old technician from Malacca who died on 22 Sep. [Deaths from
DHF are more frequently seen in under-5-year-olds in other parts of SE Asia. -

Selangor topped the list of dengue cases with 144 cases and 10 people
hospitalised with DHF, Penang (121 and one death), Kuala Lumpur (80 with one
DHF), Kedah (43 with one DHF), Johor (37), Pahang (30 with 4 DHF and one
death), Negri Sembilan (33), Perak (22), Kelantan (15 with 2 DHF), Malacca (13
with one DHF and one death), Sarawak (11), Sabah (10), Perlis (8), Terengganu
(5), Putrajaya (3) & Labuan (one).
This brings to 29 196 the number of suspected dengue cases between 1 Jan and 6
Oct 2005, with 1500 of them being DHF.
Dr Ramlee said there were 15 hotspots, namely, Barat Daya district, Penang,
(62 cases within the last 5 days) Kajang Municipality, (58), Timur Laut
district, Penang, (36), Johor Baru (31), Subang Jaya Municipality (26),
Setapak (21), Cheras (20), Penang Municipality (19), Kepong (16), Seremban
(14), Ampang Jaya Municipality (13), Shah Alam City area (12), and Bandar
Baru, Gombak and Kuantan (11 each).

Thailand has been taking the initiative in guarding against dengue fever,
which poses greater threats in 2005 to neighboring countries than in 2004, the
Department of Disease Control said here Thursday.
Thailand has adopted a package of strict measures to contain dengue fever,
including reining outbreak areas and reducing the number of striped Aedes
mosquitoes, both mosquito larvae and adults, Dr. Thawat Suntrajarn, head of
the department, was quoted by Thai News Agency as saying.
Statistics show that during the first 9 months of 2005, more than 32 000 Thais
have been infected with dengue fever, with the death toll standing at 50.
Random checks in 45 provinces found that the index of striped mosquito larvae
in 90 percent of the surveyed areas stands at zero [meaning free of the
mosquito. - Mod.JW]. The number of mosquito larvae has been substantially
reduced as its breeding grounds in houses, schools and temples were
effectively eradicated, said Thawat.
Once the dengue fever patient is detected, a team of health workers will be
sent to the area, killing mosquitoes and destroying the breeding grounds.
Villagers will be advised on how to protect themselves from the deadly
mosquito-borne disease, he added. Thailand experienced an unusually large
number of infected cases in 1998, but has contained the disease since then.

[Dengue epidemics typically occur in cycles related to changes in the
incidence of the predominant type of dengue circulating (types 1, 2 & 3 were
circulating in Thailand in 1998, with very little type 4) and the length of
the rainy season (which affects mosquito breeding). In 1998 Thailand recorded
129 954 cases of dengue with 433 deaths; since then, the number of deaths has
been much lower:
56 in 1999;
87 in 2000;*
216 in 2001;
176 in 2002;
?? in 2003
40 in 2004

The death toll from Singapore's worst dengue fever outbreak on record has
risen to 12 with total cases so far in 2005 nearing 11 000.
In the 3rd dengue death this month, a 38-year-old female shop assistant died
in hospital on Tuesday, 6 days after being admitted.
The 2 other fatalities of the mosquito-borne disease this month were a 39-year-
old mother of 3 suffering from diabetes and a 61-year-old man with liver
problems.
A health ministry spokeswoman said the death toll this year was now 12, 4 more
than the 8 who died of dengue fever in 2004.
The latest death came as the number of cases continued to rise, reaching
10 951 as of 24 Sep 2005, according to health ministry figures.
Singapore, better known overseas for its emphasis on cleanliness, has launched
an all-out campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding grounds, but despite the
effort the number of cases has continued to increase.
Puzzled by their inability to stem the outbreak, Singapore authorities have
engaged foreign and local experts to study the dengue crisis and advise the
government on the best strategy to deal with the problem.
The government is spending 30 million Singapore dollars (18 million USD) to
fight dengue and has been waging a "search and destroy" campaign against
potential mosquito breeding areas for the past 2 weeks.
Dengue experts attending a conference here said Wednesday scientists were
still 7-9 years away from developing a medicine for the tropical disease,
[spread] by the Aedes mosquito.
They said complacency, an explosive rise in urban populations, as well as
easier travel due to the advent of air travel have contributed to the survival
and spread of the dengue virus.

Even as Asia worries about a possible avian influenza pandemic, a much more
common disease is sweeping the region, borne on the wings of mosquitoes and
commercial aircraft: the dengue virus.
At least 127 000 people have been infected by dengue so far in 2005 along an
arc that stretches from eastern India through the Indonesian archipelago, with
at least 990 deaths, the health authorities say. Warning of a dengue epidemic,
Malaysia recently joined Singapore in declaring emergency measures to combat a
surge in cases that has killed at least 70 people. While those 2 countries are
experiencing record infections, the worst-affected has been populous
Indonesia, with more than 48 000 cases and more than 600 deaths.
"Dengue is now one of the most important tropical diseases," said Duane
Gubler, director of the Asia-Pacific Institute for Tropical Medicine and
Infectious Diseases at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of
Medicine. "While it doesn't kill that many people, it has tremendous economic
and social impact."
Dengue is from the same family of viruses that causes West Nile, Japanese
encephalitis and yellow fever. There is no vaccine or treatment, and it is
estimated to infect at least 50 million people a year. Those with acute cases
suffer painful fever and debilitating lethargy, with about 1 percent
developing hemorrhagic fever [DHF] or shock, sometimes with gastrointestinal
bleeding and, in rare cases, brain hemorrhages.
Complicating prevention, 90 percent of those infected develop only mild
symptoms or no symptoms, inadvertently serving as a reservoir for the virus.
Even those who do fall ill become infectious days earlier, making any
potential quarantine useless, experts say.
