The French Agriculture Ministry said Monday that two more cows affected
with mad cow disease have been discovered, bringing the total since 1990 to
45.
The cases, this year's 13th and 14th, were discovered in the regions of La
Manche and l'Ille-et-Vilaine. The discoveries meant the slaughter of 216
other cows in the same herds.
