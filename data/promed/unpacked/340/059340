Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda - WHO Update 28
--------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 12 Nov 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported
cumulative figures for Gulu district of 320 cases of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever (EHF), including 104 deaths.
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has changed its reporting system to more
accurately reflect the present situation of the outbreak. Cumulative
figures will continue to be provided, but beginning today only new cases
that are laboratory confirmed will be reported. Deaths will be reported
when they occur.
A total of 4 cases, including one confirmed and 3 suspected cases, all from
one family and all of whom have died, have been reported in Masindi
district, bordering Gulu district. The confirmed case is the husband of a
woman who had been hospitalized in Gulu. She, her daughter and grandchild
died before EHF was diagnosed in her husband. A team comprised of Ministry
of Health staff and experts from WHO, US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and Medecins sans Frontieres arrived in Masindi on Mon 13 Nov
2000 and are implementing barrier nursing procedures and are tracing contacts.
The number of new cases has declined sharply. From 8 Nov - 11 Nov 2000
inclusive, only 5 laboratory confirmed cases have been recognized in Gulu.
The cases in Mbarara and Masindi districts have resulted from persons
infected in Gulu district. Once the EHF cases were recognized, control
measures were implemented promptly to limit further spread in these
districts. Surveillance in other districts throughout Uganda is ongoing.
