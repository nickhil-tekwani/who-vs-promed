There are now 15 confirmed cases of cholera in Mpumalanga (4 new cases have
been confirmed since yesterday). One of these cases is a 36 year-old man
from KaNyamazane who was baptised in the Crocodile River on Monday. We now
have to assume that the Crocodile river is also contaminated. The 3 other
cases are from the Elandshoek community: a 4 year- and 16 year-old girl who
are both now in the Rob Ferreira hospital isolation ward in a stable
condition; and a 28 year-old woman who was treated successfully by the
mobile unit in the community. The pregnant 16 year-old who presented on 2
Jan (and was confirmed positive for cholera) has now been discharged from
ICU to the isolation ward in a stable and satisfactory condition.
Remaining patients in the isolation ward are now 6: 3 males, of which 2 are
positive; and 3 females, of which 2 are also positive. They are all in a
stable and satisfactory condition. We would like to repeat that all
untreated water in the Gladdespruit, Elandsriver and Crocodile River should
be considered extremely dangerous.
All communities that draw water from rivers, dams or streams should
continue to be urged to purify water before consumption by boiling (rolling
boil for 3 minutes) or adding one capful of bleach to 25 litres of water
(that has preferably been filtered through clean cloth or linen) and
allowing it to stand for a minimum of 4 hours before use but preferably
overnight.
Cholera should be considered in all cases of watery diarrhoea, particularly
in adults, presenting anywhere in Mpumalanga, particularly if a travel
history to KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique, Swaziland or Elandshoek is positive.
