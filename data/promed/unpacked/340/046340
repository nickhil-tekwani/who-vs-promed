Bat-bite traced to S.C.'s first rabies case in 50 years
-------------------------------------------------------
COLUMBIA: A middle-aged Sumter County woman has become the first
human to contract rabies in South Carolina in more than 50 years,
state health officials said Friday [16 Dec 2011]. Doctors think the
woman was bitten by a rabid bat a few months ago in her home, the
Department of Health and Environmental Control said.

Rabies is a virus transmitted through saliva when someone is bitten.
The disease [develops] slowly, taking weeks to [affect] the brain and
nervous system. Once there, the symptoms like headaches and seizures
begin and the infection is almost always fatal within a few weeks,
said Dr. Eric Brenner a medical epidemiologist with DHEC's Bureau of
Disease Control. Treatment [post-exposure prophylaxis] for rabies
involves several shots and is almost always effective [in] fighting
off the disease if given before symptoms appear, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

DHEC said federal health privacy laws will not allow it to release any
other information on the woman, including whether she is still alive.
No more than three humans die from rabies in a typical year across the
country, and South Carolina's last documented case in a person was in
December 1959 when a Florence County man was bitten by a dog,
according to the agency. DHEC is talking to the woman's friends,
family and health care providers to investigate if anyone else was
exposed to rabies, but human-to-human transmission of the disease is
very rare. "It's not a public health threat at this time. It appears
to be just a single bat bite," DHEC spokesman Jim Beasley said.

South Carolina law requires all [presumably domestic] dogs and cats to
be vaccinated against rabies, and health officials said most cases
reported in the state now come from wild animals. If someone finds a
bat in their home, officials recommend they trap it under a container
and contact their local DHEC office to have it tested for rabies. Bat
bites can be especially dangerous because they are small and can go
undetected.

Other wild animals that can be infected include raccoons, foxes and
skunks. And if anyone thinks they were exposed to a rabid animal, they
need to go to a doctor immediately, Brenner said. "The rabies virus
travels slowly through the body until it reaches the brain and central
nervous system and produces serious initial symptoms including
headache, difficulty swallowing, seizures, anxiety, agitation and
confusion," Brenner said. "Most patients die within a few weeks after
the onset of these symptoms."

[The species of bat involved in this incident is not stated. And for
legal reasons the fate of the victim is not disclosed. It must be
presumed that the victim of the attack has not survived, since this
case is stated to be the first in South Carolina in fifty years,
notwithstanding the fact that there have been several contacts of
resident with rabid animals in the intervening period. Several of
these incidents are documented in the ProMED-mail reports listed
below.
