A previously healthy 27 year old man presented to our hospital on 13 Dec 2013 after 4 days of fever, headache, and arthralgia and one day of rash. He had visited Bora Bora Island, an island in French Polynesia, from 2-7 Dec [2013] for sightseeing. He did not use insect repellent during the travel. His body temperature was 37.2 C [99 F] and he had maculopapular rash on his face, trunk, and extremities. Other clinical examination was normal. Zika virus RNA was detected by real-time PCR performed at National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and thus we made the diagnosis of Zika fever. His fever and other symptoms subsided one day after the 1st presentation and his rash had gradually disappeared. This is the 1st case of imported Zika fever in Japan.

Zika fever is a dengue-like illness caused by Zika virus that spreads through mosquito bites. The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] recently announced that the French Polynesian Department of Health has confirmed an outbreak of several hundred cases of Zika fever in French Polynesia, including Bora Bora (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/zika-fever-french-polynesia-tahiti).

Travelers should be advised to use insect repellants during travels to French Polynesia, and Zika fever should be considered in febrile patients with rash returning from French Polynesia.

[Although ProMED-mail usually does not post reports of arbovirus infections where there is no possibility of ongoing transmission, this report is important because it is a good illustration of risk of long-distance movement of Zika virus, especially when infections are acquired during visits at popular tourist destinations. The CDC report cited above states the extent that Zika virus transmission is occurring in French Polynesia: "The French Polynesia Department of Health has confirmed an outbreak of Zika fever in Tahiti and the other islands that make up the country (Tahaa, Uturoa, Bora-Bora, Taiohae, and Arutua). Several hundred cases are suspected. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported. The Department of Health is working to improve surveillance." The above report from Japan is also a demonstration of the need for primary physicians to take a good travel history when these cases present, and have competent laboratory support, as was the situation with this case.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Satoshi Kutsuna for sending in this case report.
