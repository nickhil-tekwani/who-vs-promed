I would like to add to the moderator's commentary about the mislabeling of "rabies suspected dogs" as "rabies infected dogs".

From a One Health perspective, the mislabeling poses serious threats to animal welfare in Indonesia and beyond. Mislabeling can result in the culling of animals that might have been previously vaccinated. Culling can be counterproductive for rabies disease control itself: owners of truly infected animals or those exposed to infected animals may actively hide them from the surveillance system. For dogs labeled positive based on mere suspicion, questions arise: Who decided they were positive, and on what basis? Did the healthcare workers managing dog bites elicit sufficient history to determine whether the animal could have been rabid including asking if the attacks were provoked or unprovoked?

In today's global village, unjustified death sentences ensuing from mislabelings are a threat to animal welfare in Indonesia, which can translate to similar but real threats elsewhere. Dogs can be and have been needlessly hanged or clubbed to death in the past; in other climes, the entire extermination of all stray animals including non-canines have been suggested after human death due to attack from rabies-suspected (but unconfirmed) dogs. When we juxtapose this with the animal welfare crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in the collateral culling of not just minks, but pigs, hens, and hamsters, it becomes pertinent that we enhance the role and understanding of animal welfare in outbreaks and possible future pandemics.

What can be done? For one, promote and fund more One Health-footed training/education at a global level. This will help address One Health competency deficiencies (one of which is appreciating and understanding the importance of animal welfare) amongst key players in the One Health work force. The newly signed One Health collaboration of the Quadripartite (FAO, OIE, UNEP, and WHO) international agencies is well placed to help achieve this. And the marvelous One Health done in Bali and other parts of Indonesia can serve as a model.

[Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo is thanked for his insightful complementary comments.

Another too-common mislabeling of a rabies-related event occurs in the media when dog-bitten people are referred to as "rabies cases". Such people are "exposed", or "potentially exposed", or "suspected to be exposed" to rabid (or suspected as rabid) animals. Such people become "cases" or "patients" only if, most unfortunately, rabies signs develop. - Mod.AS
