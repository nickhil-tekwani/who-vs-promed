Beijing has confirmed a new case of "snail infection", bringing the
total number of cases to 132. The 31-year-old man saw doctors at
about 8 city hospitals before finally being diagnosed with a type of
angiostrongyliasis at Beijing Friendship Hospital on Friday.
Like most of the other patients, he ate snails at the Shuguo Yanyi
Restaurant, which serves Sichuan-style dishes, on 11 Jul and
developed symptoms of headache and fever on 27 Jul, said a doctor
surnamed Yin at the hospital. Yin said the 8 who were hospitalized
at the Friendship Hospital were recovering well and would all be
discharged next week. The hospital is offering checkups every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday morning to ensure the patients' complete recovery.
The disease caused by parasites can affect the brain and spinal cord,
and also lead to meningitis. The Friendship Hospital has diagnosed
112 cases and admitted 71 patients since 24 Jun. No deaths have been reported.
The Amazonian snail culprits have been traced back to southern
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to the
investigation by Beijing Health Bureau. Amazonian snails originated
in South America and first came to China in the 1980s as a delicacy.
The first report of a person falling ill after eating the snails came
from Guangzhou, capital city of the southern province of Guangdong.
Until recently, the big black snails were a hot-selling aquatic
product in big Chinese cities like Beijing.
