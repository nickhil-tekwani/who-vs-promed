Killer virus identified
-----------------------
A team from the Prince of Wales Hospital and Chinese University of Hong
Kong have identified the virus that has caused the recent outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome worldwide, confirming that the current
anti-viral treatment applied to patients has been the right choice.
Identifying the virus as a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, Professor
John Tam of the department of microbiology of the Chinese University said
it was detected by electron microscopy. The finding, announced late last
night, was further confirmed by a molecular technique that revealed the
nucleic acid sequence of the virus.
Asked if the virus was curable, Tam reiterated that the finding last night
had indicated that the current treatment applied to patients suffering from
the syndrome, more commonly known as atypical pneumonia, had been the right
choice. But he added that they still needed to monitor individual patients'
reactions before they could conclude that the virus was curable.
Lo Wing-lok, Medical Association president and legislator, said the
Paramyxoviridae family incorporated different viruses that could affect
humans and, as such, further studies were needed to establish whether it
was a new virus. Earlier it was revealed that at least 6 patients were
responsible for spreading the pneumonia in Hong Kong. Health chief Yeoh
Eng-kiong also said that a mainland professor who died in [Hong Kong] SAR
on 4 Mar 2003 was a victim of the atypical pneumonia.
The new information from officials indicated the disease had been more
widespread in the SAR than originally believed. Yeoh said the pneumonia and
suspected cases had now been isolated into 6 "clusters". Yeoh again
stressed the government was not hiding anything. He insisted there was no
sign of an outbreak at the community level.

[This is the second identification of a paramyovirus-like organism from a
patient with SARS (see ProMED-mail posting Severe acute respiratory
syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677). The first identification was made
by investigators in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg from specimens taken from
a physician from Singapore who had treated some of the earlier cases seen
in Singapore and was admitted to hospital in Frankfurt, Germany en route
back to Singapore over the weekend. As mentioned in our earlier posting, it
is important to confirm these findings and to identify a similar agent from
other cases of SARS before it can be concluded that this agent is the cause
of SARS. That being said, this second identification of a paramxovirus-like
organism from patients with SARS offers hope that the etiology of this
outbreak may be identified soon. - Mod.MPP]
