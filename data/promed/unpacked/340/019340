Rift Valley fever in South Africa
---------------------------------
As of Sat 27 Mar [2010], the Ministry of Health South Africa has
reported 63 human cases infected with Rift Valley fever (RVF),
including 2 deaths in Free State, Eastern Cape, and Northern Cape
provinces. Most of these cases reported direct contact with RVF virus
infected livestock and/or linked to farms with confirmed animal cases
of RVF. The human cases are: farmers, veterinarians and farm workers.
All cases were confirmed as RVF by tests conducted at the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, South
Africa (see <http://www.nicd.ac.za/>).

There is an ongoing outbreak of RVF virus infection affecting sheep,
goats, cattle and wildlife on farms within Free State, Eastern Cape,
Northern Cape, Western Cape, Mpumalanga, North West, and Gauteng
provinces. As of Mon 29 Mar 2010, approximately 78 farms reported
laboratory-confirmed animal cases, with extensive livestock deaths.

Outbreak investigations by the Department of Health and the Department
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are ongoing, and are being
supported by the South African Field Epidemiology and Training
Programme (SA-FELTP) and NICD. The 2 departments are taking measures
to enhance disease surveillance among cattle and in managing the
control of the outbreak.

Sporadic cases of RVF infection in animals have been documented in
South Africa in recent years. The last major outbreak of the disease
in humans occurred between 1974-76, where an estimated 10 000 to 20
000 people were affected.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects
animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can
cause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high rates
of disease and death. Most infections in humans are mild. The disease
also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion
among RVF-infected livestock. RVF virus is a member of the genus
_Phlebovirus_, one of the five genera in the family _Bunyaviridae_.
The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an
epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since
then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North Africa. In
1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania and
in September 2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen,
marking the 1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the African
continent. (For more detailed information see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>).

The WHO report above restores Mpumalanga to the list of affected
provinces. Further information is available also at the WAHID (World
