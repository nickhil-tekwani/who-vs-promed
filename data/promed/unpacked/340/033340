As reported in EPPO RS 2018/106, _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ tropical race 4 was first found in Israel in 2016 at 2 separate locations. Ongoing intensive surveillance operations have discovered a further outbreak at a number of sites in close proximity to one of these locations (in the eastern/southern [Sea of Galilee] area).

The infected sites have been confined and placed under strict supervision by the NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation]. Infected banana mats, as well as a buffer of 5 mats radius, have been immediately fenced off and all plants destroyed in-situ. All plantations with infected sites have also been fenced off, access restricted and entry allowed only under strict quarantine conditions. Water ditches have been dug around the fenced areas to prevent spread of spores in rain water.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But in recent years, Tropical Race 4 (TR4) has also been reported outside that area in the Middle East, Africa and Asia (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

TR4 is of great concern worldwide and is estimated to have devastated over 100 000 hectares [about 247,100 acres] of bananas so far. Consequently, development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries. New cultivars potentially resistant or tolerant to TR4 require lengthy testing under field conditions in the various production regions and need to be assessed for commercial suitability.

Genetic relationships of TR4 strains in various countries are being investigated (see ProMED-mail post 20180405.5727838). Results can be expected to provide important information on the biology and epidemiology of the fungus, as well as possible 'hot spots' for emergence of new variants or/and potential routes of spread with their associated quarantine risks.
