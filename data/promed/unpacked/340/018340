MENINGITIS, MENINGOCCAL - BRAZIL
================================

-----------------------------------------
22 January 1996
During the past 10 years the incidence of meningococcal
meningitis increased gradually in Rio de Janeiro from
290 cases (2.4 per 100 000 population) in 1986 to 853
(8.3 per 100 000) in 1993. Preliminary data for 1994 are 974 cases
and for 1995, 1106 notified by 28 December 1995. In 1995, 40% of
the cases were in children under 5 and 16% of the cases died. Most
cases (90%) in 1995 were from the metropolitan area and about half
from Rio de Janeiro [the city; the remaining 10% of cases must have been
from Rio de Janeiro State - Mod.JW].
Types B and C have increased during this period, and in 1995 when 48% of
cases were serotyped, 42% [of those typed] were type B and
57% type C. Ampicillin and penicillin has been recommended for
treatment of cases, rifampicin for prophylaxis in close contacts.
Several vaccination campaigns have been conducted in the state. In
December 1994 - February 1995, 63% of children in age groups from 6
months to 13 years and over 80% in age groups between 1 and 9 years
received the vaccine. The vaccination campaign was resumed in
November 1995 targeting the age groups 14-29 years.
