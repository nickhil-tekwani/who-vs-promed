Binh Thanh District's medical clinic reported 140 students were
hospitalised yesterday, 16 Jan 2006 for food poisoning. The students of 3
boarding schools, Chu Van An, Thanh Da and Tam Vu, were sick and vomiting.
According to officials at the 3 schools, the number of students suffering
from food poisoning reached 225. Due the unexpected large number of
patients, 35 people were transferred to the Paediatric Hospital I and Gia
Dinh People's Hospital for treatment.
No deaths have been reported so far. Authorities are investigating the
exact cause of the food poisoning.

Kitchens from the 3 Ho Chi Minh City schools where hundreds of pupils fell
victim to food poisoning did not conform to basic hygienic requirements,
local inspectors have said.
Inspectors from the HCMC Health Department found out that the kitchens fell
short of basic hygienic standards -- food storage systems were dirty, and
'chefs' did not distinguish cooking phases, mixing cooked and uncooked food.
The manufacturing facility which supplied yogurt to the 3 schools was
earlier found to be hygienically inadequate. Accordingly, the inspectors
have sealed the remaining yogurt.
Thankfully, towards Tuesday afternoon, 17 Jan 2006, all the hospitalized
pupils were discharged. The day before, nearly 260 children from 3 primary
schools in HCMC's Binh Thanh district were rushed to hospitals in the most
severe case of food poisoning so far in the city.

[The rapid onset (in another report, within 3 hours) of a foodborne illness
associated with vomiting but not with description of significant fever and
resolution within 24-36 hours suggest staphylococcal food poisoning due to
preformed enterotoxin.
The following is extracted from the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book regarding
staphylococcal food poisoning, a disease with an incubation period of 4-8
hours that generally causes an illness with vomiting and little fever:
<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html>
"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews
with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data,
are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for
staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic
staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin.
The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food,
or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in
the food sample(s).
In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as
in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food
may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for
determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as
well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have
been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the
illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be
isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected
carriers, such as food handlers.
A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce
symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when
_S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.
Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning
include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as
egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as
cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich
fillings; and milk and dairy products (such as yogurt). Foods that require
considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly
elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in
staphylococcal food poisoning."
