At least 15 persons have died of suspected Japanese encephalitis
(JE), and more than 100 others are undergoing treatment in Manipur.

Dr Y. Yaima, Director, Health Services, said blood samples had been
sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre in Dibrugarh, Assam, and
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi to
ascertain whether Japanese encephalitis was the cause of the deaths.

Y. Mohen, Medical Superintendent at the Regional Institute of Medical
Sciences here, told The Hindu that the number of patients with
symptoms of JE [virus infection] was increasing. He attributed the
alarming outbreak of this disease to widespread rearing of pigs in
villages and urban residential areas.

Official reports said hospitals only had stocks of Acyclovir
medicine, which treats the disease, that had expired several months
ago. Efforts were on to airlift the drug from Delhi, sources said.

[The suspected JE outbreak in Manipur state continues and may be
intensifying. The 6 Jul 2010 ProMED post (archive no. 20100707.2261)
reported just 3 fatalities. The current report states that there are
now at least 15. ProMED-mail continues to await the results of the
laboratory tests.

Pigs are amplifying hosts of JE virus. The virus is maintained in
wild birds, such as night herons, and is transmitted by _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ groups, which breed
particularly in flooded rice fields. Effectively controlling the
_Culex_ JE virus vector mosquitoes over large geographic areas is not
practical. Vaccination of the population at risk seems to be the
better approach to reducing the number of encephalitis cases, should
JE virus prove to be the etiological agent involved. Unfortunately,
contrary to the above report, there is no effective antiviral
treatment for JE virus infections. Only intensive supportive
treatment is indicated.
