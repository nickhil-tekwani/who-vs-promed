The Department of Health (DOH) in Western Visayas has recommended the
activation of a local dengue task force following a 163 per cent
increase in dengue cases, including 29 deaths, [compared to 2006].
Iloilo-based online news site The News Today
<http://www.thenewstoday.info>
reported Friday [17 Aug 2007] afternoon that the Regional
Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU) recorded 2064 dengue cases
from 1 Jan - 4 Aug [2007].
Last year [2006], The RESU recorded only 776 cases of dengue for the
entire region, including 9 deaths.
Negros Occidental and Iloilo are the provinces with the highest
number of cases, at 507 and 508 respectively.
Dengue cases were clustered in the cities of Bacolod, Sagay and
Victorias, and in Hinoba-an town in Negros Occidental. In Iloilo,
they noted a clustering in Oton and Pavia towns.
The RESU considered Bacolod City, which had 595 dengue cases and 5
deaths, a hotspot because of the "increase in the number of cases for
2 consecutive weeks, even though the number is still within the
expected range."
Last year [2006], Bacolod City only had 205 cases, 3 of whom died.
Iloilo City had 341 cases and 6 deaths this year [2007] compared to
155 last year, with 4 deaths. Capiz has 38; Aklan, 35; Guimaras, 25;
and Antique, 15 cases.
The RESU report said dengue afflicted both the young and the old.
"Age of cases ranged from 2 months to 78 years with median age of 10
years," the report stated.

Dengue fever has killed at least 333 Cambodians this year [2007],
most of them children, and many more could die before the rainy
season ends next month [September 2007], senior health officials said
on Wednesday [17 Aug 2007]. The disease, which killed 116 Cambodians
in 2006, has spread across the impoverished nation and infected 31
136 people this year, most of them in the countryside where living
conditions are poor and children are vulnerable, they said.
More could die with the monsoon season, ideal breeding weather for
the mosquitoes which carry the disease and not due to fade until the
end of September 2007, he said.
A publicity campaign against the disease, including admonitions to
clean containers at home every 10 days to ensure mosquitoes cannot
breed in them, has borne little fruit.
The World Bank, the World Health Organization and the Red Cross have
provided pesticides to kill mosquitoes, and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) gave USD 300 000.
Cambodia, whose health care system was devastated in 30 years of
civil war, spends about USD 3 per person on health a year, according
to the World Bank.

[This report illustrates the serious challenge that community-based
dengue virus vector control programs present in poor countries.
Prudent use of larvacides, along with the elimination of _Aedes_
breeding sites, can provide effective reduction of dengue virus
transmission. Adulticides are likely to provide only temporary reduction.

A 9-year-old boy is suspected of becoming the latest victim of dengue
fever in Phuket. If the disease is confirmed, he will be the 3rd
person in Phuket killed by the disease this year [2007].
The boy lived in Koh Kaew and died at Vachira Phuket Hospital 4 Aug [2007].
The tests to determine whether dengue hemorrhagic fever was the cause
of death will take 2 weeks, officials at the hospital said.
Dr Wanchai Sattayawutthipong, chief of Phuket Provincial Health
Office (PPHO) told the Gazette that there has been an outbreak of
dengue fever in Thailand this year [2007]. "There have been 2
confirmed deaths by dengue fever in Phuket this year, and this latest
case is pending confirmation. The earlier cases were deaths of 2
adults, aged between 25 - 35," he said. "It shows that people in
every age group are vulnerable to the disease."
Last year [2006], there were no deaths associated with dengue,
although 136 people contracted the disease. So far this year [2007],
more than 200 people have contracted dengue.
Dr Wanchai said there are easy prevention methods that should reduce
the number of dengue cases.
"In the coming weeks, officers will go around Phuket and publicize
the dangers related to dengue fever. We will also teach people how to
protect themselves and their families from dengue.

[As Dr. Wanchai indicated, the prevention methods as such are
relatively easy. Getting local people to put the methods into
rigorous practice is difficult.
Phuket is a major tourist stop in Thailand, and dengue cases may
discourage visitors from coming. It is located in southeast Thailand,
on the shores of the Straits of Malacca in the Andaman Sea. A map of

Dengue fever cases in the country recorded a slight increase in the
32nd week of this year [2007].
A total of 1010 cases and 5 deaths were registered from 5 - 11 Aug
[2007] compared with 994 cases and 2 deaths the previous week, said
the Health Ministry's disease control director Datuk Dr Hassan Abdul
Rahman. He, however, said the situation was under control.
Dr Hassan said Kelantan recorded the highest increase of 9 per cent,
with 158 cases from 145 the previous week. This was followed by
Penang, which recorded 72 cases compared with 45 cases the previous
week and Sabah, with 35 cases compared with 55 cases the previous
week, he said in a statement here Wednesday [15 Aug 2007].
However, Selangor had recorded a drop, with 243 cases compared with
255 the previous week. The dengue situation is also improving in
Kuala Lumpur and Johor. Kuala Lumpur recorded 128 cases (143 cases
the previous week) and Johor 88 cases (119 cases).
Dr Hassan said 731 of 67 633 premises inspected between 5 - 11 Aug
[2007] were found to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Of them, 78.5 per cent, or 574 premises, were houses, followed by
factories (10.2 per cent), land and unoccupied lots (9.2 per cent),
and playgrounds (6.3 per cent).

The Phuentsholing General Hospital has referred a patient diagnosed
with Dengue fever to the Thimphu National Referral Hospital.
A 68-year-old woman from Gatiya, Samtse was admitted to the
Phuentsholing hospital on 11 Aug 2007 with fever and pain in the
limbs. According to the District medical Officer, Dr. Kesang, she was
also suffering from kidney failure with upper gastrointestinal
bleeding. She was referred to Thimphu on 15 Aug [2007].
A 2nd patient, from lower Phuentsholing town, who was also diagnosed
with Dengue on 11 Aug [2007] has been discharged but is on medication.
Phuentsholing town, meanwhile, has been hit with viral fever. Around
500 people visited the Outpatient Department at Phuentsholing General
Hospital with complaints of fever, body ache and heat rash last week.
"It is because of the fluctuations in temperature and humidity
levels," said Dr. Kesang. "Different types of virus become active and
spread rapidly in such climatic conditions."
The metrology unit with the trade ministry recorded a maximum
humidity of 92 per cent on Tuesday [16 Aug 2007]. It was 84 per cent on Monday.

[With the approximately 500 people reporting to the outpatient clinic
for fever, body ache and rash, one wonders whether some or all of
these patients might be dengue cases as well. ProMED would be
interested in knowing what laboratory tests were done to establish
the dengue fever diagnosis for the 2 patients mentioned above and
whether the fever patients were tested for dengue viruses or IgM antibody.
