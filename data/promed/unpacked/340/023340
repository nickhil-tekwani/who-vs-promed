Huge recalls under way as pork scandal continues
------------------------------------------------
Workers scatter sterilizing chemicals while burying pigs that had
been fed with banned additive clenbuterol in Qinyang city, Henan
province, last week [week of 14 Mar 2011]. Clenbuterol encourages the
development of muscle and reduces fat in pigs, but is harmful to
humans.

Supermarkets across the country were busy recalling meat products at
the weekend [19-20 Mar 2011] and taking packages off the shelves as a
result of the growing scandal in which a banned substance was found in
pork produced by an affiliate of the country's largest meat
processor.

Meat products branded as Shineway in English that were processed by
the Henan-based Jiyuan Shuanghui Food Co Ltd were found last week to
contain clenbuterol, a chemical that is hazardous to humans. The
producer is an affiliate of the market-leading Shuanghui Group.

In Xian, the capital of Shaanxi province, as in much of the country,
supermarkets took products produced by Jiyuan Shuanghui off the
shelves at the weekend. Customers are also being called on to return
affected products to the store. The recall work was likely to take 3
days, local media reported on Saturday [19 Mar 2011].

Some 20 to 30 tons of meat products produced by the company had been
selling in the city every month.

Major supermarkets in Beijing, such as Wu Mart and Ito Yokado, told
China Daily on Sunday [20 Mar 2011] that they were not recalling any
Shineway meat products because the packs on their shelves had been
processed by other affiliates of Shuanghui and had all been tested as
safe.

But in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, the Vanguard
supermarket chain went one step further and withdrew all sausage
marketed by Shuanghui despite the fact that none of it was made by the
offending affiliate, Jiyuan Shuanghui.

The Trust-Mart supermarket chain in the city was still selling
Shineway sausages on Sunday [20 Mar 2011[ and said it had not been
ordered to withdraw the item. Customers at the supermarket, however,
said they would not buy the brand.

Major supermarket chains received a notice from the Shuanghui Group
on Wednesday [16 Mar 2011] saying its cooked meat products sold in
Guangzhou were safe.

The live pigs bought by Shuanghui in Guangdong were not sourced from
Henan province, where the pigs fed with the illegal additive came
from, said the industry and commerce administration of Guangzhou.

The ongoing recall began on Thursday [17 Mar 2011] when Shuanghui
Group ordered its branches to recall all meat products processed by
its Jiyuan affiliate.

"It (the recall) does not mean all products produced by Jiyuan
Shuanghui are substandard. The move is being done to reassure the
public," Du Junfu, Party chief of Shuanghui Group, was quoted as
saying by Xinhua on Saturday [19 Mar 2011]. By Saturday, more than
2000 tons of meat products and 70 tons of fresh meat had been
recalled, the company said. But it did not revealed the total amount
of the products that needed to be recalled.

The company suffered a major setback when China Central Television
(CCTV) revealed on Tuesday [15 Mar 2011] that Jiyuan Shuanghui had
purchased pigs that had been fed with the illegal additive
clenbuterol. The feed additive causes the animals to develop more
muscle and less fat and makes them more valuable. However, pigs fed
with the additive produce pork that can be harmful to humans.

At the Jiyuan Shuanghui plant, bulk meat products bore seals
impounding them and formerly busy workshops were deserted. 20 pigs
that had been slaughtered but that had not been processed were laying
in the empty building, Xinhua reported on Saturday [19 mar 2011].

After the scandal broke on CCTV, the provincial authorities in Henan
conducted urine tests on 1512 pigs at 9 pig farms. It said 158 pigs
tested positive.

In addition, 271 kilograms [about 600 lb] of feed in the province
that was found to contain the additive was destroyed on Saturday [19
mar 2011].

Liu Xuezhou, chief of Henan department of health, said 3 senior
officials from the animal husbandry bureaus in the province were
suspended from duty in the aftermath of the revelations. Another 27
officials in the province were in police custody or had been sacked or
suspended, he said.

[Clenbuterol is a beta-2 agonist. This drug directs the body to make
lean muscle instead of fat. It has been used by body builders and
various athletes in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. It has
also been used in cattle, pork, sheep, and goats to gain a competitive
advantage in livestock shows as they appear more muscled.

Over the last several Olympic competitions various athletes have
tested positive for clenbuterol and have been suspended by the various
athletic committees and competition organizations. A few athletes have
challenged the level found in the urine, because of extremely low
levels. Such a level may indicate that it was in the food they
consumed.

Clenbuterol has a very long half-life and can be found in various
locations in the body of animals or humans long (months) after
consumption.

Clenbuterol is sold as a clenbuterol hydrochloride for treatment of
asthma and other restrictive respiratory conditions.

Clenbuterol residues can affect lung and heart function in persons
who have eaten liver or meat of animals given the drug. In the United
States, no human illnesses have been associated with clenbuterol use
in food animals. But, several outbreaks of reversible, short-term
illnesses in Europe have been traced to ingesting clenbuterol residues
in European beef liver.

No deaths were reported in several European incidents involving the
consumption of liver with clenbuterol residues. Spain reported 2
outbreaks of illness in 1990 totaling 135 persons who consumed
contaminated beef liver. Samples had clenbuterol concentrations of 160
to 291 parts per billion. The people were hospitalized with reversible
symptoms of increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headache, nausea,
fever, and chills.

Clenbuterol was suspected, but not confirmed, as the cause of an
earlier outbreak of illness, also in Spain. A similar incident with 22
cases, also traced to beef liver, was reported from France.
Clenbuterol was also a concern in Ireland in 1991.

Although the toxic effects of clenbuterol residues have been
described as mild, FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) considers all
unintended effects on humans to be unacceptable. FDA said it is
possible that persons being treated with adrenergic agents or who are
otherwise sensitive to these drugs, may be far more severely affected
by residues of clenbuterol than are normal, healthy individuals.

The FDA is also concerned that the illicit use of clenbuterol could
lead to illness or death in persons handling the drug. FDA said it is
possible that clenbuterol effects on the cardiovascular system may be
more hazardous via occupational inhalation exposure than via ingestion
in food. But FDA said it has not been able to confirm reports of such
reactions.

While some of this has relatively historical sound to it, the drug is
very much in use, illegally in the animal performance shows. It is, by
evidence in athletic arenas, a problem among some human athletes.
Sadly, many of these human competitors do not realize that they could
suffer heart disease that may not be reversible.
