Re:
[...Do the 4 ASF positive samples represent all the samples sent to
Onderstepoort, or were there other results as well? Please keep us
posted. ­ Mod.TG
We actually sent 20 samples; 10 each from 2 different infected farms.
The samples included lymph nodes, clotted and unclotted [blood
samples. We've asked OVI to give further details of their preliminary
reports and are expecting to hear from them. My suspicion is that some
of the samples sent had deteriorated, as they were initially returned
undespatched after 3 days by the first courier agency I sent them
through. I'll keep you posted.
