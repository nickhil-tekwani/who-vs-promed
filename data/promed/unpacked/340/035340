Mysterious disease killing watermelon crop
------------------------------------------
Florida is the second largest producer of watermelons in the United States
but, this year, south west Florida farmers are battling what scientists are
calling a mysterious disease, which could cost growers up to USD 50 million
this season.
Dr Patty Roberts says the unknown disease is wiping out watermelon crops
across the state. Roberts, a researcher from the Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, has no idea how it arrived.
She and her partners were trying to conduct an unrelated experiment when
their own crop was infected. Many Immokalee growers may be forced out of
business.
According to Roberts, some affected fields are losing 100 per cent of their
production. With few clues to go on, scientists say it's very likely this
situation will get worse.
Consumers can identify an infected melon by examining the rind. Healthy
watermelons have a nice, white rind on the inside, but infected ones are
yellow.

[There are a number of vine-decline diseases of cucurbits. According to
Roberts, the disease in Florida is of unknown etiology, and it has been
named mature vine decline and fruit rind necrosis. Further research is
required to determine the etiology of the disease. Useful references:
