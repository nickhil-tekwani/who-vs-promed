It is very helpful that the veterinary bureau of China's Ministry of
Agriculture has reported the outbreak of type Asia 1 FMD, as it represents
an unidentified threat to other countries in the region.
Formal and informal border trade with China has resulted in the
introduction of both the Cathay (pig-adapted) and Pan Asia strains of FMD
[see commentary] into the northern provinces of Viet Nam in the recent
past. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, the outbreak in April 2005
of goatpox in the border provinces points to the introduction by border
trade of another contagious disease from the northern neighbour.
While routine country reporting suggests that Type O FMD virus is probably
endemic in Viet Nam, the country has not reported Asia 1 virus for some
years and does not use or hold Asia 1 vaccine. Given that the disease is in
pigs in China, and the reports from the feed companies would suggest a much
more widespread phenomenon than thus far acknowledged, there is a high
probability of introduction into Viet Nam via the border trade.
It would be of additional assistance to those concerned about transboundary
animal diseases if any available gene sequence information were posted in
an appropriate database. Gene sequence and dendrogram analysis might then
give an initial indication about the protection likely to be conferred by
Asia 1 vaccine strains currently in use or available in Southeast Asia. The
most helpful action for the other countries in the region would be for the
field strain to be submitted to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD in
the UK, so that a proper antigenic characterisation can be carried out and
vaccine recommendations updated.
It would appear that the animal health situation in Hong Kong SAR might be
a very useful indicator of the animal health status of the rest of PR
China, as the 'spill-over' and detection of Asia 1 virus in Hong Kong in
March 2005 was a prelude to the reporting from Beijing of an epidemic of
FMD type Asia 1. As FMD does not spontaneously generate, the occurrence of
an outbreak on the east coast in May 2005 implies that there was a sequence
of previous source outbreaks up to 2 months ago.

[The comments of Dr Gleeson, an international authority on FMD, are very
much appreciated. For our subscribers' convenience, below is the summary of
his paper "A review of the status of foot and mouth disease in South-East
Asia and approaches to control and eradication," which was published in
OIE's Scientific and Technical Review, 2002, 21, (3), 465-475 (the entire
article at <http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/rt/2103/1.4%20Gleeson.pdf>).
"Summary.
The author presents reports of FMD submitted between 1996 and 2001 to the
OIE Sub-Commission for FMD in South-East Asia (SEA). Of the 10 countries in
SEA, FMD is endemic in 7 (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) and 3 are free of the disease (Brunei,
Indonesia and Singapore). Part of the Philippines is also recognised
internationally as being free of FMD. From 1996 to 2001, serotype O viruses
caused outbreaks in all 7 of the endemically infected countries. On the
mainland, 3 different type O lineages have been recorded, namely: the SEA
topotype, the pig-adapted or Cathay topotype and the pan-Asian topotype.
Prior to 1999, one group of SEA topotype viruses occurred in the eastern
part of the region and another group in the western part. However, in 1999,
the pan-Asian lineage was introduced to the region and has become
widespread. The Cathay topotype was reported from Vietnam in 1997 and is
the only FMD virus currently endemic in the Philippines. Type Asia 1 has
never been reported from the Philippines but was reported from all
countries on the mainland except Vietnam between 1996 and 2001. Type A
virus has not been reported from east of the Mekong River in the past 6
years and seems to be mainly confined to Thailand with occasional spillover
into Malaysia. The distribution and movement of FMD viruses in the region
is a reflection of the trade-driven movement of livestock.
There is great disparity across the region in the strength and resources of
the animal health services and this has a direct impact on FMD control.
Regulatory environments are not well developed and enforcement of
regulations can be ineffectual. The management of animal movement is quite
variable across the region and much market-driven transboundary movement of
livestock is unregulated. Formal quarantine approaches are generally not
supported by traders or are not available. Vaccination is not used widely
as a control tool because of the expense. However, it is applied by the
Veterinary Services in Malaysia to control incursions of the disease and
there is a mass vaccination programme for large ruminants in Thailand where
the Government produces and distributes vaccine. Vaccination is also used
by the commercial pig sector, particularly in the Philippines and Thailand".
This moderator fully agrees with Dr Gleeson's assessment: that the
(transparent) animal health situation in Hong Kong SAR is a useful
indicator of the animal (and, as demonstrated during the SARS outbreak,
human) health status within the rest of PR China. As a matter of fact, data
on FMD outbreaks in Hong Kong -- almost every year -- and details on the
virus types involved were available for decades, substantiated by means of
samples forwarded to the Pirbright FMD reference lab. Hopefully, this
transparency will spread now to the rest of PR China. - Mod.AS]
