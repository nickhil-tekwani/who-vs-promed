Dog Flu Reported in San Diego County
----------------------------------
Canine influenza was first reported in Florida in 2004 and has spread across the United States

A dog has tested positive for canine influenza in what's believed to be the first documented case in San Diego County.

Dawn Danielson, director of the San Diego County Department of Animal Services, confirmed the positive test result Friday from a dog at the county's shelter in Bonita.

While this isn't the first case in California, it is the first reported case in the county according to the department.

Dogs that are infected will show signs including a cough, runny nose and fever. Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say a small proportion of dogs can develop severe disease.

The virus does not spread to humans however it can spread from dog to dog through a human's touch.

If a dog has a cough, the American Veterinary Medical Association recommends that you schedule an appointment with your veterinarian so that he or she can examine and evaluate your dog and recommend an appropriate course of treatment.

Pet owners can also request a vaccine to protect their dogs from this influenza.

[Canine influenza is a serious illness in our canine friends. If your dog has these initial clinical signs it is important to get treatment right away. While some cases may be mild, it can quickly get worse.

In many circles, it is becoming mandatory for dogs being boarded to have the vaccine prior to being boarded. There is an effective vaccine and for animals, especially those in the social circles, shows or dog parks, or boarding it is important to have them vaccinated.

Visit your veterinarian and have a check up for your pet. Be sure to get your rabies, distemper and other recommended vaccines including canine influenza.
