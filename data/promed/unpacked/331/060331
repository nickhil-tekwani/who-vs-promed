[1] Cholera - Congo DR: (North Kivu)

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is sounding the alarm about the situation in
North Kivu, where people are living in a state of extreme vulnerability.
The ongoing displacement of the population has increased as the armed
conflict has intensified in this province of eastern DRC. The humanitarian
situation is deteriorating, as demonstrated by malnutrition and the spread
of cholera in different regions of North Kivu.

"We are witnessing an alarming situation in our medical programs in Masisi
and Rutshuru Districts," says Colette Gadenne, head of mission for MSF.
"Many displaced people have had to flee several times in the last few years
and are now completely exhausted. The difficulty in accessing care,
malnutrition, epidemics and violence against civilians all mean that people
here are very vulnerable."

Since mid-November 2007, tens of thousands of displaced people have arrived
in Masisi, Kitchanga, Rutshuru, Nyanzale and Goma. Access to health care
for these people was already weak, but is even more limited today. The
fighting has forced several aid organisations to suspend their activities,
and health centres are not getting any supplies, or are deserted by the
medical staff.

In Rutshuru, today's misery is cholera. MSF started working in Rutshuru in
2005. This is the 1st time that medical teams have experienced a cholera
epidemic in this area. Since mid-November 2007, more than 1200 people have
been treated, and many more continue to arrive.

"New displacement has meant that the population of Rutshuru has doubled in
the space of a month," says Augustin Augier, MSF's Project Coordinator in
Rutshuru. "As a result, the quantity of available water per person has
decreased, and hygiene conditions have deteriorated, which has fueled the
spread of cholera."
In the Goma area, MSF has treated more than 1600 cholera patients since
September 2007. More than 45 000 people are living in camps to the west of
Goma. Although the camps are easily accessible, humanitarian aid is still
insufficient, and people living there complain about the lack of food.

Malawi will launch this year's cholera campaign week Friday [21 Dec 2007]
in Nkhatabay district, health
minister, Marjorie Ngaunje has said. The health minister conceded that
Malawi was already experiencing a cholera outbreak. "Let me mention that
the cholera outbreak has already started. By 16 Dec 2007, we had registered
291 cases with 2 deaths," said Ngaunje.

The minister told a news conference in Lilongwe that government is
distressed with the increase in cholera cases and called on development
partners and the general public to join hands with the ministry in
combating the disease. She said the cases in 2006/2007 were reported from
Nkhata Bay, Machinga, Phalombe, Nkhotakota, Mangochi and Nsanje districts
and said they needed serious efforts to check the increase of the outbreak
in the districts.

Buliisa district authorities on Friday [14 Dec 2007] arrested at least 100
people over failure to construct pit latrines in their homesteads. This
comes at a time when the district has been hit by cholera that has left 8
people dead and 156 others treated and discharged at different health
centers. The chief administrative officer (CAO), Nobert Turyahikayo, told
The New Vision on Saturday [15 Dec 2007] that over 58 per cent of the homes
in the district did not have latrines.

"We cannot sit and watch as people die," he said. The CAO denied recent
media reports that 15 people had died of cholera in the last 4 days. He
said one child died last week, while 8 deaths occurred between October and
December 2007.

Since early November 2007, Nebbi District is going through its worst ever
cholera epidemic, registering an average of 10 new cases every day,
according to district health officials. The outbreak that started in 3
sub-counties of Parombo, Akworo and Panyimur has also spread to 7
sub-counties, totaling 10. According to the latest medical statistics, the
district has recorded 331 cases since the outbreak, with 4 deaths. In 2006,
over 110 cases were recorded district wide.

Despite impressive revenues from fishing, especially at Dei landing site in
Panyimur, there has been virtually no investment in basic services like
health care since the 1970s, and only a privileged minority of the people
living there have access for borehole water.

The district health inspector, Mr Anthony Andrionzi, says a number of
factors conspired for the cholera outbreak: bad hygiene conditions,
overcrowding, lack of safe drinking water, poor hygiene and sanitation that
is rampant in most homes.

A cholera outbreak has killed at least 7 people and infected 33 others over
the past week in western Kenya, health officials said Monday [17 Dec 2007],
as authorities struggled to contain the disease. The fatalities included 3
children and 4 adults who died in Sindo and Mbita trading posts, said Suda
district medical officer of health David Soti.

A total of 33 patients are admitted in 3 health centers in the affected
district, about 330 km (206 miles) north west of the capital Nairobi, he
added. Public health officers have shut public eateries and markets as well
as appealed to the public to observe high sanitation standards in the
district in a bid to contain the contagious disease.

[6] Cholera, diarrhea - Zimbabwe: (Harare)

There are serious health fears across Harare after reports of a cholera
outbreak earlier this week. According to independent health experts in the
capital, the cholera outbreak has been created by the inability of the
Harare City Council to provide residents with clean water.

Many Harare residents have been forced to drink unsafe water from streams
and wells on the outskirts of the city. Complaints also abound that the
Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) is supplying people with
untreated tap water. The state run ZINWA took over the administration of
sewer and water reticulation from the City of Harare in 2006.

The Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) says the takeover has
resulted in erratic water supply and persistent sewer blockages in several
high-density suburbs. According to CHRA, at least 2000 cholera cases have
been reported at clinics around the city in the past week. They say the
township of Mabvuku in the east of the city has been worst hit.

CHRA spokesman Mfundo Mlilo said on Friday [14 Dec 2007] that "a CHRA team
visited Mabvuku and Tafara and interviewed medical personnel in private and
public clinics. We also have reports from Mbare, Budiriro and Glen View
townships. It has emerged that between 500 and 2000 cases have been
reported. The problem of disease outbreaks comes after residents in Mabvuku
and Tafara have been hit by serious water shortages resulting in most
households fetching water from streams."

[Mabvuku <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabvuku> is a high density suburb
some 17 km [10.5 miles] east of Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. It is
classified as a suburb or township of Harare, with the Harare City Council
constituting local government. It encompasses in particular the townships
that include Old Mabvuku and New Mabvuku, and more generally Old Tafara,
and New Tafara (the latter 2 constituting Tafara properly speaking).
