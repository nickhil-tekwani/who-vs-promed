Yellow fever alert - Caribbean 980601070345
Date: 16 & 22 Jul 1998
From: Haidi Tjon Kon Fat <ahtjon@sr.net>

All results were negative for yellow fever so we are glad that we do not
have an outbreak, but we are still alert.
Two of the 5 specimens that were sent to Institut Pasteur [Cayenne, French
Guiana tested positive for Dengue IgM. We have no results on the others.
We also sent an aliquot to CAREC. The problem with referring specimens to
Instituto Evandro Chagas [Belem, Brazil is a logistic one. If we send
specimens with DHL, it has to go through Miami and that is a major problem.
I shall work on this, because I think we might certainly benefit from their
services.

[If the suspect cases had jaundice and were severely ill, they could have
had Delta hepatitis, hence the interest in having them tested at a lab with
experience with that agent, such as the Instituto Evandro Chagas - Mod.JW
