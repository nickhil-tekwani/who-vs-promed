Officials in Denmark are investigating a salmonellosis outbreak with 32 cases and 19 hospitalizations. Initial information points to fresh pork as the source. Infections with _Salmonella [enterica_] monophasic Typhimurium have been reported to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) since mid-October [2018]. _Salmonella_ monophasic Typhimurium is often found in pigs.

The outbreak was discovered on 16 Nov 2018 and is being investigated by SSI, [National Food Institute - DTU], and Fødevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration). 14 women and 18 men aged zero to 86 years who live across the country are affected. No deaths have been recorded. None of the reported cases are relatives, nor do they know each other or been to a common event. Hovedstaden has 10 cases, Midtjylland has 9, Sjælland has 7, Nordjylland has 5, and there is one case in Syddanmark.

The bacterium _Salmonella_ monophasic Typhimurium ( I:4, 5,12:i,-) is resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Whole genome sequencing has found the strains are closely related and identified by sequence-type 5296.

Luise Müller, an epidemiologist at SSI, told Food Safety News the serotype is common in Denmark but the sequence type is new and has not been seen in Denmark before. "We have interviewed cases and we are currently doing a case control study where we also compare with the food history of people who have not been ill. The advice is to cook pork meat properly and keep raw meat and ready-to-eat food separate," she said.

Müller also said Denmark has no _Salmonella_ cases identical to the Dutch _Salmonella_ Goldcoast outbreak, which is also linked to pork. She said nothing points towards a shared source for the 2 outbreaks.

The last major outbreak of _Salmonella_ monophasic Typhimurium in Denmark was in 2014 and involved 25 cases. It was also nationwide and the source of infection was believed to be Danish pork.

[This report underscores that swine can be a significant reservoir for salmonellosis and that restaurants can cross-contaminate meats. The same serotype was responsible for the 2015 outbreak centered in Washington, USA with 182 confirmed cases.

The outbreak strain is _Salmonella_ I:4, 5,12:i,-, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control), presentation downloadable at: https://idslide.net/view-doc.html?utm_source=naming-salmonella-a-paccagnella-08-nov-05-serotype-salmonella:

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_, and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4, 5, 12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL
