[Eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis viruses belong to the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family Togaviridae. Alternate infection of birds and mosquitoes maintain these viruses in nature. The disease occurs sporadically in horses and humans from mid-summer to late autumn. Horses and humans are tangential dead-end hosts. The disease in horses is characterised by fever, anorexia, and severe depression. In severe cases, the disease in horses progresses to hyperexcitability, blindness, ataxia, severe mental depression, recumbency, convulsions, and death. Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus infection in horses is often fatal, while western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus can cause a subclinical or mild disease with less than 30 per cent mortality. EEE and WEE have been reported to cause disease in poultry, game birds, and ratites [large, flightless birds, ostriches, emus, etc]. Sporadic cases of EEE have been reported in cows, sheep, pigs, deer, and dogs.

EEE has been diagnosed in Quebec and Ontario in Canada, central and eastern regions of the United States of America (USA), the Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and Central and South America.

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.5.5 "Equine encephalomyelitis (Easter and Western)" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.05_EQUINE_ENCEPH.pdf
(version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013).

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. EEEV is maintained in a cycle between _Culiseta melanura_ mosquitoes and avian hosts in freshwater hardwood swamps. _Cs. melanura_ is not an important vector of EEE virus to humans because it feeds almost exclusively on birds. Transmission to humans requires mosquito species capable of creating a "bridge" between infected birds and uninfected mammals such as some _Aedes_, _Coquillettidia_, and _Culex_ species.

EEEV infection in humans can result in one of 2 types of illness, systemic or encephalitic (EEE). Systemic infection has an abrupt onset and is characterized by chills, fever, malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia. The illness lasts 1-2 weeks; recovery is complete when there is no central nervous system involvement. In infants, the encephalitic form is characterized by abrupt onset; in older children and adults, encephalitis is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Signs and symptoms in encephalitic patients are fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis, convulsions, and coma.

No specific antiviral treatment for EEEV infections is available. Patients with suspected EEE should be hospitalized, appropriate serologic and other diagnostic tests ordered, and supportive treatment provided. About a third of those who develop EEE die. Many of those who survive will have mild to severe permanent neurologic damage. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/factSheet.html.

According to the most recent 6-monthly OIE report (July-December 2012 or January-June 2013), available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, EEE was reported as clinical disease in 2 countries, as limited to certain zones in one country, as suspected in 3 countries, never reported in 142 countries, and absent during the reported period in 12 countries. 18 countries did not provide any data. Most countries have no specified surveillance for EEE, some maintain "general surveillance," and very few maintain "targeted surveillance."

During the 1st half of 2013, EEE was deported by Panama (reoccurrence of the disease, and event is continuing), and by Ecuador (1st occurrence, and event was resolved on 27 Aug 2013). (See: ProMED-mail archive numbers 20130605.1756291 and 20130604.1753732). Details of these events are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary.
