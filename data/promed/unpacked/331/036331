In Morocco, during a survey conducted in 2018, _Little cherry virus 1_ (_Velarivirus_, LChV-1) was detected in 2 samples which had been collected from asymptomatic apricot (_Prunus armeniaca_) trees. This 1st record in Morocco is also a 1st record for Africa.

[Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. In cherry, the disease can be caused by 2 closteroviruses, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, member of the new genus _Velarivirus_) and _Little cherry virus 2_ (LChV-2, genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections. Symptoms vary with host cultivars but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings, and some loss of tree vigour and yield. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible.

LChV-2 is transmitted by at least one species of mealy bugs, which can be spread by wind and with packing material in their nymph stages. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material. An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. Disease management for LCD includes use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees), and vector control for LChV-2.

LChV-1 single infection causes LCD in sweet and sour cherry; stunting has been reported in flowering cherry (_Prunus serrulata_, indicator cultivar). However, infection in other _Prunus_ species such as apricot, plum, almond, and peach does not cause obvious symptoms. LChV-1 epidemiology, its impact on stone fruit other than cherry (such as a potential reduction of plant vigour or fruit yield), as well as potential risks of spread between different stone fruit crops remains to be clarified. In Morocco, LChV-1 was declared a quarantine organism in 2018.

Symptoms similar to LCD can be caused by several phytoplasmas of the 16SrIII taxonomic group (X diseases; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
