Malawi Government has suspended all livestock sales in Nsanje district following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the district.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development through its secretary Bright Kumwembe says there is an outbreak of the disease in cattle at Bangula dip tank and Magoli Extension Planning Area (EPA) in the district which is within the Shire Valley ADD.

Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease that mostly affects cattle and has very devastating socio-economic consequences if not timely controlled.

According to the ministry, preliminary investigation conducted by veterinary field staff from the Shire Valley ADD and Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development indicates a total number of 60 critical cases out of a total of 581 cattle in 4 kraals.

The ministry further said a total of 65 000 cattle are at risk within the affected area and investigations are ongoing to establish the extent of the problem.

In conformity with the Control and Animal Diseases Act (Cap 66:02), and the World Animal Health Organisation [OIE] guidelines, the Ministry has therefore with immediate effect instituted measures within the affected area from Dolo EPA and the whole of Nsanje District.

Among other measures instituted are temporary suspension of all livestock (cattle, goats, sheep and pigs) markets, temporary ban of all livestock slaughters, movement restriction of livestock and livestock products, banning of issuance of livestock movement permits, and roadblocks and patrols at Sorgin, Phokera and Mtayamoyo.

The ministry has also advised livestock farmers and the general public to cooperate with its officials and the police during the implementation of measures put in place.

FMD also affected cattle in the Lower-Shire area in 2015.

[Malawi reported a single outbreak of FMD in cattle in the Chikwawa district (south) on 19 Sep 2015; reportedly, the outbreak had started on 30 Aug 2015. The serotype of the causative agent was reported to be pending. According to the said immediate notification, the previous FMD outbreak in Malawi had taken place in November 2011 (see 20150921.3661514).

Follow-up No. 1 was submitted to the OIE on 4 Nov 2015. No new outbreaks were reported as such, but see further epidemiological comments; the serotype remained "pending". This report included the following additional pieces of information:

1. Epidemiological comments: The affected population is under a communal grazing system. As of 8 Oct 2015, a total of 6 clinical cases have been reported. There have been no new cases since 9 Oct 2015. However, the localized restrictions in and around the affected Mthumba dip tank are still in place awaiting science-based evidence that the outbreak has indeed been contained. 58 animals were sampled during pre and post vaccination to monitor the seroconversion rate. It was found out that 95 percent of the sampled animals seroconverted.
The report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=19022.

2. Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Chikwawa / Cattle / 9965 / The vaccinated animals are those around the outbreak and also around the nearby Lengwe National Park, which has a lot of buffalos.

The district Nsanje, where the current cases have bee observed, is situated in the extreme south of Malawi; it borders on its north the district Chikwawa where the September 2015 was recorded.

Malawi's last annual report on OIE's WAHID website dates back to December 2013. - Mod.AS
