The extended rain spell over the city has claimed 2 lives in the past 5 days, a health report released by the civic authorities late on Monday [3 Oct 2016] showed.

A 24-year-old Kurla woman died on 29 Sep 2016 due to a brain infection along with leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that spreads through flood waters contaminated with the urine of an infected dog or rat. The woman, who lived in the Raghunath chawl of Naupada area, had given a history of wading through stagnant water.

With these deaths, which occurred in BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel, the BMC confirmed that leptospirosis has so far claimed 8 lives. [BMC is Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body of Mumbai, the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra.]

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Mumbai is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is the wettest month, with almost non-stop rain. At this time, parts of the city become waterlogged (http://www.skymetweather.com/content/weather-news-and-analysis/mumbai-rains-to-continue-for-another-24-hours/).

Kurla is a suburb of Mumbai (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurla). Maps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4536524,55086. Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. - Mod.ML]
