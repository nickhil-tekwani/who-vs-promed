News that an unvaccinated Ontario boy is in hospital with a dangerous tetanus infection is prompting calls from worried parents seeking information on how to get their children vaccinated.

The tetanus case was a 6 year old boy from Owen Sound, Ontario, about a 2.5-hour drive north west of Toronto. The unidentified child had never been vaccinated against tetanus, a painful and life-threatening condition also known as lockjaw. The boy had been transferred to London, Ontario for intensive care. But his condition has improved, and he was moved to a pediatric care bed over the weekend, said Dr Christine Kennedy, associate medical officer of health for the Grey Bruce Health Unit. Kennedy said the unit has had numerous inquiries about vaccinations since word of the tetanus case hit the news over the weekend.

Tetanus is an infection caused by the bacterium _Clostridium tetani_. _C. tetani_ spores are ubiquitous, found in soil, dust and manure; infection occurs when spores make their way into a cut or a wound.

The name lockjaw comes from the severe muscle contractions that are triggered by the toxin the bacteria produce. The spasms are so strong, in fact, that people can suffer broken bones. They can also interfere with breathing. Tetanus infections are fatal in a significant portion of cases, with the rate varying among different age groups. In young children, between 20 and 30 per cent of infections lead to death, said Dr Shelley Deeks, Public Health Ontario's medical director for immunization and vaccine preventable disease.

There is no specific remedy for tetanus, though people who contract the infection may be given an antitoxin and are often treated with sedatives to control the spasms. Although commoner in the past, tetanus is now rare because most people are vaccinated against it.

Children are supposed to get 4 doses of vaccine containing tetanus protection. In Canada, the vaccine for children is generally combined with others that protect against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b and polio. Adults need tetanus booster shots every 10 years.

Everyone needs to be vaccinated against tetanus because the disease is not one where so-called herd immunity can develop, Kennedy noted. When high levels of children are immunized against some diseases -- mumps or chickenpox, for instance -- you would not expect to see many cases; when few people are susceptible, diseases cannot easily spread. But tetanus doesn't transmit from person to person. It is contracted when a vulnerable person is exposed to _C. tetani_ spores. That means that even if 95 per cent of children were vaccinated, the remaining 5 per cent would still be at risk.

[This report underscores the need for appropriate follow up immunization for another vaccine preventable disease, tetanus. ProMED-mail has been active in reporting similar issues related to pertussis and measles in the developed world as well as the increase in poliomyelitis in parts of the developing world, all primarily related to undervaccination.

It is also noteworthy that as editor-in-chief of IDCases -- an open access infectious diseases case report journal -- I have seen 3 submissions regarding tetanus cases in an elderly population, primarily unimmunized, in the developed world, the UK and Norway. One has already been published (Collins S, White J, Ramsay M, Amirthalingam G. The importance of tetanus risk assessment during wound management. IDCases 2015; 2:3-5 http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2214250914000420/1-s2.0-S2214250914000420-main.pdf?_tid=ddc53b5e-cb20-11e4-926b-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1426430454_827959d608524cd92b22e7e085897fb8, and 2 are currently in the peer review process. Although the number of cases of tetanus in the developed world is not high, the case fatality rate in these cases is dramatically higher than for pertussis and measles.

This case underscores the need for primary vaccination against this disease and many others. In addition, routine boosters for tetanus during office visits or hospitalizations for any reason must be utilized to prevent these cases, and trauma-related opportunities for tetanus protection should not be missed. - Mod.LL
