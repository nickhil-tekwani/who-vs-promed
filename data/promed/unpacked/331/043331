France: Suspected human & equine cases of West Nile virus infection
---------------------------------------------------
A probable human case of infection of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus
has been reported in France, the Health Ministry stated. "All our European
partners have been informed of the appearance of this case." It was
reported on Mon 6 Oct 2003 that the person concerned had received hospital
treatment but has since been able to return home. The patient had also
travelled to Spain during the 2-to-14-day incubation period, the Ministry
said.
Another probable case of infection with the virus has been reported in a
horse in a different area of the same southern French region as the
suspected human case. "Further examinations are currently underway to
confirm these 2 diagnoses," the Ministry added.
The virus usually infects wild birds but can be spread by mosquitoes that
have been infected by birds, to humans or herbivores, mainly horses.The
virus is not transmitted from human to human, nor from horse to human, the
French ministry said. The French authorities have stepped up their
surveillance against West Nile virus.
Around 20 cases of West Nile virus have been reported in central Tunisia in
recent weeks. None of those infected by the mosquito-borne virus have died
of the disease, health officials said on Tue 7 Oct 2003.
In the United States, the virus has claimed at least 115 lives this year
out of 5861 infections [136 and 6507 as of 8 Oct 2003 - Mod.CP], according
to official figures released at the start of the month. In France, a
handful of infections have been reported, but no one has developed the
disease, medical sources said.
