A raccoon that bit 2 individuals in the Chisholm neighborhood in north Montgomery [Montgomery county] over the past weekend [21-22 Apr 2018] has tested positive for the rabies virus, the Alabama Department of Public Health [ADPH] confirmed. The people have been notified, and have begun receiving the rabies vaccine from their medical provider. The vaccine is necessary in a timely manner in order to protect them from this deadly disease. The Montgomery County Health Department is currently investigating to determine if other people had contact with the raccoon.

Coincidentally, last week [week of 16 Apr 2018] Montgomery county officials heard reports of animals exhibiting strange behavior, and ADPH worked with Montgomery animal control officers to capture and test those animals. Those particular animals were not found to be positive for rabies. According to State Public Health Veterinarian Dr Dee W Jones, "Although there are other infectious diseases of wildlife that can make an animal behave strangely, most notably a distemper virus infection, it is safest to always use caution and not approach any wild animal and to call animal control."

The rabies virus is transmitted by saliva. In general, rabies exposure requires direct contact with infected saliva, usually through a bite or a scratch, but other less common contact exposures with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and mouth) are also considered as potential exposures.

Residents are advised to take the following precautions to avoid possible exposure to rabies:
- Do not allow pets to run loose; confine them within a fenced-in area or with a leash.
- Do not leave uneaten pet food or scraps near your residence.
- Do not illegally feed or keep wildlife as pets.
- Do not go near wildlife or domestic animals that are acting in a strange or unusual manner.
- Caution children not to go near any stray or wild animal, regardless of its behavior.
- Advise children to tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.
- A person who is bitten or scratched by an animal should wash wounds immediately with mild soap and water, apply first aid, and seek medical attention or contact the county health department immediately.

Alabama state law requires that dogs, cats and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccines are also available for horses and other livestock if recommended by a veterinarian. Vaccinating animals reduces the risk of rabies infection should an exposure occur; thus vaccinations help protect animals, as well as their owners and caretakers.

A possibly rabid fox is dead after attacking several residents in a Burlington neighborhood [Middlesex county].

[AL] was walking 10-year-old daughter, to the bus stop when the animal charged at them. "It took off and started running toward us, so I stuck her behind me and told her to start getting back to the house, and it started it was lunging and so I was kicking at it, swinging the backpack," [AL] said.

Across the street, [JB] was on the phone with Animal Control after she had been attacked just minutes prior. "I had a Wiffle Ball bat over there and I was just trying to take the water off the tarp and I was poking it like that, and I heard a noise behind me and I had the bat in my hand and I just turned around and the thing came lunging at me and I had to just keep whacking it with the bat," [JB] said.

The Leopold Street neighborhood was frantic with this fox running after people just as many were starting their days.

"Lunged at me, bit me, took me down, it bit me again. While I was down, I kicked it off me and finally got into the house," [AL] said. [Her daughter] made it inside the home, and [AL's] husband came out with an ice scraper to scare the fox off.

Several hours later on a nearby street, another woman was attacked and received injuries serious enough to require a trip to the hospital.

The fox's day came to an end when it attacked a police officer working a detail. "The animal charged at the officer and the officer had to discharge his weapon, and put the animal down," Det Jim Tigges said.

Both bitten women are receiving rabies treatments while the animal is at a lab being tested.

[3] New York (Westchester County): coyote, human exposure
Date: Tue 1 May 2018

The coyote that viciously bit a 5-year-old girl at a Westchester county playground before being tackled by a cop was suffering from rabies, health officials said [Tue 1 May 2018]. "We got results back -- and it did test positive for rabies," Catherine Cioffi, communications director of the Westchester County Health Department, told The Post.

The child, [NK-P], had been playing at James Carroll Park in Thornwood with her mom and brother [Sun 29 Apr 2018] when the animal darted at full speed toward them and bit her left arm. The girl was saved from the animal by off-duty local cop Arcangelo Liberatore, who tackled and wrestled it to the ground. The coyote left the girl with a bite wound, her mom with a nip, and the officer with a scrape that came in contact with the animal's saliva.

The injuries could pass the disease to the 3 -- but they all got rabies shots within hours after the attack and will now get 3 more, over a 2-week period, to prevent contracting the virus, according to the cop and the girl's mother. [The girl's mother] said health officials assured her that they'll be fine. "As a mother, you're always concerned about things like this. But the nurse tells us we won't develop rabies if we get the rest of the shots, so that's a good thing," [said the 36-year-old woman].

[The girl] was back at school [Tue 1 May 2018] and doing great, her mom said. "She's been a champ. She hasn't complained once about pain, even when she got the shot [Sun 29 May 2018]," [her mother] said. "She is beyond a trouper."

Liberatore added, "I know that in humans, rabies is an atrocious debilitating disease. My wife is a nervous wreck -- but I'm not concerned about it. I have a lot of faith in the health system," he said. "The nurse I spoke to seems confident about [the procedure]."

Dogs with rabies suffer from aggression and delirium and secrete large amounts of the virus in their saliva, which they can pass to humans through bites and scratches. "Everyone who came into contact with the animal, or its saliva, is being evaluated to determine the need for preventive rabies treatment," the Westchester County Health Department said in a statement. Health Commissioner Sherlita Amler warned, "If a coyote approaches, make noise and try to avoid it. If it appears aggressive or lethargic, it could have rabies, so contact local police."

[4] South Carolina (Pickens county): goat, human exposure
Date: Tue 1 May 2018
Source: WSPA [edited]
http://www.wspa.com/news/goat-exposes-4-people-to-rabies-in-pickens-co/1153874881


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] said [Tue 1 May 2018] that 4 people have been exposed to rabies in the southwest area of Pickens county after caring for a young goat. According to a DHEC news release, those exposed were caring for the goat and when it began showing odd behavior and had increased salivation, the goat was euthanized on April 27. The goat was then sent to the University of Georgia for testing, which confirmed it had rabies.

According to the release, South Carolina law requires pet owners to vaccinate dogs, cats, and ferrets, but does not require owners of agricultural animals to vaccinate, nor is there an approved vaccine for, goats.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people use caution when pets or livestock exhibit sudden changes in behavior," David Vaughan of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services (BEHS) said. "This is especially true if owners notice unexplainable injuries on their animals, or stray/wild animals mingling with livestock or pets."

According to the release, DHEC recommends that owners of agricultural animals vaccinate: any livestock that have frequent contact with humans; any livestock that are particularly valuable; animals used for raw milk or raw milk product production.

DHEC officials said the goat is the second animal in Pickens county to test positive for rabies in 2018, and said there have been 20 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide so far in 2018. According to the release, one of the 63 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina in 2017 was in Pickens county.

There is little to add that has not be said many times before. If you are confronted by a wild animal, be cautious, especially if it is a species that is normally active after dark. If concerned, call the local wildlife department so that they can deploy someone to capture the animal and initiate a rabies diagnostic procedure. If bitten, go to emergency healthcare and get vaccinated. Done right it is not a painful shot. And maker sure that children do not, repeat NOT!, pick up any sick bats. Bat rabies is fairly common.

On the other end, veterinarians and wildlife folk should make sure that their rabies shots are up to date. You never know when you are going to be exposed. Since I qualified in 1960 I have been exposed countless times, starting with bats in a volcanic vent in Mexico where they were mining bat guano. And it is a good idea at your annual medical checkup to have them titre your antibody level. Until I was told about the availability of rabies antibody titration, I got my rabies shots every 3 years.

How this South Carolina goat got exposed is not immediately obvious. If it was south of Texas, I would expect vampire bats. Sick bats regularly fall into livestock feed troughs. To keep on top of your rabies get any and all recovered rabies virus strain S typed and map the recoveries if only with coloured pins in a wall map. And remember animals die with a number of diseases -- when an urban population of raccoons grows too dense it is just a matter of time before a raccoon gets infected by a distempered dog and distemper virus moves fast and lethally through raccoon populations. Our last raccoon distemper epidemic killed around 80 percent of the raccoons in the city parish. A raccoon staggering about with distemper is still better checked than ignored. Let the wildlife department decide. - Mod.MHJ]
