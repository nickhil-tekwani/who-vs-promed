East Kasai: resurgence of sleeping sickness in Bena Kalambayi
-------------------------------------------------------------
Bena Kalambayi is 100 km from Mbuji-Mayi in the territory of Ngandajika in
the province of East Kasai. Recent statistics from the health authorities
indicate that 13 per cent of the population in this region have sleeping
sickness. Already, some deaths have, regrettably, occurred.
A combined mission between MONUC (Mission des Nations Unies en Republique
Democratique du Congo, or United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic
of Congo) and other humanitarian partners is meeting there within the next
few days.
About 1650 people, or about 13 per cent of the population, have been
infected in this epidemic. According to the National Program for the Fight
Against Trypanosomiasis, this number has noticeably increased during the
last 2 weeks [3rd and 4th weeks August 2005]. This situation worries the
provincial authorities.
The provincial health inspection office has dispatched mobile facilities to
the area. They have favored a mission to support the local treatment center
for sleeping sickness and to increase the number of mobile facilities in
this region. The provincial inspector remains cautious about the number of
registered deceased cases. Nonetheless, the situation remains worrisome.
The health authorities of East Kasai asked the population of Bena Kalambayi
to appear at mobile facilities at the 1st sign of symptoms. The
humanitarian section of MONUC had organized, on 11 Jul 2005, a combined
mission to the Tshilenge district, about 60 km from Mbuji-Mayi, after being
informed of the trypanosomiasis epidemic in this locality.
According to medical sources, 16 people with the disease are hospitalized,
and another 24 are receiving home health care because of the currently
limited core hospital facilities. The local authorities have said that
health kits have been directed to the respective health centers.
Sleeping sickness is transmitted by the bite of the tse-tse fly. According
to Jean-Pierre Mulunda of the National Program for the Fight Against
Trypanosomiasis, this illness is marked by headaches, body aches, irregular
fever, nighttime insomnia, as well as profound sleepiness during the course
of the day. Detected in time, sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis, is
curable. Treatment is free. A combined mission from MONUC and other
humanitarian partners will arrive at the locality in the next few days to
evaluate the situation.

[The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the real number of
trypanosomiasis cases in Africa is between 300 000 and 500 000. Reported
cases in recent years are from countries where surveillance coverage is no
more than 5 per cent. In certain villages of many provinces of Angola, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and southern Sudan, the prevalence is between
20 per cent and 50 per cent. Sleeping sickness has become the 1st or 2nd
greatest cause of mortality, ahead of HIV/AIDS, in those provinces.
