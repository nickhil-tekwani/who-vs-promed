There is an epidemic coming. The gram negative bacteria that produces
the NDM1 (New Delhi mettalo-beta-lactamase-1) enzyme, making it
resistant to powerful antimicrobials like the carbapenems, is
developing a resistance to the last line of antimicrobial defense.

It will develop resistance to old drugs such as Colistin and
Tigacycline in a couple of years, say doctors, and the process has
already started. Dr Bharat Shah, a senior nephrologist in the city,
says: "There are already cases where drugs like colistin are not
proving to be as effective as earlier."

Dr Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease expert who was one of the 1st
in India to raise the NDM-1 alarm a couple of years back, says: "Once
the bacteria become resistant, thousands in ICUs all over the country,
those undergoing complex procedures like transplants, or even those
infected by the relatively harmless _Klebsiella_ or _E. coli_, will be
at huge risk."

Dr Mark Toleman, a senior research fellow at the Department of
Infection, Immunity and Biochemistry at Cardiff University [UK], was
part of a team that conducted a study which found that 30 percent of
all water samples tested in New Delhi contained bacteria carrying
NDM-1. In a carrier test done by the team in Rawalpindi, they found
the presence of NDM1-producing bacteria in 14 percent of the people
and 27 percent of the patients. "Based on the results, we estimate
that 100 million Indians are already carrying bacteria harboring the
gene," he said.

The risk of infection is highest in hospitals because of a mix of
unhygienic conditions as well as the fact that the sick are generally
more prone to this particular infection. "The gram negative bacteria
in hospitals acquire genetic characteristics from other bacteria
present there," says Dr Abhay Chaudhary, director of Haffkine
Institute.

Toleman says: "Once Colistin is gone, there is little if anything that
can be done. Studies in the UK have shown that combinations of
different drugs can be used successfully against the bacteria, but
this is really hit-or-miss. The future looks especially bleak for East
Asia, and the Indian government is utterly complacent at the moment."

One problem in India is the lack of control on use of anti-infectives.
Toleman says this unrestricted use will make any new drug useless
rapidly. "It seems unfair that companies in the West should invest
heavily in development just to have their drug copied in India and
then rendered useless because the Indian government has failed to put
down restrictions," he adds.

So what's the solution? We need to take precautionary measures, says
Chaudhary. "We need to have a serious antimicrobial and infection
control policy at our hospitals. We must have a stringent disinfectant
policy that makes sure that hospital staff scrupulously disinfect
medical apparatus."

However, in a country where most government hospitals have dogs
roaming in and about and open bins with swarming flies, it remains to
be seen whether a proper sanitation policy is implemented.

[Originating in India, NDM-1 containing bacteria have spread to other
parts of the world. As reported in the 25 Jun 2010 Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (2010;59:750), during the 1st half of 2010, 3
isolates of _Enterobacteriaceae_, an _E. coli_, a _Klebsiella
pneumoniae_, and an _Enterobacter cloacae_, were identified at CDC to
carry NDM-1, which confers resistance to all beta-lactams except
aztreonam (a monobactam) and were also resistant to aztreonam. All 3
isolates were from patients who received recent medical care in
India.

Yong and colleagues (Yong D, Toleman MA, Giske CG, et al:
Characterization of a new metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla-NCm-1, and
novel erythromycin esterase gene carried on a unique genetic structure
in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ sequence type 14 from India. Antimicrob
Agents Chemother. 2009;53: 5046-54) found that the plasmid carrying
NDM-1 also carries several other resistance genes and appears to
easily transmit itself to other organisms. The authors state that "the
dissemination of this plasmid among clinical bacteria would be a
nightmare scenario."

This NDM-1 gene cassette of wide-spectrum antimicrobial resistance
appears to have developed in the Indian subcontinent, as in the above
report, where the use of antimicrobial agents is quite poorly
controlled. Organisms carrying this resistance combination have
already been introduced into western Europe, the USA and Canada. The
best methods of control are rapid recognition by standard
microbiologic/nucleic acid methodology in patients having the
appropriate medical/travel history and aggressive hand washing
techniques.

The amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I
am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA will no
doubt serve as an efficient multiplier of these isolates, just as
intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the
explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly
related to the lack of control of antimicrobial usage in intensive
care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER
physicians who often react with a lack of wisdom and "cookbook"
protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing
patterns. Once the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, the physicians
do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures,
not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is
recognized -- that is, using these agents only when rational, in
combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic
interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and
meaningful improvement in a patient's life -- the medical community
will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic
options will exist. - Mod.LL
