Radio Free Asia (RFA) says that typhoid fever is spreading in Ryanggang [Yanggang] province in North Korea. Quoting Japan's news outlet Asia Press and a source in North Korea, the USA-based broadcaster reported on Tue 24 Oct 2017, that outbreaks of typhoid were reported in Ryanggang province this month [October 2017] and related deaths are increasing among the older people.

RFA said that North Korean authorities are struggling to contain the disease as it is spreading rapidly since the 1st case was reported in June 2017.

Jiro Ishimaru, head of Asia Press' Osaka office, told RFA that the outbreak is attributable to the North's poor water supply, sewerage system, and the Yalu River as many local residents in Ryanggang province drink the water from the river without boiling it.

[ProMED would appreciate more information about this reported outbreak.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
