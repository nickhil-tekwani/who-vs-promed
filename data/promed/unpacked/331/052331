A Colorado meat company is expanding a recall of beef due to possible
contamination by _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria after an investigation found 18
illnesses may be linked to the meat, the company and the US Agriculture
Department said on Sunday [28 Jun 2009].

Greeley, Colorado-based JBS-Swift Beef Co is voluntarily expanding its 24
Jun 2009 recall to include about 380 000 lbs (172.3 tonnes) of assorted
beef products, for a total recall of about 421 000 lbs [191 tonnes], USDA
and the company said. The affected beef was produced on 21 Apr 2009 and was
distributed nationally and internationally. "The contamination may have
come from further processing by other companies," Chandler Keys, JBS
spokesman, said on Sunday [28 Jun 2009].

USDA said the recalled products are typically used for steaks and roasts
rather than ground beef. However, it said some of the beef may have been
processed into ground products by other companies. It is unlikely the
recall will be expanded further, and JBS will be contacting customers that
received the beef to learn how the product was distributed, said Keys.

The contamination was investigated by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[A key issue in the recall is that it is not primarily related to ground
beef but rather steaks and roasts, some of which might be processed into
ground beef. In most situations, surface contamination with the pathogen is
not an issue since the piece of meat is cooked at least on the outside.
However, as noted in a past ProMED-mail posting (E. coli O157, frozen
steaks - USA (Midwest): recall 20030701.1617), the bacteria associated with
the steak are usually external, meaning that the pathogen would be killed
by heat, which might not inactivate internal bacteria. In that posting, the
meat had been injected with tenderizers so that the _E. coli_ could be
inoculated internally. This technique to fool Mother Nature once again may
produce more collective harm than individual good. The mechanism of
contamination of steaks in a more recent ProMED posting (E. coli O157,
steak - USA (PA): recall 20070426.1362) was not stated.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Volk for this posting and awaits more information
regarding the form of meat associated with the outbreak strain. - Mod.LL
