New molecular laboratory findings from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention provide a firm link between an outbreak of
_Campylobacter_ diarrhea that occurred in Southcentral Alaska this
summer and eating uncooked peas grown in Alaska.

"Molecular studies demonstrated that there was a match between
_Campylobacter_ bacteria obtained from sick people and those obtained
from pea and Sandhill Crane samples taken from the farm in Palmer,"
said Dr. Tracie Gardner, an epidemiologist with the Alaska Division
of Public Health.

To date, the investigation has identified 99 people sickened by the
bacteria who reported eating raw peas within 10 days of illness
onset. 54 had laboratory confirmation of illness. 5 were
hospitalized. None have died.

Investigation revealed a lack of chlorine in the water used to wash
the peas at the farm. State officials are working with the farm to
implement future control measures.

[Campylobacteriosis is often associated with poorly cooked chicken or
turkeys but waterfowl, as well, having asymptomatic infections in
their intestinal tracts. Based on the information, both the raw peas
and the cranes are "smoking," that is the genotypically identical
organism was found in the reservoir and vehicle. Washing fresh
produce presumably not done in this situation would have minimized
the risk of disease.

canadensis_) can be found at:
