The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) said 4 cows in Franklin and Walla Walla counties were diagnosed this week with epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), a potentially deadly virus primarily affecting wild deer, but occasionally crossing over to cattle.

The WSDA advises cattle owners to be on the lookout for EHD signs such as excessive drooling, lethargy, difficulty walking, or oral and nasal lesions with ulceration, which are similar to the much more devastating foot-and-mouth disease. Fever and anorexia due to the oral erosions were seen in the recently diagnosed cattle. Supportive care is the only treatment for infected cows.

Differentiating EHD from other animal diseases requires laboratory testing, so cattle owners should contact veterinarians if the signs are observed.

"Although EHD is seldom prevalent in cattle, we must show an abundance of caution and investigate each case due to the similarity of signs this disease has with the highly contagious and economically disastrous foot-and-mouth disease," Washington State Veterinarian Dr. Brian Joseph said.

EHD is not a threat to human health.

The disease usually occurs in cattle where environmental conditions support large populations of biting midges. Biting midges or _Culicoides_ spp. gnats, commonly known as "no-see-ums" are the main way the disease is spread. Female biting midges can ingest blood from infected animals and then feed on uninfected animals. These midges typically breed near mud, so EHD outbreaks often occur when cattle congregate in wet areas.

The WSDA said cattle and sheep can be affected, but generally it is a deer disease.

No vaccines for EHD are available, so controlling the midges by eliminating standing water from areas used by cows, applying insecticides around water areas to decrease the swarms, or using bug repellent on the cows are the best defense. In the coming weeks, the cool fall weather and frost is expected to limit the gnat population and the spread of the disease.

["In the U.S., EHD in cattle is typically uncommon, rarely fatal, and usually associated with an epidemic in deer.

"The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family Reoviridae. Ten serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide. The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_ sp. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV."

"Disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical. Typical signs include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic;"

In checking the Washington State Department of Agriculture, they are not currently reporting EHD in deer. There may be some deer affected that have not yet been found. However, cattle can be helped by using fly/mosquito spray approved for use on cattle.

EHD and bluetongue virus are related but are completely separate diseases.

We sincerely hope the animals recover. - Mod.TG
