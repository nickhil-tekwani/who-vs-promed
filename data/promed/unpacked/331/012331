Wild dog expert and researcher at the Endangered Environmental Trust (EWT), Grant Beverley, said he witnessed the devastation of rabies on a pack of wild dogs denning in the Blue Canyon Conservancy, near Hoedspruit, Lowvelder reported. The dogs were the only resident pack in the Lowveld outside the Greater Kruger area, he said.

Beverley said that during the middle of August [2015] 5 wild dog puppies were found next to the road to Zandspruit. Some of them were emaciated and unsteady on their feet.

"Staggering or stumbling due to weakness in the hind legs is a common rabies sign because the virus attacks the central nervous system," Beverley said. "Most people know that foaming at the mouth is a sign of a rabid dog. It is muscle weakness of the mouth and pharynx that causes saliva to drool." he added.

Two days after witnessing the death of 2 more pups, Beverley came across the carcass of 1 of the females. It is believed the dog had convulsions before it died. He took the carcass for testing that confirmed rabies.

Head of Veterinary Wildlife Services at KNP, Dr Marcus Hofmeyr, said no cases of rabies in any wildlife had been recorded at the park, adding, however, that the potential spread of the disease was "worrying." "There is no immediate plan to vaccinate the dogs in the park, however it is critical that any stray dog or jackal displaying strange behaviour be reported."

State veterinarian at KNP, Dr Louis van Schalkwyk, added that a stray dog or jackal "would be the most likely source of rabies and those animals also pose a danger to people. We do support a sustained vaccination programme of domestic dogs throughout the country. Rabies is not something that only occurs in rural villages or in feral animals. What we need is a ring of protection around our wildlife, a community effort to ensure vaccination, an effort that involves the awareness of everyone," Beverley added.

[The African wild dog (_Lycaon pictus_), or African painted dog, is a canid native to Sub-Saharan Africa. For a picture go to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/African_wild_dog_(Lycaon_pictus_pictus).jpg.

The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is not only a public health issue but a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world. Population crashes and local extinctions of endangered African wild dogs have been linked to canine pathogens such as rabies virus, canine distemper virus, and the bacterial pathogen _Ehrlichia canis_. - Mod.PMB
