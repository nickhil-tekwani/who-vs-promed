Angola: Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Death Toll Reaches 155
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 4 Apr 2005 the outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever has
intensified in Angola, claiming more than 29 lives over the past 4 days and
taking the nationwide toll to 155, heightening fear of the disease in the
capital Luanda.
Angolan health minister Sebastiao Veloso said the toll climbed to "175
cases, among them 155 dead, all from the province of Uige," the epicentre
of the outbreak in the country's north on the border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo. 80 percent of the cases involved children under 15.
In Luanda, international experts were working round-the-clock to complete a
special isolation ward to treat incoming cases from around the country.
Volunteer workers at the Americo Boa Vida hospital, the largest in Angola,
are being outfitted with special "Ebola suits" to work as cleaners and
washers within the isolation ward, located at the back of the hospital.
"We are late, we must admit it, but we have experienced a lot of resistance
from the medical staff, the patients and the inhabitants," said Jacques
Mambela-Mbela, the clinical director of Boa Vida. [MSF (Medecins sans
Frontieres)] have been working since Tuesday to prepare the ward, which
will be able to take up to 40 confirmed Marburg cases, said Amsterdam-based
MSF water sanitation specialist Marco Visser. "People don't shake hands
these days in Luanda, because they are scared of the disease," he added.
Visser was putting workers through a rigorous training in their white
protective suits, which covered them from head to toe, despite the humid
weather and temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius. "We are making sure
that these guys are not too scared, that they know the facts rather than
rumours," Visser told AFP as he first showed volunteers how to clean the
ward and afterwards how to take the suits off without getting contaminated.
Strict rules have to be followed once inside the "high-risk" inner zone,
which has been cordoned off with red and white plastic tape. "This include
rules like not touching walls and making sure that the protective [clothing
is undamaged]", said fellow MSF specialist Klaasjan Sollie. The Angolan
Health Ministry said the unit would not be ready for at least the next 5
days. "We are really hoping that we are finished before any suspected cases
are brought here," said Visser.
Marburg virus spreads [through] body fluids such as blood, urine,
excrement, vomit and saliva. The disease was first identified in 1967 in
Germany after laboratory workers were infected by monkeys from Uganda. The
Marburg outbreak has claimed a record number of lives in Angola, overtaking
an earlier peak in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

South Africa: Suspected Marburg Case in Eastern Cape
-----------------------------------------------------
[Marburg virus may] have killed a South African. Health authorities were
waiting anxiously on Mon 4 Apr 2005 for the results of tests for Marburg
virus infection. If the results are positive, a 50-year-old Eastern Cape
resident will be the 1st person in South Africa to die of this contagious
virus. SAPA reports that 150 people from the Uige province in Angola have
already succumbed to the virus, similar to the notorious Ebola virus.
The dead South African travelled from Luanda about a week ago and spent
time in Johannesburg. It is not clear what the rest of his itinerary was or
how much time he spent in Johannesburg. The man, whose identity has not
been released, died in the hospital in Steynsburg near Aliwal North on Thur
[31 Mar 2005] night while he was waiting for treatment.
A spokesperson for the Eastern Cape Department of Health, Sizwe Jupelo,
said the deceased worked in Angola for about a year. It is possible that
the man came into contact with the virus. The man's body was taken to the
Nelson Mandela Hospital in Mthatha for a post-mortem examination and some
of his tissue was sent to a laboratory in Pretoria for tests. Kupelo said
the results of the tests should be known next week.
Eastern Cape MEC for health, Dr. Bevan Goqwana, said the man vomited and
had diarrhoea. Goqwana, who practised as a doctor before, said in his
opinion it was unlikely that the man had died as a result of Marburg virus
infection. "It could have been malaria." The man had seen a doctor in
Molteno earlier this week and was treated for influenza and bronchitis.
However, he had no fever. The doctor in Molteno could not be reached on Monday.
The independent information service, Med-Info, says Marburg fever can
easily be confused with more common diseases such as malaria, yellow fewer
or typhoid fever because the symptoms are not specific. Early symptoms
include runny diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, severe chest and
lung pains, sore throat and coughing. In most cases, the lungs and
intestines start bleeding at a later stage and a characteristic rash breaks
out. The virus is highly contagious and is spread through close contact
with bodily fluids such as saliva and sweat.
A carrier of the virus normally falls ill within 3-7 days, but Dr. Andrew
Jamieson of Netcare Travel Clinics said there have been cases where
carriers of the virus fell ill only after 21 days. This makes it much
easier for travellers to spread the disease to other areas. "It is more
important than ever that South African hospitals be alert for possible
cases of people who were in Angola within the last 3 weeks," he said.
A spokesperson for the national department of health, Solly Mabotha, said
the department is aware of this case, but it is too early to speculate
whether it is a case of Marburg virus infection or not.

Angola: Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Not Yet Under Control
----------------------------------------------------------------
Angola's Marburg epidemic, which has claimed 155 lives, is not under
control and the country urgently needs protective clothing for health
workers battling the deadly virus, a UN official said on Tue 5 Apr 2005.
With a mortality rate of 88 percent and 9 new cases reported since Sun 3
Apr 2005 -- bringing the total to 175 -- efforts to spread information
about Marburg were more urgent than ever, Mario Ferrari, UNICEF chief in
Angola told Reuters. "It will take time, we must be patient; it is not in 2
or 3 days that we can eradicate this. But I'm confident that at the end
there will be success," he added.
The northern province of Uige has been the epicentre of the disease, for
which there is no specific cure. But there are fears that it could spread
to other provinces, including Luanda, home to more than 4 million people.
In the capital, residents have scrambled to take precautions, emptying
store shelves of bleach to disinfect their homes and gossiping nervously
about the disease. "In a town like Luanda I understand that everybody is on
alert because if the disease is implanted in Luanda, it would be quite
complicated because of the size of the population, and because there is a
large movement of people," Ferrari said.
Ferrari said a nationwide public awareness campaign, led by the Ministry of
Health and supported by UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO),
would target health workers at the front line of the epidemic, as well as
the population at large. But he said there was still a serious shortfall in
protective clothing for health workers, including goggles, face masks and
headgear, and said that UNICEF and WHO were coordinating a "flash appeal"
to mobilise more resources. "We need materials to protect people working in
direct contact with patients who may be infected and also kits with
essential drugs to make sure health centres in other provinces are prepared
in case the virus spreads," he added.
