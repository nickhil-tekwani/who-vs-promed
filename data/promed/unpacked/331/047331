In Europe, where there have been over 26 000 cases of measles so far
this year [2011], there have been a fair share of severe cases of
measles. In fact, in France, where there have been just over 14 000
cases, there have been 6 deaths. Another death was reported in
Germany, where there have been 1361 cases. Other severe cases of
measles have included
- 615 cases of pneumonia and 15 cases of encephalitis associated with
measles in France;
- 48 cases of pneumonia, 3 cases of encephalitis, 2 cases of seizures,
and reports of 2 pregnant women who had spontaneous abortions and 2
more who had premature deliveries because they got measles while
pregnant (Italy 2010);
- 582 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases of encephalitis in Romania.

Although pneumonia may not sound that serious to the average parent,
reviewing what recently happened to a one year old with measles might
change their minds. While his siblings are vaccinated, his mother
wasn't aware that he needed an MMR vaccine too, even though he was
traveling to Kenya [from the United States] when he was just 9 months
old. She thought he could wait until he got his routine shots after
his 1st birthday, unaware of the latest guidelines to get infants
vaccinated as early as 6 months if they are traveling out of the
country. Unfortunately, the toddler was hospitalized with measles
shortly after returning to Minnesota, days after his 1st birthday. His
case was complicated by pneumonia, which is likely why he quickly
ended up in the hospital's intensive care unit. He remained on a
ventilator in the intensive care unit for over 2 weeks, where doctors
were not sure that he would survive. While still hospitalized and on
oxygen, he is recovering well now. He will hopefully get out of the
hospital next week, about a month after he was 1st admitted.

Some people continue to claim that measles is a mild infection. Others
knows just how dangerous those claims can be.

The medical humanitarian organization Medecins san Frontieres (MSF)
has called the executive and their Congolese counterparts to initiate
immediate measles vaccination campaigns in Ecuador [Equateur] and
eastern [Orientale] provinces to stop the spread of the disease in the
country.

Since late 2010, the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo DR) has
experienced an epidemic of measles that has affected more than 106 000
people and caused about 1100 deaths, mostly children. The disease is
said to be spreading to the provinces of Katanga, Kasai Oriental,
Occidentale, Maniema and South Kivu, because the vaccination campaign
planned for 2010 has not been carried out.

When the authorities declared a measles epidemic in April 2011,
emergency vaccination of children under 5 years was carried out, as
well as an additional campaign in July 2011. So far, more than 11
million children, 3 million of whom are under 15 years, have been
vaccinated with the support of MSF. However, these efforts have failed
to control the epidemic, which is now affecting Ecuador [Equateur] and
several eastern provinces, where vaccination coverage is very poor.

"Vaccination campaigns are planned for September 2011 in the provinces
of Ecuador [Equateur] and eastern [Orientale], but the decision to
implement them has still to be confirmed," warns Dr North Hurtado,
immunization coordinator for MSF. "Measles is a highly contagious
disease and its complications can be fatal. You can still save many
lives by vaccinating all children under age 5 who have not already
been vaccinated."

The 2 main partners of the Congolese Ministry of Health, the World
Health Organization and UNICEF, have been mobilized, and vaccines have
arrived in Kinshasa, the capital. The decision to initiate the
campaign now depends solely on the government and especially on their
economic cooperation.

"If the campaign begins in September [2011], it could be interrupted
when the rainy season begins. And with the start of the school year,
we face a greater risk of infection among children," said Dr Laurence
Sailly, medical coordinator for MSF in Congo DR.

MSF believes that the epidemic may spread to the eastern provinces
[from] Ecuador [Equateur] and is asking the government to ensure the
start of vaccination in September 2011 to stop the epidemic.

About 9000 cases of measles have been reported in Somalia since
January [2011]. In the capital Mogadishu, tens of thousands of
families displaced by drought and conflict are living in camps around
the city. Quarters are tight, making the conditions ripe for an
infectious disease like measles.

With tens of thousands of people crowded into displaced persons camps
in Mogadishu, Somalia, UNICEF and its partners are vaccinating
children against measles. "This is an airborne disease," explained Dr
Yasin Mohamed Nur of the World Health Organization (WHO). "It is
spread by coughing and sneezing, and imagine the risk when there are
so many people living in such a congested area."

Malnutrition makes the situation even worse. In south-central Somalia,
a region where some 40 per cent of children under the age of 5 are
acutely malnourished, the effects are disastrous. "When a person
becomes malnourished, their immunity drops, so he is prone to
everything," says WHO's Mohamed Shire. "When the child cannot get the
basic necessities," notes Mr Shire, "his body will utilize all the
nutrients that were stored in the body, and that will lead to a
reduction in immunity. If the child is already malnourished, he can
easily be infected by measles, and this can often lead to death."

The Horn of Africa is facing what has been described as the worst
drought in over half a century, and the UN has declared a famine
emergency in some regions. In Somalia, where the drought is compounded
by conflict, hundreds of thousands of people have fled to urban
centres and neighbouring countries. National malnutrition rates are
soaring. Combined with low immunization rates, they raise serious
concerns about large scale outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Even before the current crisis, Somalia had low vaccine coverage
compared to most other nations, with routine immunization rates
stagnating between 30 and 40 per cent. The combined effects of
poverty, civil unrest and poor health care have negatively impacted
Somali communities even further. Modest gains made in immunization
over the last few years are now at risk, particularly with respect to
measles elimination and polio eradication.

Due to the crisis, a large number of children from Lower Shabelle,
Middle Shabelle, Bay, the Jubas and other regions have settled in
Mogadishu. Immunization activity in these regions stopped for nearly 2
years amidst conflict, leaving many of these children unprotected.
Over the last several weeks, UNICEF, WHO, and other partners have been
conducting emergency vaccination campaigns in parts of Mogadishu. A
plan is also in place to vaccinate all children in south-central
Somalia, where the famine is at its peak, over the next few months.

Despite hopes for the mass campaign, which is targeting 750 000
children in all, many concerns remain. "Insecurity remains one of our
biggest obstacles," says Dr Nur. "It is important to get full access
to everyone. Our concern now is for the [displaced persons] who will
arrive in Mogadishu after we have completed the campaign here."

Northern Alberta residents have been alerted to a confirmed case of
measles in Edmonton, a passenger on a Vancouver to Edmonton flight on
15 Aug 2011. Anyone who was on Air Canada flight AC244 on Mon 15 Aug
2011, which departed Vancouver International Airport (YVR) at 4:30 pm
and arrived at Edmonton International Airport (EIA) at 6:53 pm, may
have been exposed to the illness. As well, anyone in the Edmonton
International Airport Air Canada baggage claim area on 15 Aug 2011
from 7 pm to 9:30 pm may have been exposed.

"It was confirmed in Edmonton, and it was a case of a person coming
back from Vancouver to Edmonton, and the person was an Edmonton
resident," said Kerry Williamson, senior media relations advisor for
Alberta Health Services North. "Our concern would be that there may be
some people who were on board that flight or in the baggage area that
may have not been immunized."

Measles is an extremely contagious respiratory disease caused by a
virus. Measles causes fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over
the body. The rash typically begins behind the ears and on the face,
spreading down to the body and finally to the arms and legs. About one
out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and up to
one out of 20 gets pneumonia requiring hospitalization. For every 1000
children who get measles, one or 2 will die. Individuals who have not
already had measles and have not been immunized against measles are at
highest risk for developing the disease.

In the past decade, measles in Alberta has often been related to
international travel or exposure in Canada to ill people who have
travelled. Countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia (including India), as
well as the province of Quebec, are currently experiencing measles
outbreaks. While the disease is highly contagious, the likelihood of
an outbreak is quite low because of immunization programs, said
Williamson. "Our immunization rates are pretty high, around 95 per
cent, but there may be people who haven't been immunized, and those
are the people we're most concerned about," he said. "The best way to
get immunized, if you haven't been already, would be to get in touch
with your local health clinic," said Williamson.

The Health Secretariat of Barranquilla confirmed that the 2 new
measles cases in the district are a 46 year old and a boy of 5 years,
both relatives of a teenager who was in Brazil and who was recently
confirmed as the 1st case of the disease in the country.

After these new cases, epidemiological surveillance of measles was
strengthened, especially among tourists and travelers coming to
Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport, and was also enhanced in the
city.

"We will boost prevention efforts with several actions. One is the
installation of a vaccination and information centre at Ernesto
Cortissoz International Airport, and we will require tourists and
travelers, who carry vaccination cards, to verify they have been
immunized," said secretary of the health district, Martha Rodriguez
Otalora.

The emergency plan of action continues with implementation of the
measles-rubella vaccine to vulnerable people in the city -- that is,
children and young people aged between 11 and 19 years, and people who
are traveling abroad. In the same way, advanced educational
institutions, children's homes, shopping centres, churches, and
businesses will be included if they request it.

Between 11 to 27 Aug 2011, intensified efforts will be made to
vaccinate the entire population of Barranquilla.

Notes from the field: measles outbreak --- Indiana, Jun-Jul 2011
--------------------------------------------------
On 20 Jun 2011, an emergency department (ED) physician reported 5
epidemiologically linked measles cases to the Indiana State Department
of Health. The subsequent investigation identified a total of 14
confirmed cases in northeast Indiana. Of these, 10 were
laboratory-confirmed, and 4 were among household contacts of persons
with laboratory-confirmed measles. Of the 14 patients, 13 were
unvaccinated persons in the same extended family. The non-family
member was a child aged 23 months who had received one dose of
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine 4 months before illness onset.
Four of the 14 patients were males; median age was 11.5 years (range:
15 months-27 years). One patient was a woman in week 32 of pregnancy
who was hospitalized for acute pneumonitis.

The index patient was an unvaccinated US resident aged 24 years who
noted a rash on 3 Jun 2011 during a return flight from Indonesia,
where measles is endemic. The patient was admitted to an Indiana
hospital during the period 7 to 9 Jun 2011 and treated for presumed
dengue fever. Measles was not considered, and the patient was not
isolated. The outbreak was unrecognized until 20 Jun 2011, when 5
family members visited an emergency department (ED) after experiencing
onset of measles symptoms at various times over the previous few days.
Subsequently, measles genotype D9, a strain endemic in Indonesia (1),
was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 of these patients.

A contact investigation involving about 780 persons included follow-up
of exposures at a church (about 150 persons), a factory (about 300
persons), and in a bus ridden by school-aged children who had traveled
out of state. Infectious persons attended parties, family gatherings,
sports events, and meetings, and sought health care. Health care
facility exposures included 2 general practice offices, one obstetric
office, 2 EDs, one urgent care facility, and 2 hospitals.

For exposed persons without evidence of immunity to measles, the
Indiana State Department of Health recommended vaccination of eligible
persons within 3 days of exposure or immunoglobulin administration
within 6 days of exposure for patients at high risk for measles
complications; in addition, vaccination was recommended for all
eligible persons regardless of their exposure history. Recommendations
were made to health care facilities where exposures might have
occurred to exclude potentially exposed health care personnel from
patient care responsibilities until measles immunity was documented,
and to exclude personnel without evidence of immunity for 21 days
after their last exposure.

As of 26 Aug 2011, 198 cases and 15 outbreaks of measles had been
confirmed in the United States, the highest number since 1996 (CDC,
unpublished data, 2011). Of the 198 cases, 179 (90 per cent) were
associated with US residents traveling internationally. Of the 15
outbreaks, the outbreak in Indiana is the 2nd largest. With ongoing
importation and suboptimal vaccination rates among specific
populations, measles outbreaks might continue to occur (2). In
addition to providing accurate information on the risks and benefits
of vaccines and making vaccination accessible, state and local health
departments should continue to investigate contacts of suspected
measles patients to institute control measures to prevent measles
transmission in the community. Parents should be reminded, as children
return to school, to check their children's vaccination status for
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and all other recommended
vaccines.

Officials have confirmed 2 cases of measles in Montgomery County.

Authorities said the individuals are 2 unvaccinated children who
arrived in the US on 24 Aug 2011. Authorities said the 2 children
visited the Washington Resettlement Center, located at 8700 Georgia
Avenue in Silver Spring, on Mon 29 Aug 2011. Anyone who visited the
office building on 29 Aug 2011 may have been exposed to measles.

"Individuals who have had measles, who have received 2 doses of the
measles vaccine (MMR), or who were born in the United States before
1957 are not considered at risk for contracting measles," stated
Montgomery County health officials. Those who may have potentially
been exposed may also call the Montgomery County Health and Human
Services' Disease Control Office at 240-777-1755 to determine their
risk of contracting measles.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service can confirm 117 cases of
measles in the Auckland region as of this morning [30 Aug 2011]. Two
contacts are in quarantine. Nine cases have required hospitalisation
during this outbreak. Most cases have occurred in West Auckland with
some spread to Central Auckland, North Shore, and Manuka.

The measles outbreak is now into its 3rd month. Medical Officer of
Health Dr Richard Hoskins is urging the following people to please
contact their doctor to check their immunity status: Those who were
present in the waiting room of the Middlemore Hospital Coronary Care
Unit on Tue 23 Aug 2011 between 4:00 and 7:00 pm, and who were born
after January 1969, and who have not been fully immunised (received 2
measles vaccines). "There was a child with measles in the waiting room
during this time, so it's important that those people who fit the
criteria outlined above contact their doctor. They could possibly
develop the disease over the next week," says Dr Hoskins.

[The number of confirmed cases of measles has increased from 111 on 22
Aug 2011 to the present 117.

The number of reports of measles outbreaks may be beginning to
decline, hopefully as a consequence of the increasing awareness of the
need to achieve high levels of vaccine uptake. Reports of the
situation in Asian countries continue to be sparse. - Mod.CP]
