Lead village closed to journalists
----------------------------------
Madaokou village, next to a large metal-smelting plant in Shaanxi province,
is one of several sites in China where hundreds of children have been
diagnosed with lead poisoning.

Madaokou village has been quarantined, not from the lead poisoning that has
sickened around 800 children in the area, but from journalists. On street
corners and opposite the closed primary school lurk police vehicles and
cars with blacked-out windows. Locals have been forbidden from speaking to
the media, and some complain that their phone calls are being bugged.

But with so many of their children sick -- around 160 are in hospital from
this and 2 nearby villages -- the residents are determined to tell their
story.

The sun sets without notice in the polluted sky, and a couple of villagers
offer to take me and my colleagues into the village, to meet with parents.
We enter a tollgate and drive down the long road to the village, passing
along the way half-a-dozen police cars with lights flashing. But we do not
make it very far. A dozen police officers stop and surround our car and by
the side of the dark roadside, an official tells us we can not go any
further. "You might not understand, but we the local authorities have
declared an emergency situation here," said Wang Qun, a smartly dressed
official from the Baoji local government. "We have received an order that
once foreign journalists entered this area, we have to check their
credentials to see whether they are fake or not."

"Our rules, not Beijing's"
--------------------------
Explaining that we had permission from the Foreign Ministry to report from
the area proved pointless. "The central government has its rules, and we
have ours," said Ms Wang. We have little choice but to leave. A
plainclothes policeman accompanies our van driver and we are taken to a
government-owned hotel. Eventually we are released -- our credentials are
genuine -- but we still are not allowed to return to the village or speak
to the residents.

"We don't think this story is big enough for foreign journalists," Ms Wang
added.

Unfulfilled promises
--------------------
The air around the Dongling Lead and Zinc smelter has 6 times the lead
content of other parts of the area. Central government inspectors have said
it is responsible for the majority of the lead poisoning. [One wonders if
this level is actually measured? Are there any standards that this level is
measured against? - Mod.TG]

Viewed from satellite photographs, the plant dominates the landscape, far
larger than the village that sits beside it. Worryingly, a reservoir runs
alongside. As one of the largest private companies -- and taxpayers -- in
the area, the Dongling company dominates politically too.

Residents have been complaining for years about the plant and its
pollution, but nothing has been done. Local officials' promises to relocate
families have been largely unfulfilled.

Unable to speak to the villagers directly, we reach one by telephone. "When
the plant was built, the authorities said we would be relocated. But most
of us haven't been moved. I feel very bad about it," he said. "Our health
should be more important than money. The government didn't care about our
health, now we're suffering. No wonder we're angry," he added.

The villagers had earlier vandalized the company's property, pulling down a
300 metre long fence. It was the only way to capture the attention of the
local government, they said. Officials have now arrived in droves. But
local parents complain that rather than help them and their sick children,
they appear only to want to shut them up.

[Lead is a heavy metal that can be toxic to living bodies, humans and
animals, in certain high levels. Lead can be found in paints on houses, on
pottery, and other objects. Lead can be found in water, in air around
smelters, and in such objects as batteries.

When lead enters the body, generally through ingestion but also through
inhalation from dust and lead smelters, it may be seen as a lead line on
the metaphysis of growing bones in radiographs.

Lead can be especially detrimental to children as many tissues are growing
and developing and lead is easy incorporated into those cells. It may slow
growth, cause hearing problems, hyperactivity and behavior changes.
Children with high lead burdens may have neurological damage, including
brain damage. This may present as headaches or learning difficulties,
muscle cramps, twitches or spasms. It may be more severe, leading to
seizures and death.

Adults may also suffer from lead poisoning. Adults may experience a variety
of neurological problems, among them, memory and concentration problems.
They may also have muscle and joint pain, reproductive problems, and
hypertension (high blood pressure). Adults may also suffer from
neurological problems as well.

Heavy metal intoxication almost always affects the gastrointestinal system,
such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite and as a consequence,
weight loss. Anemia may also be seen in lead poisoning, which further
increases the weakness the victim experiences.

Lead has no known physiological function in the body. It can be tested for
in the blood, but chelators are necessary to help eliminate the metal from
the body. Effective chelators include dimercapterol and succiimer. - Mod.TG
