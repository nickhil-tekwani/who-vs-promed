RICKETTSIA HELVETICA MYOCARDITIS - SWEDEN

It was reported today in local papers that Dr Kenneth Nilsson and
others at the Institution for Medical Sciences of Uppsala University
have discovered that 2 young Swedish males have died from
chronic myocarditis caused by the tick-born _Rickettsia helvetica_.
The scientists think these 2 cases may be the tip of an iceberg as
approximately 20% of the ticks carries this [microorganism]. The
men had collapsed in heart failure during physical exercise and
died shortly afterwoods. In the autopsy the myocardium showed
infection only with _R. helvetica_ and none of the other agents
known to cause myocarditis.
There will be a report published on these cases in The Lancet
tomorrow, Sat 2 Oct 1999.
