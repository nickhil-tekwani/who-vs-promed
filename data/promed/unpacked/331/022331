West Nile virus surveillance: More questions than answers
---------------------------------------------------------
As I continue to follow the fascinating West Nile virus story, I find more
questions than answers.
1. It is clear to me that the official reports we are receiving are meant
to calm the masses as much as to provide information. It was reported (from
Connecticut) that "The risk to humans is still low. Despite intensive
mosquito trapping and testing, we have had only one pool of mosquitoes test
positive for West Nile Virus, and that involved mosquitoes collected in
Stamford on July 11". Ignoring the fact that either one or all of the
mosquitoes in that pool could have had virus, the absence of a definition
of "intensive trapping", and no information as to how many pools have been
tested, the basis for assessing low human risk is unclear to me. That 8
crows were shown to have been infected with West Nile virus (WNV) indicates
that there are in the area at least some mosquitoes infected with WNV.
There are many mosquitoes in Connecticut, perhaps billions (maybe
trillions; has anyone ever tried to estimate the number of mosquitoes in
Connecticut or anywhere else?; all that is ever done is "sample"). There is
not and cannot be information on all the crows and other birds that have
not been tested because they have not been found dead. Given that knowledge
of the arthropod vector(s) of WNV in the New World is so poor, how can
human risk be assessed with reasonable accuracy?
2. As might be expected, I disagree with the current acceptance of IgM
antibody in a single cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum as being consistent
with "confirmation". The Staten Island patient can serve as a case in
point. The patient was ill, hadn't travelled, was fed upon by mosquitoes
(who hasn't been?) before the spraying operations began (that statement
undoubtedly being meant to reassure NY City residents that the patient's
infection was not evidence of a failure of insecticide spraying), etc. We
do not have any idea how long IgM antibody persists in CSF or serum of
patients infected with WNV. I do not know about this particular patient (he
probably -- probably -- had a recent WNV infection) but we will soon see
people who have had strokes, Lyme disease, and other central nervous system
problems, and unrecognized previous infections with WNV, diagnosed as
current WNV infections based on single CSF or serum samples. The illness of
this patient should more properly have been classified as "presumptive".
The CDC web site quoted someone as having said that "The patient resides in
an area where WNV-infected mosquitoes and birds have been found during
2000; no WNV activity was detected in this part of the city in 1999. The
patient had not traveled for more than 50 years to areas where other
flaviviruses had been endemic and had not left New York during the
incubation period." If a single CSF and/or serum sample is adequate to make
a confirmed serodiagnosis, then why is there a need to provide supportive
epidemiologic evidence? Either the laboratory evidence is adequate to make
a confirmed diagnosis or it is not. In this case, it is not. Antibody in
single samples such as these can be used only to make "presumptive"
diagnoses. Acceptance of such data is more wishful thinking than it is good
science. I emphasize, again, that this has nothing whatsoever to do with
the clinical diagnosis and add that it is impossible to make a clinical
diagnosis of WNV infection. [Two more Staten Island residents have now
"tested " positive, and the first case has been confirmed WNV-positive by
CDC. The nature of the tests employed has not been disclosed. -Mod.CP
3. Spokespeople in New Jersey have said from the beginning that the no
doubt excellent mosquito control programs in that state will prevent an
epidemic of WNV infections. I, for one, have no reason to believe this.
WNV-infected birds (I cannot tell whether these were determined by
detecting virus by PCR or virus isolation, or by detection of antibody)
have been reported 54 times, from Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex,
Monmouth, Passaic, and Union counties. Unless infected birds are flapping
their way from a NY City epicenter to New Jersey, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and even to near the Canadian border, then there are
WNV-infected mosquitoes in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and
upstate New York. The WNV-infected New Jersey cockatiel likely did not
migrate there from New York City. Finding WNV-infected birds and holding to
a thesis that WNV-infected mosquitoes do not occur or are rare in the area
is rather like the ostrich approach. I prefer the Marshall McLuhan
approach: "I wouldn't have seen it if I had not believed it."
4. The wide taxonomic range of birds already found to be infected with WNV
and last year's experience at the Bronx Zoo, in which exotic and indigenous
species died, indicates that this virus is a killer of New World and other
species. That this has not been noted in the literature for epidemics and
outbreaks in France, South Africa, Russia, Romania, Italy, or any of the
other places WNV has been detected should not come as a surprise to anyone.
5. That wild birds are dying and sentinel chickens have not provided any
evidence for the presence of WNV suggest to me that sentinel chickens are
an inadequate surveillance tool and that we have insufficient information
regarding the competence of indigenous arthropods to transmit WNV. [A
single chicken has now tested positive for WNV in Westchester County, NYS.
-Mod.CP
6. We are seeing a great many more numerators than we are seeing
denominators. I once heard of a man who drowned in a river that had a mean
depth of 6 inches.
To summarize: WNV entered the U.S. a year ago, it has successfully
overwintered, it replicates in a wide variety of mosquitoes and birds, it
is pathogenic for humans and equids, and it has spread from New York City
to at least Baltimore on the south as far as the Canadian border and
Massachusetts to the north. It is possible that the slight delay in
definitively identifying WNV in New York closed the narrow window of
opportunity to eradicate this virus before it became established. That no
longer being an option, minimizing statements regarding "low risk", "just
another arbovirus disease", "importance blown out of proportion", and so on
are coming from people who do not grasp or will not face the potential
severity of this situation. Anti-government sentiments and anti-government
rhetoric, such as have appeared on the Op-Ed pages of the New York Times
recently regarding control of WNV and its arthropod vectors, are not helpful.
