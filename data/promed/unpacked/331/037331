I have also heard the same report from the head of the department and from other colleagues in my healthcare facility. From their reports, meningitis was the suspected illness due to the symptoms that were observed and the season in which it occurred (hot season). It is a known fact that during the hot season in the north, especially the extreme northeast and northwest, the temperature can be as high as 45 C [113 F], and meningitis is usually the common illness.

[Many thanks to the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project members for their responses.

From the above responses, there are likely multiple local outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis, some of which have been confirmed to be due to serogroup C.
