Immediate notification (07 Sep 2010)
Follow-up report No. 1 (10 Sep 2010)

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Ashington, Northumberland, England
Date of start of the outbreak 01 Sep 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species: Equidae
Susceptible 17
Cases 1
Deaths O
Destroyed 1
Slaughtered O
Affected Population There were 17 non-thoroughbred horses on the
premises, including 6 imported from the Netherlands. One of the
imported horses tested positive for EIA and was humanely destroyed in
the afternoon of 7 Sep 2010. The remaining 16 horses are housed in
stable boxes and one in a loose yard. None are at grass.

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Introduction of new live animals
Legal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: The horses were introduced to the United
Kingdom as legal imports on 15 Aug 2010. They were subjected to a
documentary, identity and physical checks as part of routine
post-import testing. These checks disclosed documentary
irregularities and as a result of this the horses were sampled for
EIA on 1 Sep 2010. One horse was confirmed as positive for EIA by
AGID (Coggin's) test and the premises and all horses on it have been
placed under restriction. The remaining 5 imported horses were
confirmed negative by AGID. All horses on the premises are being
sampled and tested today (7 Sept 2010). The veterinary epidemiology
inquiry is on-going.

Control measures - Measures applied: Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of affected
animals

[The full epidemiologic report for the outbreak in Devon will be of
great interest because of the previous outbreak of EIA reported
earlier this month in Northumberland. It and subsequent follow-up
reports will be of continuing interest as it is unclear whether there
is any connection to Romanian origin horses, either directly or via
the Netherlands.

The same question applies to the French outbreak, as there are
documented cases of EIA being exported to Germany and the UK from
Romania this year. Given the harsh report of the European Commission,
Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) -- see Equine infectious anemia -
Romania: control deficiencies 20100914.3313 -- after their mission to
Romania, one would have to presume that Romanian horses are somehow
involved. Good shoe leather epidemiology in terms of traceback of
exposed horses and movement of horses through different European
countries is of the utmost importance at this time because equine
infectious anemia is a very unforgiving disease, best dealt with by
humane euthanasia of infected animals because of their potential to
spread the disease to other nearby horses. - Mod.PC]
