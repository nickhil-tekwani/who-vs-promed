[The locality is not given, but as of Wed 24 Nov 2004, WHO had received
reports of an outbreak of yellow fever in the district of Sindou, Cascades
region, in the southwest of Burkina Faso, near the border of Cote d'Ivoire
and Mali -- see ref. below. YF has not been reported from Mali on ProMED in
the 10 years of the list's existence, and we make a point of reporting all
outbreaks as a service to neighboring countries and travelers. - Mod.JW]
