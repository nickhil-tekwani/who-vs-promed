The recent discovery of a rare tick in Hunterdon County has alarmed New Jersey Wildlife officials, who are calling for anyone who spots the blood-sucking arachnid to contact them immediately.

New Jersey secretary of agriculture Douglas H Fisher on [Wed 22 Nov 2017] confirmed the discovery of an East Asian tick, also known as a longhorned tick or bush tick [probably _Haemaphysalis longicornis_. - Corr.SB], on a farm in Hunterdon County on [9 Nov 2017].

"This tick is a known pest in deer and has a wide host range, thus can infect a range of wildlife species," said department officials, who described the pest as "exotic". The East Asian tick is considered a serious pest to livestock including cattle, horses, farmed deer, sheep and goats. It is known to transmit a disease called theileriosis to cattle, which results in severe anemia and possibly death. It can attack humans, pets and wildlife. There are no human health or food-safety risks associated with the theileria parasite, but the East Asian tick has the potential to spread other bacterial and viral diseases to humans and other animals.

The species is dark brown and grows to the size of a pea when fully engorged with blood. Both larval and nymphal stages are very small and difficult to observe with the naked eye.

The potential impact of this tick on tickborne illness in New Jersey residents is not yet known. In other parts of the world, the bush tick has been associated with several tickborne diseases, some of which are found in New Jersey, including spotted fever rickettsioses. The Department of Agriculture is investigating if the ticks found in Hunterdon County carry any potential pathogens that may impact human or animal health. New Jersey farmers are asked to monitor their livestock for the presence of this tick and decreased growth rates or signs of anemia in the animals.

The animals and the unidentified Hunterdon County property where the tick was found have been treated to eliminate the tick, officials said. To determine if it has spread to nearby wildlife, ongoing surveillance is being conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish and Wildlife, in cooperation with Wildlife Services from the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia.

The US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the finding after initial identification was made by the Monmouth County Tickborne Diseases Lab at Rutgers University and the Hunterdon County Division of Health.

This tick has not previously been known to be present in the US, although there are records of at least a dozen previous collections of this species in the country on animals and materials presented for entry at US ports.

State and federal animal health and wildlife officials are working to address preliminary findings of their investigation. Response efforts will include surveillance of the property and wildlife within the region. If necessary, tick treatments will be conducted to reduce the risks of spread. The primary goal is to eradicate the tick before it spreads to new areas.

If the tick is detected in wildlife, it should be immediately reported to the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Wildlife Management at 609-984-6295 or the Office of Fish and Wildlife Health and Forensics at 908-637-4173 ext. 120. Questions about livestock can be directed to your local veterinarian or the state veterinarian at (609) 671-6400 during regular business hours.

Prevention
----------
Adult ticks are seen mainly during early summer, larvae from late summer to early winter, and nymphs mainly in the spring. Some tick species may become less active in the winter, but officials urge residents to take steps to prevent tick bites whenever they are in areas where ticks may be found.

Protect yourself, your family and your pets from tick bites by:
- knowing where ticks are: ticks can live in or near wooded or grassy areas or on animals directly;
- using repellent on skin: use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. Always follow product instructions;
- treating clothing, boots and camping gear with permethrin;
- covering up by wearing long sleeves and pants when spending time outdoors and consider tucking pants into socks to prevent ticks from getting under clothes;
- showering as soon as possible after coming indoors to remove unattached ticks;
- inspecting your body for ticks and removing ticks immediately;
- treating your pets with veterinarian-approved products to kill or repel ticks. Products are available for domestic animals like dogs and cats, as well as for animals like sheep, goats and cattle.

[The presence of the bush tick in New Jersey is of human and animal health concern. It is a known vector of human and animal pathogens in Asia and Australia. The bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) has been identified as a most probable vector of Japanese spotted fever [JSF] in Japan. From 1984 to 1995, 144 cases of JSF were reported by the National Institutes of Health in Japan. This tick also transmits severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) that is endemic in East Asia, including Korea and China. New South Wales, Australia, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible for transmission of theileria, protozoan parasites of cattle.
