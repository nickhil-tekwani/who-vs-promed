The following is my translation from the news site of the state-wide
German television channel, ZDF, as of 12 Jan 2000, approx. 9 p.m.

News text:
Case of Lassa fever in Wurzburg (northern part of Bavaria, Germany)
Female student ill after holiday -- No risk for population
A 23-year old female student being treated in a (Wuerzburg)
hospital has contracted Lassa fever, a dangerous tropical disease, after
a holiday in Africa. The Bavarian Ministry of Health says she is in a
serious state.
The woman was admitted with flu-like symptoms to a hospital in
Schwdbisch Hall (another town in southern Germany), says the director of
the local health department, Konrad Klaess. After seven days as
an in-patient there her doctors were convinced she was suffering from a
tropical disease. During Monday night she was therefore transferred to
the Tropical Medicine Department of the Wuerzburg hospital. Laboratory
investigations had confirmed the suspicion of Lassa fever.
We took the clinical suspicion very serious from the start, said
Klaess. Measures for isolation were taken immediately. In Wuerzburg the
woman is being treated in a separate intensive care unit. The hospital
and the health department in Schwdbisch Hall were informed...
The health departments in Baden-Wuerttemberg (the
county that Schwdbisch Hall is situated in) are currently investigating
with whom the 23-year old has been in contact since her return from West
Africa. According to first results she has not met relatives or friends.
Call to passengers on the flight
The infected woman arrived on 7 Jan 2000 on Air Portugal flight number
TP 5576 in Frankfurt am Main, says the Ministry for Social Affairs of
Baden-Wuerttemberg. All passengers are urgently requested to contact
their local health departments. If symptoms such as fever above 38.5
degrees C, headache, sore throat, coughing and intestinal discomfort
occur they should present to a hospital. The hotline of the state health
administration is 0711 / 1849328 or 0170 / 2230815.
According to experts the student does not pose a risk to the population.
"People who met her by chance are at virtually zero risk", says the
spokesperson for the Robert Koch-Institut, Edgar Muschketat. "We will
not get a Lassa epidemic in Germany, for the virus is very difficult to
transmit." The Bavarian health minister Barbara Stamm (CSU, ruling
party) declares that any threat to the population of Bavaria and
particularly Wuerzburg can be ruled out. In Wuerzburg the patient had only
been in contact with medical personnel.
Lassa fever, which occurs predominantly in Nigeria (sic!),
according to information from the health department leads to severe internal
bleeding. Even with inpatient treatment 20 percent of cases will be
fatal.

My comments (W. Preiser):
- Situation seems to be under control, one single case;
- the Wuerzburg Tropical Medicine Dept. is a good and knowledgeable one
and deserves confidence in dealing with such cases correctly.
- They do not say how the diagnosis was confirmed but have had five
days, and thus time to send specimens e. g. to the Bernhard
Nocht-Institut in Hamburg (Prof. Schmitz)
- Remember the panic last summer with the cameraman in Berlin who was
suspected of suffering from Ebola but had (and died from) yellow fever,
apparently unvaccinated.

Translation from the website of the Missionsarztliche Klinik in
Wuerzburg (Wuerzburg Mission Hospital) 12 Jan 2000 12 p.m.
http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/missio/klinik/lassa.html

Patient with Lassa fever on the isolation unit of the Wuerzburg
Mission Hospital
Situation on 12 Jan 2000 at 4.00 p.m. (local time, GMT +1)
The (female) patient is in the meantime isolated in the second
intensive care unit of the Mission Hospital which is exclusively for
her use. In this part in the far end of the building she is under
optimal care with all intensive medical measures and facilities and a
volunteer medical and nursing team. The patients state is relatively
good, according to the circumstances. The high fever continues, there
is respiratory compromise and disturbed haemostasis.
For patients at the Mission Hospital in all its departments there is
no risk, for the patient is isolated in a separate part of the
building and there is no connection between her room and all other
facilities through ventilation ducts or other ducts.
The authorities in Bavaria and in Baden Wuerttemberg have been
informed and are collaborating closely with the medical teams in the
surveillance of contact persons.
The specific antiviral agent Ribavirin is available in sufficient
quantities.

Doctors were fighting Wednesday to save the life of a 23-year-old German
woman sick with Lassa fever after a trip to West Africa.
The student, who returned to Germany on 1 Jan 2000, fell ill two days
later and is now in serious condition, the Bavarian health ministry
said.
Lassa fever, named after a Nigerian village, was first identified in
1969. It is virus-borne and causes fatal haemorrhaging in 40 percent of
cases.
The art student, who was not identified, spent from November until
the end of December 1999 in Ghana and Ivory Coast on a student exchange
programme. The ministry said she was treated for a week in her local
hospital
for a high fever, before being transferred to a clinic in Wuerzburg
with suspected malaria when her condition worsened. The Hamburg Institute of
Tropical Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of Lassa fever on Wednesday.
