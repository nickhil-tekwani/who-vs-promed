In central Massachusetts, 3 communities have suspended evening sports activities and will close playgrounds from dusk until dawn after an Athol girl was diagnosed with Eastern equine encephalitis [virus infection; EEE]. The girl, who is said to be improving, is the 3rd Massachusetts resident to be diagnosed with EEE this year.

On Tuesday [11 Sep 2012], town officials in Athol, Royalston and Orange said sports activities after dusk have been suspended and all playgrounds would be closed from dusk to dawn. The Athol case has the state taking new action to protect against disease-carrying mosquitoes.

"It looks very likely that this individual acquired it close to home," said Kevin Cranston, of the Department of Public Health.

According to the Worcester Telegram, she contracted it in Athol. The EEE threat level has been raised to "Critical" in Athol, Orange, and Royalston, and to "High" in Erving, Petersham, Phillipston, Templeton, Warwick, Wendell and Winchendon.

"It's very distressing. This young woman is still hospitalized," Cranston said.

While the summer is almost over, many areas are still at risk until the first hard frost.

"The occurrence of EEE in this young person really underscores the need for people to protect themselves and their families," Cranston said.

There have now been 3 confirmed human cases of EEE in Massachusetts residents this year, including one case that resulted in the death of a Worcester man in his 70s.

[An unfortunate consequence of EEE virus infections with clinical encephalitis is that a significant proportion of survivors suffer permanent neurological damage. Equine animals can be protected from EEE virus infection through vaccination, but there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. - Mod.TY
