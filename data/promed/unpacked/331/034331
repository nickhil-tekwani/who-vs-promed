The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
(DOH) is investigating today (15 May 2007) a case of laboratory
confirmed infection of _Streptococcus suis_, a kind of bacteria
isolated from pigs.
The case involved a 79-year-old woman living in Chai Wan, who
developed fever on 7 May 2007. She was admitted to Pamela Youde
Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 11 May 2007, and is now in critical
condition. A CHP spokesman said she had no recent travel history and
her home contact did not have any symptoms.
This is the 1st reported case of _Streptococcus suis_ infection in
2007. A total of 8 cases were reported in 2006 and 13 cases in 2005.
The spokesman said _Streptococcus suis_ infection may present as
meningitis (inflammation of the membrane enclosing the brain),
septicaemia (blood stream infection), and less commonly endocarditis
(inflammation of the inner lining of the heart chambers), arthritis,
and bronchopneumonia (a kind of lung infection involving the bronchioles).
_Streptococcus suis_ infection can be treated with appropriate
antibiotics. To prevent the disease, people are advised to always
observe personal and environmental hygiene practices and avoid
contact with pigs that are sick or dead from diseases, and their
excreta or body fluid. If contact with pigs or raw pork is necessary,
one should:
-use protective gloves;
-wash hands after handling pigs or raw pork; and
-clean and cover all wounds properly.
People with suspected symptoms should consult their doctors as soon
as possible and report their relevant exposure histories.
Additional information on _Streptococcus suis_ is available from the
CHP website at

The latest information on infectious diseases in other places is
available on DOH's Hong Kong Travellers' Health Service website at

[_Streptococcus suis_ is a zoonotic pathogen in swine, which causes
sporadic cases of invasive infection, usually meningitis, sepsis, or
endocarditis, in humans following exposure to swine or to pork. As
stated in the DOH bulletin above, cases such as these occur annually
and there is nothing atypical evident from this brief case description.
In 2005, there was a major outbreak of an unusual _S. suis_
infection in China's Sichuan Province. It included a large number of
toxic-shock syndrome cases resembling those seen with _Streptococcus
pyogenes_ or group A _Streptococcus_. Altogether, there were 204
cases and 38 deaths. Investigators doing a retrospective study of the
2005 outbreak recognized a similar outbreak in Jiangsu Province
(China) in 1998. - Mod.LM
