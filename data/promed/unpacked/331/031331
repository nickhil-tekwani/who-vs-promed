Haiti
-----
In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) to epidemiological week (EW) 32 of 2013, the total number of cholera cases has reached 669 645, of which 371 099 were hospitalized and 8224 died. The global case fatality rate has been 1.2 per cent since November 2011, however, with variations, for example, in Sud Est (4.5 per cent) and Port-au-Prince (0.6 per cent).

Since October 2012, a downward trend in the nationwide number of cases and deaths has been observed. However, from EW 1 of 2013 to EW 11, the number of cases and deaths registered at a national level was greater than the respective numbers registered for the same time period of 2012. This increase is associated with outbreaks in the departments of Artibonite, Centre and Nord. With regards to deaths, the highest increase was registered during the 1st 5 EW of 2013. From EW 12 to EW 32 of 2013, the number of cases and deaths registered has been lower than what was registered for the same period in 2012.

Dominican Republic
------------------
In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through epidemiological week (EW) 30 of 2013, the total number of suspected cholera cases reported was 30 671 of which 454 died. During the 1st year, the epidemic saw an increase of cases during the rainy season. By the end of the 1st year of the epidemic, the case fatality rate was 1.7 per cent, and the attack rate was 0.2 per cent. During 2012, the trend showed a continual decline with peaks related to outbreaks in certain municipalities. By the end of 2012, the case fatality rate was 0.8 per cent, and the cumulative attack rate was 0.3 per cent.

In the 1st 9 EW of 2013, the number of suspected cholera cases and deaths recorded nationwide was higher than the number for the same period of 2012; this increase is related to cholera outbreaks registered in certain provinces and at the prison of La Altagracia. Between EW 10 and EW 30 of 2013, the number of suspected cases decreased, with a decline of 73 per cent. The case fatality rate was 2.6 per cent during EW 1 to EW 30 of 2013.

Cuba
----
In Cuba, authorities maintain active and strict clinical-epidemiological surveillance of acute diarrheal diseases, studying every suspected case.

In early 2013, the National IHR Focal Point of Cuba reported that by 14 Jan 2013, there were 51 confirmed cases of cholera in an outbreak in Havana related to food handling. Previously, a total of 47 cholera cases had been reported following Hurricane Sandy in the provinces of Camaguey, Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba. All cases were characterized as _Vibrio cholerae_ toxigenic serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor.

Between late July and early August 2013, 5 cases of cholera associated with a history of travel to Cuba were confirmed, as follows:

Italy ex Cuba
-------------
On 24 Jul 2013, the National IHR Focal Point for Italy reported to WHO a confirmed case of cholera (_V. cholerae_ serogroup O1 Ogawa) in a 47 year old male patient with travel history to Havana from 23 Jun to 13 Jul 2013. Relevant details of the case, including detailed travel history while in Cuba and further laboratory investigations were shared with competent local authorities in Cuba and WHO.

Venezuela ex Cuba
-----------------
On 9 Aug 2013, the National IHR Focal Point for Venezuela confirmed 2 cases of cholera (_V. cholerae_ serogroup O1 Ogawa) in a 51 year old male and a 55 year old female with history of travel to Havana, Cuba.

Chile ex Cuba
-------------
On the same date, 9 Aug 2013, the National IHR Focal Point for Chile reported 2 cases of cholera, one laboratory confirmed (_V. cholerae_ serogroup O1 Ogawa) and the other by epidemiological link, in persons returning from travel to Cuba.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The government of Cuba has not been particularly transparent about the ongoing cholera in the island. The recent 5 cases of cholera in Chile, Venezuela, and Italy speak for themselves as evidence for the continued transmission of cholera in Cuba. Cholera in the Dominican Republic seemed to be related to common rivers with its neighbor Haiti. A better sanitary infrastructure in the Dominican Republic kept the outbreak from paralleling the situation in Haiti. Introduction into countries with more effective sanitary systems, such as Italy, Venezuela, and Chile, suggest that outbreaks are not likely to occur. - Mod.LL
