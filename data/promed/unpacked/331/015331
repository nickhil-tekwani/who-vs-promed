We have a rattlesnake in Michigan called the eastern massasauga. It's listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. One of the threats it's facing is a disease called snake fungal disease, and it can kill the snakes.

Dr. Matt Allender is a veterinarian, and an assistant professor at the University of Illinois. He also directs the Wildlife Epidemiology Lab.

"Snake fungal disease is a fungal pathogen, an emerging disease similar to white-nose syndrome in bats or chytrid infection in frogs throughout the world," he says. "About 10 years ago, eastern massasaugas were one of the 1st species that was identified with skin lesions that would affect their face, primarily."

He says snake fungal disease causes eye and skin infections, and sometimes the lesions are subtle.

"Some of the clues as to what's causing the death or decline in these animals with subtle lesions is still quite a mystery," says Allender. "And so we've been spending a lot of time trying to figure out how is this a threat and why this fungal pathogen is now causing issues in not just endangered rattlesnakes like the eastern massasauga but in many other species of snakes across North America."

In a new study, Allender and his colleagues looked at the microbial community living on the snakes' skin, called the microbiome.

They found the pathogen altered the snakes' microbiome.

"This is important, because for an emerging disease, we want to know, number one: what is the mechanism that leads to infection, and then how can we change management or monitor management so that we can improve conservation efforts," he says.

He says with the knowledge that the fungal pathogen _Ophidiomyces_ disrupts the snakes' microbiome, they can now start to design studies that look at ways to minimize the impact of this pathogen on the eastern massasauga.

Allender says scientists are learning more about how important the microbiome is for human and animal health.

"I think that the role of the microbiome, while quite a bit is known, is still in its infancy. There are lots of indications in people and in frogs and in bumblebees that the composition and the richness of microbes -- both fungal and bacterial on the skin, in the gut, in the lungs of these animals -- prevents or helps to reduce the impact of severe diseases," he says.

"We're starting to see patterns that might be emerging that help us to explain these fungal infections and the changes in the microbiome," says Allender.

[Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern USA, recently also found in Canada. An experimental study reproduced the skin lesions observed in the field and confirmed that the etiologic agent is the fungus _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_. This fungus had been consistently associated with the often-fatal skin, face, and eye lesions characteristic of the disease. In recent years, cases of this fungal infection have been increasing.

A picture of the lesions observed in snakes with SFD can be seen at http://mongabay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13/0906snake2.jpg.

The article referred to can be accessed at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30709-x. The abstract reads:

"SFD, caused by _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_, is the most recently described fungal disease afflicting wildlife populations across North America and Europe. It has been proposed as a significant conservation threat yielding high mortality and yet much its ecology is unknown. We collected 144 skin swabs from Eastern Massasaugas (_Sistrurus catenatus_) in 2015 and 2016 to determine document ongoing prevalence and assess differences in microbial assemblages between positive and negative individuals. Alpha diversity of fungi was reduced in SFD positive animals, while beta diversity identified distinct assemblages of microbes between SFD-positive and -negative samples. _Ophidiomyces_ was present on the skin of affected animals, even on body sites distant to lesions indicating that the microbiome on entire surface of the skin is altered. _Ophidiomyces_ was not detected in any non-SFD snake. There were smaller, but significant, influences of year sampled. Bacterial genera _Janthinobacterium_ and _Serratia_ were significantly increased in SFD snakes, while _Xylanimicrobium_, _Cellulosimicrobium_, and _Rhodococcus_ were the only bacterial taxa significantly reduced. The relative abundance of fungi within the orders Pleosporales and Canopdiales was reduced in SFD-positive samples, though _Pyrenochaetopsis pratorum_ was the only species found to differ significantly. This is the 1st study to determine the impact that this fungal pathogen has on the skin microbiome." - Mod.PMB
