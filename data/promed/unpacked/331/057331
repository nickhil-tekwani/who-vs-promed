30 Mar 2017: Survivors remember Ebola epidemic as Samaritan's Purse releases documentary
http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865676776/Survivors-remember-Ebola-epidemic-as-Samaritan7s-Purse-releases-documentary.html
[Rev. Franklin Graham recounts the story in "Facing Darkness," a documentary produced by Samaritan's Purse recounting its fight to save the 1st American doctor diagnosed with Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] during the epidemic in West Africa. The film debuts in select theaters on Thursday [30 Mar 2017] and will return for encore showings on 10 Apr 2017.]
[This doctor, KB, was director of the Ebola treatment unit at ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) Hospital when he was infected with the virus. - Mod.LK]

[Letter to the editor:
After the clinical evaluation of convalescent plasma for Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in Guinea, van Griensven and colleagues [van Griensven J, Edwards T, de Lamballerie X, et al. Evaluation of convalescent plasma for Ebola virus disease in Guinea. N Engl J Med 2016;374:33-42] now provide additional data showing that the dose of neutralizing antibodies in the donations was low and that there was no apparent association between the dose of neutralizing antibodies and human survival. [van Griensven J, Edwards T, Baize S. Efficacy of convalescent plasma in relation to dose of Ebola virus antibodies. N Engl J Med 2016;375:2307-2309]. In our opinion, it is essential that the authors clarify precisely the stage of the procedure at which samples for neutralizing antibodies were taken. Was it at the time of plasma donation, after pathogen-inactivation treatment, or at the time of transfusion (after 40 days of storage, a delay that may possibly affect the efficacy of antibodies)? This information is critical because there is no publicly accessible documentation regarding the estimated effect that handling convalescent plasma processes have on the stability and activity of neutralizing EBOV antibodies. It is also important that the authors document how samples for antibody assessment were handled. This will help in defining standards required for handling convalescent plasma against emerging infectious agents in regions with limited available technology.

Reply by the author and colleagues: We thank Burnouf et al. for the pertinent questions. Donor samples sent to France for EBOV antibody testing were peripheral-blood samples collected on the day that donors came for automated plasma collection. These blood samples had not undergone pathogen reduction, because this process was applied only to the plasma bags collected for administration. The blood samples were stored at -30 deg C [-22 deg F] in Guinea, shipped on dry ice to the biosafety level 4 laboratory in France, and stored at 80 deg C [-112 deg F]. Samples had been thawed twice when antibody testing was done. Most of the plasma used in the trial was administered shortly after collection; the median time of plasma storage before administration was 8 days (interquartile range, 4 to 15). Plasma was stored for clinical use at 2 to 8 deg C [36 to 46 deg F] for up to 40 days and frozen at -30 deg C [-22 deg F] after that. We used a pathogen-reduction process, because when this study was conducted, there were many gaps in our knowledge of EBOV persistence and the presence of other transfusion-transmissible infections that could not be excluded under field conditions. Recently, Geisen et al. reported in a single donor that levels of IgG protein, EBOV IgG, and neutralizing antibodies were only slightly reduced after pathogen-reduction treatment with S59 amotosalen-ultraviolet A. We agree that more research is needed on the potential effect of pathogen reduction on the stability and activity of anti-EBOV neutralizing antibodies.

2 Apr 2017 The trick to saving chimps from Ebola
https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/04/02/the-trick-to-saving-chimps-from-ebola.html
[A new study has shown great promise for an oral Ebola vaccine for chimpanzees and gorillas. But limits on testing are hampering the effort. The Ebola vaccine for chimps is made of a weakened rabies virus -- used in oral vaccines for animals -- with an added gene for the main surface glycoprotein from the Ebola virus. The vaccine was invented by Prof. Matthias Schnell's lab at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. The trial, consisting of oral and injected vaccines on 10 captive chimpanzees at a research centre at the University of Louisiana Lafayette, showed promising results for both. The chimpanzees developed immunity for Ebola, and suffered no side effects, said Dr. Peter Walsh, a biological anthropologist at the University of Cambridge who conducted the trials. However, the problem lies in recent changes in U.S. law stating that biomedical testing on chimpanzees is no longer legal.]
[The restrictions on medical testing on chimps in the wild need to be weighed on a case by case basis. A vaccine trial in this situation shows promise of benefiting them, as well as gorillas, as the chimps in this study would not be experimental subjects for humans, but rather they are being evaluated for a vaccine that shows strong potential to protect their species as soon as possible. - Mod.LK]

28 Mar 2017 Sierra Leone: IMF considers possible finance for Sierra Leone as economy goes into reverse
[The economy of Sierra Leone is now going through its toughest phase, since the end of the Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic. The government has run out of cash; donor funds have declined massively; inflation is rising out of control, unemployment remains chronically high; the taxation base has declined; public sector workers are going without pay; public services are facing huge financial constraints, and government contractors are not getting paid. The government has now realized that without private sector investments, it cannot diversify the economy and expand growth. Yet, public sector borrowing is rising fast, now standing at over USD 2 billion.]
[The Ebola outbreak in West Africa continues to have serious effects, not only on physical and psychological recovery of infected individuals but equally on the economy of the affected countries. - Mod.LK]
