A total of 27 538 chickens at a farm in Changhua County in central Taiwan were culled [Sun 17 Jan 2016] after a highly pathogenic subtype of the H5 avian influenza virus was detected near the farm [Fri 15 Jan 2016] according to agriculture officials. The latest culling brought the total number of poultry farms hit by the subtype of bird flu virus in Taiwan to 10 since the beginning of this year [2016], the officials said.

After the precautionary culling, areas within 3 km [1.8 mi] of the chicken farm in Chutang Township were disinfected according to established regulations, said Tung Meng-chih, the head of the Changhua County Animal Disease Control Center (ADCC). He also urged poultry farmers to be on alert for any abnormalities in their animals' health.

The Council of Agriculture (COA), meanwhile, reported on [Sun 17 Jan 2016] Taiwan's 1st case of a turtle dove being infected with the H5 subtype, bringing the total number of cases of birds infected with the strain to 4 so far this year [2016]. Last year [2015], 15 such cases were reported.
