Angola Says at Least 77 Die in Acute Fever Outbreak
------------------
At least 77 people, most of them children, have died in northern Angola
after an outbreak of a disease the World Health Organization (WHO) suspects
to be acute hemorrhagic fever, officials said on Friday [18 Mar 2005].
They have ruled out the Ebola virus -- a type of hemorrhagic fever and one
of the world's deadliest diseases -- but are urging people to avoid travel
to Uige, about 140 miles north of Luanda.
"Most of the city has been affected, but some areas are worse hit than
others. We ruled out Ebola on Monday," Health Ministry spokesman Carlos
Alberto said.
Diplomatic sources in Luanda said they understood the airport in Uige had
been closed.
Jose Caetano, a WHO spokesman in Angola, said most of the victims were
children with symptoms including fever, vomiting and diarrhea. He said at
least 77 of the total of 83 people believed infected had died.
"The situation is now under control. Our problem is trying to get the sick
to go to health centers. We are trying to encourage people who feel any of
the symptoms to get medical attention as quickly as possible," he told
Reuters in Luanda.
Caetano said Angola's limited laboratory facilities had hampered
identification of the disease and that samples had been sent to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the Pasteur Institute of Dakar
in Senegal.
He said the 1st case had been detected in November [2004].
Alberto said a specialized medical team was already on the ground in Uige
and a national commission had been created to respond to the outbreak.

Angola's Ebola-Like Illness Targets Children
----------------------
An Ebola-like mystery ailment that has killed at least 39 people in Angola
over the past 3 months is primarily targeting children under 5 years of
age, the UN health agency said today.
While the disease in Angola's northern province of Uige has still not been
identified, health officials believe it is an acute haemorrhagic fever
related to the Ebola virus, said Dick Thompson, spokesman for the World
Health Organisation. But unlike Ebola, which tends to predominantly
affect the adult population, 4 out of 5 cases of this new ailment have been
children, Thompson said.
"With Ebola, the age distribution is generally quite different than what we
are seeing here," he said. "But we are not ruling Ebola out. We are not
ruling anything out." The symptoms of the virus -- including vomiting,
bloody discharge and high fever -- are similar to those for Ebola and
dengue fever, according to the World Health Organisation.
Angolan officials have put the death toll at 64.

[In the 1st newswire above, there is mention of 83 suspected cases with 77
deaths -- a case fatality rate of approximately 93 percent. In the last
ProMED-mail posting there were reports of 64 deaths without giving a
denominator for the number of suspected cases. Now that there are teams on
the ground investigating this outbreak, one expects to find changes in the
tallies in terms of reported cases and deaths, both related to application
of clear case definitions in identifying cases as well as implementation of
active surveillance to identify cases that may not have come to the
attention of the health sector.
The newswires are intriguing in terms of the mention that 80 percent of
cases have been in children less than 5 years of age, suggesting either
immunity on the part of those older than 5 years, or an exposure that is
predominantly seen those under 5. According to the Health Ministry
spokesperson, Ebola virus has been ruled out as the etiology, although the
WHO spokesperson still leaves that open as a possibility. Obviously we
await more information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
