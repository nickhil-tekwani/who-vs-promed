Monkeypox Virus Not a Direct Ancestor or Descendent of Smallpox
Virus
---------------------------------------------------
A paper published in the 5 Jun 2002 issue of Virology by a
collaborative group of Russian and US investigators (S. N.
Shchelkunov, A. V. Totmenin, P. F. Safronov, M. V. Mikheev, V. V.
Gutorov, O. I. Ryazankina, N. A. Petrov, I. V. Babkin, E. A. Uvarova,
L. S. Sandakhchiev, J. R. Sisler, J. J. Esposito, I. K. Damon, P. B.
Jahrling and B. Moss) describes the complete sequencing and analysis
of the structure of the genome of monkeypox virus, and the
relationship of monkeypox virus to smallpox virus.
Monkeypox virus belongs to the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ of the family
_Poxviridae_, is endemic in parts of Africa, and causes a human
disease that resembles smallpox. The 196 858 base-pair genome of
monkeypox virus has been analyzed with regard to its structural
features and content of open reading frames.
Each end of the genome contains an identical but oppositely oriented
6379 base-pair terminal inverted repetition, which is similar to that of
other orthopoxviruses, includes a putative telomere resolution
sequence and short tandem repeats. Computer-assisted analysis was
used to identify 190 open reading frames containing 60 [or more]
amino acid residues. Of these, 4 were present within the inverted
terminal repetition.
The genome of Monkeypox virus contains the known essential
orthopoxvirus genes but only a subset of the putative immuno-
modulatory and host range genes. Sequence comparisons confirmed
the assignment of monkeypox virus as a distinct species of
orthopoxvirus that is not a direct ancestor or a direct descendent of
_Variola virus_, the causative gent of human smallpox.

[Human infection with monkeypox virus has been reported in rural
areas of the tropical rain forests of west and central Africa, especially in
the Democratic Republic of Congo. The signs and symptoms are
similar to those of smallpox, with generalised pustular rash, fever, and
toxaemia. The disease, which is rare, only became apparent after the
eradication of smallpox. Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic agent and is
acquired by humans through direct contact with the presumptive
natural hosts: squirrels and monkeys.
Person-to-person transmission has been recorded, but the secondary
attack rate is low. Nonetheless, the fear has been expressed that
monkeypox might evolve to become an endemic human infection. The
analysis reported above, demonstrating the distinct identity of
monkeypox virus with its deficit of immunomodulatory genes, suggests
that monkeypox virus is unlikely to become endemic in the human
population. - Mod.CP]
