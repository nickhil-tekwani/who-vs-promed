[These 5 WNV-positive crows include the 2 crows reported previously on 8
May 2001, which marked the re-emergence of West Nile virus in the
northeastern USA. The date of death of the first Edison county crow has
been given variously as 1, 2 and 3 May 2001. So far there have been no
reports of detection of WNV from any other agency. - Mod.CP
