Georgia has been put under a federal quarantine to help prevent the
spread of a devastating citrus disease. The quarantine follows the
discovery in Georgia of "citrus greening" (CG), a disease that causes
citrus fruit to be bitter and unusable. The disease was found on a
lemon tree in Savannah.

The quarantine means that nurseries in the state cannot ship citrus
plants (or related host plants that may also carry the disease) to
other states. The effect on the state's nurseries would be minimal
since few nurseries do this. Citrus plants include oranges,
tangerines, grapefruits, lemons, limes, kumquats, and calamondins.
Two other plants that could serve as hosts are orange jasmine
(_Murraya paniculata_), a tender shrub with fragrant white flowers,
and trifoliate orange (_Poncirus trifoliata_), a thorny and
cold-hardy shrub with white flowers.

Citrus greening was also found in Charleston, South Carolina, in
March [2009 -- see link below]. The disease-causing bacteria are
spread from plant to plant by a small insect called the Asian citrus
psyllid, which has also been found in Georgia. US Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Heath Inspection Service (APHIS) will
be doing some monitoring in the state to determine the extent of the
disease.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In
North America, it is caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting
bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus. Its vector is the
Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often
spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The vector is
specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives, and thus the disease is
confined to these crops. Two other species of _Ca._ L. (africanus and
americanus) can cause HLB in different areas. For more information on
HLB, see links and previous posts listed below.

Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Florida in 1998. _Ca._ L.
asiaticus was found there in 2005, and in Louisiana in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20080701.2006). Citrus psyllids have also been
found in some US states as yet without HLB, including Texas,
California, and Alabama. HLB is spreading in the Americas and,
together with citrus canker (_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_citri_), is considered a major threat to citrus industries.
