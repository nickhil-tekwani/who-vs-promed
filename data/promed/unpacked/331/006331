The pneumonic plague that hit Masindi district killing at least 9
residents in Mutunda sub-county has been contained, the Ministry of
Health has announced. Out of 19 cases, 11 have been discharged in the
last 2 weeks. No new cases have been reported in the same period.
The ministry, however, advised the public to put up flea control
measures and kill rats to contain the outbreak. Yesterday [7 Mar
2007], the health minister, Dr. Stephen Malinga, advised residents to
ensure an environment free of rodents even though the disease had
been successfully controlled. "We cannot therefore, sit back and say
all is done. We have to get rid of rats which carry fleas."

[Although one of the previous postings described the cases as
bubonic, it appears that the disease was pneumonic plague as
previously stated. It is important to reemphasize that bubonic plague
is spread to man from the bite of an infected (usually rodent) flea,
not from another person. Pneumonic plague can develop related to
bacteremic spread of _Yersinia pestis_ from a bubo (secondary plague
pneumonia) or, as primary plague pneumonia, aerolized directly from
another person with the respiratory form of _Y. pestis_. - Mod.LL]
