[1] East Anglia - bean rust warning

High levels of rust have been reported in thick winter bean crops in East
Anglia and, with the disease developing fast, growers need to act quickly,
[the chemical company] BASF has advised.
The disease -- characterised by orange-brown pustules and small chlorotic
spots on leaves and stems -- is not normally seen until the end of June
when it is controlled with the 2nd spray, said the firm's John Young. But,
this year [2007], it needs "serious consideration now," he said. "Severe
rust infections during flowering and pod fill can cause defoliation and
consequential loss of yield. PGRO (Processors and Growers Research
Organisation) trials have shown a 40 per cent yield loss when the disease
is left untreated."
Young advised growers to include a rust-active fungicide early-on in the
spray programme. "As disease pressure is so high, even in spring beans, a
2-spray programme will be needed in many situations." Products such as the
firm's Signum (pyraclostrobin + boscalid) and Caramba (metconazole) were
particularly suited to high-risk rust situations, while Walabi
(pyrimethanil + chlorothalonil) offered an alternative in low to moderate
disease situations, he said.

[2] Brown rust - fungicide efforts

With unprecedented levels of brown rust now in evidence in the UK's wheat
crop, growers are being advised to put the disease at the forefront of
their T2 fungicide campaign.
Traditionally classed as a T3 disease, the prolonged spell of dry, hot
weather has meant that brown rust has already spread into parts of the
country not seen before and is at levels higher than can be
remembered.Already this season brown rust has extended beyond its
traditional south east and East Anglian stronghold spreading across to
Hampshire, the Cotswolds, the Midlands, and up to Yorkshire.
"Brown rust has got into the Alchemy-type varieties which have a low
resistance rating and worryingly, Robigus (which has a 9 rating). With
ideal overwintering conditions, its spread has accelerated rapidly this
spring," said UAP's (United Agri Products) technical director, Chris Bean.
"We're into T2 decisions now and growers need to consider triazoles as
important in terms of brown rust activity. They're not the total answer and
despite the fact that strobilurins may have been dropped for septoria
reasons, they have a very significant part to play in the tank mix.
"If you're in a highly eradicant situation in terms of brown rust then a
triazole/strobilurin/morpholine mix needs to go on, and as soon as
possible," he said.

[Bean rust (_Uromyces phaseoli_) is present in every bean-growing area in
the world. It can destroy an entire crop and is more severe in humid areas
and under moderate temperatures. It can cause defoliation early in the
season, which reduces yield. _Uromyces appendiculatus_, a related rust
fungus, has also been reported to cause rust disease on beans.
Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia triticina_ (formerly _P. recondita_ f. sp. _tritici_). Other rust
diseases on wheat are stripe (yellow) rust caused by _P. striiformis_, and
stem rust caused by _P. graminis_.
Apparently, for rust both on bean and on wheat, a much larger than expected
number of reports have been received in the UK so early in the season. The
Home Grown Cereals Association (HGCA) (see link below) has warned growers
to be vigilant.
Wheat disease management can be used at the key decision times (T0, T1, T2
and T3) to reflect the changing risk as the season unfolds. T reflects the
growth stages of wheat referring to tillers present at a particular time:
T0 refers to the coleoptile tiller, T1 to the tiller developing from the
first leaf, etc.
