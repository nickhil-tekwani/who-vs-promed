Feline _Tritrichomonas foetus_ infection - Switzerland
---------------------------------------------------
_Tritrichomonas foetus_ is a notifiable parasitic infection in
cattle. Switzerland has a recorded absence of the parasite for more
than 10 years, the last case occurred in an imported bull in 1997. In
the cattle population, infection is venereally transmitted and causes
transient sterility in heifers, which will undergo self-cure. In
bulls, there are no clinical signs and the animals remain
persistently infected. Bulls to be used for artificial insemination
thus have to undergo appropriate quarantine investigations, including
in vitro and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) laboratory testing of
preputial wash fluid.

In cats, _T. foetus_ has been shown to cause chronic large bowel
diarrhea, initially described in the US and subsequently in the UK.
Affected animals are often pedigree cats, of young age and/or that
live in multi-cat households.

Between July 2007 and March 2008, the Small Animal Clinic and the
Institute of Parasitology of the University of Bern, Switzerland,
investigated feces from 61 native cats suffering from chronic
diarrhea. Methodically, an appropriate fecal sample was processed
with the InPouch-TF culture system (BioMed Diagnostics, Oregon, USA),
and flagellates morphologically identical to _Tritrichomonas foetus_
grew in 12 out of 61 samples. DNA-isolation and subsequent PCR for
the detection of _Tritrichomonas_ sp. upon genus-specific ribosomal
DNA sequences was performed with all 12 culture-positive specimens,
and all yielded PCR-positive findings. Subsequent sequence analyses
of the resulting PCR-product revealed _Tritrichomonas foetus_ DNA for
all cases.

To our knowledge, in Switzerland the occurrence and spread of _T.
foetus_ infection is new in cats. The risk and the potential impact
of the occurrence of _T. foetus_ in cats for the Swiss cattle
population need now to be analyzed and elucidated, respectively.

[Bovine venereal trichomonosis is an OIE (World Organisation for
Animal Health) reportable cattle disease, caused by the flagellate
protozoan, _Tritrichomonas foetus_. The natural hosts of _T. foetus_
are cattle (_Bos taurus_, _B. indicus_). Nonpathogenic species of
trichomonads occur in the intestine of cattle; _T. suis_ of pigs is
indistinguishable morphologically, serologically, and genetically
from _T. foetus_.

The control and elimination of _T. foetus_ from infected farms and
indeed countries has become possible mainly due to the implementation
of artificial insemination (AI) in the cattle industry, an
increasingly prevailing practice since the middle of the 20th
century. Switzerland reported its last case in 1997 and is one of 63
OIE member-countries which had been infected in the past and are --
according to 2007 data -- reportedly free of the disease; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_status_lists>.

Chapter 2.3.6. "Trichomonosis" of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health
Code specifies the requirements which importing countries should
require from their exporting counterparts in order to prevent the
introduction of infected live cattle or semen. For details on the
veterinary certification, see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.3.6.htm>.

OIE also prescribes the conditions applicable to artificial
insemination centres (AIC's) in order to permit the international
distribution of semen with a negligible risk of infecting other
animals with pathogens, such as _T. foetus_. Prior to entering the
semen collection facilities of the AIC, bulls and teaser animals
should be kept in a quarantine station for a prescribed period,
during which the animals should be subjected to diagnostic tests as
described in the Code's appendix 3.2.1. "Bovine and Small Ruminant
Semen". Article 3.2.1.5.1.2. of said appendix deals with _T. foetus_
testing procedures of candidate bulls during the quarantine period;
the appendix is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_3.2.1.htm>.

Further background and internationally recognised standards for
diagnostic tests are described in chapter 2.3.6. Trichomonosis
(updated 23 Jul 2004) of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00057.htm>.

Recent artificial infection trials in the US may be indicative of the
disease caused by feline and bovine isolates of _T. foetus_ as being
comparable, but not identical (see Ref 2).

The analysis and elucidation of the risk and the potential impact of
the occurrence of _T. foetus_ in cats for the Swiss cattle
population, referred to by the authors above, is anticipated with
great interest. Should _T. fetus_ infection in domestic cats prove to
present a risk factor for cattle, appropriate preventive steps --
such as precluding contact between cats and cattle, and in particular
with breeding bulls in AIC's -- will have to be considered.
