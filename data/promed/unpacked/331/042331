I am grateful for your ProMED-mail collaboration
in reporting a new anthrax outbreak.

2 animals died within a herd of 170 pregnant
and calving cows. The animals were not
vaccinated against anthrax (_Bacillus
anthracis_). According to the veterinarian
working on the case, one of the animals showed
bleeding from natural orifices, its spleen was
not enlarged but showed petechiae. Culture and
isolation showed colonies that were
morphologically atypical. White mice were
inoculated and died 22 hours post-inoculation;
_B. anthracis_ was isolated from their spleens.

The herd is located close to Highway 226 towards
Pehuajo, 15 km (9.3 mi) from Bolivar city in
Buenos Aires Province.

[Our thanks to Ramon for this report and to Maria Pena for her translation.

Livestock anthrax in Argentina is very much an
imported disease through the historic use of
imported bone meals. Until the carcass
restrictions imposed after the 1967/68 FMD
(foot-and-mouth disease) epidemic in the UK,
Argentina loaded refrigerated ships with whole
beef carcasses. The ships were docked next to the
slaughter houses in La Plata and the carcasses
were wheeled in to their refrigerated holds.
Bones from dressed cuts could not be recycled
back as the dressing was done abroad.

Unfortunately Argentina is deficient in calcium
and phosphorus so mineral supplements had to be
imported. Though Lord Pakenham unsuccessfully
invaded Buenos Aires in 1811 -- before he went on
to attack New Orleans and die -- in time the
country was essentially run by the British
through banks, communications, rail, and the
cattle and sheep companies. So the beef carcasses
went mainly to the port of London and bone meal
went back to Buenos Aires, and like all bone meals
available in the UK at that time, it had a risk
of _B. anthracis_ contamination. And because of
the multiple sources of that contamination (such
as Africa, India, Central Asia), Argentina has a
wide range of now endemic strains. Thus, the
atypical morphology on culture. Not unexpected -- I
once recovered 4 different strains from one
Argentinean pig.

After the 1967/68 FMD epidemic it was illegal in
the UK to import meat on the bone so Argentina
prepared and boxed the various cuts. This had
various benefits including more beef per shipment,
and they now had bones they could process into
bone meal for domestic use.
