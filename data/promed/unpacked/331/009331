The Ministry of Agriculture and Food has confirmed "a premises of concern has been identified in the Cowichan Valley" with respect to the avian influenza (bird flu).

According to the Salt Spring Island Poultry Club, a member was notified by the ministry that their birds in Mill Bay were within 12 km [7.5 mi] of a backyard flock that had the virus and they have been advised to take extra precautions.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is the lead agency on the case. A CFIA spokesperson said the only confirmed case thus far is the one in the Okanagan, and the CFIA does not release information on suspected cases until they are confirmed.

On 20 Apr [2022], in response to a confirmed outbreak of avian influenza at an Okanagan farm, Minister of Agriculture and Food Lana Popham said, "Enhanced prevention and preparedness measures are being taken to protect poultry flocks in BC."

"All poultry producers, including backyard poultry owners, are advised to increase their biosecurity practices and to be vigilant and monitor for signs of avian influenza in their flocks," said Popham's statement. "To further protect farmers and prevent the spread of avian influenza in BC, the deputy chief veterinarian has issued an order requiring all commercial poultry flocks in the province with more than 100 birds to be moved indoors until the spring migration ends in May."

While acknowledging the potential Cowichan Valley case, ministry staff did note it had not yet been posted on the CFIA's growing investigations list.

Signs of avian influenza include, but aren't limited to, a drop in egg production, respiratory illness, diarrhea, drop in feed or water intake, and death.

Those who suspect their birds have avian influenza are to contact a veterinarian or their nearest CFIA animal health office.

[2] British Columbia (Central Okanagan): backyard flock

The Canadian Food and Inspection Agency announced Monday [25 Apr 2022] evening highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a small backyard flock within the City of Kelowna.

"The infected premises has been placed under quarantine. CFIA has begun an investigation and will be establishing movement control measures on other farms within that area," the agency said online.

Producers within a 12 km [7.5 mi] radius of the test result have been informed, said the BC government in a separate news release.

This strain of avian flu was first detected at an Enderby farm, leading to a control zone being set up in the surrounding area, limiting the movement of livestock birds.

The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and can cause serious disease and death in birds, says the CFIA. It poses low risk to humans, although people who are in close contact with sick birds can fall ill. It is very rare for the disease to spread between humans.

The CFIA said last week this has been an unprecedented year globally for avian flu. It said it believes migratory birds are responsible for the outbreaks and expects there will be more cases as flocks continue to fly north for the summer.

Previous outbreaks in BC and elsewhere in Canada led to the destruction of millions of birds. The most serious was a 2004 outbreak in the Fraser Valley, where the H7N3 strain spread to 42 commercial farms and 11 backyard coops, prompting federal officials to order a cull of about 17 million birds.

Avian flu is spread through contact with an infected bird or its feces or nasal secretions. Farm birds going outside are most at risk because they can come in direct contact with infected wild birds or their feces. Humans can also inadvertently carry the infection into a barn on their shoes or clothing.

When Agriculture Minister Lana Popham announced the discovery of avian flu in the North Okanagan farm earlier this month [April 2022], she said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was leading the response to the outbreak, which includes testing, mapping, surveillance, and disposal of animals.

"All poultry producers, including backyard poultry owners, are advised to increase their biosecurity practices and to be vigilant and monitor for signs of avian influenza in their flocks," she said.

BC's deputy chief veterinarian also issued an order requiring all commercial poultry flocks in the province with more than 100 birds to be moved indoors until the spring migration ends in May [2022], the Agriculture Ministry said.

Avian influenza confirmed in commercial poultry flock

Manitoba Agriculture is advising the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed a case of avian influenza in a commercial poultry flock in Manitoba.

This confirmation marks the 1st case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in a commercial flock in Manitoba. Further information is available at https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/detection-of-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-h5n/eng/1640207916497/1640207916934.

HPAI cases had previously been confirmed in many jurisdictions in Canada and the United States, including North Dakota and Minnesota, along the route for spring migratory birds returning to Manitoba.

The risk of avian influenza to human health is low. There are no known cases of transmission of this strain of the virus from birds to humans in North America.

This strain of avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk. Manitoba poultry and eggs are safe to eat when proper handling and cooking take place.

All Manitobans who keep poultry on their properties in any amount are required to complete an application to Manitoba Agriculture's Premises Identification program. This will allow for rapid contact in the event HPAI is detected nearby. More information is available at <www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/food-safety/traceability/premises-identification.html>.

Small flock owners are highly advised to take extra precautions. Small flocks are considered at high risk for HPAI infection as they often have access to outdoor pens or free range. This means there is a high probability of contact with wild birds that may be contaminated with HPAI.

Precautions for small flock owners include
- confining birds indoors during this high-risk period of wild bird migration;
- avoiding shows or trading birds while the risk of HPAI is high;
- contacting a veterinarian immediately if an increase in sudden death or respiratory signs is seen in a flock; and
- using a quarantine period of 21 days before integrating new birds to the flock.

Manitoba's poultry farmers are strongly urged to follow strict biosecurity protocols including precautions with farm visitors and service companies. The Manitoba government continues to work with the CFIA, which is leading the disease response, as well as the poultry industry to support producers and small flock owners and strengthen the high levels of biosecurity already implemented to reduce further spread of the disease. Co-ordination is underway with Manitoba's poultry organizations and key sector stakeholders, and regular updates are being provided.

Producers are advised to continue monitoring information provided through their sector organizations and the Office of the Chief Veterinarian. Producers and small flock owners who need help with animal health-related concerns can contact their veterinarian or the Office of the Chief Veterinarian.

Although the risk of transmission of avian influenza to humans is low, people should not touch dead birds or other wildlife with their bare hands. Protective eyewear and masks are recommended as an additional precaution. Hands should be thoroughly washed before and after with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If a dead bird has to be handled, gloves should be worn and the dead bird placed in a plastic bag.

Manitobans are asked to contact the TIP Line (toll free) if they find any of the following:
- clusters of 6 or more dead wild waterfowl (e.g., ducks, geese) or other water birds;
- any number of dead raptors or avian scavengers (e.g., ravens, crows, gulls); and
- groups of dead birds, such as more than 20 of any species.

The public's co-operation is appreciated to help monitor this developing situation.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says 6 new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been reported in the state.

The newest cases were all confirmed on 19 Apr [2022], and all involved commercial turkey flocks.

Two of those cases were in Morrison County, affecting 18 000 and 10 369 birds, respectively.

The largest flock of those most recently affected was in Meeker County, where 53 069 birds were affected. A flock in Kandiyohi County had 36 210 turkeys, while HPAI cases in Otter Tail and Swift Counties had 29 751 and 31 700 turkeys, respectively.

So far in 2022, Morrison County has had 9 cases of HPAI, Kandiyohi County has had 8, Meeker County has had 4, Otter Tail County has had 3, and Swift County has had 2.

According to the state agency, Minnesota has had 46 confirmed cases of HPAI in 2022, although 4 of those involved backyard flocks and should not have an impact on international trade. The total number of commercial birds -- which includes meat turkeys, turkey breeding hens, laying hens, and broilers -- that have been affected by HPAI in 2022 was 2 117 872 as of noontime on 20 Apr [2022].

Other Minnesota counties with confirmed cases of HPAI in 2022 include Blue Earth, Waseca, Yellow Medicine, LeSueur, Renville, Dodge, Becker, Stearns, and Lac Qui Parle.

In addition to Minnesota, HPAI has been confirmed in poultry in the following states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. In addition, the virus has been confirmed in commercial game bird operations in Texas, New York, and South Dakota.

Presently, 165 flocks in the United States and Canada have been affected by HPAI in 2022, amounting to 129.1 million birds. However, the number does not include the number of birds in several Canadian cases in which the flock sizes have not yet been released.

Utah's Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) has confirmed a 2nd case of bird flu in Utah.

In a press release sent out Saturday [23 Apr 2022] morning, UDAF announced the highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in birds on a farm in Cache County.

This comes after the department had detected the virus in a backyard flock of chickens in Utah County on Monday [18 Apr 2022].

The owner of the farm noticed his birds experiencing signs of the virus and immediately contacted UDAF. The farm had been following "very strict biosecurity measures" since the agency's announcement on Monday [18 Apr 2022].

"The diagnosis of HPAI on this farm is devastating," said Dr. Dean Taylor, Utah State Veterinarian, in the press release. "UDAF is working to contain the disease and prevent it from spreading further in this area."

UDAF urges bird owners to continue to check for signs in their birds. Signs include a high death rate among flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and lack of coordination in birds.

Owners whose birds are exhibiting signs are asked to contact the state veterinarian's office immediately by email at<statevet@utah.gov>.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have still been no human cases of this particular strain of HPAI detected in the United States.

https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/two-more-bird-flu-outbreaks-on-pennsylvania-egg-farms


In less than 3 months, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has killed more than 31 million birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, in domestic flocks from the Atlantic coast into the Rockies, according to USDA data released Sunday [24 Apr 2022]. Officials said bird flu was identified on 2 additional egg farms in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with a combined 2 million hens.

HPAI was a factor in high egg, chicken, and turkey prices. The USDA said there were 373 million hens in the US laying flock at the start of this month [April 2022], a decline of 5% from April 2021. According to USDA data, 5.4 million laying hens died in outbreaks so far this month [April 2022].

Egg and poultry meat prices are likely to be elevated through the end of the year [2022], Wells Fargo analyst Courtney Schmidt told the Washington Post.

More than 50 million chickens and turkeys died in the 2014-2015 HPAI epidemic, including 12% of the country's laying hens. Some 211 commercial poultry farms were hit during the epidemic, which ended in mid-June 2015.

By comparison, 150 commercial flocks have been infected this year [2022], following the 1st confirmed outbreak on 8 Feb [2022]. HPAI has been identified in 91 commercial flocks during April [2022], compared to 51 flocks in March [2022], but less than half as many birds have died this month [April 2022] compared with March [2022], roughly 9 million vs. 21 million.

[One of the articles listed above did a brief comparison regarding the outbreak in 2004 versus now. The number of birds affected has increased dramatically.

Please, if you have birds whether as a pet, a backyard flock, or a commercial production unit, take extreme safety issues to protect your birds.

Some facilities are limiting the feeding of some poultry houses to only one person, who must not own or work with other birds, even pet birds, in any way. Keeping birds inside is helpful. It is critical to have on clean boots, gloves, and coveralls when entering any poultry house or premises. While there have been no human cases of this influenza strain, it is strongly suggested that any individuals entering a poultry facility/house should have a face covering on to prevent any viral particles from the nose or mouth to reach the birds.

This is not a food safety issue, but it is a food issue, as the fewer birds there are, the fewer eggs and meat products available. The price goes up. So please be extremely diligent in protecting your birds. - Mod.TG
