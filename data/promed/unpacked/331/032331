Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Between January 2016 and 13 Mar 2018, 7 countries and territories of the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of yellow fever: the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, and Suriname. The number of human cases and epizootics collectively reported in this period in the Region of the Americas is the highest observed in decades.

Since the 16 Feb 2018 Epidemiological Update on Yellow Fever published by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), Brazil and Peru have reported new yellow fever cases; the following is a summary of the situation in both countries.

Brazil. The situation in Brazil, including most recent case counts in Brazil (from the Brazil Ministry of Health) and cases in foreign travelers, were included in yesterday's [19 Mar 2017] ProMED-mail post (Yellow fever - Americas (21): Brazil, Europe 20180319.5696497).

In Peru, between EW 1 and 9 of 2018, 22 cases of yellow fever were reported, 8 of which were confirmed by laboratory, and the remaining 14 are under investigation. This figure is higher than those reported in the same period of 2017, when there were 5 yellow fever cases reported (2 in Amazonas and 3 in Ayacucho).

In 2018, the majority of the cases are residents of the Calleria district, Coronel Portillo Province, Ucayali department, an area considered at risk for yellow fever.

Advice for national authorities: The occurrence of confirmed cases of yellow fever in unvaccinated travelers highlights the need for member states to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travelers.

The continuing occurrence of epizootics [cases in monkeys] during the current seasonal period indicates that the risk of transmission to unvaccinated humans continues; accordingly, PAHO/WHO encourages member states to continue efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated when heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

On 16 Jan 2018, WHO published updated advice, entitled, "Updates on yellow fever vaccination recommendations for international travelers related to the current situation in Brazil, information for international travelers", available at http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20180116/en/.

Vaccination: the yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 per cent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 per cent immunity after 30 days. A single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines and with the aim of promoting the rational use, PAHO/WHO reiterates its recommendations to national authorities:
1. Conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in areas at risk at the municipal level to guarantee at least 95 per cent coverage among the resident population of these areas.
2. Member states that are not currently experiencing outbreaks should not conduct yellow fever immunization campaigns. Priority should be given to the use of vaccines in susceptible populations and to avoid revaccination.
3. Ensure vaccination of all travelers to endemic areas at least 10 days before traveling.
4. Depending on vaccine availabilities, member states should have a small stock that allows them to respond to outbreaks.
5. Postpone routine vaccination in children in non-endemic areas until sufficient vaccines are available. Once there is availability, catch-up campaigns should be conducted to complete vaccination schedules.

Precautions: It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease when faced with the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years who have not been previously vaccinated.
- The vaccine can be offered to individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ counts 200 cells or higher/mm3 requiring vaccination.
- Pregnant women should be vaccinated in emergency epidemiological situations and following the explicit recommendations of health authorities.
- Vaccination is recommended in nursing women who live in endemic areas, since the potential risk of transmitting the vaccine virus to the child is far lower than the benefits of breastfeeding.
- For pregnant or lactating women traveling to areas with yellow fever transmission, vaccination is recommended when travel cannot be postponed or avoided. They should receive advice on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination to make an informed decision. The benefits of breastfeeding are superior to those of other nutritional alternatives.

The following people are usually excluded from yellow fever vaccination:
- Immunocompromised individuals (including those with thymus disorders, symptomatic HIV, malignant neoplasms under treatment, and those that are receiving or have received immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments, recent transplants, and current or recent radiation therapy).
- People with severe allergies to eggs and their derivatives.

[Although there have been no reports of cases from the urban _Aedes aegypti_ cycle of transmission in Brazil, Peru, or other yellow fever (YF) virus endemic countries in South America, the risk remains that spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note from the case numbers above that cases of YF in humans and monkeys were occurring in areas outside of the 3 states in Brazil, Peru, and other South American countries earlier in this year (2018). There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so surveillance in broad YF-endemic areas is important.
