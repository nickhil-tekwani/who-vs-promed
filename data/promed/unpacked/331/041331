Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 1 Apr 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 3 Apr 2020
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 11 Sep 2012
Manifestation of disease: subclinical infection

Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location 1 (CEM 2020-1): Fife, Scotland
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 26 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: one stallion on premises in isolation, 10 pregnant mares and 15 mares awaiting artificial insemination - no contact with affected stallion.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 3.85 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Whilst carrying out a routine pre-breeding sampling, an imported 6 year old Warmblood stallion has been confirmed positive for Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM). It is now placed under restrictions on the stud whilst investigation and tracings continue. The stallion and one identified contact mare on the same premises are undergoing treatment.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; traceability; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (antibacterial wash and topical antibiotic cream)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Liphook Equine Hospital (Local laboratory) / Equidae / bacteriological examination / 1 Apr 2020 / Positive
Liphook Equine Hospital (Local laboratory) / Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 1 Apr 2020 / Positive
Apha Penrith (National laboratory) / Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 3 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Contagious equine metritis is an inflammatory disease of the proximal and distal reproductive tract of the mare caused by _Taylorella equigenitalis_, [a Gram-negative bacterium] which usually results in temporary infertility. It is a nonsystemic infection, the effects of which are restricted to the reproductive tract of the mare.

"When present, clinical signs include endometritis, cervicitis and vaginitis of variable severity and a slight to copious mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Recovery is uneventful, but prolonged asymptomatic or symptomatic carriage is established in a proportion of infected mares.

"Direct venereal contact during natural mating presents the highest risk for the transmission of _T. equigenitalis_ from a contaminated stallion or an infected mare. Direct venereal transmission can also take place by artificial insemination using infective raw, chilled and possibly frozen semen. Indirectly, infection may be acquired through fomite transmission, manual contamination, inadequate observance of appropriate biosecurity measures at the time of breeding and at semen collection centres. Stallions can become asymptomatic carriers of _T. equigenitalis_.

"The principal sites of colonisation by the bacterium are the urogenital membranes (urethral fossa, urethral sinus, terminal urethra and penile sheath). The sites of persistence of _T. equigenitalis_ in the majority of carrier mares are the clitoral sinuses and fossa and infrequently the uterus. Foals born of carrier mares may also become carriers. The organism can infect equid species other than horses, e.g. donkeys".

"The geographic distribution of _T. equigenitalis_ is difficult to estimate accurately. This organism has been detected at times in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia and on some islands. In some countries, it may be absent or rare in some breeds of horses (e.g., Thoroughbreds) due to control programs, but present in others. Some nations reported to have eradicated contagious equine metritis include certain European countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia and Japan.
