From: Dr. Marcus Lem <marculem@mail.unixg.ubc.ca>
The patient was an elderly German woman who was visiting her son. When I
assumed care of her, she had already been in the hospital, on the medical
ward about 2 weeks with the presumptive diagnosis of community acquired
pneumonia. Her main symptoms were dyspnea and weakness and she had a
moderate pleural effusion. She had been treated with the usual antibiotic
therapy, but had not responded, and Respirology and Infectious Disease had
been consulted.
When I started caring for her, I did a full respiratory history and
physical. She denied living on a farm, having pets, being exposed to
birthing animals, having unusual hobbies involving plants, glues, etc. When
I inquired about medical history, her daughter-in-law, who was present,
volunteered that the patient had been to Germany recently for some
treatment for arthritis that involved the injection of sheep tissue.
Further inquiry with the patient revealed that it was fetal sheep tissue
and that she had gone to Germany just to get the treatment before a
moratorium was declared.
Shortly after returning home to Canada, she developed "the flu" which
lasted a few weeks. On the basis of this history, I ordered serological
tests, which came back as positive for _Coxiella burnetti_. The titres did
not seem to indicate an acute infection. Since she had been unresponsive
to the usual antibiotics, I started her on doxycycline. She had marked
improvement within two days. Shortly afterwards we transferred her off the
acute ward.
Since she had the injections in Germany, I was unable get any sample to
positively identify the source of transmission. Likewise, although the
patient was alert and cogent, I cannot rule out [an incidental exposure
which the patient did not recall, or even realize. I understand that a few
cases of Q fever have no identifiable source of transmission. Given the
history, serology, and response to the appropriate anti-microbial, I'm
confident that she had Q fever. The fetal sheep tissue injection is the
most likely source, however I cannot prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt.
If samples of such treatments exist in Germany, they could be tested for
_Coxiella_.
I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has had similar cases or who
knows more about the sheep tissue injections.

[Psittacosis acquired from birthing tissues of sheep might also be
considered here, although the portal of entry may not be right.
_Chlamydia_ would be expected to respond to doxycycline. See the
ProMED-mail postings cited above for more details. - Mod.ES
