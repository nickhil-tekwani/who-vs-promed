The success reported by Escobar in the Americas should be of impetus to
those clamouring for prevention-based rabies eradication in the countries
of Africa and elsewhere, where dogs are still the main source of urban
rabies.The problems that may or are being faced in achieving such
outstanding results as in the Americas , however need to be highlighted and
addressed.
While urban migration is similar,the pattern of relationship of the
populace may be more complex. For one thing, there are several societies in
Africa where dog meat (as well as that of other potential vectors) is a
delicacy. What impact will a mass vaccination program have in such an
arena? The continuous transportation of dogs, especially across borders,
will have a toll on any vaccination program and has not been duly
addressed. Has there been any work done on the possibility of transmission
to man of the virus from an animal subclincally infected or with the virus
still undergoing incubation? The constant availability of local
rabies-virus variant-based vaccine is often another problem.
