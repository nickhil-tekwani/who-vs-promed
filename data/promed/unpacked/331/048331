The parents of a 3-month-old girl say they watched their baby become paralyzed before their eyes. Neurologists at CHKD diagnosed the baby with a rare case of botulism last Thu 11 Jul 2013.

According to the CDC, infant botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused when a person consumes the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release a toxin.

The baby's mother says her baby seemed constipated and stopped smiling. "We thought it was a virus, and we wanted to wait it out." But 4 days later, she took video of her daughter moaning. "I heard her moan all night long, and I went into the bathroom, and I told my husband, 'We've lost our baby,'" said Emily. "I don't think we're going to get her back, because we just couldn't figure it out."

The next morning, doctors at CHKD listened to the mother and began testing her baby. "The neurologist lifted her leg, looked in her eye and said she has botulism. Of course, we're standing around the bed saying, 'Okay, what?'" the mother said.

Paralysis began to set in, and the baby was immediately intubated. "We heard what was coming, and frankly we didn't know what was going to be on the other side of it," said her father. "We didn't know if this was the last time we were going to see her off of a ventilator, so we tried to capture it all, to make sure that we had her."

That night, a rare medication from California, botulism immune globulin, was ordered to stop the baby's paralysis. According to CHKD Neurologist Dr. Michael Strunc, babies used to be intubated for months, and thanks to this drug, it's just weeks. Now, the hunt for the cause begins.

Doctors wonder whether the baby's older brothers may have transferred spores after playing in the dirt in the backyard and then touching the baby. The CDC is running tests on the soil. "We want to know what's in our backyard," the father said. The CDC said other usual causes are exposure to honey and corn syrup.

A previous case of infant botulism in Suffolk was linked to exposure from a construction site that released dust particles carrying the spore. The father said his family doesn't live near any construction sites. Dr. Strunc said the family may never know the cause, but believes it's important that everybody know the symptoms. Strunc says one of the 1st symptoms is constipation. "The paralysis starts in the cranial nerves and moves downward. So, those kids present with constipation and eventually a weakened cry."

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the USA. In many cases, the source of the spores is not found, although honey has been a common vehicle. Babies being breastfed as the only source of food may also develop the illness.

A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial note (with references removed) from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified." http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5202a1.htm. - Mod.LL
