A Potters Pond _Campylobacter_ outbreak has closed the area, which is used for shellfish harvesting, in Rhode Island after 7 people got sick with the bacterial infection, according to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH). Potters Pond is located in South Kingston, Rhode Island. The pond is going to remain closed until further notice.

An investigation linked the illnesses to shellfish harvested in the area. A shellfish sample collected by RIDOH tested positive for _Campylobacter lari_. The shellfish sample does not match the illnesses from the investigation; however, the positive shellfish sample does indicate the presence of _Campylobacter_ in the pond. More samples are being collected and tested. Two of the patients have tested positive for _ Campylobacter jejuni_, a different serotype of the pathogen. Those sickened ate raw shellfish between 11 and 19 Aug 2021.

Government officials have contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to make sure that any product harvested during this time frame is not sold at restaurants and markets. Officials are urging recreational harvesters who harvested shellfish in Potters Pond between 9 and 11 Sep 2021 to discard the shellfish or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. The pond had been closed for some time before 9 Sep 2021 because of heavy rain.

Shellfish is safer to eat when it is cooked to a final internal temperature of at least 145 deg F. Quick steaming is not enough to prevent gastrointestinal illnesses. And remember that raw oysters and shellfish that are contaminated with pathogens still look, smell, and taste normal.

Symptoms of a _Campylobacter_ infection include fever, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that is often bloody. People usually start feeling sick 2-5 days after infection, and symptoms usually last about a week. One of the serious long-term complications of this infection is Guillain Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis.

[This post and, indeed, the original press release from the state of Rhode Island (https://www.ri.gov/press/view/42081) do not make it clear if the other 5 cases were _C. lari and the shellfish isolate did not match the human isolates. Campylobacteriosis is commonly associated with unpasteurized milk and undercooked chicken, but shellfish can be a reservoir. _C. lari_ is found in water and was initially isolated from seagulls. - Mod.LL
