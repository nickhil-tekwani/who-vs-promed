Anthrax has infected 20 residents of Tajur Tapos hamlet in Hambalang
subdistrict, Citeureup over the past month, 2 of whom have died. The local
residents have been suffering from bleeding ulcers, which is identified as
a specific symptom of anthrax, after reportedly eating either goat meat or
beef, Darminto, head of the Bogor Veterinary Research Office, said on
Monday. Darminto said an investigation conducted on 29 Jan 2001 found that
[a man & a boy, who were neighbors, had died of the disease. The official
added that 5 people have been receiving medical treatment in Cibinong
Hospital since 29 Jan 2001.
He suspected that the virus [sic had been spreading since last November
[2000, but stated that his office had only received a report on the matter
on 29 Jan 2001. He added that the inspection team had not found any anthrax
spores in the soil samples taken from animal graves in the infected area.
"It was too late for us to inspect the infected area as the anthrax spores,
the spreaders of the virus [sic, had already been washed away by the rain
which has been drenching the city lately," he told The Jakarta Post on Monday.
"The virus [sic should not have infected the people if anti-anthrax
vaccines had been distributed to the thousands of livestock rearers in the
area from the beginning," he asserted. Darminto said the disease has been
caused by anthrax spores in the soil. The virus normally requires 60 years
to become locally extinct. [Actually, it is frequently much faster than
this in most instances, especially with active vaccination and effective
carcass disposal. - Mod.MHJ Darminto said many areas in Bogor were prone
to anthrax, including Cileungsi, Jonggol, Bojong Gede, Sukaraja and Cariu.
Contacted separately, Musni, head of the animal health division of the West
Java Public Health Office, said that his office had vaccinated only 1000
out of some 4000 head of livestock in Hambalang village, including both
cattle and goats. The regency administration has banned the transportation
by road of livestock out of the Bogor area, especially from Hambalang village.
The Jakarta city administration has required vaccinations for all livestock
coming into the city. Head of the Jakarta Livestock Husbandry Agency Edy
Setiarto said on Monday that city officials would examine the physical
condition and health documents of each animal, particularly at
slaughterhouses. "So far, we haven't found any infected livestock in the
capital. However, if we do, we'll put them in quarantine and put them
down," said Edy.
Head of the Jakarta Livestock Husbandry Agency Edy called on consumers to
beware of anthrax-infected livestock and to buy animals only from
authorized traders. Dark bloodstains normally marked infected meat, he
said. City residents consume at least 150 tons of meat every day. About 35
tons are supplied by the city-owned meat distributor, while another 45 tons
are imported from neighboring countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.
The remaining 70 tons are supplied by livestock-rearing areas around
Jakarta. According to Dharma Jaya president Prabowo Soenirman, about 70
percent of the meat is distributed to some 151 traditional markets across
the capital, while the rest is sold through supermarkets and hypermarkets.
"I guarantee that our meat has been examined for anthrax, because we always
require a beast to be checked before being slaughtered," said Prabowo. Edy
said his agency had prepared at least 45 000 goats and 3000 cattle to meet
the city's demand for meat on Idul Adha, Islamic Day of Sacrifice, which
falls on 5 Mar 2001.
