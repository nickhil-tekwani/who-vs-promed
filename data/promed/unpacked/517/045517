Q Fever and Queensland Tick Typhus are Distinct Rickettsial Diseases
----------------------------------------
The "Q" in Q fever is derived from the original name of this then-unknown
fever, which was labelled "Query fever." Q fever should not be confused
with another rickettsial illness in Australia, Queensland tick typhus.

Vaccine Reactogenicity Warning
------------------------------
The [Q fever vaccine is very reactogenic in sensitized individuals. For
that reason, skin testing is required before vaccination. That is usually
[performed with 1/1500th of a vaccine dose.
