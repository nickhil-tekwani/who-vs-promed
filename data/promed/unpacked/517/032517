Nepal: Hepatitis E - background information
-------------------------------------------
The disease is most common during July to August and among persons
below age 35.
Hepatitis E accounts for 50 percent to 85 percent of hepatitis in
Kathmandu and is the prominent cause of jaundice in that city.
Hepatitis E accounts for 56 percent of acute hepatitis of unknown
etiology. Age-specific infection rates for persons ages 12 to 19
years are estimated at 9900 per 100 000 during periods of sporadic
transmission.
433 Nepalese citizens were hospitalized (11 fatal, including one
pregnant woman) for the disease in the Kathmandu Valley during 1995;
1166 (27 fatal, 13 antenatal women) in 1996.
Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 10 percent to 12 percent of the general population (1992 to 1993)
- 16 percent to 31 percent of healthy adolescents and young adults in
Kathmandu (1996)
- 30 percent to 37 percent of adults (1995)
- 95 percent of adults with hepatitis (1987 to 1988)
- 37 percent of United Nations peacekeepers in Nepal.
Serum antibody has been demonstrated in free-roaming swine (_Sus
scrofa domestica_), rats (_Rattus rattus brunneusculus_), bandicoots
(_Bandicota bengalensis_) and house shrews (_Suncus murinus_) in the
Kathmandu Valley (1995).
Notable outbreaks
-----------------
1973 to 1974 - An outbreak (10 000 cases) of presumed hepatitis E
infection was reported in Kathmandu.
1981 to 1982 - An outbreak (4337 cases) was reported in the Kathmandu Valley.
1995 - An outbreak (30 cases) was reported at a military training
camp east of Kathmandu.
The ProMED-mail post mentions that the current outbreak included
Nepal's Prime Minister. This would make him the 35th known or alleged
notable person to suffer from hepatitis, an old hobby which I
maintain at
