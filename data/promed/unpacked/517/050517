[As can be seen from the OIE disease map for LSD (http://tinyurl.com/zknsspl, click on the Caucuses cluster and zoom in) the infected territories closest to Kazakhstan are the Russian regions of Astrakhan and Volgograd, which border the regions of West Kazakhstan and Atyrau.

Should the disease be detected in animals in Mangyshlak in Mangystau region, these animals likely passed through the aforementioned 2 regions (unless there are other possible animal transport routes by sea?). Immediate and thorough surveillance in the 2 regions is essential. An alternate route of introducing the virus could be vector-borne spread across the Caspian Sea, but that is less likely.

Mangystau region is located in southwestern Kazakhstan, east of the Caspian Sea (https://www.britannica.com/place/Mangghystau). A map showing the location of Mangyshlak and the region of Mangystau can be seen on http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KZ/09/Mangyshlak.html and http://tinyurl.com/hlkr9xl. - Mods.AS/CRD
