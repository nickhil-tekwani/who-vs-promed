According to the expert [Guangzhou City's Director of the Municipal
Health Bureau, Huang Jiong Lie] the atypical pneumonia is caused by
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, which is a small microorganism lying
between the categories of bacteria and [viruses]. [It] causes acute
sickness. Its main symptom is fever,
accompanied by dry cough, less phlegm, and an [acute] respiratory
tract condition.

[_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ is a bacterium that infects the lower
respiratory tract. The disease is asymptomatic or very mild in
children under 5 years old; symptomatic cases are most common among
school-aged children and young adults. Fatalities are rare.
Treatment of Mycoplasma infections is with erythromycin, other
macrolides, or tetracyclines. A large outbreak with many hospitalized
patients, particularly health care workers, would be unusual.
Mycoplasma infections have a long incubation period, typically 2-3
weeks, compared to the short incubation periods of most respiratory
viruses. It would be interesting to know the suspected incubation
period in this outbreak. In the absence of details as to how this
diagnosis of Mycoplasma was made, and the lack of subsequent
confirmatory reports (see [4] below), this diagnosis must be
considered quite speculative. ProMED-mail awaits further details. -

Health officials from Guangdong Province have reported a total of 305
cases and 5 deaths of acute respiratory syndrome from 16 Nov 2002 - 9
Feb 2003 (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_11/en/>)
A team from the Chinese Ministry of Health is working with Guangdong
health officials to investigate the outbreak and collect samples for
laboratory analysis. To date, virus isolation for influenza has been
negative.
Cases have been reported from 6 municipalities in Guangdong Province:
Foshan, Guangzhou, Heyuan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan. No new
cases have been reported in Foshan, Heyuan, or Zhongshan during the
past week. The number of new cases is decreasing in Guangzhou,
Jiangmen, and Shenzhen municipalities.

Pneumonia outbreak in Guangdong under control
--------------------------------------------------
Huang Qingdao, director of the Guangdong Provincial Health Bureau,
said 305 people had been found to have contracted the disease between
16 Nov 2002 and 9 Feb 2003. 5 patients have died, including a
10-year-old boy, a 36-year-old teacher, and 3 men aged between 45 and
56 years. The patients include 105 doctors, nurses, and other medical
workers who were apparently infected by the disease while treating
the victims. [The age range and spread to health workers fits the
profile of mycoplasma infection commented upon above. - Mod.JW]
Huang said the patients were found in 6 cities -- Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Foshan, and Heyuan -- in the province
bordering Hong Kong and Macao. A total of 226 pneumonia patients,
including 2 deaths, were detected in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong
Province, which has more than 80 million people.
Huang told the press Tuesday there had been no new pneumonia cases
reported in Heyuan, Zhongshan, or Foshan in the past week. The number
of new patients decreased in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Jiangmen, Huang
added. He said 59 patients had recovered and left hospital and that
those still hospitalized are in stable condition.

Lab Aims to Identify Guangdong Pneumonia Virus
---------------------------------------------
A mysterious pneumonia that left five people dead and some 300
hospitalized in south China's Guangdong Province was possibly caused
by a virus, which may not be identified for two more weeks, disease
control experts said.
Currently, experts at the Beijing-based Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention are doing laboratory work in order to discover
exactly which virus caused the outbreak, Li Liming, director of the
center, told the press Thursday afternoon.
Liang Guodong, a viral disease expert with the center, said they
suspected viral pneumonia was the culprit since many patients were
doctors and nurses, who had close contact with other patients.
Liang returned from Guangdong, where he had been sent by the Ministry
of Health as a member of an investigation team.
Health experts called the illness "atypical pneumonia" because it was
not caused by pneumococcus, which leads to normal pneumonia. Atypical
pneumonia can have 17 different causes such as virus, bacteria or
mycoplasma, said Dr. Zhao Mingwu with the No. 3 Hospital of the
Medical School of Peking University.
The experts have excluded the possibility that the illness was caused
by the plague, anthrax, haemorrhage fever or leptospirosis, which had
been rumored to be causes.
Patients suffered acute symptoms including high fever, dry cough,
muscle pain and weakness when they were hospitalized. But now many
have recovered and left hospitals, Li said.
No new cases have been discovered for four successive days in
Guangdong, which neighbors Hong Kong.
"The situation is under control and is stable. It is not as serious
as the rumors say," Li said, but Li stressed that the nation's
disease control institutions remained on high alert and were keeping
a close eye on the epidemic.
Li's center also maintained good communication with health
departments in Hong Kong and Macao, where the illness has been the
top concern in recent days.
The outbreak in Guangdong has aroused concerns nationwide since
unconfirmed news and rumors were disseminated via the Internet and
short messages on mobile phones.
Panic also prompted the craze to purchase traditional herbal
medicines, vinegar and surgical masks, which people believed could
keep the illness away.
But the experts in the center clarified that there was no evidence
that herbal medicines and vinegar could effectively block the virus,
and some exaggerated news reports have caused unnecessary panic.
The center has suggested some preventative measures such as improving
ventilation in offices and homes, disinfecting the air in hospitals,
avoiding large crowds, wearing masks when in contact with patients,
keeping warm, and consulting a doctor when experiencing suspicious
symptoms.

Acute respiratory syndrome in China - WHO Update 2

The Ministry of Health, China, has reported that the outbreak in
Guangdong Province is clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia.
Cases had been detected in the province as far back as 16 Nov 2002.
The majority of the patients have experienced non-specific symptoms
including fever, headache, joint ache, and overall fatigue and
weariness. As of 11 Feb 2003, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths have

have ruled out anthrax, pulmonary plague, leptospirosis, and
haemorrhagic fever.
