Larval habitats of _Aedes aegypti_ and dengue in Yemen
---------------------------------------------------
Have the vectors responsible for the dengue infections in Hodeida -- and,
for that matter, Mecca -- been identified? In many of the posts dealing
with dengue virus outbreaks, it is reported that ground pools are being
treated or eradicated. Ground pools are not usually suitable oviposition or
larval habitats for the aedine vectors. These mosquito species normally
breed in tree-holes, leaf axils or artificial containers (e.g. abandoned
tyres). I would suggest that vector control efforts would be more gainfully
aimed at artificial containers and the leaf axils of palm trees in Hodeida.
Another apparent misunderstanding is that dengue vectors favour stagnant
pools to breed in. Nothing can be farther from the truth. These species
rely on fresh, localised rainfall to fill small receptacles to flood their
semi-desiccated eggs; the hatching stimulus is the rapid deoxygenation of
this fresh water. Mosquitoes of other genera utilise more stagnant pools
because their eggs must be in constant contact with water; small water
bodies dry up too rapidly to allow embryonic and larval development to be
completed in these mosquitoes.

[The principal vector of dengue is the cosmotropical (meaning that it
lives in warm places all over the world) mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, while
the basically Asian species _Aedes albopictus_ is also a vector or
potential vector, having spread since the 1970s to the USA and Canada,
several countries in Latin America and Europe and elsewhere, but not to Yemen.
Most larval habitats of _Ae. aegypti_ are man-made. For example, virtually
all types of water receptacles such as water barrels, discarded tin cans,
broken bottles, large water tanks and very commonly water-storage pots --
whether they be inside or outside houses -- are colonised by _Ae. aegypti_
larvae. Larvae are also found in cemetery urns and flower vases, and less
commonly in wells, but that is mainly where there are few water-storage
pots. Larvae are not found in waters polluted with urine or feces, such as
cess pits and septic tanks. They are often said to be found in clean
waters, but usually such waters contain some amount of organic matter. For
instance, in Kenya, water-storage pots where people wash their hands after
eating were the most productive breeding sites, as larval food was
plentiful in such pots.
Whether or not _Ae. aegypti_ larvae are present in stagnant waters depends
on what is meant by stagnant! If it means "still, as opposed to flowing,
water" -- then yes, this mosquito does breed in such waters. But stagnant
can also mean foul or polluted waters. It then further depends on the
definition of foul and polluted waters, because _Ae. aegypti_ can be found
in waters containing considerable detritus or organic materials such as
human food (see above), but not in waters contaminated with urine, feces,
or decomposing animal material.
Only very rarely have _Ae. aegypti_ larvae been found in ground collections
of water, but in some areas (mainly rural), larvae are commonly found in
tree-holes and more occasionally in water-filled leaf axils of plants such
as _Colocasia_ (coco-yams). Larvae have occasionally been found in atypical
habitats, such as non-chlorinated (and usually abandoned) swimming pools,
but such larval habitats will rarely produce sufficient numbers of adults
to be of any importance in dengue situations.
_Aedes albopictus_ larvae are also found in water-storage pots and
discarded tin cans, etc., but also in rain water that accumulates in tires,
either abandoned ones or those being used for retreading (remoulding). But
this species is more commonly found in water-filled tree-holes, cut bamboo
stumps and leaf axils than _Ae. aegypti_. Basically _Ae. albopictus_ is
less well-adapted to city life than _Ae. aegypti_.
_Aedes aegypti_ occurs in Yemen and in Saudi Arabia, and I think there is
little doubt this is the vector involved in any transmission of dengue in
these countries. - Mod.MS]
