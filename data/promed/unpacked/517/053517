_Brucella abortus_ Vaccine Strain RB51 Infection and Exposures Associated with Raw Milk Consumption -- Wise County, Texas, 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In July 2017, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Region 2/3 office reported a human case of brucellosis associated with the consumption of raw (unpasteurized) cow's milk purchased from a dairy in Paradise, Texas. CDC's Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch (BSPB) confirmed the isolate as _Brucella abortus_ vaccine strain RB51 (RB51).

Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects humans and many animal species. In humans, the disease is characterized by fever and nonspecific influenza-like symptoms that frequently include myalgia, arthralgia, and night sweats. Without appropriate treatment, brucellosis can become chronic, and life-threatening complications can arise. Human brucellosis transmitted by cattle was once common in the United States. Control strategies have focused on elimination of brucellosis through vaccination and surveillance of cattle herds, in addition to milk pasteurization. Because of these measures, domestically acquired human cases are now rare (1).

RB51, a live-attenuated vaccine used to prevent _B. abortus_ infection in cattle, has been documented to cause human disease, most commonly through occupational exposures such as needle sticks (2). Importantly, unlike wild strains of _B. abortus_, RB51 does not stimulate an antibody response detectable by routine serological assays, requiring culture for confirmation. Additionally, RB51 is resistant to rifampin, a common treatment choice for human brucellosis (2,3). This case represents the 1st documented instance of human brucellosis caused by RB51 through consumption of raw milk acquired in the USA.

Following isolation of RB51 from the patient's blood, bulk milk tank samples from the farm tested positive for RB51 by polymerase chain reaction and bacterial culture. Culture of individual milk samples from all 43 cows in the herd identified 2 RB51 culture-positive cows. Subsequent whole genome sequencing indicated genetic relatedness between the cow and human isolate.

In Texas, farm sales of raw milk products to the public are legal with a "Grade 'A' Raw for Retail" license, regulated by the DSHS Milk and Dairy Group. By the end of August [2017], through correspondence with the dairy, DSHS had identified approximately 800 persons who might have visited the farm during [1 Jun 2017 to 7 Aug 2017]. On [1 Sep 2017], Texas DSHS and BSPB began notification calls to these households, recommending that all exposed persons (i.e., those who consumed raw milk products from the farm during [1 Jun 2017 to 7 Aug 2017]) seek medical attention and begin 3 weeks of postexposure prophylaxis, even if asymptomatic (4).

Contact information was available for 582 households. The notification was issued successfully to 397 (68.2 percent) households. Among these notified households, 324 (81.6 percent) identified at least 1 exposed household member. Contacted persons referred 34 additional potentially exposed households, including households from 7 other states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee). A nationwide press release and Health Alert Network Health Advisory were issued in September to facilitate further identification of exposed persons (5).

To date, there are no other confirmed cases associated with this investigation. CDC and Texas DSHS continue measures to increase awareness among health care providers and the public regarding unique challenges associated with treatment and diagnosis of RB51 in humans and the risks of consuming raw milk.

[If an antibody response to RB51 does not occur and potentially infected individuals actually took chemoprophylaxis, the number of the cases might have been greater. This was the first of 2, presumably unrelated cases, of strain RB51 causing human infections related to the ingestion of unpasteurized milk, the other occurred in New Jersey and is listed in the "see alsos". This report does not even mention the NJ case.

Regarding human exposures to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine, this 2004 report outlined 26 exposures, none related to milk.

Abstract
--------
"_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse events associated with accidental exposure. As many as 9 cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens."

Regarding brucella vaccine strains in milk, this appears to be uncommon and it is not clear if human transmission of the vaccine strain has occurred from unpasteurized milk:

Abstract
--------
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the shedding of _Brucella abortus_ in the milk of cows vaccinated with a full dose of RB51 during lactation. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3 x10(exp10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. Milk samples from all animals were collected daily until day 7, and at weekly interval for the next 9 weeks after vaccination. To evaluate the shedding of _B. abortus_, milk samples were submitted for culture and PCR. No _B. abortus_ was isolated from any sample tested. Only one sample, collected on 1st day after vaccination from a cow previously vaccinated, was faintly positive in the PCR. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination."

Abstract
--------
"This paper aimed to determine the excretion period of B19 vaccine strain during a complete reproductive cycle (from estrus synchronization, artificial insemination, pregnancy and until 30 days after parturition) of dairy cows from 3 to 9-years-old that were previously vaccinated from 3 to 8 months. Three groups were monitored with monthly milk and urine collection during 12 months: G1 with 7 cows from 3 to 4-years-old; G2 with 3 cows from 5 to 6-years-old; and G3 with 4 cows from 7 to 9-years-old. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. Ring test (RT) was also performed in the milk samples, and serum samples were tested by buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA). All animals were serologically negative at BAPA and _Brucella spp._ was not isolated from both urine and milk samples. RT revealed 13/210 (6.2 percent) positive milk samples. PCR reactions detected DNA of _Brucella spp._ in 86/420 (20.5 percent) samples. In urine it was found a significantly higher frequency (35.2 percent; 74/210) than in milk (5.7 percent; 12/210), more frequently from the estrus to 150 days of pregnancy and after parturition (6.7 percent; 10/150), and from 150 days of pregnancy to parturition (3.4 percent; 2/60), and they were all identified as B19 strain. In 3 groups, intermittent excretion of B19 strain was detected mainly in urine samples, which confirmed its multiplication and persistence in cows for until 9 years." - Mod.LL
