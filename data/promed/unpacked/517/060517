An outbreak of anthrax involving 3 deaths has been reported to the
United Nations. Pero Byrs reported this disease in cattle. "In order
to eat meat, people had bought it from butchers without the necessary
health guarantees."

According to the Save the Children Fund organization, the outbreak
has resulted in the deaths of 2 children and one adult and threatened
some 60 000 head of cattle in the northern valley of the Zambezi. 32
human cases had been detected [diagnosed, under treatment?] in Binga District.

[According to the Digital Journal: "Binga is a vast, remote,
inaccessible district in northern Zimbabwe. Possibly the most hostile
of all Zimbabwe's areas, it boasts a population of about 130 000
people and has a climate to challenge most of the arid areas of the
world." <http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/1706>. So, it is to be
expected that sick and dead cattle would be harvested for meat in such an area.
