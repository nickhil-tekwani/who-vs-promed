In the past weeks health officials have become concerned over the rise in the number of reported cases of hand-foot-mouth Disease (HFMD).

The disease typically affects children under the age of 5 years; however adults and older children can be affected. The cause of the disease is attributed to the Coxsackie virus and the early symptoms include sore throat and fever that can later develop painful, blister-like lesions on the tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks and blister can also develop on the palms of hands, soles of feet, knees, elbows, buttocks, or genital areas.

Ministry of Health officials are asking the general public to take the following precautions:

If diagnosed remain at home and isolated until the fever, mouth sores and blisters have resolved.

Make sure children wash hands after wiping the face and mouth, and before and after using the toilet.

Adults are reminded to wash their hands thoroughly before and after using the toilet or changing a diaper, and before preparing food and eating.

Disinfect all common areas with soap and water as well as bleach.

And avoid kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with someone who has HFMD.

A highly contagious and painful disease has reared its ugly head in the US and shows no signs of slowing down.

States have reported an uptick in hand-foot-and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in the Midwest. The disease, which has so far gained momentum in Kansas and parts of Missouri, can cause those infected to develop painful blisters on their hands, feet and in and around their mouths.

HFMD is caused is usually caused by the coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71, but you may hear your doctor simply refer to it as the coxsackie virus.

Though anyone can contract the disease, it's most commonly found in children under the age of 10 and can spread when a person makes skin-to-skin contact with a blister or inhales droplets from an infected person's breath.

Early symptoms of the disease may include a sore throat and fever in addition to painful blisters that can look similar to cold sores and often will appear on the inside of an infected person's mouth or around the lips.

A rash can also develop on the palm of the person's hands and soles of their feet around day one or 2 after the 1st symptoms appear.

However, remembering to wash your hands can greatly reduce your risk of contracting HFMD.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

- Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness.
- Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with cases and outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease. Less often, enterovirus 71 has been associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis.
- Several types of enteroviruses may be identified in outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease, however most of the time, one or 2 enteroviruses are identified more frequently.

Health complications from hand-foot-mouth disease are not common.
- Viral or "aseptic" meningitis can occur with hand-foot-mouth disease, but it is rare. It causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain and may require the infected person to be hospitalized for a few days.
- Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or polio-like paralysis can occur, but this is even rarer.
- Fingernail and toenail loss have been reported, occurring mostly in children within a few weeks after having hand-foot-mouth disease. At this time, [it is not known] whether nail loss was a result of the disease in reported cases. However, in the reports reviewed, the nail loss was temporary, and the nail grew back without medical treatment.
