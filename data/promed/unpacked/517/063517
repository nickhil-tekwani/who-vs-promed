[1] Cholera - Haiti (Port-au-Prince)

During a telephone interview with AlterPresse, the humanitarian organization Doctors without Borders (MSF) said it has detected a new outbreak of the epidemic of cholera in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince and its surrounding area. "There has been a resurgence over the past 1 to 2 months, in particular in Port-au-Prince," said MSF's head of mission in Haiti, Olivier Schulz. "We have more patients than expected," explained Schulz, who believes that the current capacity of MSF is exceeded. On average, MSF's cholera treatment centers receive 50 persons per day, that is, in Delmas (northern periphery) or in Martissant (south sector), but on some days in these last few months the daily total has reached 100.

The Ministry of public health is "motivated and has the will," but the Schulz believes that there is currently a shortage of funding for the management of the epidemic. It called for an "increase in the coordination" of the activities of support for patients, by introducing an active and proactive warning system, able to allow managers to respond more rapidly to outbreaks.

From October 2010 to October 2014, 8621 people died of cholera in Haiti. For this same period, 708 425 cases of cholera have been identified across the country, with 397 637 hospitalized. With a case fatality rate overall of 1.2 percent, Haiti remains the country most affected country by cholera in the world.

[2] Cholera - Haiti (Port-au-Prince) prison vaccination program
Date: Sun 16 Nov 2014

Following a dramatic increase in cases of cholera, after a particularly active rainy season (2000 cases recorded in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince between mid-August and mid-October 2014), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in collaboration with the Haitian authorities, including the Ministry of Justice has launched a vaccination campaign to curb the spread of cholera in the country's prisons.

ICRC efforts thus complement the national immunization program of 2014 (http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-12338-haiti-cholera-success-of-the-second-vaccination-campaign.html) launched by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, with the support of the WHO and its Regional Office for the Americas.

"This is the 1st time that such an operation targets the prison population," explained Agathe Stricker, head of the ICRC delegation in Haiti. "Cholera outbreaks are recurrent in Haitian prisons since the disease appeared on the island in October 2010 (http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-1701-haiti-epidemic-in-prison-cholera-kill-guilty-and-innocent.html). We took the opportunity to extend the national campaign to prisons." In all, some 5800 prisoners should be immunized against cholera in 16 prisons in the country, which will help to reduce the risk of contagion in detention centers, where access to health care is often very limited.

This vaccination campaign will last approximately 2 weeks.

The vaccine used, Shanchol (produced in India) contains killed different biotypes of bacilli of both _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 and O139 serotypes. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study revealed a cumulative efficacy of the product at 5 years of 65 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 52-74) with significant protection at the p less than 0.0001 level (1). The other WHO prequalified vaccine, Dukoral, produced in Sweden, contained several biotypes of O1 only together with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit.

As a review, the cholera toxin, encoded by the ctxA and ctxB genes, is the principal toxin produced by _V. cholerae_ O1 and O139 and is responsible for the disease. The genes are encoded with a filamentous bacteriophage. The toxin has many immunological properties that include impressive adjuvant properties and action as an anti-inflammatory agent. Each toxin molecule contains a catalytic A subunit (the active toxin) and 5 B subunits that bind the holotoxin to its ganglioside GM1 receptor. After internalization, a subunit of A, A1, will catalyze the ribosylation of a GTP-binding protein which increases the activation of adenyl cyclase and a chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) which produces increased chloride secretion, intestinal water accumulation and diarrhea. It is mutations in CFTR that produces cystic fibrosis, a disease that affects a number of organs related to difficulties in fluid secretion (2).

[3] Cholera - Nigeria

The number of cases from the ongoing outbreak of cholera in Nigeria climbed to 34 008 as of 12 Oct 2014, the National Travel Health Network and Centre reported on Wed 5 Nov 2014. Since the outbreak began in May 2013, 664 cholera-related fatalities have been reported.

Cholera is spread through contaminated water or food as a result of poor sanitation, meaning areas with weaker sanitation systems are more likely to see cases. Person-to-person transmission of cholera is rare.

Cases have been reported in 19 states, including Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Plateau, and Zamfara.

Two persons died and over 300 were taken ill after drinking contaminated water from a government overhead tank. The taluka [administrative division] Chhota Udepur district in Gujarat, has been declared cholera hit after tests showed strains of the disease. A 28 year old and a 35 year old died on [12 Nov 2014]. People started complaining of diarrhea, vomiting, and headache since 7.30 pm Tuesday evening [11 Nov 2014], and as reports came in nearly 352 had taken ill. Of these, 40 are at the referral hospital and 30 have been taken to Vadodara. There was panic after rumors that a monkey had died in the overhead tank that was supplying water to the town. Regional deputy director, health, Dr PB Itare told The Indian Express, "This is a cholera outbreak. The monkey bit is not true. The contamination has happened during transmission via pipeline." Tankers have been deployed to provide drinking water as an interim arrangement.
