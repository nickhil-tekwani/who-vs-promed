The Honduran Health Ministry has registered 6,016 cases of common dengue
and 47 cases of the hemorrhagic dengue since the beginning of the year, a
department spokesman said Friday.
There were 1,906 [50% more cases of common dengue, which is transmitted by
mosquitoes, in the first six months of 1999 than in the same period in
1998, the source said. The incidence of dengue as well as of other
vector-borne diseases mushroomed in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, when
stagnant and contaminated flood waters became ideal breeding grounds for
dengue, malaria, cholera and other illnesses. The normal rainy season has
helped make the situation even more precarious.
Of the 47 reported cases of hemorrhagic dengue, which can be fatal, 25 were
registered in Tegucigalpa, Health Ministry spokesmen said.
