Vancouver Coastal Health [VCH] is warning customers not to consume any produce or ready-to-eat foods made in-house at Foody World, at 3000 Sexsmith Road in Richmond, due to possible listeria contamination. So far at least 6 people have been hospitalized due to the illness.

Potentially contaminated items include all ready-to-eat meat products such as BBQ pork and marinated meats, sushi, produce, and baked goods purchased since July 2016. If you have any produce, ready-to-eat or raw food items from Foody World, please dispose of them immediately.

Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and muscle aches. Listeriosis can also cause serious illness such as meningitis or blood infections in pregnant women and newborns, those with weakened immune systems and older adults or seniors. Symptoms typically start within 4 weeks after consuming, but can appear up to 10 weeks later.

If you think you have an infection caused by listeria, see a doctor for testing, advice and treatment. VCH Public Health will follow-up with any patients whose lab results are positive for listeria. Most healthy people require no treatment, however, those at higher risk of serious illness can be treated with antibiotics.

VCH public health inspectors have closed the store and kitchen. The store will be reopened once it meets all health and safety standards.

For more information about the food recall, members of the public can call Vancouver Coastal Health - Health Protection at 604-233-3147 and ask to speak to a senior environmental health officer. Further information is available at the following websites:

[The news report above fails to identify any specific food product, bought at Foody World, that is suspected to be contaminated by _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Foody World is an Asian supermarket (http://www.chowhound.com/post/foodyworld-richmond-omg-1034656) located in Richmond, a coastal city that is part of the Metro Vancouver area in the Canadian province of British Columbia; Richmond has an immigrant population of 60 per cent, the highest in Canada, with over 50 per cent of residents identifying as Chinese (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_British_Columbia#Demographics).
