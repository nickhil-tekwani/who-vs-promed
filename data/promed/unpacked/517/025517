A total of 177 chickens in Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh have tested positive for H5N1 strain of avian influenza, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.

The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the chickens were in Phong Thanh commune, Cau Ke district.

Tra Vinh People's Committee has instructed all relevant agencies to step up prevention measures including vaccinating livestock and poultry against flu strains, sterilizing farms and abattoirs and alerting residents about the outbreak.

Agencies have been told to set up checkpoints along waterways and roads traversing flu-hit communes, and localities near other provinces such as Cang Long, Cau Quan, Thong Hoa, and Dinh An.

Quarantine staff members have been dispatched to markets, wharfs, and bus stations to monitor livestock and fowl trade and transport.

In the 1st quarter of this year [2014], Tra Vinh recorded 25 cases of avian influenza in 12 communes which killed 16 500 chickens.

[Last avian influenza season (October 2013 - March 2014) Viet Nam suffered a recurrent HPAI H5N1 epizootic, caused by virus clade 2.3.2.1. The strain 2.3.2.1C was, reportedly, of the highest pathogenicity. This epizootic involved a total of 39 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 11 Apr 2014. Genotyping of the current virus strain will be of interest.

In April 2014, a new strain, HPAI H5N6, was identified in Viet Nam for the 1st time. It caused 7 outbreaks and was declared resolved on 6 Oct 2014; all reports and an interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15802.

Since 2003, 127 human cases of avian influenza have been reported from Viet Nam, including 64 deaths (2 of them in 2014). The disease peaked in the 2 years 2004/2005 (90 cases, 39 deaths). Since then, control and prevention efforts of the animal health authorities were intensified, including vaccinations of poultry.- Mod.AS
