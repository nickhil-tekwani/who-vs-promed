PARALYSIS (? TOXIC) - SCOTLAND (4)
==================================
[This posting combines two messages received this
week from the originator of the query. - Mod.]

Thanks to respondents who have commented on the case in reply to
my request for information (RFI) on pelagic paralysis, and for
the message from SCIEH ["Paralysis (?toxic) - Scotland (3)",
promed archive.960116].
I did talk to Dr. Cowden at SCIEH after I sent out the RFI
and we had a nice little discussion (both by e-mail and phone).
There have been no recent cases of pelagic paralysis reported
to SCIEH from Scotland but of course there is probably
reporting bias.

Although clinically my case does not fit classic ciguatera poisoning,
paralytic shellfish poisoning or domoic acid poisoning, the temporal
relationship suggests a neurotoxin related to mussel ingestion.
I did find a reference to paralytic shellfish poisoning occurring in
Leith (Scotland) in 1793 (reference: Lancet 1988; Mills et al).
[And additional suggestions are welcome.]
Thanks again.
