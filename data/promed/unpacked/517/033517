New Caledonia: Dengue Fever Outbreak Claims 8 Lives
-------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of dengue fever in the French Pacific territory of New
Caledonia has now claimed 8 lives. The spread of the mosquito-borne
disease accelerated after Cyclone Erica hit New Caledonia in
mid-March 2003.
New Caledonia's RFO television service reports that 2 adults died in
the intensive care unit of Noumea's Gaston Bourret Hospital at the
weekend, from a dengue fever virus type 1 infection. 3 children are
among earlier deaths from the dengue outbreak, which began in January
2003.
RFO reports that the latest health statistics indicate that more than
1200 people in New Caledonia are suffering from dengue fever, which
spread rapidly after Cyclone Erica dumped torrential rain on the main
island and left behind tonnes of rotting vegetation.

Northern Region
---------------
Roraima state has the most cases, 373, with no cases of DHF. Acre
state is second with 279 reported cases. Amapa state has 217,
Rondonia state 216 (including 1 case of DHF), Amazonas state 154,
Tocantins state 56, and Para state 28. In 2002, the Northern region
registered 27 931 cases out of the national total of 780 645.
Bahia state (Itabuna)
--------------------
Approximately 2000 cases of dengue have occurred in the city of
Itabuna in the last 2 months. In the last 2 weeks, there have been 30
percent more cases than during the same period last month, March 2003.
Ceara state
-----------
According to the Epidemiological Bulletin of the state health
department, Ceara has had 11 805 suspected cases of dengue, with 1018
confirmed. The large difference is due to a laboratory backlog [not
surprising under the circumstances. - Mod.JW]. There have been 118
cases of DHF, with 52 confirmed and 4 deaths, with 9 other deaths
pending confirmation. In the whole of 2002, 14 612 cases were
reported.
Sao Paulo state (Aracatuba)
---------------------------
Public health authorities estimate that the 2265 cases of dengue
reported in the city of Aracatuba since the beginning of 2003
represent only 60 percent of all cases in the city -- the balance of
40 percent (1500 cases) did not come to the public health services
and so were lost to official statistics. So the true count of dengue
cases for the city is close to 3700 cases.
Tocantins state
---------------
In a little more than one week, the state capital, Palmas, has
recorded 3 cases of DHF. The most recent, an adult female, was
discharged from hospital on 22 Apr 2003.
In 2003, including partial numbers from this month (April), 1525
cases of dengue have been notified state-wide. The cities with the
most cases are Palmas (367), Araguaina (361), and Araguatins (111).
Gurupi, the third largest city in the state, has 63.

Guatemala: Dengue Fever Cases Expected to Increase in Third Week of May
---------------------------------------------------
In Guatemala, during the first trimester of 2003, the number of cases
of dengue fever increased by 30 percent, as compared to the same
period in 2002. According to government officials, one of the causes
is the instability of the weather. The current situation adds to the
already existing increase shown by the disease since 2001.
According to data from the Ministry of Health, as of 22 Mar 2003, 454
cases of suspected dengue were registered, 35 of which were
confirmed. They include one case of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]
and one death. During the same period in 2002, 319 clinical cases
were reported, 35 cases were confirmed, and no cases of DHF or deaths
were registered.
Julio Castro, Director of the Ministry of Health's Vector Department,
said that some of the causes of the increase in the number of cases
are the high temperatures (2 degrees higher than normal) and the
rains affecting the whole country. Castro explained that high
temperatures favor the reproduction of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito,
and rain contributes to the collection of stagnant water, which
provides the appropriate breeding environment.
The Ministry of Health has determined that dengue fever has become a
latent threat, particularly in the capital [La Paz], and the
localities of Escuintla, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa, Jutiapa, Jalapa,
Chiquimula, Izabal, Suchitepequez, Quiche, Peten, and El Progreso.
Castro announced that this year, 50 percent of the cases reported by
the state of Quiche occurred in the municipality of Joyabai alone.
However, he did not provide the total number of cases registered in
the state but indicated that during the last week in March 2003,
there were 12 confirmed cases in that locality.
