South Dakota deer hunters beware: epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has been confirmed in 17 counties with another 21 counties reporting nearly 1200 dead white-tailed deer most likely infected by the same disease. This is troubling news and greatly impacts not only this year's [2016] season, but possibly future seasons, too.

According to The Capital Journal, due to the level of the outbreak, South Dakota Game, Fish, & Parks (SDGFP) officials will not distribute any leftover antlerless tags for 11 East River hunting units. Any hunter with a license for any of the East River hunting units or Units 45A and 45B in Lyman County can turn in unused tags for a full refund and reinstatement of preference points.

"These actions are intended to lessen the impact on deer populations in hunting units where management objectives are to maintain or increase deer populations," says Chad Switzer, wildlife program administrator.

EHD is caused by a biting midge and spreads quickly, often killing an infected deer within days. According to Andy Lindbloom, a senior SDGFP big game biologist, the disease seems to be running rampant primarily in the central and southeastern portions of the state and "seems to affect white-tailed deer far more than mule deer." Lindbloom adds that a hard freeze will likely slow EHD's reach, but not eliminate it completely.

While EHD hasn't been confirmed to harm humans, it's recommended that you don't eat the meat from a diseased animal.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: Orbivirus), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases BT viruses from infected deer were 1st reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. - Mod.PMB
