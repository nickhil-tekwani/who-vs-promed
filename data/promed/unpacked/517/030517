[1] Breath test

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to the 1st COVID-19 test that can detect the virus in breath samples, the agency announced on Thursday [14 Apr 2022].

Dubbed the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer, the test uses gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to rapidly detect volatile organic compounds associated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients breathe into a disposable straw on the device -- which is about the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, according to the agency -- and results are returned in less than 3 minutes. The test is intended for healthcare settings where samples can be collected and analyzed, such as mobile testing sites, doctor's offices, and hospitals.

"Today's authorization is yet another example of the rapid innovation occurring with diagnostic tests for COVID-19," said Jeff Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement. "The FDA continues to support the development of novel COVID-19 tests with the goal of advancing technologies that can help address the current pandemic and better position the United States for the next public health emergency."

In its news release, the FDA noted that positive test results with the breathalyzer should be considered presumptive and confirmed with a molecular test. "Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as they do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions," the agency said.

Primary support for the EUA came from a study of 2409 individuals with and without symptoms, conducted in 4 US states. The breathalyzer test was found to have a sensitivity of 91.2% (90% CI 85.4-94.8) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI 98.8-99.5) when compared with a PCR test. This yielded a negative predictive value of 99.6%, the agency noted, "meaning that people who receive a negative test result are likely truly negative in areas of low disease prevalence."

A follow-up trial of 12 symptomatic individuals in Texas, conducted in February [2022] when omicron accounted for nearly all cases there, showed a similar sensitivity of 90.9% (90% CI 67.7-98.0).

The company expects to produce 100 units each week, with each unit estimated to be able to analyze 160 samples each day, according to the FDA.

Also, from The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/health/covid-breath-test-fda.html): "...But breath tests still pose real-world challenges, and this particular device has several practical limitations, scientists said. The machine required to conduct the tests is large -- about the size of a carry-on suitcase -- and can only be used by trained operators supervised by healthcare professionals.

"And many devices would be needed for wide-scale screening, given that each machine can process only about 20 samples an hour, according to InspectIR Systems, a small, 5-person company based in Frisco, Texas.

"The company cited high accuracy rates for its tests, but some experts said they wanted to examine the data underlying its application to the FDA before endorsing this test method.

"In addition, many healthcare settings and mobile test sites where the devices may be used have already adopted other kinds of rapid tests, which are now widely available. InspectIR's officials said that final pricing plans had not yet been set." - Mod.LK]

[2] Children: upper airway infections
Date: Fri 15 Apr 2022

Rates of upper airway infections (UAIs) such as croup and bacterial tracheitis among pediatric COVID-19 patients, though low, rose after the omicron variant became dominant in December 2021, with more than one-fifth of hospitalized children with both conditions developing severe illness, estimates a study today [15 Apr 2022] in JAMA Pediatrics (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2791278).

The University of Colorado-led US National COVID Cohort Collaborative analyzed its data and those from a National Institutes of Health-funded pediatric COVID-19 dashboard on 18 849 hospitalized COVID-19 patients 18 years and younger from 1 Mar 2020 to 25 Dec 2021 (before the emergence of omicron) and after (26 Dec 2021 to 17 Feb 2022).

Of the 18 849 children, 384 (2.0%) had UAIs, and 81 (21%) required invasive ventilation, the use of vasopressor drugs to raise blood pressure or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or died. Rates of UAIs in COVID-positive children rose from 1.5% to 4.1% after the emergence of omicron, with 178 of 384 cases (46%) diagnosed during that time.

Pediatric patients with UAIs during omicron were more likely than those diagnosed in the preceding delta period to be younger and Hispanic and less likely to be given the corticosteroid dexamethasone or to become severely ill. The proportion of children with a complex chronic condition weren't significantly different during the 2 periods, at 36% (74 of 206) before omicron and 22% (39 of 178) after.

While noncoronaviruses such as parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus most often cause UAI, coronaviruses are also commonly implicated, the study authors said. "Young children are especially vulnerable to UAI given their small and relatively collapsible airways," they wrote.

The researchers said that the study likely underestimated the concurrent COVID-19 and UAI cases amid omicron because diagnostic codes for these conditions were available only for completed hospitalizations, meaning that children still hospitalized during the study period were not represented.

While the rate of coexisting COVID-19 and UAI in children wasn't strikingly high, the researchers said that severe UAI predisposes children to cardiac arrest from rapid-onset upper-airway obstruction. "They may require therapies typically provided in intensive care units, including frequent administration of nebulized racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen mixtures, and intubation," they wrote.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
----------
"SARS-CoV-2-positive pediatric UAI rates increased during the omicron surge. More than one-fifth of children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 and UAI developed severe disease. Given the high proportion of UAI cases during the omicron period, these results appear to support recent mechanistic reports. A limitation of this analysis is that diagnosis codes will only be present for completed encounters; as such, children who are still hospitalized are not represented, and the frequency of severe disease observed in the omicron period may be an underestimate.

"Children with severe UAI are at risk of cardiac arrest from rapid-onset upper airway obstruction. They may require therapies typically provided in intensive care units, including frequent administration of nebulized racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen mixtures, and intubation. While the rate of SARS-CoV-2 pediatric UAI is not overwhelmingly high, understanding this new clinical phenotype and the potential for acute upper airway obstruction may help guide therapeutic decision-making." - Mod.LK]

[3] Psychiatric disorders and infection after vaccination

A history of certain psychiatric disorders may predispose fully vaccinated COVID-19 survivors to reinfection, according to a study of 263 697 US veterans published yesterday [14 Apr 2022] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791033).

Researchers from the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System and the University of California retrospectively analyzed the administrative and electronic health records of US veterans who completed their COVID-19 vaccine primary series at least 14 days earlier from 20 Feb 2020 to 16 Nov 2021. Patients had received the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Average age was 66.2 years, 90.8% were men, 70.1% were White, 20.5% were Black, 8.3% were Hispanic, 9.3% were of other or unknown race, 51.4% had one or more psychiatric diagnoses, and 14.8% were reinfected.

Psychiatric disorders included depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, adjustment disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dissociation, and eating disorders within the past 5 years. Psychiatric disorders were more common in patients younger than 65 than in their older peers (65.6% vs 43.0%).

A history of any psychiatric disorder was tied to a 7% higher incidence of COVID-19 reinfection in models adjusted for potential confounders and to a 4% increased incidence in models further adjusted for underlying illnesses and smoking.

In fully adjusted models, most psychiatric disorders were linked to an increased incidence of reinfection, with the highest risk for substance use disorders (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.16) and for adjustment disorder (aRR, 1.13).

The risk of COVID-19 reinfection was 24% higher for patients 65 and older with substance abuse, 23% higher for those with psychotic disorders, 16% for bipolar disorder, 14% for adjustment disorder, and 12% for anxiety.

Patients with chronic kidney disease had an increased risk for reinfection of 23%, compared with 20% for HIV, 19% for cardiovascular disease, 18% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 13% for sleep apnea.

This indicates that older patients with certain psychiatric conditions face risks on par with those of other medical conditions, senior author Aoife O'Donovan, PhD, of the San Francisco VA, said in a University of California at San Francisco news release. "Mental health is important to consider in conjunction with other risk factors," she said.

Stratification of the sample at age 65 revealed that associations between psychiatric diagnoses and COVID-19 reinfection were seen in both age-groups: 15.9% in those younger than 65 vs 14.2% in older patients. The associations were strongest in older patients after adjustment for chronic conditions and smoking.

Fully adjusted models, however, showed that younger people with psychiatric disorders had a 10% lower incidence of COVID-19 reinfection than those without such a diagnosis.

Also, all disorders except bipolar and psychotic disorders in younger patients were tied to increased incidence of reinfection when adjusted for potential confounders, but associations were no longer seen for depression, posttraumatic stress, and alcohol use disorders when also adjusting for underlying illnesses, obesity, and smoking.

O'Donovan said that the lower risk of reinfection among younger versus older people could be due to lower socialization among younger people with psychotic disorders compared with older people who "may be less socially isolated because of their greater burden of ill health and contacts with caregivers."

Fully adjusted models among older patients showed that any psychiatric disorder (aRR, 1.05) and all disorders except posttraumatic stress and alcohol use disorder remained linked to an increased incidence of COVID-19 reinfection.

Psychotic disorders were tied to a lower incidence of reinfection among younger patients (aRR, 0.90) but a higher incidence in the older group (aRR, 1.23), although only 2.8% of the sample had a psychotic disorder (3.6% among younger patients and 2.3% in the older group).

Before vaccines were widely available, people with psychiatric disorders were at elevated risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death, the researchers noted. And COVID-19 reinfections among the fully vaccinated are relatively common today owing to waning vaccine-generated immunity, incomplete vaccination coverage, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can escape immunity, they added.

Risk factors for COVID-19 infection among people with psychiatric disorders include impaired immune function, poor response to vaccines, more risky behaviors that may lead to viral transmission, and high rates of underlying medical conditions such as COPD, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, as well as health-compromising behaviors such as smoking, the authors said.

"It's possible that immunity following vaccination wanes more quickly or more strongly for people with psychiatric disorders and/or they could have less protection to newer variants," O'Donovan said.

The authors said that the increased reinfection incidence among people with psychiatric disorders was not completely explained by sociodemographic factors, vaccine type or timing, chronic conditions, obesity, or smoking. "Psychiatric conditions may be a risk factor for an increased incidence of breakthrough infection independent of these other factors," the researchers wrote.

"Our findings indicate that individuals with psychiatric disorders...should be prioritized for booster vaccinations and other critical preventive efforts, including increased SARS-CoV-2 screening, public health campaigns, or COVID-19 discussions during clinical care."

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries, including France (125 394), South Korea (107 882), Germany (88 188), Viet Nam (73 934), Italy (62 290), Japan (56 316), Australia (44 516), USA (42 803), UK (32 522), Thailand (18 892), Brazil (13 278), and Russia (11 432), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2362 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Apr 2022 to late 14 Apr 2022).

A total of 32 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 19 of the 32 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 1 is from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South-East Asia region, and none is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 24.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 17.9% increase in daily reported cases and a 0.43% increase in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases (although the USA has shown an increasing trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report registered over 737 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 503.79 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.22 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
