The Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency has warned people of the state to take measures to protect themselves against Lassa fever, as the disease recently killed a medical doctor. It was gathered that the doctor became infected after he treated a patient with Lassa fever virus.

Executive chairman of the agency, Dr Nisser Ali Umar, while briefing newsmen yesterday as part of the sensitization exercise embarked upon to educate citizens on the dangers of the disease, said: "The disease is deadly and infectious. Recently, a medical doctor got infected by the disease after treating a patient who had the fever. The doctor died, and about 8 other doctors got infected after treating a pregnant woman who had the disease." Umar said the state recorded 7 cases of Lassa fever between 2012 and March 2013, but with only a single death.

He said the federal and state governments have taken adequate steps to address the problem. "People can easily contract the disease by eating rat [meat] or eating food contaminated by rat urine," he said. He advised people with suspected cases to report to the nearest hospital for treatment. He commended the Federal Ministry of Health for providing Ribavirin tablets and enough personal protective equipment to health care providers in the state to prevent nosocomial infection.

Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa fever virus, a member of the family _Arenaviridae_. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in the hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential. - Mod.CP]
