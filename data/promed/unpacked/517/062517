PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING - NEW ZEALAND

A Maori environmentalist is worried the long weekend will result in
more victims of a potentially fatal shellfish toxin.
Emma Gibbs said a warning that Bay of Islands shellfish should not be
consumed may have come too late for the influx of people onto
Northland marae over Queen's Birthday Weekend. The long weekend [is]
a popular time for events such as unveilings.
Levels of the Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxin have risen
above the Ministry of Health's safe limit, prompting a Bay of Islands
shellfish-gathering ban on Thursday. Ms Gibbs said a young girl had
last week become ill after eating shellfish, and she feared people
who had not known about the ban would be struck down after the
weekend.
Some marae may have hosted functions over the weekend and could have
collected shellfish earlier, holding it in storage. It is the second
time since April 2003 that a ban has been placed on Bay of Islands
shellfish. Northland Health had issued a warning on 14 Apr 2003,
after the PSP toxin had been found at more than 3 times the safe
health limit.
The toxin, which can cause paralysis and death, was attributed to a
PSP-producing phytoplankton. The first warning was lifted on 2 May
2003. Health officials believed the latest PSP levels were probably
due to the toxic algae _Alexandrium tamarense_.
Signs and symptoms of poisoning include numbness and tingling around
the mouth, face, or extremities; difficulty swallowing and breathing;
dizziness; double vision and paralysis.
Kina, mussels, toheroa, pipi, tuatua, oysters, and cockles in
affected areas should not be eaten. Paua, crab, and crayfish may
still be eaten if the gut has been completely removed prior to
cooking. Fish, such as snapper, gurnard, and terakihi are not
affected by the algae and are still safe to eat.

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the effect
the toxin has, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), because it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
on both the east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be below the
water surface where they are not visible. Low-density populations can
cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced.
Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine
waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient
inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs.
Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is
discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness
and may last for several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.
Petersburg, FL.
