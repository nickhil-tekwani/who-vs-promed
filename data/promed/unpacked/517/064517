As many as 189 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Assam's Dibrugarh, out of which 14 people have died.

"A total of 189 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) [have been] reported in Dibrugarh since January [2019]. Of these, 5 of them died from Japanese encephalitis (JE) and 9 from AES," said Dr. Navjyoti Gogoi, Health Coordinator Officer, Dibrugarh.

[The highest] number of AES cases have been reported from Bihar, and the death toll due to AES mounted to 142 in Muzaffarpur district on Monday [8 Jul 2019].

While talking about JE cases, VK Prasad, Medical Superintendent ANMMC, Gaya said, "Out of 13 suspected cases, 3 patients are in a critical condition, [and] one patient has been found JE positive. There have been 6 deaths so far."

AES is a viral disease that causes flulike symptoms such as high fever, vomiting and, in extreme cases, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of heart and kidney.

Meanwhile, JE is a vector-borne encephalitis transmitted by _Culex_ groups of mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed mainly in rice fields and large water bodies rich in aquatic vegetations. Migratory birds along with pigs in the community play an important role in the transmission of JE [virus] from one area to another area.

[The picture of the etiology of the encephalitis cases in Assam is confusing. Apparently, the 189 encephalitis cases are attributed to a combination of AES of unspecified etiology other than an unidentified virus and JE virus. Of the 14 deaths mentioned above, 5 are due to JE virus infections and 9 from AES. Previous recent reports from Assam in June and July 2019 attribute all the encephalitis cases to JE, without mentioning AES (see archived posts below). It would be of interest to know which virus or viruses are responsible for the current Assam AES cases. Lychee fruit consumption is the suspected cause of the AES cases in Bihar, mentioned above.

The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY
