[1] Japan 2018: Measles, rubella and syphilis
Date: Sat 12 Jan 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-2018-measles-rubella-syphilis-47732/


In 2018, Japanese health officials battled 3 infectious disease outbreaks of note -- the vaccine-preventable diseases of measles and rubella and the sexually transmitted infection, syphilis.

Measles
--------
While Japan saw 282 measles cases total, an outbreak in Okinawa that started in March 2018 accounted for more than one-third of the total annual cases (101). The outbreak began on 20 Mar 2018 and has been linked to an imported case from Taiwan. It had spread to Aichi and Kanagawa prefectures and Tokyo. The Okinawa outbreak was declared over in June 2018.

Japan has successfully eliminated endemic measles transmission and sustained this status since March 2015 through both high vaccination coverage and rapid detection of and response to every case of measles.

Rubella
--------
Due to health regulations in place from 1977 to 1995, which required that only junior high school girls be vaccinated for rubella, making men who are now between the ages of 30 and 60 years vulnerable to infection, Japan saw a significant outbreak in 2018, particularly in men in this age-group. Through 30 Dec 2018, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo reported 2917 rubella, or German measles, cases. Tokyo saw 945 cases, followed by Kanagawa (402) and Chiba (383) prefectures.

Syphilis
--------
Japan saw a dramatic syphilis outbreak in 2018. With nearly 7000 cases reported as of 30 Dec 2018 (6923), this is the most cases reported in the country in decades. A total of 1759 cases were reported in Tokyo, and Osaka saw 1186 cases in 2018. This was an increase on 2017's numbers, 5534 syphilis cases, the 1st time that happened in more than 4 decades.

A total of 9 people in Daegu have been diagnosed with measles as of Thursday [10 Jan 2019], the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said Friday [11 Jan 2019]. To prevent the disease from spreading nationwide, the government plans to carry out an epidemiological investigation while urging people to get vaccinated against measles.

According to the KCDC, the 1st patient was diagnosed with measles on 17 Dec 2018 in Daegu. The disease soon spread among infants, young children and healthcare workers.

Of the 9 patients, 5 have been released from the hospital, with the remaining 4 in isolation. The health authorities in Daegu have been conducting an epidemiological investigation and tracing people who had contact with the patients.

As infants and young children are especially susceptible to infection, the government urged vaccination of children. Infants should receive their 1st MMR vaccine at between 12 months and 15 months of age with the 2nd vaccination at between the ages 4 and 6 years.

People who travel China, Thailand, the Philippines and countries in Europe should check whether they received the 2 MMR vaccinations, as measles has been spreading in those places recently. If not, the travelers should get the 2 vaccinations 4 to 6 weeks before their departure. Infants 6 to 11 months of age should get the MMR vaccine if visiting those countries.

A total of 2 imported cases of measles have been confirmed in Taiwan, the 1st in the country this year [2019], the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Wednesday [16 Jan 2019]. The 2 people tested positive for measles [16 Jan 2019] after returning from trips to Vietnam and the Philippines, respectively, the CDC said in a statement.

The 2 men, both from northern Taiwan, started experiencing symptoms of measles on 7 Jan and 8 Jan 2019, respectively, and broke out in a rash on 11 Jan 2019, the CDC said. As of press time [16 Jan 2019], one man was at home resting, while the other was still undergoing treatment at a hospital, the CDC said.

In an interview Wednesday [16 Jan 2019], CDC Deputy Director General Lo Yi-chun said one of the men had contact with 118 people, some of whom were at his company's year-end banquet at a restaurant in Zhongli District in Taoyuan on 12 Jan 2019. The people who sat near the man at the banquet will be monitored for any signs of measles, Lo said. The other man, meanwhile, had contact with 216 people, who will also be monitored until 2 Feb 2019, when the incubation period for the measles virus would have passed, Lo said. According to the CDC, some of the places the 2 infected men visited over the past week [can be seen in the report at the source URL above.]

According to CDC data, the 2 cases of measles were the 1st reported in Taiwan this year [2019]. Between 2015 and 2019, there were 91 confirmed cases of measles in Taiwan, 33 of which were contracted abroad, CDC data showed.

Patients infected with measles are being treated in Saigon's Hospital for Tropical Diseases on 14 Jan 2018. One Saigon hospital is treating 60 to 70 measles patients a day, 50 times higher, year-on-year.

The number of measles patients admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Saigon, one of the city's top public hospitals, has been rapidly increasing within the past 3 months, said Huynh Thi Thuy Hoa, head of the hospital's General Medicine Department A. From October to December 2018, the number of measles hospitalizations increased from 76 to 270 cases, she added. "The hospital is currently treating 65 measles cases, in which over half are children and pregnant women. The current number of measles patients doubled from last month's [December 2018] and is 50 times higher compared to January last year [2018]," said Hoa.

The high number of patients has overloaded the department, which has only 55 beds for in-patients, she added. She said she expected even more measles patients in the coming days and weeks, and the hospital has therefore devised plans to increase the number of beds, relocating children and adult patients to separate areas for better treatment.

Children vaccinated at 9 months need to be re-vaccinated 9 months later to reinforce their immunity against measles, Hoa said. In 2014, a measles epidemic broke out in Hanoi with a record-breaking 1700 cases, of which 14 people died.

In Viet Nam, measles outbreaks are frequent, especially in colder months. In 2016, Viet Nam became the 4th country in Asia after Japan, India and China to successfully produce a measles-rubella vaccine on its own.

Source: Disease Outbreak News [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2019-measles-madagascar/en/


WHO is supporting the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar to respond to an unusually large measles outbreak. Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 Oct 2018 to 7 Jan 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 "facility-based" deaths (case fatality ratio, 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM positive) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked case.

The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo-Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants) and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants) in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared with the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants.

In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under 5 years at 35%, 5 to 9 years at 22% and 10 to 14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged 9 months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under 5 years of age (47%) in the African region, which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection.

The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries, and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe.

The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country -- which reoccurs seasonally -- straining the public health response.

Public health response
--------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public health response measures include:
- Enhancement of active surveillance (active case finding, community-based surveillance, distribution of specimen collection kits) in all affected districts.
- Use of the Global Measles Programmatic Risk Assessment Tool to target priority districts for vaccination.

Completion of targeted vaccination campaigns:
- Campaign conducted from 22 Oct to 9 Nov 2018 in 4 districts of Antanavarivo city. The campaign targeted at least 95% of children aged between 9 and 59 months. Preliminary results show coverage of 84% of the targeted population.
- Campaign planned from 14 to 18 Jan 2019 targeting 2 083 734 children aged between 9 months and 9 years in 25 districts across 13 regions.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------------
Low coverage with measles vaccine, combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar, has contributed to a significant proportion of the population who are susceptible to measles.

According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor, as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection.

WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection.

The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low.

An outbreak of the measles has prompted the Georgian government to draft a provisional response to containing the disease. The vaccination will be free of charge for all citizens of Georgia starting from this evening [18 Jan 2019], Georgian Health Minister David Sergeenko said.

Director of National Centre for Disease Control Amiran Gamkrelidze has called on the public to ensure they are vaccinated to avoid contracting the disease. "From the beginning of January [2019], 312 cases of the disease have been identified," Agenda.ge cited Gamkrelidze as saying. He urged the population to get vaccinated in order to prevent the number of cases of measles from growing further.

Kakheti and Imereti have been the most affected by the outbreak, although measles has also been reported in Zugdidi and Adjara.

Following the arrival of several travelers who had been infected with measles outside the area, Reunion Island currently faces a risk of an epidemic outbreak in the south of the island. A total of 6 cases of measles have been diagnosed in people who have not traveled, and given the extreme contagiousness of this disease it is feared that many cases will occur in the coming days. Therefore, the Indian Ocean Health Agency calls for strong vigilance because measles is a highly contagious infectious disease in the absence of vaccination. All those who have not already contracted the disease in their childhood are advised to check and update if necessary their vaccination with their doctor.

Diners who visited a restaurant at one of Melbourne's most famous nightclubs, as well as an inner-city public pool, last week may have been exposed to measles, health authorities have warned. A man in his 20s has been diagnosed with the infectious disease, after spending 2 hours at Colonel Tan's restaurant at Revolver Upstairs in Prahran on Thu 10 Jan 2019.

This warning follows an earlier case this week in which another young man, also in his 20s, was diagnosed with measles after spending a number of long days at Box Hill Hospital last week. It is believed that both people came into contact with someone who had caught measles while travelling in southeast Asia.

"It's not home grown," said health department spokesman Bram Alexander. The new cases are among string of measles infections diagnosed in Melbourne and Sydney over the past year, and health authorities say they highlight the importance of receiving a measles vaccine before travelling overseas.

While the vast majority of Australian children are now immune from measles through a vaccine they receive at 12 months and 18 months, some people born between 1966 and 1994 may not have received full immunisation coverage, or immunity through exposure in childhood. "This means if you are an adult born during or after 1966, especially if you are planning travel overseas, you may be susceptible and should contact your GP to get vaccinated," said Victoria's acting chief health officer Dr. Brett Sutton.

Public health officials on Thursday [17 Jan 2019] said 2 more cases of measles have been confirmed and 2 more suspected cases are being investigated in Clark County, Washington. The new cases bring the total of confirmed measles cases to 16. There are now a total of 5 suspected cases.

All of the confirmed cases involve children who are 18 years old or younger, and 14 of the 16 were unvaccinated, health officials said. The vaccination status of the other 2 children has not been verified. One child who is a confirmed case has been hospitalized, along with one suspected case.

The children may have exposed others at numerous health clinics, schools, restaurants and Portland International Airport.

Clark County Public Health is requiring students and staff who do not have documented immunity to measles to stay away from schools identified as possible exposure sites.

According to Washington state records, just 77.4% of all Clark County public students last year [2018] had completed all of their vaccinations, the 6th worst among all counties in the state. Some 6218 students had a recorded exemption -- either for religious, personal or medical reasons -- from completing their vaccinations.

Melnick said before the measles vaccine hit the US in 1963, 400 to 500 people would die from the disease every year, and 48 000 more were hospitalized. "It can be a very deadly disease."

Melnick said the recent outbreak is scary, and he notes that schools need "well over 90 percent" of students to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. "Once you get below that, it can spread like wildfire," he said.

The City of New York announced on 16 Jan 2019 that there have been 58 confirmed cases of measles in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, NY. The initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel during October 2018, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring.

Since last October [2018], there have been additional children living in Brooklyn who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while visiting Israel. Additionally, children who did not travel to Israel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County.

The Brooklyn neighborhoods that have reported measles cases since October 2018 are as follows:
Bensonhurst: 1 confirmed measles case (no new cases since November 2018)
Borough Park: 35 confirmed measles cases (3 new cases in the past week)
Midwood/Marine Park: 1 confirmed measles case (no new cases since November 2018)
Williamsburg: 21 confirmed measles cases (no new cases in the past week)

The NYC Health Department says on a website statement that "if you plan to travel to Israel, protect yourself and your family against measles and get vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at least 2 weeks in advance of your trip." In the US, 2 approved measles vaccines are available, MMR-II and ProQuad.
