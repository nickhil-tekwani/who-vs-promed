Ukraine in 2018-2019 is threatened by an outbreak of diphtheria. [The 1st diphtheria case in Ukraine in 2018 was reported in January 2018 from Luhansk, https://112.international/society/first-diphtheria-case-in-ukraine-in-2018-reported-25140.html. - Mod.ML].

Secretary of the National Medical Chamber Sergey Kravchenko said: "Only one case creates an alert. Ukraine has already recorded 2 cases of diphtheria in the Luhansk region. We must pay tribute to the professionalism of doctors, as not in all cases were the cultures confirmed as diphtheria. This requires a serological laboratory test that is not conducted in Ukraine.

Accordingly, our physicians, are on time and have identified and localized the alert. Antibiotics for diphtheria will not help; it requires a specific serum, which is currently in the Ukraine. The US has alleged that India handed over 900 doses, but nobody knows whether this information is true. [In February 2018, Ukraine was reported to have only 900 doses of anti-diphtheria serum, https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/bohomolets-says-ukraine-900-doses-anti-diphtheria-serum.html]. Ukraine, according to the WHO and our doctors, is in 2018-2019 threatened with an outbreak of diphtheria," Sergey Kravchenko said.

He stressed that in Ukraine over the last 3 years, there has been a failure [to vaccinate against] measles and diphtheria.

"Ukraine has moved on procurement of medicines through international organizations. The Health Ministry was unable to make an adequate request, and international organizations are unable to undertake adequate purchase. Diphtheria protection requires vaccination, but it does not give a 100% guarantee that the person will not get sick. However, vaccinated citizens tolerate this disease in less severe forms," - concluded Sergey Kravchenko.

Rubizhne, Luhansk oblast, had the 2nd case of diphtheria at the beginning of 2018.

[Luhansk is a city near the eastern border of Ukraine with Russia; Luhansk is the capital and administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, but was captured by the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), a rebel group that has held the city and the southern half of Luhansk Oblast since 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_People%27s_Republic). Rubizhne, where the 2nd case of diphtheria has been reported, is a city in Luhansk Oblast with a population of about 60 000 residents in 2013, over 100 km northwest of the city of Luhansk, outside the territory controlled by the LPR (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubizhne). A map of Ukraine that shows the location of Luhansk can be found at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/ukraine.pdf.

In the early 1990's, a diphtheria epidemic emerged in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, which included Ukraine; the diphtheria epidemic was attributed to disruption of vaccine supply and economic difficulties associated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol4no4/vitek.htm). At the time, Ukraine had "among the highest diphtheria incidence in the world" (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036675.htm). In 1995 and 1996, as a result of concerted national and international efforts, the NIS raised adult and childhood coverage and began to control the epidemic, although over 2700 cases were still reported in 1998 (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/destinationUkraine.aspx). - Mod.ML
