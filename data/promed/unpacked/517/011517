West Darfur
---
West Darfur's Minister of Health, Ishaq Ahmed Yaqoub, disclosed that a number of yellow fever patients disappeared from the hospital before completing their treatment in Foro Baranga and Habila localities, sources told Radio Dabanga on Sunday 25 Nov [2012].

The minister warned that leaving the hospital before completing treatment is dangerous and could endanger the patient's life.

He appealed to all yellow fever patients, through Radio Dabanga, not to leave the hospital or clinic before completing their treatment. Lastly, the minister appealed to the people to visit the vaccination centers before the campaign ends.

Additionally, the minister disclosed that the incidence of yellow fever has stabilized in the state.

Central Darfur
---
On the other hand, Central Darfur's Minister of Health, Issa Mohamed Moussa Ahmed, disclosed that approximately 700 000 doses of the vaccine have arrived to the state.

He explained that this quantity will only cover the 4 localities affected by the epidemic. These 4 localities are Zalingei, Azum, Wadi Saleh and Nertity. The minister added that the deficit in vaccinations is around 527.

Ahmed confirmed that the incidence of yellow fever has stabilized in Central Darfur, he added to Radio Dabanga.

[It is good to see the yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign progressing. The shortage of vaccines in Central Darfur is of concern, however. Continued success of the campaign will depend heavily on effective surveillance to detect new cases and rapid response to vaccinate people in those areas. One presumes that the indication of "incidence is stabilized" means that the incidence rate has not increased.
