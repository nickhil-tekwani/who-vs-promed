EWGLINET (The European Working Group for
Legionella Infection) has alerted the HPSC of an
outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Venice,
Italy. As of 11 Sep 2006, 15 cases of
community-acquired legionnaires' disease
associated with the center of Venice have been
confirmed. No deaths have occurred to date. The
date of onset of symptoms ranges from 20 Jul to 31 Aug 2006.
Environmental investigations are in progress to
identify the source of this outbreak.
Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia
caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. The early
symptoms include a flu-like illness with muscle
aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough and fever.
Some people develop diarrhea or may become
confused. Deaths occur in 10-15 percent of
otherwise healthy individuals and may be higher
in some groups of patients. The incubation period
ranges from 2 to 10 days but is usually 5 to 6
days. In rare cases people may develop symptoms
as late as 3 weeks after exposure.
It is advisable that any persons who visited
Venice from early Aug 2006 onwards who develop
symptoms similar to those outlined above would
seek medical advice and visit their physician. In
particular, they should inform him/her that they
have visited Venice and that an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease has occurred there.
