Although by all measures the dengue fever outbreak on the Portuguese island of Madeira, which began in early October 2012, has decreased significantly, the outbreak is still ongoing after the 1st month of the new year [2013], according to a European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Epidemiological Update of 14 Feb 2013.

As of 3 Feb 2013, the Portuguese Ministry of Health has reported 2164 cases of dengue infection from the Autonomous Region of Madeira since 3 Oct 2012. No deaths or cases of severe dengue have been reported. All reported cases refer to the resident population of the island.

There have been 28 cases reported since the beginning of 2013.

According to ECDC numbers, 78 patients have been diagnosed in European countries with dengue infection after returning from Madeira: 11 in mainland Portugal, 23 in the UK, 19 in Germany, 3 in France, 5 in Sweden, 7 in Finland, 2 in Denmark, 2 in Austria, and 2 in Norway. Croatia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland have all reported one case each. The latest case was reported on 1 Feb 2013 from Finland.

[Although previous reports indicated that vector mosquito control measures were undertaken, transmission of dengue virus continues, although at a declining incidence. Fortunately, there is no possibility of ongoing transmission of the virus from visitors returning to their home countries because no vector mosquitoes are active there.
