The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed 13 cases of yellow fever, which has resulted in 3 deaths in 4 local government areas of Plateau State.

WHO State Coordinator, Wonk Vingey Bassey, confirmed the incident while presenting a report on a survey conducted on affected councils during an emergency stakeholders' meeting in Jos. The meeting followed the outbreak of the disease in Jos North, Bassa, Riyom and Wase local government areas of the state.

Bassey, who gave the breakdown according to councils, said the deaths were recorded in Wase local government [area]. The coordinator, represented by the consultant Elizabeth Ahinchi, advocated early inspection and reporting of cases of the outbreak, in addition to intensified routine campaigns in communities.

State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ninkwom Ndam, said the state government is working in collaboration with federal authority and other partners to strengthen healthcare services to citizens. Also, Executive Secretary, Plateau State Healthcare Board, Dr. Livinus Niamkwap, noted that the recent outbreak in the 4 councils calls for proactive measures to avert escalation to other areas.

Participants at the meeting discussed extensively on the way forward, laying emphasis on the need for the provision of mosquito nets, surveillance, awareness campaigns in media stations and worship centres, as well as financial support, among others.

[A 17 Dec 2019 report indicated that from 1 Jan through 10 Dec 2019, a total of 4189 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases were reported from 604 of 774 local government area (LGAs) across all the 36 states and the federal capital territory in Nigeria (see Yellow fever - Africa (27): Nigeria, WHO 20191217.6845662). Although that report indicated that there have been YF cases in all 36 states, previous reports do not specifically mention Plateau State. Although the need for the provision of mosquito nets, surveillance, and awareness campaigns in media stations and worship centres is real, it is curious that no mention is made of a vaccination campaign or of the proportion of the populations in the affected areas that have been vaccinated previously. Vaccination is the best YF preventive measure. - Mod.TY
