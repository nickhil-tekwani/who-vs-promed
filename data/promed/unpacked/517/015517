No new cases
----------------
No new cases of anthrax contamination had been found, government
officials said Sunday, but efforts are continuing to take precautions
in case other tainted letters are in the mail system.
Thousands of postal workers and others who dealt with large amounts of
mail were being urged to take preventive antibiotics. "There may be
other letters that are stuck in the system. We're asking people to be
very careful," White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said on "Fox
News Sunday."

Washington DC
-------------------
Doxycycline becomes DC's anthrax drug of choice
---------------------------------------------------
Washington health officials say they will now prescribe the antibiotic
doxycycline, instead of Cipro, to those needing a preventive treatment
against anthrax.
"We'll be treating them with 60 days of doxycycline, which is what the
CDC is now recommending, because we are fortunate to have a very
sensitive organism," said Dr. Gregory Martin, an infectious disease
specialist at Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
More than 10 000 people in the Washington area alone are currently
taking ciproflaxin, manufactured under the name Cipro, to combat or
prevent anthrax infections.
Authorities initially prescribed Cipro but said they will now
prescribe doxycycline because the anthrax strain seen so far is
sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics. Health officials said they
also want to bolster the public's confidence in other drugs, besides
Cipro, to treat anthrax infections and to achieve a better balance in
the type of antibiotics used.
Using a single antibiotic for extended periods of time can increase
the likelihood of antibiotic resistance, CDC sources say. Also,
doxycycline is cheaper than Cipro and more plentiful.
"I think (over-prescribing Cipro) should concern us because this is a
large clinical trial," Dr. Ivan Walks, Washington's chief health
officer, said of the desire to use antibiotics beside Cipro. "We have
not put this many people on this number of concentrated antibiotics in
a long period of time, if ever."
The side effects for Cipro and doxycycline -- including nausea -- are
similar, but Walks told CNN that "doxycycline has a better side-effect
profile."
Mailroom workers in "several thousand" Washington businesses have been
asked to come in for tests to determine if they have been exposed to
the anthrax bacteria, Washington's chief health officer, Dr. Ivan
Walks, told CNN Saturday. Walks said that more than 10 000 people been
tested, and the number "will get profoundly larger."
The justices of the Supreme Court began a 10-day doxycycline
prophylactic treatment, Walks said. On Friday, authorities discovered
anthrax spores in an off-site mail room that serves the nation's
highest court.
Government officials told The Washington Post that top FBI and CIA
officials think the anthrax attacks in Washington, New York and
Florida are likely the doing of United States extremists probably not
connected to the al Qaeda terror network. [Check the CNN URL above for

Washington DC
-------------------
Anthrax spores still being found in Congress
-------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax spores have now turned up at a total of 11 locations on
Capitol Hill. Tests confirmed Friday that anthrax spores were in the
offices of Reps. John E. Baldacci, D-Maine; Rush Holt, D-N.J., and
Mike Pence, R-Ind., on the sixth and seventh floors of the Longworth
House Office Building, said Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols.
On Saturday Dr. Gregory Martin reported that the new findings were
low-levels of contamination. Martin, chief of the infectious diseases
service at the National Naval Medical Center, said that for safety's
sake staffers in the three offices are being provided with an
antibiotic.
Pence said his staff is going through visitor records to contact
anyone who had been in his office since 11 Oct 2001 to advise them to
go to their doctor for antibiotics.
Senators and representatives could not get their mail, which was
halted as a precaution the day the potentially deadly letter arrived
in Daschle's office. Their mail continues to pile up and it is unclear
when it will resume. With no one absolutely certain whether other
anthrax-laden letters are still out there, there has been talk of
burning some of the mail. Daschle said he normally receives 5000 to
6000 letters weekly, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., normally
gets 20 000 letters a week, said her spokesman, Howard Gantman.

New Jersey
--------------
Anthrax Closes Princeton Post Office
----------------------------------------------
Saturday, officials closed the Princeton post office after a single
anthrax spore was found in a colony of several types of bacteria on a
mail bin, health department spokesman Tom Slater said. The 60 to 70
workers there do not need antibiotics because the level of
contamination was minuscule, said state Health Commissioner George
DiFerdinando. But he said workers will get help in obtaining
antibiotics if they choose to be treated.
Since we consider the single colony to be an insignificant amount, we
don't believe the benefit of treating them at this time is worth the
risk of side effects to those people, he said.
DiFerdinando said he was not sure how the mail bin in Princeton became
contaminated. The bin could have been used in Hamilton before it was
taken to Princeton, he said. Or there may be separate contamination in
the Princeton facility, located in West Windsor.
The Postal Service announced Friday that mail facilities across the
country will be tested randomly for anthrax.

Little red 'bites' were the first sign that I was victim
---------------------------------------------------------------
Claire Fletcher, a Briton working for CBS News in New York, recounts
how she discovered that she had anthrax
"...we heard about the first case of anthrax at another television
network. That was when I started to worry about two pimples on my left
cheek. I had first noticed them around 1 Oct [2001, when I thought
the tiny red marks were insect bites. But overnight they blistered and
turned blackish and my cheek swelled. I thought I might have developed
an allergic reaction to the bites and called my doctor, who prescribed
penicillin.
I never felt any illness, weakness or nausea. I continued to follow a
work-out regime at the gym and carried on with my training for the New
York City marathon, which I will be running next week. It never
occurred to me that I might have anthrax.
By the time news of the NBC case broke, the bug bites looked more like
a lesion. I thought perhaps I should get a second opinion. A friend at
CBS made an appointment with one of New York's top dermatologists. I
also got in touch with a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, who referred me to a colleague in New York.
She prescribed a dose of the antibiotic Cipro 'just to be safe'. "
