A total of 7 cases of diphtheria and 8 carriers of toxigenic strains
have been registered in Donetsk this year [2008]. The epidemic
situation is especially bad in the city of Makeevka, where 5 cases of
diphtheria and 5 carriers have been registered. One of the patients, a
5-year-old child, died from diphtheria in this city. The head sanitary
doctor underlined that the number of people declining vaccination has
increased, which has contributed to the development of the epidemic.

[When ProMED-mail last reported on diphtheria in Ukraine in 1996 (see
ProMED archive below), Ukraine had 'among the highest diphtheria
incidence in the world'. In the early 1990's, a diphtheria epidemic
emerged in the Newly
Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, which was
attributed to disruption of vaccine supply and economic difficulties
associated with the dissolution of the Soviet Union
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol4no4/vitek.htm>).
At the time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reported one probable case of diphtheria acquired in 1994 by a
22-year-old American while working in Ukraine where the disease was
epidemic
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036675.htm>).
In 1995 and 1996, as a result of concerted national and international
efforts, the NIS raised adult and childhood coverage and began to
control the epidemic, although over 2700 cases were still reported in
1998
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/destinationUkraine.aspx>).

A risk of diphtheria infection remains in all countries of the former
Soviet Union. The CDC advises that to minimize the risk for
diphtheria, all US residents should be up-to-date for diphtheria
vaccination, regardless of whether they plan international travel, and
travelers to areas with endemic diphtheria or outbreaks should
consult their medical providers to ensure they are adequately
vaccinated. - Mod.ML

Countries which have reported diphtheria in recent years include
Tanzania, Nigeria & some other parts of Africa, Afghanistan, Russia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, Ukraine, the 5 Central
Asian Republics (Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan &
Turkmenistan), the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia & Estonia), India,
Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, & Paraguay -- see ProMED archives.

Adequately vaccinated means, for adults, according to the CDC:

"Adults 19?64 years of age should receive a single dose of Tdap
(ADACEL) to replace a single dose of Td for active booster
immunization against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, if they
received their last dose of Td more than 10 years earlier and have not
previously received a dose of Tdap. Replacing one dose of Td with Tdap
should reduce the morbidity associated with pertussis in adults and
may reduce the risk of transmitting pertussis to persons at increased
risk for pertussis and its complications. Tdap is not licensed or
recommended for adults 65 years of age and older, who should receive
Td instead."
