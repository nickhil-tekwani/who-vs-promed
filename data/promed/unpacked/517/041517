The following background data on Q-fever in Germany and details of
the human vaccine [an additional option in high-risk situations] are
extracted from GIDEON.
Q-fever was first recognized in Germany in 1947. Reporting was
instituted in West Germany in 1962, and in East Germany in 1979. The
2 systems were combined in 1991. Most cases are reported in Bavaria,
Baden-Wurttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Northrhine-
Westphalia, and Thuringia. Hesse has experienced the greatest increase
in incidence since 1990.

22 percent of blood donors (nationwide, 1983 to 1986) and 22 percent
of military personnel (1985 to 1987) are seropositive.
12 percent of cattle in the southern Bavarian foothills are seropositive.
The average number of reported herds infected with Q fever was 71
per year during 1971 to 1979; 328 during 1980 to 1989; 303 during 1990
to 1998.
Outbreaks currently peak during spring to summer, and may be related
to urbanization.
40 outbreaks were reported during 1947 to 1999. Sheep were
implicated in 24 of the outbreaks, and cattle in 6.
2 laboratory outbreaks (in 1947 and 1948) were reported during 1947 to
1999.
An epidemic occurred in Berlin during 1992, involving 80 cases,
mostly staff from a veterinary institute. An outbreak in Hessen during
1993 involved 121 cases.
In 1996, 60 cases were confirmed in the Rollshausen area (Lohra,
Hessen) during an outbreak associated with infected sheep.
A University outbreak in May 1997 (105 confirmed cases) was
associated with proximity to sheep.
An outbreak in Dortmund during 1999 (81 cases) was associated with
proximity to sheep.
An outbreak (68 clinical cases) was reported during December 2000 to
June 2001 in Hochsauerland and Nordhessen.
Regarding the [human] vaccine: Q-fever vaccine is produced from
inactivated phase I whole _Coxiella burnetii_ under the proprietary
name Q-vax. The typical adult dosage consists of 0.5 ml s.c. (deltoid
region) for high-risk populations (e.g., occupational exposure).
Currently use is limited to Australia, notably among abattoir workers.
Protection persists for at least 5 years, and there are no clear guidelines
concerning boosters. Potential side effects include fever and headache;
the only contraindication is known allergy to the vaccine itself.

[We are very grateful to Dr Berger for the epidemiological data. Some
of the statements -- e.g. the alleged linkage between urbanization and
the observed Q fever peaks during spring to summer -- might need
clarification (rural vacations of city dwellers?). More information on
animal vaccines, as requested in the RFI, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
