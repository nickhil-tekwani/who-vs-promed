Almost 50 people are ill in France as part of a foodborne outbreak linked to eating a brand of unpasteurized, raw milk sheep's cheese. A spokeswoman from Sante Publique France told Food Safety News that _Salmonella_ Enteritidis was responsible for 49 illnesses and one person needed hospital treatment.

Those ill are men and women, mostly adults between 22 and 94 years old, but 5 children were infected. The patients live in 5 different regions of the country. The 1st patients were reported in early June 2019, with the most recent reported illness in early July 2019. Two incidents of food poisoning with isolates of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis in patients were declared via mandatory declaration by regional health authorities in Center-Val-de-Loire.

Patients were asked about food consumption, and the _Salmonella_ strains isolated from their stools were sent to the National Reference Center of Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur for typing. All these people had eaten sheep cheese, and checks on the cheeses revealed the presence of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis.

In mid-July 2019, the French firm GAEC Froidevaux Cornuet withdrew products from sale as tests detected _Salmonella_ and the epidemiological link to potential human illness. Implicated raw milk sheep's cheese with the name "Pur brebis du Lochois" was sold between 20 May - 20 Jul this year [2019]. Products were sold directly on the farm, at the Loches market in Indre-et-Loire, and at retailers or wholesalers who distributed them at the national level.

French authorities advised anyone who had the products not to consume them and to return items to the point of sale where they were purchased. Distribution also included Austria, Germany, and Spain, as well as possibly the Netherlands. In Germany, some of the cheese has use-by dates in August and September 2019.
