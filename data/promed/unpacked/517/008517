INFECTION CONTROL: MRSA/VRSA: REQUEST FOR INFO
==============================================

As a virologist following the MRSA comments on ProMed-mail, I wonder two
things:
1. What could have been done to avoid or substantially delay our
current situation with regard to treatment of serious _Staphyloccus aureus_
infections with methicillin?
2. Is it likely that vancomycin resistance will become an issue;
what is being done in the way of surveillance for "VRSA"; and
what will be done if/when it is detected?
