African Horse Sickness spreads to 3 provinces
---------------------------------------------
African Horse Sickness [AHS] which has spread to 3 provinces is
starting to take a serious toll among the horse population and owners
are losing millions. The equine disease has broken out in Gauteng,
KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape [Map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?action=selmap&country=257_0_4&language=1>.
- Mod.AS]

An embargo has been placed on movement of horses in the Western Cape,
the country's export zone. In the Eastern Cape, veterinarian Jane
Pistorius says more than 180 cases have been reported, while 130
horses have already died. Irene van der Westhuizen has lost 6 horses,
among them valuable American Saddlebreds.

Less than half of the 300 000 horses and other equines in South
Africa have been vaccinated. Horses need to be vaccinated fully, 5
months before the AHS season begins, to attain maximum immunity.

A 2004 outbreak of the sickness in the Western Cape led to an embargo
on the import of horses by the European Union (EU) [see also comment
and ProMED 2004 ref. below. - Mod.JW].

African horse sickness is a highly infectious non-contagious,
vector-borne viral disease affecting all species of Equidae.

[AHS virus is an orbivirus, rather close to the bluetongue virus which
affects ruminants, and similarly transmitted by culicoides [midges].
Both diseases are seasonal; following a year with a massive outbreak,
the target populations may acquire immunity which may be retained for
some time, leading animal owners to neglect the timely performance of
annual vaccinations, with the unavoidable result when vector/virus
activities are resumed. - Mod.AS]

[The EU reinstated its ban in 2007 after a report of suspected AHS in
Western Cape Province -- see ProMED 2007 ref. below. However, it was
lifted after AHS was excluded from the diagnosis. ProMED would still
like to know what the final diagnosis was in that 2007 outbreak. -
