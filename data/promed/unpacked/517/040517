"Amala is a Nigerian food processed from yam or cassava. It's a Yoruba traditional delicacy in Nigeria. Amala is a unique food on its own and cannot be compared to any other meal. "No food like it".

"Amala and ewedu with stew are commonly eaten by the Yorubas but in recent times it has become a household meal in every Nigerian home. It cuts across the different dialects in Nigeria and has gained ground in every part of the country; including some parts of Africa. It's no longer only Nigerian food, but also referred to as Amala African food."

"Amala Nigerian food is mostly made with yam, some people use cassava as well to get the same feel of amala. It is done by peeling the yam and then drying it, after which it is blended and it comes out in a powder form called Amala flour or Elubo in our local dialect. It has a black or dark brown color due to the drying process and as a result of its cooking method. The [closest] Amala near me is the likes of Olaiya Foods and Catering.

"Moreover, Amala recipe is a must serve in every Yoruba party, and is usually delicious. In order to make Amala flour, you will need tubes of yams. Finely peel the yams, slice, and dry before grounding into a powder called Elubo.

"Similarly, there is also Amala Lafun made from dry cassava which is usually white; it has a different method of preparation."

While the headline calls this yam flour, it may be a local or common name as the article above indicates the dish may be prepared with cassava or yams. Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_), an edible tuberous root is resistant to drought, diseases, and pests, and is a major source of carbohydrates in tropical areas, such as Uganda and Nigeria.

If this flour is prepared locally, it is important to strictly adhere to the established methods of degrading cyanogenic glycosides in the cassava, which is essential to prevent cyanide poisoning.

Clinical signs and symptoms of cyanogenic glycoside ingestion include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pains. This article indicates the individuals were transported to a hospital complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting.

We extend our sympathies to the victims' family. - Mod.TG
