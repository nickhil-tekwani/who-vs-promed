The Department of Agriculture (DA) in Southern Mindanao confirmed that the deadly African swine fever virus [ASFV] which reached the town of Don Marcelino in Davao Occidental, has spread to nearby Malita town, also in Davao Occidental. Ricardo Onate, the Regional Field Office 11 director of the DA, said in a statement issued by its regional office that a composite team of veterinarians also reported ASF incidence in the barangays of Malita - Bito, Kidalapong, Tubalan, Felis, Mana, Talogoy, and New Argao. "Laboratory examinations of affected animals revealed similarities of lesions for classical swine fever or hog cholera and ASF," he said.

Onate said it was later confirmed that blood samples collected and submitted to the Bureau of Animal Industry's animal disease diagnostic laboratory in General Santos City in Region 12 on [30 Jan 2020] turned positive for ASF. While the entry of ASF in Malita and earlier in Don Marcelino town, had been confirmed, the DA said it still did not know how the disease had managed to sneak in.

He said secretary William Dar has already ordered Ronnie Domingo, the national director of the Bureau of Animal Industry, to conduct "trace-back" and "trace-forward" investigations, particularly in areas where Don Marcelino actively trades with - such as the towns of Malita, Santa Maria, Jose Abad Santos, all in Davao Occidental; and Sulop, in Davao Del Sur. It was in Don Marcelino where the disease had initially been reported.

The DA said it suspected the practices of local traders contributed to the spread of the deadly swine disease. "Backyard farmers in the area practice group rearing (Pagalam system) of hogs, from different owners, most having no proper housing provisions nor biosecurity practices. They also do not practice vaccination, vitamin supplementation and deworming. Household butchering is common especially with animals exhibiting weakness or disease, and animals are sold to neighbors and relatives," Onate said.
