Death toll from variant CJD Reaches 100 in UK
---------------------------------------------
THE death toll from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human
form of [bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has reached 100 and shows
no signs of slowing down, scientists said [on Thursday 24 May. This
landmark figure was revealed as Government advisers warned that elderly
patients with variant CJD, the disease linked [circumstantially - Mod to
eating BSE-infected beef, could be dying undiagnosed and that the true
scale of the epidemic could be far worse.
Yesterday, one of Britain's leading epidemiologists warned that the most
optimistic predictions of the spread of vCJD could now be ruled out. In the
first 5 months of the year there were 16 confirmed or suspected new cases
of vCJD. If new cases continue to emerge at the same rate, the 2001 toll
will top last year's total of 28 cases.
Professor Peter Smith, chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC), which advises the Government on BSE, vCJD, and the
related sheep disease scrapie, said: "It is an arbitrary landmark, but
obviously every additional case is of great concern. But it has reached 100
and some of the earlier predictions were that it would not reach 100. We
don't know how it's going to evolve." An early model of the disease by
Professor Roy Anderson, another member of SEAC and an epidemiologist at
Imperial College London, predicted a range of deaths between 100 and 100
000. Professor Anderson warned that the epidemic was still rising. He said:
"It will be a long time before we have an idea of the scale of this
epidemic so that the bottom line remains that the future is still uncertain."
Although most patients with vCJD are in their 20s and 30s, a patient aged
74 died of the disease last year. SEAC called for more postmortem
examinations to be conducted on elderly people who die with suspected
dementia, in case vCJD is being misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's [disease or
senility.

[A similar report appeared in the Independent on Fri 25 May 2001. In this
report Professor Robert Will, head of the CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh, is reported as saying that: "The latest analysis [of new cases
by month still shows a significant upward trend, and we don't know how
long that will continue. We don't know who is infected in the population.
Knowing that, and the average incubation period, and the risk of developing
the disease once infected, would help us enormously." He added that: "It
still remains an exceedingly rare disease Â­ but each case is a tragedy." -
