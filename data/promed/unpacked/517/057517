From: Dr Tony Speekenbrink <speekb@clinmed.gla.ac.uk>

Do the local scavengers know they are not supposed to eat the dead geese?
Surely it would be better to sample the carcasses and then incinerate them,
irrespective of whether the geese died of infection or intoxication. The
alternative is either to risk the spread of a disease which is highly
contagious to birds, or the accumulation of toxic materials higher up the
food chain.
