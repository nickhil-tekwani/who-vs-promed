The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (8 Jun 2021) closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involved a 49-year-old woman living in Chengdu. She developed symptoms on 13 May [2021] and was admitted for treatment on 16 May [2021]. The patient is now in serious condition.

From 2014 to date, 31 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food, and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:

- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals, or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter, and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels, or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/24244.html), the weekly Avian Influenza Report (https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/332.html), global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf), the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection), and the YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel).

China has reported another human H5N6 avian flu case, which involves a 49-year-old woman from Sichuan province, according to a statement yesterday [Tue 8 Jun 2021] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). Sichuan province is in the country's southwest.

The patient's symptoms began on 13 May [2021], and she was hospitalized on 16 May [2021], where she is listed in serious condition. The report did not say how she was exposed to the virus.

China and a few other countries have reported H5N6 outbreaks in poultry since 2014, but China and Laos are the only ones that have reported human cases, which can often be serious or fatal. The latest case would raise the global total to 33, all but one in China.

[According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. With the continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.

The 1st avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province, China. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 31 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 8 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210528.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_137). The above reports do not mention the nature of exposure of the case with poultry or products thereof.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. - Mod.UBA
