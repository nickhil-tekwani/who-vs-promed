Vaccination campaign for cattle launched
----------------------------------------
Jagmohan Singh Kang, Minister for Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Dairy
Development and Tourism, Punjab, has announced that 80 lakh [8 million] [A
lakh (also spelled lac) is a unit in a traditional number system, still
widely used in India, equal to 100 000. - Wikipedia] units of vaccination
would be administered to the milk cattle during the current year under a
special drive to check the spread of FMD [foot and mouth disease] and HS
(hemorrhagic septicemia) [acute pasteurellosis, caused by particular
serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_, principally in cattle and water
buffalo] diseases among livestock in Punjab.
During 2004, 75 lakh [7.5 million] units were administered.
The minister said that the protection of livestock from various diseases
was of utmost importance to make dairy farming competitive. He added that
the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairy Development had been fully
geared up to implement the programme.
Kang said that the department would also organise a large number of camps
to educate the farmers regarding health care, vaccination and other
facilities available for the treatment of livestock.
The minister said the state government had decided to set up Sri Guru Angad
Dev Veterinary University in the state and the cabinet had already given
its nod for the project.

The detailed monthly reports are available at

A media-derived report on "a fatal syndrome" affecting mainly dairy cattle
in Punjab (India) since January 2005 has been included in an earlier
posting (20050312.0734). Reportedly, the responding authorities ordered the
application of (unspecified) vaccinations and the performance of a
veterinary investigation, no results of which are available. - Mod.AS]
