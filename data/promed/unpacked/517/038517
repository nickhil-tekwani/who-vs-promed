Epidemiology

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Vectors

Epidemiological comments: Before this event, the disease was detected only in the south of Israel in 1989, 2006 and 2007. The herds are located in the north of the country, near the Syrian and Lebanese borders. All the cases are concentrated in the Golan heights and the upper Galilee. Stomoxys flies have been seen in the area.

Control measures
Measures applied: Control of arthropods, Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Screening, Dipping/Spraying, Modified stamping out.

Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total Vaccinated / Details
Hazafon / Cattle / 35 000 / Sheep pox vaccine

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Taking into consideration the discovery of aged skin lesions ("sit-fasts") in the 1st cattle herds found infected (27 Jul 2012) and in view of the anamnestic data derived from the herders, the current follow-up report mentions the date of start of the event to be 1 Jul 2012 (in the immediate notification and follow-up report No. 1, the start date given was 24 Jul 2012). This update expresses commendable transparency. Since the incubation period of LSD in the field is thought to be 2 to 5 weeks, the LSD virus may have thus been circulating in the affected area for at least 3 months.

The disease is already reported in 12 northern localities, 4 of which are covered in the current follow-up report. In some of them, more than one single herd was present and affected. As indicated in the report, outbreak No. 3 is distant from the other foci. In fact, this outbreak, involving the beef cattle herd of Kibbutz Malkiyya, less than one km from the Lebanese border, is on the western side of the Upper Galilee, about 14 km from the cluster of foci on the Golan; see map at the source URL (zoom in). It is not clear whether this outbreak results from a spread from previous outbreaks or rather reflects a new introduction from Lebanon.

Since the initial notification of the epizootic, a total of 12 outbreaks have been reported. For a map showing all 12 foci, one has to go through the WAHID (2nd version) system, looking for the "summary."

The total animals affected in all 12 outbreaks are as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 7757 / 2180 / 219 / 4 / 0

Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate
Cattle / 28.10 percent / 2.82 percent / 10.04 percent / 3.29 percent

The late discovery of the disease has made mass culling a difficult if not impossible task, resulting in the risk of the virus becoming endemic, a scenario seen in Egypt since the introduction of LSD there in 1988. In order to prevent such a development in Israel, and particularly to protect the highly susceptible national dairy herd, rigorous quarantine measures and animal movement restrictions combined with effective vaccination are essential.

According to information from the Veterinary Services, as of 29 Aug 2012, about 22 500 beef cattle and 15 000 dairy cattle have been vaccinated within and around the infected zone with a sheep pox vaccine. Gathered information on the efficacy of the said vaccine (and of other candidate vaccines), is of the utmost importance, not only for Israel but for the region and for international organisations.

According to available information (OIE and other sources), LSD was last reported in Middle Eastern countries as follows (in brackets, last year of LSD occurrence): Bahrain (2009); Kuwait (1991); Lebanon (1993); Oman (1984); UAE (2000); Yemen (1995). It is suspected that the disease spread to northeast Israel from adjacent infected territories, where (undiagnosed?) circulation of the virus may prevail. Lebanon in particular is prone to penetration of exotic animal diseases, in view of its dependence upon imported live cattle for the local meat markets (2009 official FAO statistics: 264 341 imported live cattle from 13 countries). On top of the possible exposure to infection underway (some ships with cattle to Lebanon pass through the Suez canal), illegal movement of livestock in the Middle East is a long-known phenomenon.

In view of the risk of LSD transboundary spread and its threat to Europe, efforts to intensify surveillance in the region deserve prioritization, with the support of international organizations. - Mod.AS
