The announcement of the infection [on a mink farm in Milheeze on Thu 23 Apr 2020] with the virus that can cause COVID-19 was released last weekend. The alarm bells immediately rang for Jan Hoevenaars [chairman of the Social Gemert-Bakel group; map at https://tinyurl.com/y6v5knoj]. He is very committed to this matter, not only as a councilor, but also as a retired general practitioner. The consequences of intensive livestock farming, where risks can arise for humans and animals, have been keeping him busy for decades.

Pointing to bird flu, Q fever [both zoonotic], and swine fever [not zoonotic], Hoevenaars says there is no time to waste. "We have to start moving proactively, even before the data from the investigations arrive. That may take several weeks, but you shouldn't want to wait for that. Together with national politics, the GGD [Regional Public Health Service], and the Ministry of Agriculture, we must come up with a solid plan."

He suggests that employees of mink farmers who may be infected be tested immediately. This could also apply to people who live near these communities and who may have the virus among their members. Furthermore, it should be examined whether the environment in which air samples are taken [see comment], among other things, is set up sufficiently spacious, says Hoevenaars. He also wants to know when the mayor and aldermen have been notified of the infection.

Vet Haiko Koenen will be happy with an energetic approach. He is affiliated with Veterinary Practice Pecon in Gemert and was the man who "discovered" the spread of the virus in Beek en Donk [the 2nd mink farm affected; see 20200427.7272289]. "That happened last week; the contamination in Milheeze was already reported to the ministry at the time," says Koenen. "In Beek en Donk we noticed symptoms that we could not immediately bring home. They did not indicate the flu or any other illness. We then took the coronavirus into account deep in the back of our minds. When tests confirmed it, the ministry [of Agriculture] and the NVWA [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety] took action."

"Precautions were rightly taken at the company and in an area with a radius of 400 m [0.25 mi] around the mink farm. However, the issue relates to the entire [Dutch] mink industry. After all, a legal obligation to report was immediately issued."

Koenen does not (yet) speak of a disaster; he hopes that the consequences will remain limited to the 2 affected farms for the time being. "It is also the 1st time that we have to deal with this. The animals do not get sicker than people. I do not know the situation in Milheeze; a colleague of mine and I have not been there. In Beek en Donk it concerns a few dozen animals that are sick or deceased, fortunately not hundreds. Moreover, the rest eat well and show normal behavior, but we continue to take care."

Other mink farmers have already contacted Koenen. "Not because their animals are also sick, but because they have questions. And we are happy to help them," as a precaution.

An area around the 2 mink farms had already been cordoned off last weekend. Signs have been placed to prevent pedestrians and (moped) cyclists from entering the area in the near future. The site of the municipality of Gemert-Bakel has also indicated a detour to and from Beek en Donk, which is located in the municipality of Laarbeek.

[The concerns of Dr Hoevenaars, in particular about the potential hazard of airborne virus dissemination from the mink farms/air-sampling data, deserve to be viewed while keeping in mind the mass Q fever epidemic that affected North Brabant in 2009-2010. This unique outbreak caused more than 2000 human cases, including mortalities and lifelong damages, and was attributed -- at least partially -- to aerosol spread from the animal reservoir (goats; see the investigation report discussed in 20100930.3546).

On Sun 26 Apr 2020, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) published the following: "It is important to know how the disease develops on the infected [mink] farms. This knowledge can be used to better understand the disease and its course in animals and humans. Therefore, samples are being collected from sick and healthy animals. These will be used for further investigation. While it is not expected that the virus will spread over long distances, air and dust samples are also being taken in the vicinity of the farms as a precaution. These samples are being examined to see whether virus can be detected in them. The Lower House will be informed as soon as more information is available about the outcome of this investigation."

Results of the current, so far unique, RIVM investigation are anticipated with interest. This event deserves to be viewed as a reminder of the urgent need for an updated assessment of China's role as a source of emerging zoonotic disease agents, which should not be limited to animal markets but include China's industrial as well as smallholders establishments of farmed wildlife, reportedly still active. This multi-billion-dollar industry is allegedly engaged in the breeding, production, processing, and marketing of wild animals (including minks, raccoon dogs, badgers, masked palm civet, pangolins, foxes and others; see https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3064927/wildlife-ban/index.html).

The Dutch minks are the 2nd species of the Mustelid family shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, following ferrets (found susceptible in experimental infection trials performed in a Chinese and a German laboratory). A spatial and epidemiological One Health approach will require an early response to the question: Have similar events been recorded/investigated in China's farmed minks or other animals, including raccoon dogs, covering human AND animal? - Mod.AS
