The exotic white spot virus that devastated South-East Queensland prawn farms is now killing wild prawns and small crabs in the Logan river and has become widespread in Moreton Bay.

The Federal Government is reviewing its import requirements for prawns, and a leading aquatic disease expert warns that a dangerous double standard favouring importers over Australian fishers and aquaculture farmers is leaving the country wide open to the introduction of more dangerous viruses.

In a survey finalised for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation late last year [2020], Dr Ben Diggles discovered dead banana prawns and small crabs in waterways surrounding the Logan river -- and live virus in small crustacean species in the marine food chain in Deception Bay, well away from the original incursion.

"We looked at a whole range of crustaceans that aren't commercially significant because they're too small.

We found it was throughout many of those other species so it's within the food chain and unfortunately it looks like it's here to stay," the aquatic disease expert said.

[White spot disease (WSD) has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and India. The virus was first detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil last year (2016). Reports in Australia began in December 2016.

Acutely affected shrimps are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic, and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "white spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
