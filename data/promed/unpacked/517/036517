A 2nd horse at Fair Grounds [New Orleans, Louisiana] has gotten sick and tested positive for the equine herpesvirus, senior director of racing Jason Boulet said Saturday morning [31 Dec 2016].

The herpes positive comes 5 days after one barn at Fair Grounds was put under quarantine because a horse died from the virus. That horse, trained by [AC], was housed in barn 14, as was the 2nd horse to be infected, one trained by [JT].

The stricken animal, Boulet said, has been moved to an isolation area set up on the northeast corner of the Fair Grounds backstretch, away from the rest of the equine population.

Protocols put in place by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture require an infected site to have no herpes cases for 14 days in order to lift the quarantine. The latest case resets the start of that period to 31 Dec 2016, though it is good news that the 2nd infection occurred in the same barn. Starting last [Tue 27 Dec 2016], horses in that barn have been training between 9:30 and 10:30 am, after the horses from the rest of the backstretch have finished exercising.

[Trainers JT, AC, and JF] run smaller strings in barn 14, whose major occupant is trainer [ML]. Horses from the quarantined barn are not permitted to race, and access to the barn is restricted by security.

Fair Grounds has not imposed restrictions on horses shipping into and out of its backstretch. Trainers, though, will be hesitant to send horses to the site of a herpes outbreak. Trainer [JS], for instance, elected not to ship 2 horses, for stakes on [Sat 31 Dec 2016] because of the ongoing situation.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
