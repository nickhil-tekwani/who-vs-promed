Newcastle disease, cormorants - USA (California) 970616124506
Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998

The OIE has published reports of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in Canada
(wild double-crested cormorants). The current report on _ Phalacrocorax
auritus_ is the second finding of Newcastle in wildlife in the last 6
months. The latest event was in northern Saskatchwean and involved birds
nesting at Lavallee Lake and Dore Lake, far from any commercial poultry
operation.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: diagnosis was confirmed at the
Animal Disease Research Institute (Hull, Quebec) on 30 January 1998.
B. Causal agent: intracerebral pathogenicity indices were 1.56 (Dore Lake)
and 1.72 (Lavalle Lake).
Epidemiology: isolates with similar indices of pathogenicity were reported
in 1990, 1992, 1995, and 1996 in cormorants. In the previous experiences,
there was no extension to the domestic poultry population and there is no
evidence of involvement of domestic poultry in the present case.
Source of agent / origin of infection: it seems that Newcastle disease
virus is present in cormorants and it is expected that it will be found on
a regular basis in the future.
Control measures during reporting period: Canada's poultry industry, aware
of the presence of Newcastle disease in cormorants, is being kept informed
with fact sheets and regular updates on avian diseases. All regions and
district offices are alerted to increase vigilance during summer months and
to report any suspicious cases in commercial flocks. Canada's poultry
flocks are free from Newcastle disease and, as for any other List A
disease, case suspicions are being dealt with according to the Foreign
Animal Disease Surveillance scheme.
