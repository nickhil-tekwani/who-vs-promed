[The location of Rahat, a Bedouin township in Hadarom (Hebrew for South) district, can be seen in the map appended to the OIE notification at the source URL above.

According to a circular, electronically distributed by the IVSAH (Isreal's Veterinary Services & Animal Health) to veterinarians and farmers on 22 Mar 2012, the affected unit is a backyard holding consisting of 10 adult sheep and 90 lambs, most of which had escaped the compulsory ear tagging and annual FMD vaccination. This is the 1st FMD case in Israel for 2012, corresponding to the long-recognised seasonality pattern of the disease (see commentary in posting 20090204.0493). It will be interesting to note if the origin of the virus is in the adjacent Gaza strip, west (an Egyptian strain?) or rather in the Palestinian Authority territory (West Bank) on the east (a Jordanian strain?).

Israel's traditional FMD-prevention policy includes annual mass vaccinations of cattle, sheep, and goats. In cattle, a trivalent vaccine (O, A, Asia1) is applied; in sheep/goats, a bivalent (O, A) vaccine is applied. In view of the recent alarming information concerning the spread of the exotic FMDV SAT2 strain throughout neighbouring Egypt, IVSAH have decided, following consultations with local and international experts, to apply preventive SAT2 (Eritrea strain) vaccination in a zone bordering Egypt (Sinai) and the Gaza strip. A circular, distributed on 21 Mar 2012, informed veterinarians, farmers and local authorities about the vaccination initiative, calling for alertness and introducing monitoring activities. - Mod.AS]
