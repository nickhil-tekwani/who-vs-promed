Expansion of Washington's wine grape acreage may be driving a new virus from propagation of unclean plants. There is concern about a relatively new disease: the grapevine red blotch.

The red blotch virus probably has been active for years but was mistaken for another disease known as leaf roll, said viticulturist Richard Hoff. Symptoms are similar, red leaves and grapes that are low in sugar and color and high in acid, he said. Grapevine red blotch has only been known for the past 3 years, and there is no cure. Some growers have removed whole blocks of vineyard, he said.

There is no known insect vector, so the source is believed to be propagation of unclean plant material coinciding with growth of industry acreage.

"It definitely is a serious problem. Right now, there's no commercial testing lab in Washington; growers have to [send samples] to California," Hoff said. But [for] most growers, it's too expensive. Large estate companies flag and do not use infected grapes, but smaller growers often can't afford that loss or don't know they have the disease.

Naidu Rayapati of Washington State University does limited sampling for growers [and] is trying to determine how widespread red blotch is and how much it affects wine.

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening in the US. It does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (associated with several viruses within the family _Closteroviridae_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades, pink or red veins, occasional reddening of leaf blades, as well as slow accumulation of sugars or failure to mature in fruits. It is not known whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards.

The disease has been shown to be graft transmissible. The new virus has been given the preliminary name grapevine red blotch associated virus (GRBaV). It is thought to be a likely member of the family _Geminiviridae_, but final taxonomy still requires complete characterisation. The virus has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. Like many viruses (and viroids) of mainly vegetatively propagated hosts, the new virus may have been spread widely with host varieties and, therefore, may be present outside the US as well.

Disease management of grapevine viruses may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of clean planting material -- including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting which have been certified for virus freedom -- is essential.
