Cat owners are being urged to vaccinate their pets against a rare and potentially deadly virus outbreak in Melbourne.

The highly-contagious feline panleukopenia virus, commonly referred to as feline distemper, has been confirmed in a handful of stray kittens, and the RSPCA is urging cat owners to keep their pets' vaccinations up to date.

"The virus is not contagious to humans or any other animals, however, it can be spread to other cats through the clothing and shoes of handlers or owners of infected animals," RSPCA Victoria said in a statement on [Sun 4 Feb 2018].

[This disease seems to be making resurgence in Australia.

Feline panleucopenia is also known as feline enteritis, feline distemper or feline parvovirus. It is a highly contagious, often fatal virus that affects cats. Although the virus is closely related to the dog parvovirus, feline panleucopenia is not transmissible to dogs.

The virus attacks the rapid dividing cells of
1) the bone marrow causing a low white cell count and hence increased risk in infection from normal body bacteria
2) the lining of the gastrointestinal tract resulting in severe ulceration and sloughing

Clinical signs develop suddenly and can include fever, lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, profuse watery (often bloody) diarrhoea, vomiting, anaemia, severe dehydration, septic shock and often death. If a cat is exposed during pregnancy the virus can cause still births, abortion and brain damage to off spring. The virus most commonly affects cats less than 6 months of age.

While this disease formerly was very prevalent in many part of the world, vaccination has greatly diminished the impacts of this disease. This resurgence, with 2 outbreaks in Australia is concerning but it should be noted these current outbreaks are in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated cats. The majority of these outbreaks have been in kittens less than 6 months, and especially in 6-12 week old kittens.

Affected kittens or cats require aggressive treatment in the hospital as this disease can kill cats in less than 24 hours. Treatment may involve whole blood transfusions, intravenous fluids to restore fluids and electrolytes, IV antibiotics, anti-nausea and anti-vomiting medication. Prognosis is guarded especially in kittens and many die despite intensive treatment.

The best prevention is vaccination. Please follow your veterinarian's recommendation as to the frequency of necessary vaccinations for your kitten or unvaccinated cat.
