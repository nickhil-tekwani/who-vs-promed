The 1st case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus infection has
been recorded in Yaroslavl in a 7-year-old child. The child's parents
stated that an attached tick had been found in the child's ear 5 days
after potential exposure. After the tick had been removed, it was
confirmed to be TBE virus infected.

Immunoglobulin was then administered. Due to the delay in
administration of immunoglobulin until 12 days after the tick bite,
the child's condition began to deteriorate 2 weeks after exposure and
became severe, with a temperature of 40 C. The child suffered
headache and vomiting. Two days later, the child's condition
improved, and the child is now out of danger according Vyacheslav
Shadrin, the head of the Neurological Department in the Regional
Children's Hospital.

The situation in the region continues to worsen. Recently, the
Yaroslavl laboratory has examined 3500 ticks, and 84 were found to be
carriers of the TBE virus. 68 of the infected ticks originated from
the town of Rybinsk.

[The TBE incidence rate has considerably increased since the end of
last century in the Yaroslavl region. The index of morbidity is among
highest in the central federal district, where the Yaroslavl region
is located. - Corr.BA]

The Yaroslavl region (Yaroslaskaya Oblast) is between the Moscow,
Vladimir, Vologda, Kostroma, Ivanovo and Tver regions. Yaroslavl
(population 603 000) is the administrative center and the largest
city of the Yaroslavl region. It is located 280 km (approx. 175
miles) from Moscow and 850 km (approx. 530 miles) from St.
Petersburg. The Volga river flows across the territory of the
Yaroslavl region connecting the coastal areas of 6 seas: the Baltic
Sea, the White Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov,
and the Mediterranean.
