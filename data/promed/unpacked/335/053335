[1] Beaver, human exposure - New York/Pennsylvania

A Boy Scout leader from New York who was attacked by a rabid beaver while swimming in the Delaware River is recovering.

The Poughkeepsie Journal reports that the 51 year old victim, of Pine Plains (NY), was swimming in eastern Pennsylvania on 2 Aug 2012 when a beaver swam through his legs and bit him in the chest.

The animal then bit him in the leg, buttocks, arm, hand, and torso before he managed to grab it and hold its jaw closed.

One Boy Scout pulled the victim to shore, where he tossed the beaver away from him. The Scouts then used rocks to kill the animal.

A doctor confirmed the beaver had rabies a day after the attack. Dutchess County health officials say a rabid beaver attack is unusual.

[This appears to be an update of the cases previously reported as Rabies - USA (17): (PA), beaver 20120805.1228835.

It would be an excellent time to remind people to update the rabies vaccination of their pets, including any large animals, such as horses or other livestock show animals, especially those being handled on a regular to daily basis. - Mod.TG

The Manalapan Township Health Department and Western Monmouth Animal Control are alerting residents about an outdoor stray cat that tested positive for rabies on 25 Jul 2012.

The black and white cat, which was found in the area of Atrium Way and Chestnut Way off of Pension Road, bit 3 residents on 2 separate occasions on Wed 25 Jul 2012. The cat was captured and sent out to be tested for rabies; the positive results came back on 27 Jul 2012.

The people who were bitten by the cat have now begun a rabies post-exposure prophylaxis treatment.

Anyone who has come into contact with this stray cat is advised to call the Manalapan Health Department, located within the Manalapan Township Municipal Building.

Also, if a pet has come into contact with the feline please get in touch with your veterinarian, the Health Department advises.

According to Manalapan Health Department Director David Richardson, the incident of the rabid cat is not related to a recent event involving a rabid bat that was discovered in the township. Please be on the lookout for any other animals or cats that may be acting strangely. Unusual behavior in animals is generally defined as aggressive tendencies, a sick appearance, or a very lethargic or passive behavior, according to the Health Department. Any observances of peculiar functioning in animals should be reported to the Manalapan Health Department or the Police Department after normal working hours or on the weekends at the after hours number.

The Health Department wants to take this opportunity to remind residents that all of their domestic pets should be properly vaccinated against the rabies virus.

[3] Bat, human exposure - Massachusetts

Health officials are warning anyone who may have touched a bat found at Luther Hill Park on Tue 17 Jul 2012 to consult with their doctor immediately, as the bat had rabies.

A 10 year old child who was bitten by the bat is undergoing treatment but, health agent Lee Jarvis said, there were reports that several other children may have touched it and could have been exposed to the deadly virus.

"What we were told was that the bat fell from a tree into the water," Mr Jarvis said. Someone retrieved the bat and brought it to shore where several children gathered around. Some of the children reportedly were "petting" the bat.

The bat was sent out for testing and was found to have rabies.

Mr Jarvis said he placed a reverse call to every residence in Spencer yesterday [20 Jul 2012] but there may have been people who did not receive the message.

Treatment for exposure to rabies includes a series of injections over a period of several days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva or the tissue from the brain or nervous system of an infected animal and a person can only get rabies by coming in contact with these specific excretions or tissues, the website states.

There have been cases of bats with rabies in the 48 contiguous states in the United States, according to CDC, whose website states, "Recent data suggest that transmission of rabies virus can occur from minor, seemingly unimportant, or unrecognized bites from bats. Human and domestic animal contact with bats should be minimized, and bats should never be handled by untrained and unvaccinated persons or be kept as pets."

CDC recommends a series of shots for anyone who has a "bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure to a bat, unless the bat is available for testing and is negative for evidence of rabies."

Mr Jarvis urged anyone who came in contact with the bat at the beach to speak with their doctor as soon as possible. He said time is of the essence when treating for rabies exposure.
