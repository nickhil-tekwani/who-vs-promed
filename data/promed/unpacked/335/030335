Comments on the Role of Handling and Consuming Poultry in Avian Influenza Cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[These comments were sent to ProMED-mail on 12 Aug 2005, and ProMED-mail
apologizes to the author for an inadvertent delay in processing. In alerting
us to this omission, Dr Ben Embarek has pointed out that in encounters with
the media, it is apparent that several journalists are getting the erroneous
impression that avian influenza may be a food-borne disease. - Mod.CP]
In recent days, I have noted several instances where your moderator (CP) has
commented on avian influenza news items [implying that] infections in humans
are associated with consumption of infected poultry. These comments tend to
give the wrong impression that avian influenza is predominantly a food-borne
disease. Available data would tend to indicate that human infection is
associated with handling and preparing diseased birds prior to cooking.
So far, there are no detailed descriptions of the route of infection for human
cases of avian influenza nor detailed descriptions of the exact kind of "close
poultry contact" human cases have had so far. Such information will help a lot
in better designing prevention campaigns addressing high-risk behaviors in at-
risk populations.
However, from the information available, it is clear that the large majority
of human cases have been in rural settings, linked to "handling" diseased
poultry. Here, "handling" probably covers a series of high-risk activities
such as slaughtering, defeathering, eviscerating, and preparing raw poultry
for cooking.
The virus is inactivated at temperatures achieved in usual cooking (at least
70 degrees Celsius at the centre of the product), and consumption of properly
cooked poultry is not a high-risk activity. If this were the case, we would
see small family clusters of people having shared the same dish. What we do
seem to find is mostly individual cases of people who participated in the
above-mentioned high-risk activities. They have of course also consumed the
poultry afterwards. It would seem strange if in all these cases, they had been
the only ones eating the contaminated bird. Normally a chicken dish would be
shared among several persons.
Along the (often very short) food chain in rural Asia -- between slaughter of
an infected bird all the way to consuming it in a cooked dish -- the high-risk
activities are the ones in the first phases of the process as described above
and not the actual eating of the cooked dish.
However, there have been reports of a few cases potentially linked to
consumption of raw poultry ingredients (e.g. raw blood-based dishes). It
should therefore be reiterated that consumption of any raw poultry ingredients
must be considered a high-risk activity and banned.
Slaughtering, defeathering, and eviscerating poultry are very messy activities
that cannot be done "safely" unless in full protective gear; therefore such
activities under traditional Asian rural settings, with obviously diseased
birds, must be stopped. If properly explained and enforced by rural
populations in affected areas, this would go a long way towards stopping the
current pattern of human infections.
I hope that the above comments will provide to your readers a more balanced
understanding of the role of handling of poultry products in human infections
with avian influenza.

[In general I have no quarrel with Dr Ben Barek's comments. However, on
account of the rarity of cases of human infection with avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection in East Asia, there is still some ambiguity concerning
the precise mode of transmission of the virus to humans. In previous posts my
comments have in general tended to reflect local opinion.
