[The genotyped FMDV serotype O virus from North Korea has been
identified as a SEA topotype, Mya-98 strain, closely related to the
2010 strains in South Korea and Hong Kong. The report includes also a
dendogram, showing the relationship of the North Korean isolate to
other regional strains.

According to WRLFMD data (see ref 1), phylogenetic studies of the FMD
viruses belonging to the O/SEA/Mya-98 lineage, detected during 2010 in
Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region), China, the Republic of
Korea, Japan, Mongolia and eastern Russia indicate a close
relationship between this virus and those present in Malaysia, Myanmar
and Thailand in 2009 and point to at least 2 independent virus
introductions into the region from Southeast Asia.

The last follow-up report from North Korea (No 2) was submitted to
the OIE on 18 Apr 2011. An interactive map, showing the locations of
the 139 reported outbreaks, is available at
