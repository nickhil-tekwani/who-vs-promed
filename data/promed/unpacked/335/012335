7 provinces set for bird flu free status
-----------------------------------------
No new bird flu outbreaks have been reported in 7 provinces in the
past 3 weeks across the country, namely Ha Nam, Binh Phuoc, Ninh
Binh, Kien Giang, Ninh Thuan, Lam Dong and Ho Chi Minh City,
according to the Veterinary Department.

The department said on Sunday [13 Feb 2005] that the provinces of Ha
Nam (in the north) and Binh Phuoc (in the south) have reported no new
outbreaks for a month.

However, it said the disease still broke out on a scattered basis in
some localities, with the latest outbreaks reported in Long An, Bac
Lieu, Hai Duong, Hai Phong and Long An. Nearly 7000 chickens, ducks
and quail have been culled. The department warned that the increasing
demand for the transport of chickens during the Tet holiday posed a
high risk for the transmission of the virus.

Meanwhile, all H5N1 patients and those who were suspected of
contracting the lethal virus were discharged from tropical disease
hospitals in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City before the traditional Lunar
New Year Festival (Tet) on 9 Feb 2005. They all showed positive signs
of recovery. Dr. Nguyen Duc Hien, head of the National Institute for
Tropical Diseases, said experts from the World Health Organization
(WHO) will arrive in Viet Nam to study the transmission mechanism of
bird flu from chickens to humans. WHO will also study the production
of preventive vaccines in case the virus strain changes.

Officials close down 38 cockpits to fend off bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Phitsanulok officials have ordered the closure of 38 cockpits until
April [2005] to prevent the transportation of fowl, in a bid to
tackle a bird-flu outbreak in the province. The outbreak is mainly
confined to domestic fowl, and the province is well known for its
fighting cocks, deputy governor Direk Konkleab said yesterday [11 Feb
2005].

Random bird-flu tests found the virus in up to 70 percent of domestic
fowl, a result of the transportation of fighting cocks, Direk said.

Meanwhile, tambon [sub-district] Matume residents in the province's
Phrom Phiram district yesterday [11 Feb 2005] agreed to the culling
of 200 chickens and will continue efforts to eradicate bird flu, said
Lamphun Khumkham, head of the tambon administration. There have been
a lot of unnatural deaths among domestic fowl, and tests have
revealed some were infected with the virus, he said.

Suphan Buri authorities have culled almost 3000 chickens infected
with the virus in the province's Song Phi Nong district, said Weera
Romphopak, an acting livestock-development official.

Early this month [February 2005], 900 chickens in the district's tambon Sri
Samran, and 2000 in tambon Bang Plub, were culled, after tests showed they
were infected with the virus, the official said. "There have been no more
reports of fowl infected with the virus," Weera said.

[Maintaining control over the keeping, handling and movements of fighting
cocks is a complex, sometimes impossible task. Fighting cocks have been shown
to be involved in the spread of HPAI in Thailand since the early stages of
the current outbreak; a similar pattern had been seen with Newcastle disease
in California in 1971 and 2003, when that disease was associated with
national and international movements of fighting cocks. - Mod.AS]
