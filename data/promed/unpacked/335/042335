Gnathostomiasis acquired in Botswana
-------------------------------------
We have identified 2 separate clusters of gnathostomiasis acquired in
the Okavango Delta, Botswana, with a total of 8 confirmed or probable cases.

Both outbreaks (one in August, one in November 2008) occurred in
groups of people who ate raw, marinated bream (_Tilapia_ species).
After non-specific malaise and/or gastrointestinal discomfort, some
exposed individuals presented with recurrent episodes of painful
migratory skin nodules and transient urticaria. Several small worms
were extracted from localised skin lesions, and we identified 3rd
stage larvae of a _Gnathostoma_ species. These nematode parasites
have a complicated life cycle involving carnivorous mammals as
definitive hosts and a variety of intermediate and paratenic hosts,
including snakes, birds, frogs, eels, crustaceans and freshwater
fish. Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked fish,
crabs, or crayfish. The larvae migrate through skin and subcutaneous
tissues (the most common presentation), but also sometimes the
internal organs, including the eye or central nervous system in the
most serious forms of the disease.

Gnathostomiasis is well-known in Southeast Asia and Central and South
America and is regarded as an emerging imported disease resulting
from increasing international travel and adventurous eating. This is
the 1st description of the disease from Botswana; the only other
recognised outbreak in the region occurred on the Zambezi River in
western Zambia. Freshwater fish caught in Botswana and Zambia should
not be eaten raw.

[Humans become infected by eating undercooked fish or poultry
containing 3rd-stage larvae or, reportedly, by drinking water
containing infective 2nd-stage larvae in Cyclops.

Gnathostomiasis occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical areas
but has especially been reported from Southeast Asia, probably
because eating raw or undercooked fish is common there.

Gnathostomiasis has previously been reported from Zambia; see:

Zambia. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2003;68:707-9). - Mod.EP]
