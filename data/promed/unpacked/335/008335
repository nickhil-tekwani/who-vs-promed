More than half a billion bees dropped dead in Brazil within just 3 months, according to Bloomberg. Researchers say the main cause of death is pesticides, which could end up affecting more than the bees. As some of the most integral pollinators in nature, bees contribute to the reproduction of various plants. About 75% of the world's crops depend on pollination by bees, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports. FAO has warned about the importance of protecting bees to ensure food security. With 500 million dead in Brazil, the future of food has come into question.

The mass deaths of bees were reported by beekeepers in 4 Brazilian states. In Rio Grande do Sul alone, 400 million dead bees were found. Aldo Machado, vice president of Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul beekeeping association, told Bloomberg his colony was decimated in less than 48 hours after some of the bees 1st showed signs of illness. "As soon as the healthy bees began clearing the dying bees out of the hives, they became contaminated. They started dying en masse," Machado said.

Lab research points to pesticides with neonicotinoids and fipronil -- products banned in Europe -- as the main cause of death for most bees in Brazil. The use of these bee-killing pesticides spiked under former President Michel Temer and current President Jair Bolsonaro, according to Greenpeace's Unearthed. In just 3 years, 193 weedkillers and pesticides containing chemicals banned in the European Union were registered in Brazil, the Unearthed investigation revealed. Brazil has become the biggest buyer of pesticides in the world.

While the mass deaths of bees in Brazil occurred this year [2019], the link between pesticides and the decline of bee populations has long been studied. A 2014 study from Harvard University found pesticides play a key role in killing off the honey bee population in the United States.

Colony collapse disorder (CCD) has been affecting the US bee population since 2006. The disorder causes bees to disappear from their hives. While the root cause of CCD is a mystery, many experts believe a combination of factors, including pesticides, are the driving force, especially neonicotinoid pesticides.

[Honey bee (_Apis mellifera_ L.) colony collapse disorder (CCD), which appeared in 2005/2006, still lingers in many parts of the world. Recent research (see ProMED-mail post 20120330.1085129) suggested that pesticides were linked to the bee's colony collapse disorder. Another finding (ProMED-mail post 20130728.1850594) showed that fungicides are implicated in disease-driven bee mortalities. Pesticides may be interacting with a number of contributing factors resulting in bee populations crashes. - Mod.PMB
