A wildlife biologist at Grand Canyon National Park most likely died
from the plague contracted while performing a necropsy on a mountain
lion that later tested positive for the disease, officials said Fri 9 Nov 2007.

The 37 year old, who worked in the park's cougar collaring program,
became ill on 30 Oct 2007 and called out sick from for a couple of
days before being found dead in his home 2 Nov 2007. Tests were
positive for pneumonic plague. Officials said 49 people who came in
contact with York were given antibiotics as a precaution. None have
shown symptoms of the disease.

The biologist, whose family lives in Massachusetts, had skinned the
cougar and was exposed to its internal organs during the necropsy he
performed 3 days before developing symptoms, said David Wong, an
epidemiologist for the USA Public Health Service.

The cougar, which had died from the plague, was believed to have
remained in back-country areas where park visitors wouldn't normally
go, officials said.

The National Park Service is planning to review its safety guidelines
for wildlife biologists and make possible recommendations for
improvements. Park Superintendent Steve Martin said authorities were
examining whether the guidelines were followed in this case.

An average of 13 plague cases are reported in the USA each year. A
total of 14 percent of cases are fatal, according to the CDC. While
Arizona health officials say the disease appears to be on the rise in
the state, CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said plague cases weren't on
the rise nationally.

Plague is transmitted primarily by fleas and direct contact with
infected animals. When the disease causes pneumonia, it can be
transmitted from an infected person to a non-infected person by
airborne cough droplets. Cases are treatable with antibiotics.

Grand Canyon National Park issued new precautions for visitors after
lab tests indicated that a wildlife biologist had died from pneumonic
plague. The biologist was found dead 2 Nov 2007 in his home on the
canyon's South Rim, and the preliminary lab results were reported
today [9 Nov 2007].

Pamela Walls, parks spokeswoman, emphasized that the victim had
limited contact with visitors and that, in any event,
person-to-person transmission of the potentially fatal disease was
highly unlikely. According to the CDC, she said, such transmission
has not been observed in the USA since 1924.

However, because the disease, carried by fleas that feed off infected
rodents, can infect humans through flea bites or by direct contact
with infected animals, Walls said, officials are adding new
precautions to their usual advice to avoid feeding or approaching
wild animals. Among the recommendations:
- use insect repellent when visiting or working in areas where
plague might be active or rodents might be present;
- control fleas on pets by using flea collars or flea sprays;
- prevent pets from roaming loose;
- avoid exposure to rodent burrows and fleas and wild animals; and
- do not handle sick or dead animals.

Walls said 49 people, including co-workers and roommates but no park
visitors, are known to have had contact with the biologist, and they
have been put on antibiotics. So far none has shown symptoms, she
added. Walls also said she wasn't aware of any prior infections or
deaths involving the disease at the park.

[Primary pneumonic plague (1 percent of natural plague presentations)
arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious
aerosols, such as would be produced when there are pneumonic
complications in bubonic plague. It is, importantly, the form of the
disease that would be most likely if _Yersinia pestis_ were to be
used in an aerosol as a biological weapon. Such an aerosol would
likely be used in an indoor setting to avoid the outdoor UV radiation
inactivation of the organism.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters [6.5 feet] as being
at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be
carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact
with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious
body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive
preventive antimicrobial therapy.
