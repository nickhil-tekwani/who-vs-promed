The link between a respiratory virus called enterovirus D68 and a polio-like illness has been bolstered by new research showing a spike in both the virus and reports of acute flaccid myelitis in children in 2018, a new government report suggests.

The report released [Thu 28 Mar 2019] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reinforces previous research that the virus strikes every other year and in the late summer and early fall.

In 2018, 358 of 2579 tested patients were positive for EV-D68. In the same year, the CDC confirmed 223 cases of the polio-like illness, acute flaccid myelitis. That compares to 2017, when researchers found the virus in 2 out of 2433 patients with acute respiratory illness who were tested.

The average age of patients who tested positive for EV-D68 was 3. Almost 60 percent of patients with EV-D68 were male, according to the CDC.

The new report came from a network which tracks acute respiratory illness among children and teens under the age of 18 at 7 US medical centers: Cincinnati; Houston; Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville; Pittsburgh; Rochester, New York; and Seattle.

This spike in cases in 2018 suggests there will be fewer infections with EV-D68 and fewer cases of AFM in 2019, Dr Matthew Elrick, pediatric neurologist and AFM expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine told NBC News. "But just because it's been every other year so far that doesn't mean it will continue to be exactly every other year."

AFM first attracted attention in 2014 when 120 cases were reported nationally.

The link with EV-D68 has been hard to prove conclusively because the symptoms of AFM often show up after the virus has cleared the respiratory tract, Elrick said. And tests have shown several viruses such as coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus A71 in the bodies of patients, according to earlier CDC reports.

"But the fact that outbreaks of EV-D68 and AFM come together -- there were spikes in the number of cases in 2014, 2016, and 2018 -- and the fact that EV-D68 shows up in respiratory specimens of roughly half of AFM patients certainly adds support to the fact that it's likely to be the leading causative agent," said Elrick.

Polio-like disease challenges even parents with top connections Experts suspect that in many of the children infected with EV-D68, symptoms are limited to the respiratory tract.

"There's probably a very small percentage of kids who get an infection and develop AFM as a result," Elrick said. "Most commonly they are asymptomatic or have a mild cold."

Scientists are still learning how AFM is similar to polio. While both viruses can cause paralysis, they affect different parts of the body. AFM is very rare, but that could change, Elrick said. Polio didn't immediately become a widespread problem and EV-D68 is in the same family of viruses, he added.

Some experts have suggested that the enterovirus could mutate to become more infectious. As yet, "there is no evidence to suggest that changes in the virus are associated with transmission or infectiousness," said Dr Susan Gerber, a CDC researcher in the division of viral diseases at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told NBC News in an email.

The CDC's data shows an increasing number of cases in the even numbered years: In 2017, CDC received information for 35 confirmed cases of AFM in 16 states. In 2016, CDC received information for 149 confirmed cases of AFM in 39 states and DC.

In 2015, CDC received information for 22 confirmed cases of AFM in 17 states. From August to December 2014, CDC received information for 120 people confirmed cases of AFM in 34 states. Elrick said he found the number of children diagnosed with AFM in 2018 to be concerning, since it falls in line with the trend of increasing cases shown in previous years.

Abstract
--------
Since 2014, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a long-recognized condition associated with polioviruses, nonpolio enteroviruses, and various other viral and nonviral causes, has been reemerging globally in epidemic form. This unanticipated reemergence is ironic, given that polioviruses, once the major causes of AFM, are now at the very threshold of global eradication and cannot therefore explain any aspect of AFM reemergence. Instead, the new AFM epidemic has been temporally associated with reemergences of nonpolio enteroviruses such as EV-D68, until recently thought to be an obscure virus of extremely low endemicity. This perspective reviews the enigmatic epidemiologic, virologic, and diagnostic aspects of epidemic AFM reemergence; examines current options for clinical management; discusses future research needs; and suggests that the AFM epidemic offers important clues to mechanisms of viral disease emergence.

Perspective
-----------
In recent decades, new human infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Nipah virus infection, among others have emerged. Well-known diseases also have reemerged because of human movement, crowding, and other population factors (such as, dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever), warfare and natural disasters (such as, cholera), and viral evolution (such as, poultry-adapted influenza A H5N1 and H7N9). Joining this list is epidemic acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), characterized by sudden denervation-associated muscle paralysis of healthy children (and occasionally adults) in one or more limbs that mimics poliomyelitis but which is not caused by polioviruses. AFM was first recognized around 2010 as a seemingly novel condition and quickly grew into an alarming and important disease threat, with the 1st large outbreak occurring in 2014. Since then, seasonal waves have occurred every other year in the United States, the largest occurring in 2018 (Fig. 1). Because of its uncertain cause and pathogenesis, enigmatic epidemiology, and limited treatment options, the disease captured national attention and triggered considerable concern among parents of young children.

Figure 1. Epidemic curve of 551 confirmed cases of AFM reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by month of onset, [14 Aug 2014 to 31 Jan 2019. The epidemic curves of summer/fall AFM correspond closely to typical seasonal peaks of most NPEVs, including EV-D68. Note that the US epidemics have occurred in 2-year cycles, with peak case onsets in the middle week of September in 2014, 2016, and 2018 but with few cases during any season of the intervening years 2015 and 2017.

Background. AFM actually is a newly coined term for a subset of cases of the long-recognized syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in which cord myelitis is documented, typically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualization. The term AFP subsumes additional causes of flaccid paralysis such as trauma, tumors, and immunopathologic disorders. Clinical descriptions of AFP appeared in medical textbooks in 1789. Clusters of cases began to be recognized in 1840, with larger epidemics documented in Sweden in 1881 and in the United States in 1894. Early, widespread epidemics came to be referred to as "poliomyelitis" ("polio" for short, derived from the Greek words for inflammation of the neural gray matter). In the late 1940s, the breakthrough (and Nobel Prize-winning) technology of viral cultivation in tissue culture led to the isolation of 3 infectious agents of epidemic polio (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3), to further clinical and epidemiologic characterization of poliomyelitis, to effective polio vaccines, and to global polio eradication efforts, now in their final stages.

Multiple broadly pathogenic nonpolio enteroviruses. Poliovirus isolation techniques also led to discovery and characterization of a large, ubiquitous group of picornaviruses termed "enteroviruses," containing not only the three polioviruses but also at least 110 "nonpolio enteroviruses" (NPEVs). Unlike classical fecal-oral transmission of polioviruses, some NPEVs are more commonly transmitted by the respiratory route. NPEVs can cause a wide array of disease syndromes, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, myositis, pleurodynia, myocarditis, maculopapular and vesicular rashes, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, herpangina, meningitis, encephalitis, so-called "neonatal viral sepsis," possibly type 1 diabetes, and -- occasionally -- sporadic AFM.

Circulating NPEVs usually are replaced, in part or in whole, by other NPEVs in subsequent seasons; however, some NPEVs may reappear at intervals of 2 or more years . For example, in Southeast Asia (but not in the rest of the world), EV-A71 has occurred in 2- to 3-year cycles; in previous decades, 5-year cycles were noted for EVA9 and EVB5; and various other cyclic patterns have been noted for different NPEVs.

Sporadic AFM inevitably appears at low incidence during widespread seasonal circulation of almost any NPEV. Some NPEVs, such as, EV-A70 and EV-A71, have been historically more frequent causes of AFM than have others. Beginning in 1988, polio eradication efforts further clarified NPEV epidemiology via the global establishment of national surveillance systems to identify all cases of AFP. As many as 60 000 documented cases of nonpolio AFP are reported annually; cases are predominantly associated with NPEVs or Guillain-Barre syndrome, the latter of which is itself often associated with NPEVs.

By 2014 to 2015, large AFM epidemics began to appear across the United States and globally (Fig. 1); again, such outbreaks typically occurred in temporal association with EV-D68 epidemics. The EV-D68/AFM epidemiological association has since become unmistakable. 2 unprecedented epidemics have been recurring in the same places at the same times: beginning in 2014, AFM epidemics in the United States have recurred in 2-year cycles of increasing magnitude, usually during seasonal EV-D68 circulation.

Although EV-D68 appears to be good at covering its tracks, the epidemiologic evidence that EV-D68 is a major cause of epidemic AFM, while circumstantial, is nonetheless strong. Since historically many or even most cases of nonpolio AFP/AFM have been caused by circulating NPEVs, it is logical to suspect that during explosive EV-D68 epidemicity, many or most AFM cases would be caused by EV-D68 as well, even as AFM cases associated with other NPEVs continue to occur at lower background rates.

As important as determining the cause of AFM is the establishment of optimal interventions to prevent, limit, or reverse neurologic damage that is often advanced at the time of clinical presentation. Attempts at treatment with interventions such as intravenous immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, and antiviral drugs such as pleconaril have been largely unsuccessful. Experimental nerve transfer to adjacent unaffected segments of the cord may offer improvement to some patients. Of greater promise is mounting evidence that early intensive physical therapy, the value of which has been well documented for polio , may benefit nonpolio AFM patients as well. Therapy for polio was developed to be aggressive and comprehensive in addressing each of the three conceptual stages of acute, convalescent, and chronic polio paralytic disease.

A major challenge in the study of this disease is that AFM is an uncommon, sporadically occurring complication of a common infection that is difficult to diagnose with viral specificity.

Until such time as the causes of the AFM epidemic are better understood, development of preventive vaccines will remain challenging. NPEV virus-specific diagnostics are needed, as are virus-specific serologic tests to support epidemiologic studies. Alsok needed are experimental animal models to study viral neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness properties , genetic markers, and drug therapies. These and other research challenges are daunting because the NPEVs have been neglected for decades. Watching healthy children become permanently paralyzed virtually overnight by a seemingly random, lightning-strike disease is as heartbreaking today as it was in the polio era. The trajectory of AFM over the past 5 years suggests that the problem is getting worse, and so it is critical that we galvanize our efforts to learn more about, and respond adequately to, this ubiquitous, often crippling, continually reemerging group of viruses.
