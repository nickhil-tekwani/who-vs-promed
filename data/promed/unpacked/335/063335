The death count from cholera in Iran is at least 44, with more than 4,300
people infected, according to Deputy Health Minister Ali-Akbar Sayari. He
said most of the victims of the disease, known as Cholera El tor, are over
50 years old.
Other experts and newspapers, however, have said the number of people
infected is higher, and accused the authorities of not informing the public
of the extent of the problem.
Zan daily said there was a cholera epidemic in the central provinces of
Tehran, Qom and Esfahan as well as southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan.
The epidemic had caused growing concern in the city of Karaj, west of
Tehran, where 18 people have died of the disease, the newspaper said, also
criticizing health authorities in that city for "not publishing correct
statistics" on the number of people infected or killed by the disease.
"They believe that such statistics will only create panic, but correct
information can help as a warning and deterrent to baseless rumor," it
said.
Zan said hospitals in Karaj had set up special sections to cope with the
growing number of cholera patients, and that the authorities were
disinfecting the houses of those infected with the disease.
Health clinics in rural areas, where people do not have access to purified
water, have disinfected wells and channels and distributed information
leaflets to the public.
