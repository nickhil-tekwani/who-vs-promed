The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, represented by the General Organization for Veterinary Services [GOVS] and the organization in charge of animal and poultry wealth, undertook, in coordination with poultry producers, the setting of a timetable for
the completion of the preparation of detailed maps for the project named "poultry villages" in desert country zones. Other actions will consist of: ensuring adherence to preventive measures in feed mills; assessing the commitment to the requirements of bio-safety; preventing bird movements without prior examination; enhancing education; reducing household poultry husbandry and the indiscriminate use of vaccines to curb epidemic diseases; encouraging investment in poultry industry; and offering the possibility to unlicensed farms to obtain their licenses.

An official source at the Ministry of Agriculture, declared in a statement for "Youm7", that the ministry, based on the instructions of Dr. Salah Helal, Minister of Agriculture, began to prepare an emergency plan for the transfer of poultry farms to the desert, providing an opportunity to overcome the present problems facing poultry industry and ensure the application of bio-safety and other preventive measures. Those areas will be designed in the modern way. He added that the transfer of poultry farms outside the urban space aims at protecting citizens from any epidemics of poultry origin, such as bird flu.

The Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with the General Union of Poultry Division, poultry Chamber of Commerce has prepared a plan for the transfer of poultry farms outside the Valley and Delta to back desert in 5 areas in order to control poultry diseases and epidemics. Of these there are 21 000 and 60 000 acres respectively east and west of the province of Minya; 28 000 and 60 000 acres respectively in eastern and western Beni Suef; and 95 000 acres in various oases, in addition to the approval of the Planning Commission to allocate 28 000 acres on the Suez and 33 000 acres in Natrun Valley.

[This sounds like good news for the containment of highly pathogenic influenza (HPAI) in poultry, and hence in humans, in Egypt. Hopefully, this series of decisions is backed by a realistic regulatory frame and incentives for the poultry producers and families who raise backyard
poultry.

The dimensions reached by the infection in this country are so alarming that such a radical strategy is required. The genetic shifts
of the virus are indeed of great concern to the scientific community, as it is feared that future mutants of the virus may acquire the
potential for inter-human propagation. - Mod.AB

Between November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases during this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar 2015, a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met in Egypt with key stakeholders and analysed the situation.

The report of the team included -- among other issues -- the following comments, addressing the epizootic (poultry-health aspects) of the
subject:

"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.

The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force".

The report was presented and discussed in posting 20150516.3366602. It may be assumed that the current new measures have been undertaken following study of the experts' team report.

It remains to be seen if and how these measures will affect the H5N1 situation in the numerous backyard flocks in Egypt. - Mod.AS
