---------------------------------------------------------
[The said posting including the following text with an error]:
"The virus originates from Africa, was isolated several times in mites in
South America [sic; should have been edited to South Africa] and found in
Europe once during an outbreak in Vienna in 2001".

[Though the commentary in posting 20060825.2402 was apparently corrective
by including the right geographic terms, for subscribers' convenience we
reproduce the following information, extracted from Gideon database, as
included in posting 20031024.2665:
"Usutu virus (vectors: _Coquillettidia aurites_, _Culex neavei_, and _Culex
perfuscus_) has been identified in a single case of human infection (fever
with rash) in South Africa. The agent is named after the Usutu River in
Swaziland, and has been found in rodents (African soft-furred rats of
_Praomys_ species) and in birds (_Andropadus virens_, _Bycanistes sharpei_,
_Turdus libonyanus_) in South Africa, Cameroon, Mozambique, Nigeria,
Uganda, Senegal, and the Central African Republic.
In 2001, Usutu virus was confirmed as the cause of death among several wild
and captive birds in Austria: blackbirds, Great Gray Owls (_Strix
nebulosa_), and Barn Swallows (_Hirundo rustica_) in Upper Austria and the
Vienna Zoo".
Prof Calisher is acknowledged for bringing the error, which remained
uncorrected in the received item, to our attention. - Mod.AS]
