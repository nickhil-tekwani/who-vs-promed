Elk test positive for brucellosis
---------------------------------
The 4th year of a 5-year pilot test-and-removal program on 3 western
Wyoming elk feed-grounds concluded on Friday morning [13 Feb 2009]. A total
of 50 cow elk tested positive for the brucellosis over January and February
2009, including 5 that tested positive on Friday and were shipped to slaughter.

In 2 separate efforts in January and February 2009, state wildlife
officials trapped and processed 932 elk through the chutes at the 3
feed-grounds, including 421 adult females that were subject to brucellosis
testing. All 50 cow elk that tested positive for the disease were
transported to an eastern Idaho slaughterhouse for processing.

The brucellosis testing project is a recommendation of the Wyoming
Brucellosis Coordination Team in an effort to reduce the brucellosis rate
in the Pinedale elk herd.

Brucellosis is a contagious disease that causes abortions in hoofed animals
and is present in elk and bison in the Yellowstone region. Brucellosis
transmitted to cattle herds from elk caused Wyoming to lose its
brucellosis-free market status in 2004.

Wyoming later regained its brucellosis-free status in September 2006.
However, cattle from a herd near Daniel were found to be positive for the
disease in June 2008. That cattle herd was sent to slaughter.

[Brucellosis has always been a problem in the Greater Yellowstone area. The
transmission between elk and cattle has always been an issue. The test and
slaughter policy of recent years has created some consternation within some
groups, but as this is the only place in the USA still having brucellosis,
this may eventually be a solution to the situation. - Mod.TG
