In the wake of the African swine fever (ASF) killing nearly 15 000 pigs in Assam and spreading to new areas despite preventive measures, the state government is preparing to go for mass culling, according to media reports.

Earlier this month [May 2020], Assam Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister Atul Bora had said that the Centre has advised the state government to go for the culling of pigs affected by ASF.

The disease was first reported in November-December 2019 from areas of China bordering Arunachal Pradesh. Pigs in the eastern part of Assam started dying in mid-April [2020].

[According to earlier reports, following the deaths of nearly 2000 pigs in 6 districts of Assam, 17 samples were sent to India's National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases ("the Bhopal Institute") for tests. Similarly, 62 samples were sent from 2 districts in Arunachal Pradesh.

"All 17 tissue samples from Assam were positive for ASFV genome by real-time PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis. Eleven of 62 samples from Arunachal Pradesh were positive for ASFV genome, according to the NIHSAD test results" (https://tinyurl.com/yazpanxa).

According to FAO's "ASF situation in Asia" update of 14 May 2020, the Assam State government announced on 12 May that ASF has killed 14 465 pigs in 10 districts in Assam State. Districts affected include Biswanath, Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur, Sivasagar, and Jorhat. Pigs in the eastern part of Assam State started dying in mid-April. Assam State Agriculture Minister banned transportation of pigs from outside the state on 25 Apr 2020 and prohibited pig transportation in affected districts. - Mod.AS]

[2] India (Arunachal Pradesh): ASF suspected in wild boar

The virus of the deadly African swine fever (ASF) has spread to the wild of Arunachal Pradesh.

The forest officials in the state retrieved the carcasses of 6 wild boars in East Siang district. Several other wild boars were reported to have also died in Upper Siang district in the past few days.

Divisional Forest Officer, Tashi Mize, suspected that ASF was the reason behind the deaths of the animals.

"The carcasses of 6 wild boars were retrieved from a community forest, located some 20-25 km (12.4-15.5 mi) from (East Siang district headquarters) Pasighat and upstream river Sille. They were of 2 adults, 1 semi-adult and 3 piglets. We suspect that they died due to ASF," Mize told The New Indian Express.

He said the locals had informed him of the deaths. Three forest officials, who had marched around 10 km (6.2 mi) to reach the site and retrieve the carcasses, collected samples. The samples will be tested at the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases Laboratory.

"Porcupines eat such carcasses but I don't think they will be infected. The other animals are also unlikely to be infected by the ASF," Mize said, adding, "The Veterinary Department has identified all areas in the grip of ASF. We have issued instructions to all concerned to ensure that wild boars and domestic pigs don't come near each other."

The state's Forest Department has advised people not to hunt wild boars or eat their meat. The state has also recorded the deaths of domestic pigs in recent times.

The situation is worse in Assam where over 13 000 domestic pigs have died of ASF so far. As the domestic pigs might infect wild boars, the government has already alerted the forest department.

The authorities at the Kaziranga National Park have dug a 2-km-long (1.2 mi) and 6-feet-deep [1.8 m] trench to protect the park's 15 000 wild boars.

There is a village adjacent to the park's Agoratoli range where the locals rear pigs. There is always a movement of domestic as well as wild boars in the area. As this could endanger the lives of wild boars, the park authorities have dug the trench.

AFS was first detected in 1921 in Kenya. No vaccines or medicines have been discovered so far.

[ASF in India's wild boar, if confirmed, adds a serious epidemiologic aspect to the situation. China has reported sporadic outbreaks of the disease in wild boar (see OIE's global ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/y826f2gf; click on the area of interest, zoom in).

ASF is yet to be notified by India to the OIE. - Mod.AS
