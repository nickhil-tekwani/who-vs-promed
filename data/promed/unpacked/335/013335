First Report of Cassava virus X in Cassava in Venezuela.

E. I. Chaparro-Martínez and G. Trujillo-Pinto, Facultad de Agronomía,
Universidad Central de Venezuela, Maracay, Ar. 2101, Apdo. 4579, Venezuela.
Plant Dis. 85:1119, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-0802- 01N, 2001.
Accepted for publication 26 June 2001.
[Viral infections are limiting production of cassava (_Manihot
esculenta_Crantz), a vegetatively propagated tropical root crop (2). To
survey for [cassava virus diseases, [samples of plants expressing
symptoms were collected from the Venezuelan cassava production states [of
Amazonas, Aragua, Barinas, Cojedes, Monagas, and Portuguesa.
Mechanical transmissions to ... _Chenopodium quinoa_ and a previously
described DAS-ELISA procedure (3) were used to test for the presence of
Cassava virus X (CsVX). The DAS-ELISA procedure used gamma globulin diluted
1/2000, conjugate diluted 1/2000, and leaf sap extracts diluted 1/100 (1).
CsVX and frog skin disease (detected [in graft inoculation tests with
cultivar Secundina and electron microscopy) were [found in mixed
infections in plants collected in Barinas.
CsVX was not detected in any of the plants collected in the other surveyed
areas. The low incidence of the virus (11.43 percent; 4 of 35 samples)
suggests that CsVX [was recently introduced ...via infected planting
stock. Transmission of the virus is 100 percent when infected cuttings are
used as propagation material. CsVX caused no symptoms on any of the
cultivars examined in the field, and the occurrence of symptomless CsVX in
Venezuela may result from the inadvertent use of cuttings from
virus-infected plants.
This is the first report of CsVX infecting cassava in Venezuela.

[CsVX was first reported in Colombia in 1986 on cassava. It is one of 2
potexviruses infecting cassava that are recognized by the ICTV; the
other is Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV). According to Francisco
Morales, a plant virologist at CIAT in Colombia, CsVX does not cause
noticeable symptoms even in the most sensitive cultivars. Its detection in
Venezuela is probably a chance event, and we do not know whether the virus
was already there or was introduced in infected cassava stakes.
In a message sent to me on 11 Nov 2001, Morales indicated that the etiology
of cassava frog skin disease remains unknown despite research over several
years, though 2 possible etiologies have been proposed: 1) a phytoreo-like
virus or 2) a pathogen other than a virus. Research continues.
At this stage, all that can be said is that the disease is caused by an
unknown agent. If any of our readers have information about the possible
etiology of frog skin disease, please let me know.
Note: According to the 7th Report of the ICTV, CsCMV induces mosaic
symptoms in cassava. It spreads in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan,
... the USA (Florida), and Cote d'Ivoire (possibly).
Though this disease is symptomless, it must be remembered that synergistic
interactions between symptomless viruses and other viruses often result in
disease symptoms that are much more severe than either virus alone. An
example is potato co-infected with Potato X potexvirus virus and Potato Y
potyvirus, which results in lethal necrotic disease in both potato
and tomato. - Mod.DH
