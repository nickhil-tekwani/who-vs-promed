Mongolia plans to launch a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against the infectious animal foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), starting Monday [18 Apr 2022], its State Emergency Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday [13 Apr 2022].

Since the beginning of this year [2022], a total of 422 epicenters of FMD have been registered in 20 of the country's total of 21 provinces due to an FMD outbreak, according to the SEC.

As of Wednesday [13 Apr 2022], a quarantine regime has been continued in 145 epicenters in 15 provinces, it said.

The landlocked country strives to develop its livestock sector by increasing meat exports in a bid to diversify its mining-dependent economy. However, frequent outbreaks of livestock animal diseases such as the FMD, lumpy skin disease, and mad cow disease impede its endeavor.

The country's meat exports have been suspended since last June [2021] due to infectious animal diseases, according to the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

[The continuing FMD (serotype O) epizootic in Mongolia started (recurred) on 6 Aug 2021. According to Mongolia's page on the WRLFMD (FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease) website, sequences for genotyping were received from Mongolia at Pirbright on 9 Aug 2021. The virus was identified as FMDV serotype O, topotype 'ME-SA,' lineage 'Ind-2001,' sublineage 'e.' A similar virus had been identified in samples from Mongolia during 2018 and 2019. The detailed report, including a link to vaccine-matching strain tests results, is available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2021-00012-MOG-GTR-O-O_001.pdf.

According to a report of Mongolia's News Agency dated 13 Apr 2022, "during 2021, Mongolia received 23 million doses of FMD vaccine. In 2022, 12 million doses of vaccine have been received from Russia. This is enough for 15% of FMD-susceptible animals."

Mongolia's livestock population is, reportedly, 67.1 million strong, composed of 4.1 million horses, 4.7 million cattle, 472 900 camels, 30.0 million sheep, and 27.7 million goats (FAO, 2020). - Mod.AS
