Three new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were confirmed among poultry in Taiwan on Thursday [8 Mar 2017], the Council of Agriculture (COA) said. They include 2 cases involving the H5N2 strain and one the H5N8 strain, the council said.

Since the start of the year [2017], 84 poultry farms in Taiwan have been hit by HPAI, including 11 that were infected with the H5N6 strain, which is transmissible to humans, resulting in the culling of 649 993 birds, according to the COA.

[At present, 3 HPAI serotypes are circulating in Taiwan. The most recent follow-up reports addressing them were published by the OIE on 7 Mar 2017, as follows:

1. The 2nd follow-up report on the HPAI H5N6 epizootic that started on 2 Feb 2017: This report includes details of 3 new outbreaks (see, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23073). This virus has affected, so far, wild ducks as well as poultry (chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys); the HPAI H5N6 virus strain is considered to be zoonotic (see 20161212.4689184).

2. The 52nd follow-up report on the HPAI H5N2 epizootic that started on 7 Jan 2015: This report includes details of 21 new outbreaks (see, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23077).

3. The 33rd follow-up report on the HPAI H5N8 epizootic that started on 8 Jan 2015: This report includes details of 2 new outbreaks (see, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23075).

A stamping-out policy is being applied in relation to all 3 virus strains/events in Taiwan. A human case, caused by HPAI H7N9, was infected while on China's mainland.

The 3 new outbreaks, reported in the above media item, are expected to be included in the next follow-up report. - Mod.AS
