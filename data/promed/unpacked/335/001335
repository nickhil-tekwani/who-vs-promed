As the city began to receive reports of people getting sick after
attending the Taste of Chicago, the visitors had one thing in common:
they all had eaten at the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth. The
Lincoln Park eatery's stand was identified Wed 11 Jul 2007, as the
source of a salmonella outbreak, the 1st one confirmed at the
festival in 20 years. The contaminated food sickened as many as 17
people, including 3 who were hospitalized.
City health officials still are trying to pinpoint which of the
restaurant's Taste dishes, which included cucumber hummus and
pomegranate chicken among others, was the culprit.
The 1st confirmed case of the foodborne illness was reported to
health officials Mon 9 Jul 2007, and more came in, prompting the city
to notify the public about the outbreak on 11 Jul 2007, and to warn
people of the symptoms and causes behind the common bacteria, which
is spread by eating contaminated foods. The Taste of Chicago ended
Sun 8 Jul 2007.
City health officials began conducting phone interviews this week
with those who reported being ill to narrow down the source of the
outbreak. Their responses to questions about what they ate in the
days leading up to their stomach problems led to one conclusion,
officials said. "Pars Cove was the only booth in common among all 17
cases," said Susan Gerber, the Health Department's medical director
for communicable diseases. At least one of those hospitalized in the
outbreak says it had to be the hummus.
City officials were quick to point out how few people were affected
by the outbreak out of 3.5 million visitors to the festival.
Officials said were perplexed by the salmonella outbreak because
their inspection process at the festival is thorough: 4 Health
Department inspectors comb the booths at Taste of Chicago looking for
problems, stopping at each of 70 booths at least 4 times daily,
officials said. They measure the temperature of the dishes with a
digital thermometer and routinely throw out trays of food that are
not up to code. Each year, they toss about 2000 pounds (907 kg) of
food and, in effect, can shut down a booth if they trash its entire
supply, officials said.
Inspectors threw out food from the Pars Cove booth at least once at
this year's [2007] Taste of Chicago, although the Health Department
did not make its records of the incident available.
The city, which is leading the investigation, notified state
officials of the outbreak Tue 10 Jul 2007, said Connie Austin of the
Illinois Department of Public Health. State labs conduct "serotyping"
tests on stool samples of people with confirmed cases of
salmonellosis to identify which of the more than 1000 strains is
involved, Austin said. The Heidelberg serotype was found in people
who got sick after eating at the Taste of Chicago, she said.
In recent days, state labs have confirmed 9 cases of illness caused
by the Heidelberg serotype of the bacterium. The number of victims
could increase as doctors report patients with salmonellosis and more
serotyping and interviews are completed, she said.

[It is likely given the small number of cases (at least so far) that
the contaminated food was served for only a brief time at the Food
Festival. No information is given regarding what day (or days) the
affected individuals attended.
