You recently asked:
>[Well, is this (archive 970903123440) the first reported
penicillin-resistant _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or not? If it is not, then
is it among the few reports of PRSP? If it is the first report, then
whether it is to have been expected or not is irrelevant to the finding.
We would appreciate it if someone with other than an opinion on this would
let us know. -- Mod CHC
The PARADIGM annotated literature index contains a few references on the
subject of PRSP, including:
Simor AE, Louie L, Goodfellow J, et al. Emergence of Penicillin-Resistant
Streptococcus pneumoniae - Southern Ontario, Canada, 1993-1994 MMWR
1995;44(11):207-15. 7.9% of 202 nonduplicate isolates in a laboratory
serving physicians, clinics, nursing homes and the emergency department of
a teaching hospital were resistant to penicillin. This contrasts with 2.4%,
1.5%, and 1.3% rates reported from 1977-1990 in Alberta, Ontario and
Quebec, respectively.

resistance in United States sentinel site hospitals.

series report for 1991-1994 reporting 15 intermediate and 4 high level
penicillin-resistant isolates among 344 tested by MIC determination, and
2.8% resistant among 922 tested by oxacillin screening.
