Health officials say 2 recent incidents in which swimmers at Loch
Raven Reservoir were attacked by a rabid beaver should remind people
that those "no swimming" signs are there for a reason.
"The take-home lesson is that one way to avoid unwanted contact with
wildlife is to not swim were you are not supposed to swim," said Gary
Thompson, supervisor of disease control for the Baltimore County
Department of Health, which investigated the attacks. In other words,
Thompson said, "Don't swim in the water that you drink."
Thompson said that most likely one rabid beaver, now dead, was
responsible for an attack on a swimmer on Sun 12 Aug 2007 and another
incident a day earlier. The attacks occurred within a half mile of each other.
The victim in the 12 Aug 2007 attack was a woman who was accompanied
by her husband and 3 grown sons. "She was bitten severely on her
upper thigh," Thompson said. "Her husband pulled the beaver off and
killed it with a rock but got scratched in the process."
The woman and her husband are both being treated [post exposure] with
rabies vaccine.
In the 11 Aug 2007 incident, a lone swimmer was attacked by a beaver
that escaped after biting the swimmer. That victim is also receiving
rabies vaccine. The county health department is withholding names of
the bite victims at the victims' request.
In the days immediately following the 11 Aug 2007 attack, health
officials were trying to locate an unidentified swimmer who came to
the victim's rescue after hearing cries for help. They feared he also
might have been exposed. But by the end of the week, he came forward
and was found not to be at risk.
Thompson said that rabies is "endemic" and "uncontrolled" in
wildlife. Raccoons, skunks, foxes and bats are the disease's most
frequent victims, he said.
According to Thompson, "The 1st terrestrial cases of rabies (animals
other than bats) were reported in Baltimore County in the early
1980s, and today, reports of infected wildlife are common."
He said there is a map on the U.S. Center for Disease Control and
Prevention's website
<http://www.cdc.gov>
that gives the location of all reports of rabid animals.
"Baltimore County and the surrounding counties are almost the
epicenter of the outbreak in the mid-Atlantic region," he said. "Our
area on the CDC map looks like one big black dot."
The good news is that attacks on humans by rabid wild animals are
rare. The 2 cases this month [August 2007] are the 1st attacks by a
beaver that Thompson has heard of during his 13 years on the job.
"The last sensational case we had was last year [2006] when a man
walking his dog was attacked and had face-to-face contact with a
rabid raccoon, which he drowned by hand."
Due to the effectiveness of the vaccine used today, human fatalities
from rabies are also rare, even though rabies is almost always fatal
if humans exposed to it don't get treatment before the onset of symptoms.
According to the CDC, in recent years, there have been only one or 2
fatalities per year nationwide. A century ago, there were more than
100 rabies-related deaths annually.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley
[In 2001, wild animals accounted for 93 percent of all reported cases
of rabies in the United States. Raccoons were the most frequently
reported rabid wildlife species (37.2 percent of all animal cases
during 2001), followed by skunks (30.7 percent), bats (17.2 percent),
foxes (5.9 percent), and other wild animals, including rodents and
lagomorphs (0.7 percent). Reported cases in raccoons and foxes
decreased 0.4 percent and 3.5 percent respectively from the totals
reported in 2000. Reported cases in skunks, and bats increased 2.6
percent, and 3.3 percent respectively from the totals reported in
2000. Cases attributable to contact with rabid beavers have been very
rare. - Mod.CP]
