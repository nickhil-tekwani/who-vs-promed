I find it strange that there should be so much confusion over the identity
of the virus causing all the panic in New York.
There is a monoclonal antibody (546) which I published years ago that
identifies West Nile virus uniquely, i.e., it is negative for Kunjin virus
or any other flavivirus. This monoclonal antibody will show up in an
immunofluorescence test on infected brain smears and almost certainly will
have been used in the tests in Colorado, since I supplied it to them some
years ago.
Moreover, if there are sequence data spanning the envelope gene (which I am
sure there are by now), then it is quite easy to distinguish West Nile from
Kunjin or SLE [viruses] for that matter. The amino acid sequences of each
of these viruses are unique and many of the people at CDC Colorado are
perfectly capable of identifying these viruses precisely using standard
alignment methods.
Therefore, I cannot understand why the virus is constantly referred to as
"WN-like" virus -- unless of course it is neither WN nor Kunjin virus.
The question of how and when it arrived in the USA is of course intriguing
but that should be a reasonably easy question to answer now that the
sequence data are available.

[There is no "panic" in New York City. It would take a great deal more than
a virus to cause panic there.
I cannot answer the question as to why there has been so much difficulty
definitively identifying this virus, as I am not privy to the details of the
methods and reagents being used. Keep in mind that arboviruses were
identified and named based on their antigenic relationships. The
flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae, genus _Flavivirus_), to which West Nile,
St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and Kunjin
viruses (plus about 60 others) belong have been studied extensively (de
Madrid AT & Porterfield JS [1974] The flaviviruses (group B arboviruses) : a
cross-neutralization study . J gen Virol 23:91-96; Calisher CH, Shope RE,
Brandt W, Dalrymple J, Karabatsos N, Porterfield J, & Westaway E [1989]
Antigenic relationships among viruses of the genus _Flavivirus_ (family
Flaviviridae). J. Gen. Virol. 70:37-43).
Kunjin virus differs antigenically from West Nile virus, else it would not
have been given a distinct name, it would have been called West Nile virus.
That the RNA sequences of West Nile and Kunjin viruses are closely aligned
only means they are closely related. Sequencing identifies flavivirus
sequences, not flaviviruses (one could argue against this, but not with me).
In order to definitively identify an arbovirus, two-way (field isolate and
antibody against it tested against reference viruses and antibody against
them) neutralization tests are called for. Obviously, this cannot be done
without antibody to the field isolate. Routine production of such antibody
takes some weeks, so that the tests that have been done to now likely were
one-way (field isolate tested against antibodies to reference viruses). It
is possible to produce very specific antibody by inoculating virus into the
spleens of mice and then extracting the antibody a few days later. The use
of Ernie's monoclonal antibody, however, could provide a short-cut to such a
procedure and the virus could be identified by immunofluorescence within a
few hours at most. - Mod CHC]
