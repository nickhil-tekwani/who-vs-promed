A mysterious disease broke out in Lalpora village [in Tangmarg tehsil, Jammu and Kashmir] affecting at least 8 school children at Government Primary School Band Mohalla at Lalpora. The children developed rashes and complained of fever. The schoolteachers and the parents of the children informed the health officials at Kunzar. On Wednesday [23 Apr 2014] a team of doctors of Kunzar Primary Health Centre visited the school and examined the affected children. "It seems some viral disease. We have sent the clinical examination report to the concerned experts and expect results tomorrow," said Block Medical Officer Kunzar Dr Idrees. "We have given the 1st aid to the children and there is nothing to worry [about]."

[The description of the illness (fever and rashes) in the affected school children is too vague to develop a differential diagnosis without more information. A more detailed description of the illness from knowledgeable sources would be welcomed by ProMED-mail.

Tangmarg is one of 8 tehsils (an administrative division) and a town in Baramulla District of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and Lalpora is one of the villages in the Tangmarg tehsil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangmarg). Tangmarg is 39 km (24 mi) from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. Kunzer (perhaps also spelled Kunzar) is another tehsil in Baramulla District (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunzer).
