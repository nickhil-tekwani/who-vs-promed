According to the Ministry of Extreme Situations of Russia anthrax in cattle
has been recorded in the Tambov region.
Symptoms of this disease were detected on Thursday [24 Aug 2006] in a cow
in the village of Andreevka of the Sosnovskiy district in the Tambov
region. The man, the owner of the sick animal, was placed in hospital for
observation for symptoms of anthrax.
Now necessary sanitary and epidemiologic measures are being carried out at
the focus of infection.

[There are several cattle burial grounds and more than 10 biothermal holes
in the Tambov region. However, it was not possible to find information in
the mass media about anthrax in there in recent years. The latest mention
of anthrax in cattle in this region was in 1979:

The Tambov region is located in the central part of European Russia. To the
north, the Region borders the Ryazan Region, to the east the Penza Region
and the Saratov Region, to the south the Voronezh Region, and to the west
the Lipetsk Region. Administrative centre: Tambov; Distance from Tambov to
Moscow 480 km; Population (2002) - 1 240 700, - Mod.NP].
[This is, yet again, the age-old story of anthrax in Russia and will
continue until a better structured control programme can be installed.
