A case of bovine tuberculosis, a rare disease in the region, was
detected on a farm near Quimper, in the locality of Menesguen. The
146 animals of the farm will be slaughtered, and the farmer was
placed under medical surveillance.

This disease is indeed potentially transmissible to humans either by
direct and prolonged contact or through consumption of raw milk.
Yesterday [2 Oct 2008] evening, the prefecture indicated that the 2nd
hypothesis was rejected but that the farmer was subject to
appropriate medical monitoring. The origin of this disease is unknown
at this time. The specialized services believe it could be
transmitted by wildlife. The presence of deer, not far from
livestock, embodies this hypothesis that will be addressed by the
veterinary services and the Office of Hunting. For now, no security
perimeter was established around the farm.

Yesterday [2 Oct 2008] evening, Jaouen Jacques, president of the
Finistere [a Department of France in Brittany] Chamber of Agriculture
showed surprise: "This is the 1st time since I've been a farmer that
I've known of a case of bovine tuberculosis. The disease was
eradicated, and the region has been disease free for a long time,"
statements that legitimize all the precautions taken by services.

Jean-Francois Treguer, the chairman of the livestock health advocacy
group of Finistere, confirmed last night [2 Oct 2008] that no case of
bovine tuberculosis had been found in the department [Finistere] in
the past 15 years: "One should not dramatize; no sign of the disease
has been detected in the vicinity of the livestock. This is an
isolated case that should not have consequences, because the herd
will be slaughtered."

[Has the decision to slaughter (all?) 146 bovines on the affected
farm been taken since multiple suspected cases were detected? It will
be interesting to note how many of the animals will be found affected
following their slaughter and how old the lesions are. The final
results of the epidemiological investigation into the origin of
infection -- in France or elsewhere -- is anticipated with interest;
it may include examinations of other species on the affected
premises, such as domestic cats and dogs.

The last annual report from France on its Animal Health Situation,
displayed on OIE's WAHID interface, dates back to 2006. During that
year, bovine tuberculosis was reportedly present ("confirmed clinical
cases"; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country_status&year=2006>.

Data on the more recent bovine TB situation in France will help in
determining the significance of the current cases. Such data could be
derived from France's 3 missing semi-annual reports, when available.
