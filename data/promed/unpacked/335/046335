Northern Israel has experienced an outbreak of rabies since last year
[2009], and it is showing few signs of abating in the near future.

16 cases of the disease have already been discovered this year
[2010], 9 of them in dogs and most of the rest in wild animals.
Already this year, 671 people in the north have been inoculated
against the disease.

"The clock is ticking, and with such high exposure to rabies,
ultimately a human being will die from the disease," said the Health
Ministry's Northern District director, Dr Michal Cohen-Dar.

Last year [2009] saw 58 incidents of [animal] rabies [annual total].
Before 2009, Israel only experienced between 9 and 12 cases of the
disease a year.

"The most worrying development is the discovery of the disease among
dogs, while in the past most of the cases were found in wild
animals," said Dr Yuval Hadani of the Agriculture Ministry's
veterinary service.

Rabies generally reaches Israel from regional countries such as
Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. "The disease knows no borders," Hadani said.

In Israel, a joint Agriculture Ministry and Nature and Parks
Authority project to orally vaccinate foxes and jackals has almost
eradicated the virus among wild animals. The inoculation is performed
by baiting the animals with meat injected with the vaccine. [This is
not accurate; the (dry) bait formula includes various ingredients. - Mod.AS]

The bait, however, is considered too small to be effective among
dogs. Canines swallow rather than chew the [bait], depriving the
vaccine of [obtaining the required contact with the mouth and throat tissues].

On Tuesday [23 Mar 2010] a dog inoculated against rabies died in
Safed, the 3rd dog to die this year despite having received
inoculation against the virus [see comment below].

Representatives of the health and agriculture ministries in the north
are now taking measures to remind the public that rabies is caused by
a virus, and can be incurable if not caught quick enough. "From the
onset of symptoms in humans or animals, there is no possibility of
saving the patient," they said.

60 people in the northern Bedouin village of Bir al-Maksur were
recently administered rabies vaccines after a resident adopted a pair
of puppies found to be infected with the virus. Local council head
Yasser Hujeirat said yesterday [24 Mar 2010], "Public awareness of
the disease must be raised. People just aren't aware of the dangers involved."

Some 390 000 dogs are registered in Israel, the majority inoculated
against rabies. Over 200 000, however, are not registered, the vast
majority of which have not been vaccinated.

Medical professionals told Haaretz that if authorities invested more
in public awareness and enforcement of inoculation regulations, the
state could save hundreds of thousands of shekels spent on treating
individuals exposed to the virus.

[Notably, 3 of the dogs confirmed as rabid in Northern Israel during
2010, had a history of vaccination. According to information
distributed by the Israeli Veterinary services to the veterinary
profession, this involved the following cases:

1. A 6-year-old female boxer from Kfar Baruch (Valley of Yezreel,
northern Israel) died on 23 Feb 2010, following several days of
nervous, rabies-suspected signs and was lab-confirmed positive. This
dog had been vaccinated 5 times during its life, the last vaccination
carried out on 29 Jan 2009.

2. The mother of the said bitch, a 7-year-old boxer, kept by the same
owner. Following her daughter's death, this dog was tested for rabies
antibodies and found non-immune, in spite the fact that it had been
similarly vaccinated 5 times against rabies throughout life. The
7-year-old bitch was brought to the Kimron Veterinary Institute and
kept under observation. No clinical signs were observed until 8 Mar
2010; on 10 Mar 2010, the dog was found in coma and died the same
day, lab-confirmed rabies positive.

Among the various factors suggested as possible background for the
immunodeficiency of both dogs, was the repeated application, on both
of them, of the (immunosuppressive) insecticide chlorpyrifos (which
is not registered for use on dogs in Israel). The issue is still
under investigation.

3. On 22 Mar 2010, a male English bull mastiff, born end
2007/beginning 2008, died in the dog rabies quarantine in Safed after
showing clinical signs suspected as rabies, which was posthumously
lab-confirmed. This dog had been kept on the same premises where a
rabid dog died on 21 Feb 2010; it had been initially vaccinated
against rabies on 30 Nov 2008 (no re-vaccinations since). According
to the owner's statement, the last date of possible physical contact
between the 2 dogs was 20 Jan 2010. Subsequently, and according to
the prevailing policy, this dog was put in isolation in a rabies
quarantine station for 45 days, the counting commencing 20 Jan 2010
(last contact). On 11 Mar 2010 the 45 counted days were over and, in
the absence of clinical signs, the dog was released. On 18 Mar 2010,
the owner contacted the District Veterinary Officer and reported
heavy breathing of the dog. Subsequently, the dog was returned to the
quarantine where it deteriorated, developing swallowing difficulties,
salivation and emaciation, without aggression. It died on 22 Mar 2010
and found rabies positive.

The details above, included in circulars (in Hebrew) from the State
Veterinary Services to veterinarians throughout the country, have
been translated and included in this commentary in view of the
possible interest of subscribers concerning rabies in vaccinated dogs.

The figure of 200 000 unregistered, unvaccinated dogs in Israel,
cited by "Haaretz", may be rather excessive and is in need of
official view. - Mod.AS]
