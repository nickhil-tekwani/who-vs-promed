Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever Death in Nakuru, Rift Valley Province
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Government yesterday confirmed that one patient who was bleeding from
body orifices died over the weekend at a Nakuru hospital. Rift Valley
Province General Hospital Medical Superintendent, Dr John Kibosia, said
that the male patient, who had been admitted at the annex wing of the
hospital on Thu 12 Apr 2001, died within 48 hours. Kibosia said that the
patient had been initially treated for malaria when he was admitted, but
his condition deteriorated and he died after he bled from the nose, ears,
and gums.
Mr Charles Njuguna of the Division of Communicable Diseases, Ministry of
Health, said specimens had been collected for diagnostic tests to establish
the cause of death, and had been sent to the Kenya Medical Research
Institute (KEMRI) for analysis. Following the incident, Kibosia said some
beds have been set aside in the Annex Isolation Ward in case of emergency.
He said since a similar disease was detected in Nyeri a week ago, doctors
[were adopting a precautionary approach.
