The Ministry of Health of Neuquen province reported the detection of 8 cases of psittacosis in the locality of Centenario.

Psittacosis is an acute respiratory disease transmitted by birds, mainly parrots, parakeets, parrots, canaries, and pigeons that can be spread by direct or indirect contact. The infected birds can be apparently healthy or present with symptoms such as lethargy, diarrhea, or sometimes death. In people the disease can present as a flu-like syndrome or progress to pneumonia. Symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, cough, and shortness of breath. Although the illness is usually mild or moderate, sometimes it can be serious, even fatal, especially in the elderly and children who do not receive treatment.

The ministry recommends that people who have acquired this type of bird since 10 Dec 2013, whether they are healthy or sick, take them to the vet for evaluation and possible treatment. And anyone who has had contact with these birds and presents any of the symptoms described should consult the nearest hospital or health center.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _C. psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Historically (http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/DISEASES-AND-PARASITES-AFFECTING-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html), the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895.

An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America. - Mod.LL
