ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS - USA (NEW YORK CITY): CONTROL COSTS

Re: C.H. Calisher's question
Question: "What is the likelihood that a single bird or a few birds,
infected with SLE virus (from where?) decided to nest only in Queens County
and that this is not a problem of the entire NY City area, which to me
includes Connecticut, Westchester County (NY), and New Jersey?"
Answer: Zip, zero, nada.
I'll bet my first born that confirmed cases live on the first or second
story of buildings, do not have air conditioning, do not have screens on
their windows and leave their windows open. The real question: is this
situation a classic example of Public Health by crises? An even better
question is: does it cost more in dollars and lives to have an ongoing
vector control and surveillance program or to take action after the bodies
start to drop?

[Of course, Bobbi, we'd have to see the first born before taking the bet.
My understanding is that NY City has budgeted $6,000,000 for the on-going
vector control program. I do not know how much of a prevention program
that would buy but I suspect it would have gone a long way before this
outbreak was recognized. Perhaps there would not have been an outbreak at
all? - Mod.CHC]
