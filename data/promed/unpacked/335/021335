Czech Republic: outbreak of low pathogenic bird flu in ducks
------------------------------------------------------------
The Czech [agriculture] authorities reported an outbreak of low
pathogenic avian influenza (H5N3) in a holding with mallard ducks for
restocking of game in Jihocesky.

From 40 cloacal swabs taken in the frame of regular monitoring, one
sample appeared positive. Clinical signs were absent. All 280
susceptible birds were destroyed.

H5 and H7 avian influenza in their low pathogenic form in poultry are
notifiable diseases.
