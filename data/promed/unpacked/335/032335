Vietnam, in an effort to control the widespread of foot and mouth disease
[FMD], is intensifying slaughter of infected animals, beefing up
surveillance and propaganda on the disease, according to a local animal
health agency on Thursday [18 May 2006].
Under a regulation recently issued by the Vietnamese ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, all pigs, goats, sheep, or deer in a
cage in which a single animal shows FMD symptoms will have to be culled,
even before the results of the disease's tests come out, said the
ministry's Department of Animal Health.
Infected bulls and buffaloes in outbreaks occurring for the first time in a
commune, or contracting viruses of new types or viruses that have not
appeared in a province or city for a long time will also be slaughtered.
Under the new regulation, a commune has to declare FMD outbreaks when the
disease occurs in a hamlet, and a district has to do this when it hits 2
communes, and a province has to do this when it strikes 2 districts.
The department has established 6 working teams with the tasks of helping
localities build plans to prevent and fight the disease, isolating affected
areas and working out vaccination schemes. FMD has jumped to 235 communes
in 30 cities and provinces nationwide, hitting over 26 000 pigs, bulls and
buffaloes, of which over 10 600 have been killed by the disease or culled,
said the department.

[The rapid and wide-scale spread of the virus might be explained, at least
in part, by the involvement of pigs. Traditionally, sheep and goats are
regarded as the FMD virus maintenance hosts, pigs as its amplifiers, and
cattle as indicators.
Unfortunately, no information on the FMD virus serotype involved could be
obtained (see commentaries in previous postings).
The Vietnamese decision to apply a stamping out policy, in spite the fact
that Viet Nam is a vaccinating country, raises the suspicion that an exotic
virus strain might be involved.
Serotypes O and A were regarded endemic in Vietnam for years. In spite of
the steady increase in the alarming rate and publication of detailed news
in state-managed press, no official information has been sent -- as far as
we are aware -- to the OIE.
Viet Nam's reporting on FMD, in the past, was generally timely and
comprehensive. Though the outbreak undoubtedly looks and sounds like FMD,
in the absence of official confirmation it maintains the title "suspected".
