Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials received confirmation of anthrax in a captive white-tailed deer herd on a Val Verde County premises on Sun 11 Jul 2021. This is the first anthrax case in Texas this year.

The premises is located in the south central portion of the county, north of Comstock, and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation and provide updates as needed," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC State Veterinarian and Executive Director. "Producers are encouraged to remain vigilant and consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they suspect their animals are exposed to anthrax or are interested in vaccinating their livestock."

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Anthrax cases in Texas are most often found in portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney, and Maverick counties.

An effective vaccine for livestock is available and is commonly used in areas that are prone to have anthrax. To be effective, the vaccine must be used before the animal is exposed to the bacteria. There is no approved vaccine for deer. Consult a local veterinarian or a local TAHC region office for more details on vaccinating your livestock for anthrax. All label directions should be followed carefully, including personal protective measures while handling the vaccine to prevent accidental exposure.

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals can ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay, or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

After exposure to anthrax, it typically takes 3 to 7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. If you see wild or exotic deer dying more than 10 animals at a time, and carcasses show bleeding that is characteristic of anthrax, move livestock away from carcasses immediately.

Owners of livestock and animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax or experiencing death of animals should contact a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official immediately.

These links show the locations of anthrax outbreaks for 1974-1999 and 2000-2008. The cluster of affected counties around Val Verde is the region of most risk today:
https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/disease/anthrax/information/data/1999/ and https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/disease/anthrax/information/data/2008/

This brief report from the TAHC is not untypical and beyond brief. All it says is that a single swab from a single dead deer, probably a White Tail, was confirmed positive at College Station, TAMU. If it was a "captive" deer it was at a deer breeding facility north of Comstock. If it was south of Comstock it would have been in Mexico. These animals are not cheap. The latter facilitates recognition.

How index cases with deer occur is not always clear, especially in the absence of any other affected deer thereabouts. Deer can be infected by tabanid female flies that have fed on another infected animal, which was what happened in the major deer epidemic in 2001 that killed deer on around 100 deer ranches or so. Also deer browsing near an anthrax carcass will be infected when they consume fly-vomit on the leaves, and that also involves immediate previous cases. Texas "pot-holes", mildly sunken areas 1-3 acres in size, can safely collect spores from animals that died there in the previous months or longer. These areas collect salts from the surrounding acid soil raising the pH to neutrality or slightly alkaline, ideal for spore survival. Their sunken nature means that they collect rainwater and together it attractively fosters the growth of grazing in a soft humus soil, facilitating ingestion and infection. Frankly index cases on their own are a mystery. If we were to check deer from a ranch with cases in the previous summer at a dressing station for latent infections of lymph nodes, it would be a great step forward.

I have asked colleagues in Texas to tell me of anything else that might be of value. If I hear anything that may be shared, it will be posted. - Mod.MHJ
