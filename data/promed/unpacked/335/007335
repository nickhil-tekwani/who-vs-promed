Rabies mortality estimates - the last word
------------------------------------------
The National Health Profile of India, published by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence within the Directorate General of Health Services, under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, actually began reporting markedly lower rabies death numbers in 2005 -- but apparently nobody noticed until Indian health minister Gulam Nabi Azad on 29 Apr 2012 brought the latest data to the Lok Sabha [House of the People, the lower house of the Parliament of India].

The National Health Profile of India human rabies death numbers:
2005: 274
2006: 361
2007: 221
2008: 244
2009: 260
2010: 162
2011: 223

The National Health Profile is a source of data about many other diseases commonly discussed by ProMED-mail (see http://cbhidghs.nic.in/index2.asp?slid=1000&sublinkid=706). Why has no one brought this resource to our attention before?

[ProMED-mail thanks Merritt Clifton for his continuing analysis of estimates of human rabies mortality in India. With these data from the Indian Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, this thread is now cut.

Hopefully the relevant international agencies and travel advice organisations will take note and revise their statements downward accordingly.
