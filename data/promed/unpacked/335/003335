E. Cape Farmer Contracts Congo Fever
---------------------------------------------------------
An Eastern Cape farmer has been diagnosed with the deadly and contagious
Congo Fever. An intensive program has been launched in the province to
prevent the spread of the disease. The farmer, 51, is in a critical
condition and is being treated in strict isolation. He was initially
admitted to hospital at Graaff-Reinet but subsequently transferred to Port
Elizabeth. The Graaff-Reinet hospital was immediately placed under
quarantine but the measures have since been relaxed. From Thursday, anyone
who has had contact with the patient will be monitored. This includes
medical personnel who treated him.
For further information on the disease, see:
