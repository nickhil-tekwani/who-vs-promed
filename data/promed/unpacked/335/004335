A 3 km (2 mi) foot-and-mouth [FMD] temporary control zone has been
put in place around premises in East Sussex. It follows a veterinary
assessment of suspected signs of the disease in sheep. Tests are in
progress on livestock at the site near Rye.

The government had planned to lift the movement ban in low-risk
foot-and-mouth areas on 17 Oct 2007. The plan also to lift the Surrey
FMD protection zone was dependent on no further outbreaks.

A Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)
spokesman said: "Animal keepers are urged to remain vigilant for
disease, check their animals twice a day and report any suspicions
immediately."

If confirmed, it would be the 1st case of FMD outside of Surrey since
the emergence of the disease in August [2007].

The disease has been identified at 8 farms in Surrey since 3 Aug 2007.

The disease's risk area covers Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire,
Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Surrey, Hampshire and West Sussex,
according to Defra.

England's farming community is also reeling from bluetongue disease,
although restrictions put in place to prevent its spread were eased
on Monday [15 Oct 2007] despite the virus spreading to sheep.

The new FMD scare comes days after the EU lifted a ban on meat
imports from Scotland, Wales, and parts of England following the 2
outbreaks.

All farms outside of an area, which takes in southeast England and
the Home Counties -- deemed a "foot-and-mouth risk area" -- and
outside of bluetongue control areas -- taking in Suffolk, parts of
Norfolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire -- are now allowed to export meat
to the EU.
