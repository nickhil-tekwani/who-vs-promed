China: outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Guangdong Province
--------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Japanese encephalitis has killed 18 children and infected
more than 200 others in Guangdong Province, south China. Hong Kong media
have noted anxiously that the reported death toll has risen more than
20-fold since Wed 18 Jun 2003, when officials reported only one death.
Japanese encephalitis is a mosquitoborne disease, which attacks the brain
and the spinal cord, and is endemic to many parts of Asia. There are
thousands of cases in China each year.
What is different this time is that it comes hot on the heels of the SARS
outbreak, and in the very region where the pneumonia-like disease began. An
initial government cover-up of SARS in Guangdong let the virus spread to
Hong Kong with impunity. But a Guangdong health official has denied any
cover-up over encephalitis, saying the rise in numbers was just a question
of data collection. The World Health Organization also says it sees nothing
suspicious. But despite the government's belated openness about SARS, the
legacy of anxiety and mistrust the disease has left behind could be hard to
vanquish.

Disease 'seasonal' outbreak kills 18
------------------------------------
An outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in southern China has killed at least
18 children, prompting the Guangdong provincial government to launch an
emergency vaccination program, health officials said yesterday. At least
211 people have contracted encephalitis in Guangdong Province, where rice
paddies provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry the disease,
according to local newspaper reports.
The disease causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, and
fatigue in most victims. It can, however, cause a serious brain
inflammation in a few. It is usually fatal in 30 per cent of cases,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The disease usually strikes southern China in summer, between May and July.
WHO is monitoring the outbreak, but doesn't consider it to be out of
control, said a spokesman for the UN agency in Beijing. "This is a seasonal
occurrence," said WHO spokesman Bob Dietz. "If the numbers are accurate,
you have a death rate of about 10 per cent, which is actually low."
Cases have been reported in areas throughout Guangdong, including 7 in the
provincial capital of Guangzhou. Many are children of migrant workers, who
often aren't covered by the government health program, which includes
vaccinations for encephalitis, the newspaper Xin Kuai News said.
"Some parents want to save money or time," the newspaper said. "Others
simply don't know anything about the disease" and fail to get necessary
shots. It said the government had launched an emergency program that has
vaccinated 100 000 children in the past week.
Encephalitis kills nearly 10 000 people each year in Asia, most of them
children, and infects 40 000. Many survivors suffer permanent nerve
damage.The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome prompted
hard-hit Guangdong and other regions to issue daily bulletins on deaths and
new cases. Hong Kong's director of health Margaret Chan yesterday expressed
the hope that encephalitis should be included in the system. In Hong Kong,
though encephalitis cases were reported in the past, the number was very
small. But Chan stressed that since diseases do mutate, ample precautionary
measures are necessary.

[ProMed-mail does not normally report outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis.
Although endemic in parts of Asia, it is now a vaccine preventable disease.
In this instance, however, the location of the outbreak and the abrupt rise
in the number of fatalities are significant. - Mod.CP]
