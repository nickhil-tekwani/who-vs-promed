[BTV is seasonal in the Middle East (see further). Previous annual reports of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to the OIE on BTV outbreaks in sheep included the following information:
2009: Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec. Reportedly, serotyped as BTV-8.
2010: Jan, Aug, Oct, Dec. Reportedly, serotyped as BTV-8.
2011: Jan, May, Sep, Nov, Dec. Reportedly, untyped.

The information above is presented in WAHID's "Detailed country disease incidence", which is based upon the annual reports of the PA to the OIE.

Information on the serotyping of the 2010 outbreaks (method applied, the identity of the performing laboratory) will be helpful; generally, such information is to be found in the "immediate notifications" and "follow-ups"; no such BTV reports from PA are available for 2010 and 2011.

Results of the serotyping of the 2011 outbreaks, in case performed, as well as of the 2012 (current) outbreak, are anticipated with interest. It will also be helpful to obtain information on the BTV serotypes to be included in the vaccine, which according to the notification above, is to be applied in response to the outbreak.

The location of the reported outbreak is shown on the appended interactive OIE map, at the source URL.

From unofficial sources we are informed that outbreaks of BT have been very recently observed in neighbouring Israel, affecting sheep and also suspected in cattle. In view of the seasonality of BTV, which in Israel traditionally corresponds to the period June-January, such outbreaks are not surprising. During the last 3 decades of the 20th century, the average monthly incidence of BT spelled out as the percentage of the total of hundreds of ovine BTV outbreaks in Israel (occurring every single year except 1980/1981), was about 8 percent (of the grand total) in August, 10 in September, 35 in October, 30 in November, and 10 percent in December. Confirmation of the current cases and additional information, in particular results of serotyping, are expected. - Mod.AS
