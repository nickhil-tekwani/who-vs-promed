With the lambing season coming to an end in some regions of Europe, the number of cases of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) being identified in sheep are declining, but cases in cattle are increasing, according to a recently updated outbreak assessment from Defra's International Disease Monitoring (IDM) team [See updated figures from all 8 SBV-affected counties in item 2.].

In its assessment, which was published on 11 Mar 2012, the team said that since its previous update of 22 Feb 2012, there has been a significant increase in cases being reported from new areas of affected counties in England. This was not unexpected, it said, and all affected counties were within revised "at risk" zones identified as being in the pathway of windborne infected midges arriving from mainland Europe in the late summer and autumn of 2011.

The team noted that there had been no further cases reported from Italy, but the number of cases in Luxembourg had risen to 7. The other affected European countries are the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France. "Considering the total number of cattle and sheep establishments in affected countries, this remains a low-impact disease, considering the number of farms where virus has been identified in deformed newborn animals," it said.

Turning to research being conducted to try to identify the vector of the virus, the IDM team said that SBV had been identified in 2 species of midge, _Culicoides obsoletus_ and _Culicoides dewulfi_. Researchers in Belgium conducted RT-PCR on the heads of midges collected in September and October 2011 and detected the virus in 2 pools of midge heads. By using the heads, the researchers avoided testing any blood meals that the midges had consumed, and the detection of the virus suggested it was present in the midges' salivary glands, the IDM team said. It added that, according to information from the Institute for Animal Health, both species of midge are found throughout northern Europe, including the UK, and that they are often found together. _C. obsoletus_ is the primary vector for serotype 8 of the bluetongue virus in northern Europe, the team noted.

In the UK, AHVLA reported on 12 Mar 2012 that SBV infection had been identified on 158 farms, with 11 positive cases being found in cattle and 147 in sheep. 20 counties had been affected, with the highest number of cases (30) being reported from Kent.

In Northern Ireland, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) supported calls from farming and veterinary associations for the local farming industry to remain vigilant for the virus. David Bryson, acting director of AFBI's Veterinary Sciences Division, said: "As we head towards the peak of the lambing and spring calving seasons in Northern Ireland, we would encourage farmers to familiarise themselves with the symptoms and report any suspicion to their private veterinary practitioner."

The AFBI pointed out that, while Northern Ireland is generally not considered to be part of the "at risk" region, based on mathematical modelling of the likely spread of the virus in a midge vector, the risk remained that the virus could be imported in a live animal sourced from an affected region, and it was, therefore, important that farmers sourced stock responsibly.

[The latest total numbers of lab-confirmed SBV-affected animal holdings in the 8 countries are:
cattle - 406 (see comment)
sheep - 1991
goats - 59
total - 2456

The actual number of affected cattle holdings is assumed to be much higher, since animals seem to have tested PCR-negative more than 5 months post infection (infected during early pregnancy). This is supported by the results of a Dutch serosurvey (see archived posting 20120309.1065831) and reflected by the number of cattle farms which have submitted complaints on malformed calves. In Netherlands (506) and Belgium (357) combined, 863 complaining cattle holdings have tested negative. The number of SBV-positive cattle farms among the submissions has been increasing since late February 2012, while the appearance of malformed lambs is reaching its terminal stage. - Mod.AS
