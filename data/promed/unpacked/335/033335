Plague has been confirmed in fleas taken from a prairie dog colony near a
popular Boulder area trailhead, officials said on Thursday.
The plague was detected in a prairie dog colony about 100 yards from the
trail at the Flatiron Vista Trailhead, which is near the intersection of
highways 93 and 128, according to Boulder city officials.
Most of the prairie dogs were killed by the disease and health officials are
warning visitors to use precautions when they are near the infected area.
For example, hikers should take precautions to reduce the potential for flea
bites and avoid handling the dead rodents. Pets also should not be allowed
in the area.
Plague is spread through the bite of fleas infected with the bacteria.
Prairie dogs and other rodents such as deer mice and rock squirrels are
common carriers for the disease in Colorado.
Symptoms include fever and chills, headache, muscle aches and nausea. It can
be fatal if left untreated.
