New confirmed: 2
Total confirmed cases in 2018: 38
Total number of confirmed cases reported from September 2017: 116

Highlight
- The NCDC is following up closely with the Ministry of Health Israel following the report of a confirmed monkeypox case in Israel on 13 October with a travel history from Nigeria.
- 10 new suspected cases of monkeypox were reported from Ebonyi (4), Rivers (2), and Bayelsa (4)
- 8 patient samples from the cluster of 10 suspected cases with epidemiological linkages to the 1st case in the UK were tested and found to be negative for monkeypox but positive for chickenpox. Two cases will require further investigation.
- 13 contacts of the 1st UK confirmed case were followed up in Nigeria for a period of 21 days. None became symptomatic.
- NCDC continued to collaborate with PHE to investigate and strengthen control measures related to the 2 cases confirmed in the UK.
- A total of 86 cases have been reported in 2018 from 16 states (Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Nasarawa, Oyo, Abia, Anambra, Plateau, and the FCT); 38 are confirmed, one probable, 10 awaiting results, and 2 deaths.
- 116 confirmed and 280 suspected cases have been recorded from the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017.
- Genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into the human population with some evidence of human-to-human transmission.
- Males are more affected with 79 percent of confirmed cases.
- The most affected age group in confirmed cases is 21-40 years (Median Age = 31).
- Nigeria continues to report sporadic cases since the beginning of 2018.

Monkeypox virus transmission continues over a broad geographic area in Nigeria this year (2018). The above report provides the most recent update of the monkeypox situation in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area in a short period of time. The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of monkeypox virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people. As mentioned earlier, prevention will require a proactive public education effort to convince local people to take measures to prevent contact with the infected rodents and their excreta to avoid transmission, a difficult task involving so many local people over such a large geographic area.

Non-human primates are not monkeypox virus reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents (genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). - Mod.TY
