A listeriosis outbreak has New Mexico health officials on alert. 3
people in the state have already died, 2 men from Bernalillo County
and a woman from Curry County. 6 others have been hospitalized. There
are 11 similar cases in Colorado and officials there believe the
culprit is contaminated cantaloupe.

The New Mexico Department of Health says they're working to determine
the source of the bacteria, but right now they can't say with 100
percent certainty what caused the outbreak.

Experts in Colorado, however, are blaming cantaloupe likely from the
Rocky Ford growing region 60 miles [97 km] east of Pueblo, Colorado.
Health officials in New Mexico are expediting samples from across the
state to the Center for Disease Control. Jim Winchester with the
Environment Department said they are hoping to have results in the
next 48 hours. That will tell them if the cases are connected.

Health experts said listeriosis is relatively uncommon but dangerous.
"It's a severe illness...most people, when they get sick, they already
have a blood stream infection so they need to get medical attention
and it can be successfully treated with antibiotics," said Dr Michael
Landen, an epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health.
Symptoms include fever and muscle aches and can also include diarrhea,
headache, stiff neck, and convulsions.

Dr. Landen said there are 4 high-risk groups that need to stay away
from cantaloupe right now: adults over the age of 60, pregnant women,
infants, and those with weakened immune systems. He explained after
exposure, it can take between a couple days and up to a month to show
symptoms.

As of right now there are no recalls to report. Health officials in
Colorado are advising consumers to wash and dry the outside of melons
before cutting.

Health officials have issued a warning for cantaloupes from a revered
melon-producing area of Colorado amid a bacterial outbreak blamed for
4 deaths in the state and New Mexico, troubling farmers who depend on
sales of the fruit.

The warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]
came after 16 cases of a strain of listeriosis were reported in 5
states, including 11 from Colorado, 2 from Texas, and one each from
Indiana, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.

The agency said it was the 1st listeriosis outbreak linked to
cantaloupe in the United States. The US Food & Drug Administration
said it had not recalled the melons while it worked to locate the
source.

Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named for a region along the old Santa Fe
Trail about 130 miles [209 km] southeast of Denver, are prized for
their above-average sugar content. WC Fields reportedly said bald guys
have "a head shaped like a Rocky Ford cantaloupe," and Lucile Ball had
the melons delivered to her dressing room. "This is really silly. You
can get listeriosis any place. I eat those melons every day," said
Kent Lusk, a 5th-generation cantaloupe farmer from Rocky Ford.

Colorado Agriculture Commissioner John Salazar said it might not be
the cantaloupes, but a contaminated truck or other source. He said no
recalls have been issued, but several Colorado grocery chains pulled
their supplies as a precaution.

Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food
contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. The disease
primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and adults
with weakened immune systems. Colorado health director Chris Urbina
said people who are at high risk included people 60 and older, those
with weakened immune systems from transplants, and people with chronic
diseases. Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, diarrhea,
headache, stiff neck, confusion, and convulsions. Listeriosis can
cause miscarriages and stillbirths.

The CDC warning advised people with cantaloupes at home to see if they
came from the Rocky Ford region, and if so, not to eat the melons if
they're in a vulnerable group. Health authorities asked people
throwing out Rocky Ford cantaloupes to put them in a sealed plastic
bag before putting them in the trash. Several grocery stores in the
Rocky Mountain region, including King Soopers, Safeway, and Whole
Foods, voluntarily pulled Rocky Ford cantaloupes. "We decided out of
an abundance of caution" to remove Rocky Ford melons in 142 Colorado
stores, King Soopers spokeswoman Kelli McGannon said.

School cafeterias in at least 2 Denver-area school districts threw out
their Rocky Ford melons. Denver Public Schools (DPS) cafeterias had
planned to highlight them Wednesday [14 Sep 2011] in a local foods
promotion. Other Colorado products, including grass-fed beef and green
chili sauce, also were on the menu, DPS spokeswoman Kristy Armstrong
said.

Urbina said the Colorado health department was expecting more test
results this week that might help identify the specific source of the
cantaloupe sickening people.

Lusk said this year's [2011] growing season was almost over and that
he doesn't believe the outbreak will have a lasting impact. "I think
there were just a few bad ones," said Adela Licano, a Chamber of
Commerce board member who added that about a dozen roadside stands
were still open. "This is a major industry. We hope there is no
permanent impact. We're going to get to the bottom of this," Salazar
said.

In New Mexico, the fatal cases included a 93-year-old man from
Bernalillo County, a 61-year-old woman from Curry County, and a
63-year-old man from Bernalillo County. State Environmental Health
Bureau inspectors were collecting cantaloupe samples from grocery
stores and distributors across New Mexico for laboratory analysis.
Mark Salley, spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment, said the person who died in Colorado was not being
identified.

"We extend our sympathy to the families and friends of those who have
died from this infection," said Colorado Health Secretary Dr Catherine
Torres. "At this time, based on the preliminary findings in Colorado,
we are cautioning people who are at high risk for listeriosis to avoid
eating cantaloupe."

[In June 2011 an outbreak of listeriosis occurred in Colorado (see
ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719), in
which 2 of 3 patients died. That all 3 patients were said to be of
Hispanic or Latino heritage would suggest the source could possibly be
soft Mexican-style cheeses contaminated with _Listeria_
contamination.

The current listeriosis outbreak that started in August 2011 was
initially reported to involve a total of 13 cases, including 2 deaths,
and was limited to the state of Colorado (see ProMED-mail post
Listeriosis, fatal - USA (02): (CO) 20110909.2746). According to the 2
news releases above, this outbreak has expanded to 25 cases, including
4 deaths, in multiple states. The states involved are Colorado (11
cases), New Mexico (9 cases), Texas (2 cases), Indiana (1 case),
Nebraska (1 case), and Oklahoma (1 case).

Hopefully, genotyping of patient-isolates is being done. A similar
genotype for some or all of the patient-isolates would imply a common
source. The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by matching
genotypes of _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source with that
of patient-isolates.

Cantaloupe from the Rocky Ford region of Colorado is the suspected
vehicle, but we are not informed about how this fruit/vegetable came
under suspicion. Cantaloupe has been incriminated previously as the
vehicle for enteric pathogens, specifically _Salmonella_ species, in 3
outbreaks in North America, in 1991
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00014966.htm), in 2002
(ProMED-mail post Salmonella poona, cantaloupes - USA, Canada (02) 20021123.5884), and in 2011 (ProMED-mail post Salmonellosis, serotype
Panama - USA: ex Guatemala, cantaloupe 20110325.0948).

Cantaloupe grows on a vine on the ground and its rind can become
contaminated with enteric pathogens by contact with contaminated soil,
fertilizer, or water used for irrigation or washing. Contamination
could also occur later during the distribution process. Cutting
through the outer skin can then contaminate the pulp of cantaloupe, if
washing of the outside is inadequate. It is therefore important to
wash the melon thoroughly before cutting into it, since bacteria can
grow on the rind. However, because _Listeria_ multiple at refrigerator
temperatures, inoculation of the pulp by even low numbers of the
organism can result in high-grade contamination of refrigerated
product.
