From: T Jacob John <vlr_tjjohn@sancharnet.in>

I am responding to the request for more information by the moderator on the
report of undiagnosed deaths in India (Uttar Pradesh) -- 13 Nov 2005.
In the write-up the "ecovirus" is almost certainly echovirus, as suggested
by the moderator. The "cocktail virus" could either be coxsackievirus or
evidence of infection with more than one virus -- mostly serological, not
necessarily quality-controlled, and likely to be not very useful
information. Finding malarial parasites points to 2 questions -- (1) could
such children have had cerebral malaria? and (2) why is speciation between
_P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ not clarified? If that is not done, what
confidence can we have in a medical diagnosis?
The "self-culture system" mentioned in the last paragraph is most certainly
a cell culture system. NICD (National Institute of Communicable Diseases)
in New Delhi (or rather Old Delhi, to be accurate), has excellent cell
culture laboratories.
What I know -- from keeping watch over news and journal articles as well as
speaking with local pediatricians -- includes:
1. In the absence of fairly strict clinical (let alone laboratory) criteria
of syndromic diagnosis, do not assume that all cases suspected of being the
"mystery disease" are not cases of other diagnosable diseases such as
septicemia, cerebral malaria, typhoid encephalopathy, meningitis, viral
encephalitis, Reye's syndrome, other forms of toxic encephalopathies,
chemical/insecticide poisoning etc. When clinicians have been discerning,
they have found an undiagnosed illness with stereotypical clinical picture
(more below).
2. The typical case is an acute neurological catastrophic illness, with
very high case fatality -- over 50 per cent, usually 60-80 per cent. The
illness is very short -- death or recovery within a few days. Intravenous
mannitol to reduce brain edema is life-saving in many children. Case
fatality can be halved by this treatment alone.
4. The geographic distribution is fairly wide -- Western UP, nearby
Haryana, central India in some years, occasionally Andhra Pradesh and
Maharashtra. The illness occurs almost annually in some places like in
western UP (Saharanpur, Ghaziabad). It is predominantly rural and
peri-urban -- also in town slums and "disadvantaged" habitats. The
distribution is wide -- a few cases per village over weeks. In some cases
siblings are affected. [for a good map of India with states, see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg> or
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/states/index.html> - Mod.MPP]
5. Although "seasonal", season varies in different locations. In
Saharanpore-Ghaziabad and similar recurrent spots, the seasonality is more
predictable -- September, October. In other places, any time from April or
May until October.
6. The crucial differentiation between encephalitis and encephalopathy is
often not made. Since Japanese encephalitis (JE) is well known in India,
every outbreak (except the repetitive seasonal ones in specific places) is
first called JE and then as studies find no clear evidence of JE, revised
as viral encephalitis; if no viral infection can be found, then it is left
as a mystery virus or disease. Many doctors do not perform lumbar punctures
(LPs) in sick children even with obvious neurological illness -- I cannot
understand why -- but they say the families might blame the LP and doctor
for any subsequent complications, including death. Moreover, laboratory
support services are grossly inadequate. In my judgement and after careful
review of several pieces of evidence -- including those of a few LPs done
by good pediatricians -- the "mystery disease" is an acute encephalopathy
syndrome closely resembling Reye's syndrome (Ref 1), more likely to be
toxic or multifactorial -- viral infection being quite unlikely.
7. I had requested a friend and colleague in Saharanpore (Bijnor to be
specific) -- Dr Vipin Vashishtha -- to do specific investigations for
Reye's syndrome. Except for the consistent microvesicular fat inclusion
bodies in hepatocytes, most other features -- CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)
without pleocytosis, under pressure due to brain edema, high liver enzyme
levels, low blood sugar, etc. fit with a Reye's-like picture (ref 2); case
fatality 84 per cent and total duration of illness 48 hours or less.
8. There have been many virological studies on similar outbreaks, but in
all of them clinical criteria were vague and epidemiology virtually absent.
In 2 'published' outbreaks (Vadodara and Warangal), measles virus was
detected in CSF or serum and incriminated as the etiolgy of the illness
(ref 3). In one genuine Reye's syndrome outbreak (ref 4), measles virus was
also detected in CSF and declared the etiology (ref 5). However, I do not
find these studies to be completely reliable (ref 6). Curiously, in another
similar recent outbreak, Chandipura virus (Genus vesiculovirus, family
Rhabdoviridae) was declared by virologists as the etiology in a study of 55
children (ref 7). The odd thing is that the very same 55 children were
reported by neurologists to have ischemic brain lesions and encephalopathy
-- but no encephalitis (ref 8,9).
I need not say more, although I have more historic information. The disease
ought to be called Khan's syndrome, for his description was the first (ref
10). All my efforts to get all players together across the table have
consistently failed. My current suspicion is agriculture practice-related
chemical toxicity as the proximate cause of illness -- of the Reye's-like
syndrome with clinical and laboratory features, reminiscent of "Udorn
encephalopathy" (ref 11,12). The vasculitis-ischemic syndrome deserves more
attention and study. Proper epidemiological investigation of every outbreak
is sorely needed. They will certainly provide clues.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr T Jacob John for this very informative
discussion of the previous post "Undiagnosed deaths - India (Uttar
Pradesh): RFI," 20051113.3322. From the above description it appears there
is an encephalitis or encephalopathy that occurs annually in several
states, but there are also other illnesses being grouped into this
syndromic diagnosis, with the suspicion that further testing would have
established a definitive etiology for some of these cases. For a very good
discussion of these illnesses and the justifications for the suggestion
that these cases may be Reye's syndrome, see Dr T Jacob John's first
reference <http://www.indianpediatrics.net/sep2003/sep-863-869.htm>.
In addition, from Belay ED, et al (Reye's syndrome in the United States
from 1981 through 1997 N Engl J Med 1999 340: 1377-1382): "The CDC defines
a case of Reye's syndrome as one in which there is acute, noninflammatory
encephalopathy, manifested clinically by alterations in the level of
consciousness and documented, when such results are available, by the
measurement of 8 or fewer leukocytes per cubic millimeter of cerebrospinal
fluid or by the presence of cerebral edema without perivascular or
meningeal inflammation in histologic sections of the brain. The
encephalopathy must be associated with either fatty metamorphosis of the
liver, diagnosed by biopsy or at autopsy, or a tripling (or a greater
increase) in the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, or ammonia in serum. There must, moreover, be no other
more reasonable explanation of the cerebral or hepatic abnormalities."
Dr T Jacob John raises the issues of the diagnostic challenges and
questions the conclusions on the etiology of prior outbreaks of
encephalitis-like illnesses. In keeping with the discussion of diagnostic
challenges in India, the list of prior ProMED-mail postings on selected
"undiagnosed/unknown illnesses" from India that might be classified as part
of the above syndrome are included below. Many more 'undiagnosed' or
'unknown' threads have been omitted.
Clearly there is the need for further studies (including good epidemiologic
data as well as strong laboratory support) to identify the etiology of
this/these outbreaks. - Mod.MPP
There is no clear evidence that these outbreaks are due to a single viral
agent, or even that a virus is involved. The ubiquity of some of the
viruses mentioned -- enteric viruses such as echoviruses and
coxsackieviruses (of which there a large number), and the vectorborne
Chandipura virus -- make them unlikely candidates. Likewise the extent and
periodicity of these outbreaks argue against rare sporadic events such as
overspill into the human population of bat-associated henipaviruses.
Environmental toxins cannot be excluded. Professor John has made the point
that the aggregate data do not allow a specific diagnosis. Nonetheless his
analysis of the possibilities is very useful and intriguing. - Mod.CP]
