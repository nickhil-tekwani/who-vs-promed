In a major relief to tea garden owners, British and Indian scientists
have agreed to jointly work on a project to control the blister
blight disease which largely damages tea bushes. Blister blight hits
large areas of tea bushes in north Bengal [north Bengal is a term for
a part of the state of West Bengal and includes tea growing areas
such as Darjeeling] causing loss of millions of rupees. The disease
damages the leaves and the bush within days of attacking the tea gardens.

However, the Indian National Science Academy and Royal Society, UK
have agreed to jointly carry out "a genetic study of the fungus" that
is responsible for the blister blight. The 2 scientists engaged in
the study are B N Chakraborty, North Bengal University (NBU), and Roy
Kennedy from Warwick Horticultural Research International [HRI], UK.

B N Chakraborty is optimistic that the team's efforts will "bring out
some viable remedies to cure the disease" that damages tea shoots and
leaves, rendering them useless. According to Chakraborty, the
airborne microbe, called _Exobasidium vexans_, has been a prolific
phenomenon in north Bengal, where the tea industry has been the
mainstay of the local economy. "We want to find out how to treat the
disease," said the scientist.

Chakraborty had earlier collaborated with the Royal Society of
Chemistry, UK to prepare a chemical finger-printing of the same
microbe. He said with the help of a sophisticated micro-immunospore
trapping device sponsored by the National Horticultural Research
Programme, the team is currently able to identify various microbes
present in the air and forecast plant diseases. "We have already
collected samples of the fungus from the air with the help of the
device. The institute in Warwick has a huge gene bank of microbes,
including the fungus we want to study. We will be able to do a
comparative study of the genetic makeup of the microbe."

Chakraborty agrees that "blister blight causes a huge loss in tea
production. This forces the planters to resort to high doses of
chemicals to fight the disease, which results in a drop in quality.
We plan to come out with a means of bio-controlling the disease,"
Chakraborty added.

[Blister blight of tea (_Camellia sinensis_) caused by the fungus
_Exobasidium vexans_ is the most important leaf disease in tea
cultivation in Southeast Asia. It has not yet been reported from any
tea-growing areas in other parts of the world where it is a major
quarantine concern. The fungus infects tender tea leaves and stems,
resulting in enormous crop losses of harvestable young shoots. The
pathogen is an obligate parasite with no alternate host, completing
its life cycle on the tea plant. Several generations of the pathogen
are completed in a single cropping season. The disease is airborne
and spreads very quickly. High relative humidity, moderate
temperature and leaf wetness favor symptom development. Disease
management is costly and includes cultural practices such as shade
reduction as well as repeated fungicide treatments. Some tea
varieties (clones) with resistance to blister blight are available.
Research on biological control is in progress.

The forecasting model mentioned above is based on epidemiological and
physiological pathogen data and helps to predict disease incidence
and risk well in advance. Control measures can be planned early in
the cropping cycle, minimising crop losses and management costs.
