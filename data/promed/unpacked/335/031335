Scrapie Infection Hits German Farm
-----------------------------------
More than 1500 sheep have been slaughtered at a farm in central Germany as a
precaution to prevent an outbreak of the livestock disease scrapie,
authorities said Mon 24 Jun 2002.
The entire flock at the farm near Fulda, east of Frankfurt, was slaughtered
after tests confirmed one animal was infected with scrapie, the Hesse state
social affairs ministry said. Scrapie is a member of a family of ailments
that includes mad cow disease.
The case was the third this year in Hesse. Scrapie poses no direct threat to
people, but the outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain is thought to be
related to feeding meal made of scrapie-infected sheep carcasses to cattle.
Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE], is
linked to the human illness variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

[This news item needs some clarification. The slaughter of the affected
flock is in line with the stamping-out policy of Germany regarding scrapie;
a single case, in one animal, is regarded an outbreak. Last year (2001) 3
sheep with scrapie were recorded in Germany, in 3 different flocks, thus 3
outbreaks were reported to the OIE and 544 sheep destroyed. The current case
in Hesse is not a precautionary measure to prevent an outbreak but the
eradication of an established outbreak.
Regarding the source of the BSE outbreak in the UK -- referred to in the
item -- there are several concurrent theories; the issue is not yet unequivo
cally solved.
Scrapie is one of the TSE (Transmisible Spongiform Encephalopathy) diseases,
which affect sheep and -- to a lesser extent -- goats and are non-zoonotic,
i.e. which are transmissible to others of the same species but not to
humans. Although the disease is regarded as endemic in many parts of the
world, only 22 of the 158 OIE member countries have reported its presence
during the years 1996 to 2000; Germany is one of them.
Germany was one of the first countries (along with England, Scotland, &
France) where scrapie was historically recorded during the 18th century.
Initially it was called there "der Trab" (trembling), later (early 19th C)
obtaining another name, "die Seuche" (the Disease). Its current common
German name is Traberkrankheit, meaning trembling disease.
The OIE has been considering the addition of a special chapter on scrapie to
its International Animal Health Code, thus enhancing surveillance and,
eventually, control of the disease in member states.
Laboratory trials, mainly in the UK, have shown that the BSE agent can be
experimentally introduced from cattle to sheep. If such a case occurs
primarily in countries where a BSE risk has been identified such cases
should be differentiated from scrapie in sheep and goats, mainly because
BSE, unlike scrapie, affects man. Several scientists have recently published
possible scenarios of such a hypothetical situation.
For additional data on scrapie, see chapter X.9. of the OIE Manual of
Standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2000
