100 000 Chickens at Infected Farm to be Destroyed
--------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Health officials will destroy all 100 000 chickens at a Hong
Kong farm following the mysterious deaths of several birds, the government
announced yesterday, in an apparent move to prevent a new outbreak of avian
flu.
Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department director Thomas Chan
said the slaughter will take place immediately at the farm, which was
placed under quarantine on Friday when 120 birds were found dead after they
were taken to a wholesale poultry market for inspection.
"So far it is an isolated incident and we are dealing with it quickly," he
said, adding that the operation will last two days. He said the sick
chickens were limited to just one farm.
Farm owner Lam Po Sang said the birds had not looked well since Wednesday
and that about 30 000 of them have died so far.
Health officials, wearing white protective smocks, collected blood and
offal samples from the chickens for testing. Officials said they could not
rule out that the chickens may have contracted avian flu.
Last May, avian flu infected thousands of chickens, forcing the government
to destroy 1.37 million birds.
A similar avian virus crossed over to the human population in 1997, killing
6 people.
