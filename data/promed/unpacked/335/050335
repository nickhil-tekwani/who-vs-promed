Dairy factory is officially declared the source of an epidemic
----------------------------------------
Dysentery enveloped the South of Russia 2 months ago. The total number of
people affected totaled 1661: in Krasnodarsky region 1431, in Stavrapolsky
55, in Rostovskaya oblast 70, in Adygeya 37, in North Ossetiya 42, in
Astrakhanskaya oblast 26. It became known that the source of the epidemic
was the Kropotkinsky dairy factory. Doctors discovered the pathogen of
so-called Zonne Dysentery in sour cream produced at the factory. Earlier 2
employees of the factory fell sick of dysentery.

[It is possible that the cause of the dysentery, probably a _Shigella_
species, was introduced into the dairy and then infected the
above-mentioned workers, or that the workers themselves were the vectors
that introduced the organism. An oblast is an administrative territorial
division within Russia and other former Soviet republics. The word is
apparently derived from an Old Church Slavonic word for power. - Mod.LL]
