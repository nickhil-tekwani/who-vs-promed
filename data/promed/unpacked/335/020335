Brown planthoppers and virus diseases threatening rice in West Java
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Karawang, Subang, Indramayu and Cirebon are important rice areas in
West Java [Java Barat]. Recently, the rice fields in these areas had
been threatened by brown planthopper (BPH) attacks. Areas attacked
increased from 450 ha [1112 acres] in February [2010] to ca. 10 000
ha [24 710 acres] in March 2010. About 250 ha [618 acres] were a
total loss amounting to about USD 125 000. There are indications that
the 2 virus diseases, rice ragged stunt and rice grassy stunt, are
increasing. Hundreds of hectares in Sukamandi have been affected.

In Subang, an area of nearly 200 ha [494 acres] managed by a hybrid
seed company were severely affected (see pictures) and harvest was
only 20 percent. Probably 3 factors triggered the outbreaks: (1)
farmers follow continuous cropping pattern, rice-rice-rice, (2) they
primarily grow susceptible varieties, such as Ciherang, IR42,
Mekongga, etc., and (3) mismanagement of insecticides, like using
wrong insecticides and wrong spraying techniques. Farmers using IR42
were infested by BPH just 1-2 days after insecticide application.

In Sukamandi, many plants were infected by both viruses that BPH
vector. About 30-40 percent were infected and these would have become
virus sources, unless the infected plants were eradicated.

[_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) has been
reported to cause yield losses of up to 90 percent in several Asian
countries. Symptoms include ragged appearance of plants, twisted
leaves, vein swelling, unfilled grains, and severe stunting of
plants. Its only way of spread is vector transmission by brown
planthoppers (_Nilaparvata lugens_). The insects transmit the virus
in a persistent manner and remain infectious for life. Infected
hoppers can be transported on air currents to spread the virus
quickly over long distances.

_Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) has been
reported to cause serious damage in limited areas during sporadic
outbreaks of its vector. It is spreading in large parts of the
rice-growing areas of Asia. RGSV is also transmitted exclusively by
vectors (_N. lugens_, _N. bakeri_ and _N. muiri_) in the same way.
Symptoms include severe stunting, excessive tillering ('grassy'
appearance), erect growth habit, leaf spots, and reduced pale leaves.
Infected plants usually survive until maturity, but produce no panicles.

High vector populations are often associated with outbreaks of these
viruses. Disease management for both viruses includes cultural
practices (such as short term draining of rice fields, crop rotation
or rice-free periods), vector control, and use of cultivars with
reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the vector, or both.
Cultivars resistant to the vector have low disease incidence, but
insect adaptation overcoming hopper resistance has been a problem.
The application of insecticides to migratory planthoppers is being
used in some areas to reduce disease incidence.

_N. lugens_ is one of the worst pests of rice in the Australasian and
Pacific Island region. In addition to being a virus vector, it causes
yellowing, browning, and drying of plants ('hopper burn') and leaves
small injuries exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections.
An increase in rice hoppers has been reported in areas growing new
hybrid rice, for example, in China, resulting in severe crop damage
and an increased risk of the spread of associated viruses. A similar
increase in some pests and pathogens in improved varieties has also
been observed in other crops and regions, and it has been suggested
that this may be due to higher insect appeal and/or an increased
ability to sustain pathogen replication by healthier, more vigorous plants.
