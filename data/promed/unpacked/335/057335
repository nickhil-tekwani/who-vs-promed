The Uberaba Regional Health Administration [GRS] is investigating a
case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The case occurred in the Araxa
region, where a GRS team is conducting a survey related to the case.
The victim is a 21-year-old young woman who was infected in the Araxa
region and died in the Clinics Hospital of the Universidade Federal do
Triangulo Mineiro [HC da UFTM]. A GRS team formed for hantavirus
expertise, Marcia Maria de Souza and Jose Maria Sales, are in Araxa
carrying out investigations, and have not yet determined where the
victim was infected. "Today we met with a municipal zoonoses team to
inform the group about the disease and now have communicated with the
city infectious disease physician about the occurrence of the
disease," said Souza.

According to the team, the victim was attended to in Araxa and later
was transferred to the HC da UFTM. "She died in February 2011, but
[the death] was recorded as [a] hantavirus [infection]. Since that
disease was not confirmed, we ran the hemorrhagic fever protocol with
symptoms in common and detected spotted fever. Thus, we had a
confirmation Friday afternoon [25 Mar 2011] a GRS team came
immediately to Araxa to carry out an investigation," she said,
pointing out that they had are having all support from the staff of
the neighboring town.

Marcia Maria stated that the last case of spotted fever was reported
more than 10 years earlier. "This is a new fact and we are doing
everything possible to to avoid additional occurrences of the disease.
The 1st action, according to the protocol, is to identify the probable
location of the infection and inform the zoonoses staff," she said.

Spotted fever is an infectious, acute febrile disease with high
mortality [if untreated - Mod.LL], transmitted by an infected tick.
"The disease is caused by a bacterium of the _Rickettsia_ genus. The
main reservoirs of the _Rickettsia_ are ticks of the _Amblyomma
cajennense_ species, commonly known as the star tick. [The
_Rickettsia_] is not transmitted person to person, only by the
vector," she stated, pointing out that there are reports of the
disease in Brazil since 1929.

The main symptoms are high fever, red spots on the skin, intense body
pain, general malaise, nausea and vomiting. Treatment with drugs
[antibiotics] must be initiated immediately, even before laboratory
results confirm the disease [diagnosis]. In serious cases, there are
specific medications and supportive measures and in most cases the
patient requires intensive care.

>From 1995 - 2009 there were reports of about 210 cases in Minas
Gerais. In 2010, 6 cases were confirmed in the state, with 4
registered in the Diamantina municipality and one in the Catuji
municipality.

Brazilian spotted fever is known in Portuguese as "febre maculosa
brasileira." The disease is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, with only subtle differences. The etiological agent,
_Rickettsia ricketsii_, is considered almost identical to its American
counterpart.

The disease was 1st described in 1929 but underwent a
still-unexplained disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985, it
has been found with increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais
states, but cases have been seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo
states. Cases have also been identified in the state of Santa Catarina
in the south. The main vector tick is _Amblyomma cajennense_, but _A.
cooperii_ has been also implicated.

It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to
minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas
such as the midwestern USA, where the disease is uncommon. The time
frame in this case is not clear.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing
human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from
grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After
crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site
(wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate
and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice
daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission.
Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be
more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific: fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache
is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of
illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before
becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well
as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen
before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if
treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of
the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people
with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring
and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
