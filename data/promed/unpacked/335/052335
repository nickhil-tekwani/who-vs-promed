Water warning targets hikers / 3 dozen sickened in viral outbreak on
Appalachian Trail
----------------------
Health officials are urging hikers along the Appalachian Trail
to boil their drinking water or treat it with chemicals in the wake of a
viral outbreak that has sickened more than three dozen hikers since last
week.
State and local health experts were on the trail yesterday interviewing
hikers in an effort to pinpoint the cause of the illness, which seems to be
the Norwalk virus, said Dick Tabb, environmental health manager for the
Alleghany/Roanoke City Health District.
The Norwalk virus causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea over several days,
and it can be spread by sharing water or food or even by shaking hands,
Tabb said.
"It's extremely contagious," he added. "And you're dealing with conditions
on the Appalachian Trail, where sanitation facilities aren't very good."
The outbreak that began last week apparently began in an area between
Catawba and Troutville, judging from the number of sick hikers who left the
trail in the area.
Authorities are investigating the water at a store in Catawba as the
possible source of the outbreak. Unhealthy amounts of fecal coliform
bacteria were found in the water. However, authorities said hikers might
have picked up the virus by drinking from streams, which are unusually low
now and possibly high in [microbes.
"It could be as simple as someone coming on the trail with the virus and
spreading it among other hikers," Tabb said.
"Right now we don't have enough information to make judgments based on
anecdotes," said Molly Rutledge, Roanoke's health director. "We need the
facts, and we have a team out there on the Appalachian Trail working hard
to get the facts as quickly as we can."
Tabb said epidemiological investigators have questioned 18 sick hikers so
far. They also are questioning healthy hikers to determine what
person-to-person contact and sources of food and water they have in common.
Health officials also have asked trail clubs to spread the word up and down
the Appalachian Trail and advise hikers to filter their drinking water and
either boil it or treat it with iodine or chlorine. The Norwalk virus is
able to slip through most canteen filters, Tabb said.
Authorities also are urging hikers to eat only food that has been stored
properly.
