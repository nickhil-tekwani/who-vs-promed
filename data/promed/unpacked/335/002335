Between 1 Jan and 25 Apr 2015, the Ministry of Public Health of Niger notified WHO of 1543 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 147 deaths. Suspected cases have been reported in 7 of Niger's 8 regions. Meningococcal meningitis outbreaks have been confirmed in several areas of Dosso and Niamey regions.

In Dosso region, 282 cases, including 27 deaths have been reported, primarily from Dogon-Doutchi and Gaya districts where several areas have exceeded the epidemic threshold. In Niamey, 944 suspected cases, including 88 deaths, have so far been reported. 3 of Niamey's 5 districts (Niamey I, II, and III, with a total population of over 660 000) have exceeded the epidemic threshold.

Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C in the affected areas, with _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W also being identified in several samples.

A national epidemic committee has been activated to manage the outbreak. An international investigation team composed of WHO and CDC has been deployed to support the Ministry of Public Health's (MoH) investigation of the outbreak and reinforce the surveillance capacity in the country.

WHO and partners are providing support to the government of Niger for the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has approved three vaccination requests, one from MSF and 2 from the MoH with support from WHO and UNICEF, releasing in total 460 000 doses of [meningitis] ACW vaccine, as well as 18 500 antibiotic vials to respond to the outbreak. Case management and social mobilisation activities are also ongoing.

Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, W135, and sometimes X. In the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, designated the WHO African meningitis belt, large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. The African meningitis belt extends from Ethiopia in the East, to Senegal in the West and includes Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf).

Serogroup A meningococcus had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). WHO has promoted vaccinating all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Recent outbreaks of other meningococcal serogroups following recent mass vaccination with serogroup A conjugate vaccine likely represent serogroup replacement in the meningitis belt. - Mod.ML]
