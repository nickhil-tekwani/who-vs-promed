Indonesia will procure 28.7 million vaccine doses for foot and mouth disease [FMD] by year-end and limit livestock transportation between regions amid a surge in cases, a senior minister said on Thursday [23 Jun 2022]. The country launched a nationwide livestock vaccination programme last week, as the disease has been found in 19 of the country's 34 provinces, with the number of infected livestock growing quickly from 20 000 last month [May 2022] to 232 549 this week.

Infections have spread ahead of the Eid al-Adha festival, when Muslims traditionally slaughter animals and share the meat with the poor.

"The president instructed that we prepare the medicines immediately and to prepare enough personnel who can vaccinate," coordinating minister of economic affairs Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement. The procurement of 3 million vaccine doses is under way from producers in France, Australia, Brazil and New Zealand, and the government expects to import 16 million doses in the next 3 months, Hartarto said earlier this week. The country also aims to buy locally made vaccines, the production of which is expected to start by the end of August [2022].

About 3000 cattle had been vaccinated as of Thursday [23 Jun 2022]. Lawmakers had accused the government of letting the virus spread widely for the first time since the late 1980s. They have urged the government to ramp up efforts to prevent further spread.

[Indonesia has submitted on 23 Jun 2022 its first follow-up report on the FMD event to the WOAH. The disease recurred for the first time since 1983. The epizootic started, according to the official report, on 13 Apr 2022, caused by FMD virus serotype O.

According to the update, the disease has spread so far throughout the republic's main islands Sumatra (8 provinces), Java (6 provices), Borneo (3 provinces), the island-province Bangka-Belitung and the island Lombok of the province West Nusa Tenggara, totalling 19 affected provinces, most of the country's territory. The distance, as the crow flies, between the most western outbreak, in the province Aceh, Sumatra, and the most eastern one, on Lombok, exceeds 2600 km (~1615 mi). A map presenting the outbreaks is included in the follow-up report, available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=56084.

The report presents the total number of cases as follows: cattle 64 919, buffaloes 1454, sheep 532, goats 229 and swine 16.

Initial clinical cases were diagnosed as bovine ephemeral fever and were treated unsuccessfully before further disease spread and mortalities were observed. The diagnosis was reported to the OIE on 9 May 2022. FMD viral sequence data were exchanged with the OIE and FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease in the United Kingdom (Pirbright Institute), confirming the presence of serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e lineage). It remains to be checked if this is the only FMD virus strain circulating in Indonesia.

The vaccination seems to be in its initial phase. Eid al-Adha, a festival involving massive trade in livestock for the ritual sacrifice, is expected to be celebrated on 10 Jul 2022. Without the adoption of severe animal movement restrictions, the (extremely infectious) FMD virus is expected to continue its spread.

FMD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
