On Aamir's request I am posting a citation. The manuscript is in press in
the European Journal of Tropical Medicine and International Health. I am
assuming it will come out within the next two months.
Proud to say that myself, Aamir and others worked on this study with
scientists like Dr. Mc Cormick, Dr. Fisher Hoch and of course Dr. Steve
Luby. The citation is:

Pakistan: Contact tracing and risk assessment. Tropical Medicine and
International Health. In Press
SUMMARY
In December 1994 in a private hospital in Quetta, Pakistan, 3
health-workers contracted Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) after
surgery on an actively bleeding patient who later died. We conducted a
retrospective study to determine transmission risks among contacts.
Fifty contacts gave blood for antibody tests and answered questions about
exposure. Two of 4 people exposed percutaneously, i.e. blood crossing
breached skin and 1 of 5 with cutaneous exposure, i.e. blood touching
intact skin, contracted CCHF. The person with cutaneous exposure was a
surgeon who tore his glove during surgery, noted blood on his hand but did
not note any skin-breach.
There were no anti-CCHF antibodies or CCHF cases among persons who had body
fluids other than blood contact skin (0/4), skin to skin contact (0/16), or
physical proximity (0/21). The index case's relatives reported that
although ten family members had cutaneous exposure, none developed CCHF.
The family refused blood tests.
CCHF transmission in resource constrained settings can be limited by
focusing on avoiding health worker contact with blood.
