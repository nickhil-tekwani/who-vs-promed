[Ref. Jolobe OMP. Extending the clinical spectrum of thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome attributable to adenovirus-based vaccines for Covid-19 (published online ahead of print, 23 May 2021). Am J Emerg Med. 2021;doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2021.05.053.]

The report by Yocum et al. [1] adds a new dimension to the syndrome of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) attributable to Ad26.COV2-S vaccination [2,3] [See comment section for report].

In their report, Yocum et al. report a case [1] which differed from the other 2 VITT cases [2,3] in having acute kidney injury as the manifestation of the prothrombotic state, arguably as a result of thrombotic occlusion of renal microvasculature [4]. Furthermore, at 62, their patient was older [1] than the patients in the other 2 reports [2,3], and the 37 days interval between vaccination and symptom onset [1] was longer than the vaccine-to-symptom onset interval documented in the other 2 reports [2,3].

The symptomatology was also distinctive, the main feature being an acute-onset confusional state characterised by combative behaviour, which included ripping things off the wall and tearing her room apart. The patient had also been vomiting, and her room was covered in emesis, and there was also feces on the floor. All this, in spite of the fact that prior to going upstairs to her room, she had been in a state of good mental and physical health and had eaten dinner with her family. Physical examination revealed scattered petechiae but did not reveal any focal neurological signs.

In the context of thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the association of acute confusional symptoms and acute onset renal failure reported by Yocum et al. could, arguably, have been attributable to sudden-onset thrombotic occlusion of cerebral microvasculature and sudden onset thrombotic occlusion of renal microvasculature, both phenomena well recognised in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [4]. By contrast, in See et al., and in Muir et al., thrombotic occlusion was extrarenal in location, involving the cerebral venous sinuses, middle cerebral artery, portal venous system, internal jugular vein, and lower limb deep veins, respectively [2,3]. Notwithstanding the cerebrovascular involvement, the only manifestation of cognitive impairment was "cognitive fogginess" in only one patient [2]. Accordingly, there appear to be fundamental differences in the pattern of vascular involvement, namely, microvascular thrombotic occlusion in Yocum et al. [1] versus large vessel thrombotic occlusion in the other 2 cases [2,3].

Synonyms for VITT include Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Syndrome (TTS) [5]. Tom Shimabukure and his team defined a "definite" case of TTS as one characterised by the following:

(i) Platelet count under 150 000/ul with confirmatory peripheral smear showing reduced platelets with no evidence of clumping that could indicate a falsely low platelet count.
(ii) Presence of thrombosis/thromboembolism confirmed by one or more of the following, namely, imaging studies, surgical procedures, and pathologic examination [6].

The Expert Haematology Panel of the United Kingdom defined a "definite case" of VITT as one characterised by platelet count under 150 000/ul and very raised D dimer levels, the latter above the level expected for venous thromboembolism. That panel also noted that, in many cases, antibodies to platelet factor 4 have been identified in the absence of exposure to heparin treatment [7].

The ChAdOx1-nCoV 19 is another adenovirus-based vaccine for which data on VITT have been published in the medical literature. There are data on 58 cases (45 females) of whom 48 were aged under 60 [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The twin derangements of thrombocytopenia and raised D-dimer levels were documented in 51 cases. In the 7 other cases, only one of either of the 2 derangements was documented. Thrombotic manifestations were present in 57 cases. The only patient who lacked clinically overt thrombotic manifestations was a 71-year-old woman who, nevertheless, had a D dimer level of 20 000 ug/L [9]. The spectrum of thrombotic occlusion comprised cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) (36 cases), and, also, thrombosis involving the middle cerebral artery, the coronary arteries, portal venous system, the internal jugular veins, and the lower limb veins, respectively. One patient was exceptional in having documentation of thrombotic occlusion at microvascular level (involving the brain and kidneys), but this documentation was only made at autopsy [10]. Only one patient (aged 34) presented with mental agitation, and that patient had CSVT and intracranial hemorrhage [8]. The longest interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms of VITT was 24 days [9]. The latter was in a 49-year-old woman in whom pulmonary embolism was the only documented manifestation of VITT [9].

In short, the report by Yocum extends the clinical spectrum of the thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome attributable to adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccines to include symptoms that can best be explained by assuming that thrombotic occlusion had taken place at microvascular level. This pattern of thrombotic occlusion has also been documented in one example of VITT attributable to ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccination [10].

"Abstract
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for 2 highly effective Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. More recently, EUA was granted for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which uses traditional virus-based technology. In this vaccine, researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to modified Adenovirus 26 and named it Ad26.COV2-S. Nearly 7 million doses of the Ad26.COV2-S have been administered as of mid-April 2021. Recently, the Federal Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed data involving 6 reported cases in the United States of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia in people who received the vaccination. All cases were in women between 18 and 48, with symptoms developing 6 to 13 days after vaccination. A recent study in the United Kingdom reported similar events in 23 patients age 21 to 77, 61% of which were female, with cases of presumed vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia occurring 6 to 24 days after vaccination. We report a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of altered mental status. She had received the Ad26.COV2-S vaccine 37 days prior to ED presentation. She developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and no other cause was found. To our knowledge, this is the 1st case in the United States of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after receiving the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine." - Mod.LK]

Date: Sat 28 May 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-variants.html?searchResultPosition=1


If world leaders don't act now, the end of the Covid pandemic may come with a horrible form of herd immunity, as more transmissible variants that are taking hold around the world kill millions.

There's troubling new evidence that the B.1.617.2 variant, 1st identified in India, could be far more transmissible than even the B.1.1.7 variant, 1st identified in Britain, which contributed to some of the deadliest surges around the world.

In countries with widespread vaccination, like the United States and Britain, we can expect that Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths will continue to decline or stay low, especially because lab tests and real-world experience show that vaccines appear to defend recipients well against the severe effects of both variants.

For much of the rest of the world, though, this even more transmissible new variant could be catastrophic.

The evidence is not yet conclusive because the data is preliminary, and figuring out whether a variant is more transmissible isn't easy. It could be spreading rapidly in an area because of chance. Maybe it got there before other variants and found a susceptible population or got lucky and seeded a mega-cluster. If a variant is seen more frequently in a country's genomic databases, it could just be because travelers, who are often tested more routinely, are bringing it in from another country where it is already dominant.

One key measure that's been used in previous outbreaks to figure out whether a variant was more transmissible was to look at "secondary attack rates" in non-travel settings, or how many people who come into close contact with an infected person get the virus themselves. The greater the number of these contacts getting the virus, on average, the greater the likelihood that a variant's transmissibility is greater.

Data on secondary attack rates released by a British public health agency similar to our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that this variant 1st seen in India may be substantially more transmissible among close contacts than even the already highly transmissible B.1.1.7. A report published by the same agency on Thu 27 May 2021 further supports last week's findings. It was just such early data that raised alarms about B.1.1.7, with later information confirming those early fears.

Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also told me that the faster spread in areas of Britain with higher levels of the variant suggests it has higher transmissibility. This point seems to be backed up by the terrible outbreaks in India and neighboring Nepal, where it is also widespread. Given how limited genetic identification is in those countries, the data from Britain is particularly useful for assessing the risk.

A variant with higher transmissibility is a huge danger to people without immunity, either from vaccination or prior infection, even if the variant is no more deadly than previous versions of the virus. Residents of countries like Taiwan or Viet Nam that had almost completely kept out the pandemic and countries like India and Nepal that had fared relatively well until recently have fairly little immunity and are largely unvaccinated. A more transmissible variant can burn through such an immunologically naive population very quickly.

Increased transmissibility is an exponential threat. If a virus that could previously infect 3 people on average can now infect 4, it looks like a small increase. Yet if you start with just 2 infected people in both scenarios, just 10 iterations later, the former will have caused about 40 000 cases, while the latter will be more than 524 000, a nearly 13-fold difference.

Morally and practically, this emergency demands immediate action: widespread vaccination of those most vulnerable where the threat is greatest.

Waiving vaccine patents is fine, but unless it's tied to a process that actually increases the supply of vaccines, it's a little bit more than expressing thoughts and prayers after a tragedy. Officials from all nations that produce vaccines need to gather for an emergency meeting immediately to decide how to commandeer whatever excess capacity they have to produce more through whatever means necessary. Because of the threat of increased transmissibility, and since the evidence at hand indicates that all of the vaccines, even the Chinese and Russian versions, appear to be highly effective against severe disease or worse, the focus should be on manufacturing and distributing the highest number of doses possible as fast as possible.

If the choice is between no vaccine and any vaccine, the precedence should go to whatever can be manufactured fastest, regardless of patents, nation of origin, or countries prioritizing their allies or wannabe allies.

Vaccine supplies need to be diverted now to where the crisis is the worst and, if necessary, away from the wealthy countries that have purchased most of the supply. It is, of course, understandable that every nation wants to vaccinate its own 1st, but a country with high levels of vaccination, especially among its more vulnerable populations, can hold things off, especially if they also had big outbreaks before. In addition, excess stockpiles can go where they are needed without even slowing down existing vaccination programs.

Right now, Covax, the global alliance for vaccine equity, does not have enough vaccines to distribute, and what supply it does get is allocated according to national population, not the seriousness of outbreaks. This needs to change. Our fire department needs more water and should direct it to where the fire is burning, not to every house on the street.

The responses could vary. The elderly and healthcare workers could be prioritized wherever a crisis is worst. Dose-sparing strategies could be applied; delaying boosters has been successful in Britain and Canada when they faced surges. The details can be decided by the global health authorities.

If there is a reasonable possibility that the world faces a mounting threat, it's best to intervene as early and aggressively as possible, because even a few weeks of delay could make a huge difference. Waiting for definitive evidence of transmissibility could allow the variant to rampage; besides, if fears prove unfounded, then the world would still be better off for being more vaccinated. And any solution, even if imperfect, is better than waiting for the perfect setup or the most conclusive evidence.

As Dr. Kucharski told me, it's now entirely possible that most Covid deaths could occur after there are enough vaccines to protect those most at risk globally. Britain had more daily Covid-related deaths during the surge involving B.1.1.7 than in the 1st wave, when there was less understanding of how to treat the disease and far fewer therapeutics that later helped cut mortality rates. Even after the vaccination campaign began, B.1.1.7 kept spreading rapidly among the unvaccinated. A similar pattern was observed in much of Eastern Europe as well.

Even if it is determined that the transmissibility of B.1.617.2 isn't as bad as feared, the emergency is still there.

The kind of catastrophic outbreak like the one in India can cause many more needless deaths simply by overwhelming our resources. Already, there are reports that countries ranging from Nepal to Philippines to South Africa to Nigeria may face supplemental oxygen shortages of the kind seen in India. This pathogen has one fatality rate when oxygen is available as a therapy and one when it is not, and it would be an unspeakable tragedy to suffer the latter in the 2nd year of the pandemic.

Like all pandemics, this one will end either with millions -- maybe billions -- being infected or being vaccinated. This time, world leaders have a choice, but little time to make that choice before it is made for them.

[This opinion piece paints a very dire picture unless the world acts immediately to vaccinate the population in the hotspots where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is intense. Covax is experiencing a shortage of vaccine, so it is unable to address this problem. It is up to the developed world and vaccine producers to take action to protect vulnerable people. Viruses, especially respiratory viruses, do not respect borders. This is a global emergency. - Mod.LK]

[3] Indoor air cleaners
Date: Thu 27 May 2021
Source: Mother Jones [abridged, edited]
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/air-purifier-covid-asthma-unproven-science-coronavirus-ionization/


Desperate to reopen and loaded with stimulus cash, schools are spending millions on high-tech purifiers. But are they safe?

Brandon Armbruster just wanted to keep his students safe. The chief operating officer of St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, Armbruster spent the spring and summer of 2020 diligently preparing for students to return, designing outdoor classrooms, setting up testing routines, and debating whether to cancel sports.

A private school with nearly 1000 K-12 students on 2 campuses, St. Andrew's had its own advisory committee of doctors and scientists to guide decisions about COVID. And as they learned more about how the coronavirus could hang suspended in aerosols for hours, the committee urged Armbruster to turn his attention to ventilation and ways to maximize the amount of fresh air St. Andrew's could pump into its classrooms.

So, when a contractor the school had worked with before suggested installing high-tech devices in air ducts to scrub out the coronavirus, Armbruster was intrigued. The devices used a technique called bipolar ionization, shooting tiny, electrically charged ions into the air, where they would interact with and neutralize airborne contaminants like viruses. Or, at least, that's the theory. According to the manufacturer, Plasma Air, the Spanish Ministry of Defense had backed research that proved its purifier could reduce 99 percent of a coronavirus surrogate from the air in a Madrid hotel room within 10 minutes. All St. Andrew's would need to do was attach Plasma Air's small cartridges into its air ducts, hook them up to some electricity, and let the ionization process begin.

Armbruster, a 45-year-old business and finance guy, liked how the ionizers sounded more "proactive" than filters, which trap tiny contaminants as they float through air ducts or are sucked into the kind of free-standing air purifier you can buy at Home Depot. The contractor assured him that other Texas schools had already gone ahead with the technology. But Armbruster wasn't convinced. For one thing, he couldn't find much data on bipolar ionization that didn't come directly from the companies peddling the products. And a video on the Plasma Air website raised red flags. In a science-fair style experiment captured on camera, 2 slices of bread were placed side by side in transparent boxes, one with a Plasma Air ionizer running, and one without. Over 6 days, mold blossomed across the bread in the non-ionized box; the other slice appeared fresh. "Yeah, it works great inside a small box," Armbruster remembers thinking. "But what's it going to do for a big classroom?"

To find out, he got in touch with Atila Novoselac and Pawel Misztal, 2 engineering professors and indoor air experts at the University of Texas, Austin. He asked whether they would run tests on a couple of these ionizers before the school forked over more than USD 100 000. "Well, why not?" Novoselac recalls answering. They didn't have access to a biosafety lab where they could test the ionizers against actual coronavirus. But they could measure whether the machines removed particles or broke down volatile organic compounds released in the air by household cleaning products, which would give them an idea of whether they worked as advertised. "We were quite excited initially," Misztal says, "because we thought, 'Wow, if this is really true, with those bold claims that the company was making, that should really help schools.'"

Yet, when they turned on the ionizers in their own stainless steel chamber, the 2 engineers couldn't detect any meaningful change in air quality. At 1st they thought the devices must not be working. After consulting the manual and running the tests again, they got the same results. Both researchers cautioned that their experiments were informal and confined to the 2 specific devices they tested. But the conclusions were unambiguous: "Installing this unit in a classroom's HVAC was as good as putting a brick in a duct," Novoselac wrote in an email to another researcher.

Armbruster passed on Plasma Air, instead opting to overhaul St. Andrew's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and add higher-efficiency filters. But Plasma Air's slice of the air purifier industry is doing just fine without him. Since the onset of the pandemic, companies hawking indoor air cleaners have benefited from people's fears over the air in their businesses, schools, and workplaces; an enormous amount of government and corporate money being spent to ensure those places can be reopened safely; and an almost entirely unregulated landscape in which to sell fancy-sounding but largely unproven technology.

The new universe of air scrubbers goes by a lot of names -- bipolar ionization, photocatalytic oxidation, "organic air"-- but some experts refer to them as "additive" purifiers. They all share the same underlying principle: Rather than simply subtracting matter from the air using a filter, they add molecules to create chemical reactions that, at least in theory, eliminate airborne contaminants. Those molecules supposedly float out into a room and destroy viruses, break down harmful gases, or make particles stick together, causing them to get trapped in filters or settle on surfaces, where they can't be inhaled. Some manufacturers emphasize that their process mimics the atmospheric activity found near crashing waves, mountaintops, and waterfalls.

The reality is far less rosy. In interviews with Mother Jones, nearly a dozen chemists, engineers, and indoor air-quality experts laid out a range of possible dangers. 1st, there's the matter of the molecules that additive purifiers release into air, which can include ozone or free radicals. Ozone, a highly reactive form of oxygen, has long been known to damage lungs and worsen chronic respiratory diseases. While some purifiers are certified to produce undetectable levels of ozone, others produce much more. And little oversight exists to keep levels in check. Free radicals, meanwhile, have an odd number of electrons, which makes them unstable and greedy. When they meet other molecules, they grab their electrons, transforming into something new. While purifiers rely on those transformations to destroy unwanted gases, some research suggests free radicals may damage lung tissue when inhaled.

Experts also worry the machines run the risk of creating harmful byproducts like formaldehyde, a probable carcinogen at high concentrations. A federal class-action lawsuit filed in May 2021 against one of Plasma Air's competitors, Global Plasma Solutions (GPS), alleges that bipolar ionizers "make the air worse for people" by causing toxic chemicals to form.

In 2 recent studies conducted in China, researchers found that ionizing air purifiers tested in schools reduced particulate matter but also appeared to cause health problems. "Indoor air is a complex chemical soup," explains Jeff Siegel, a University of Toronto civil engineering professor who has spent decades researching air cleaners. "If you're operating one of these devices, the most charitable thing I can say is you are doing an uncontrolled experiment on the air in your building," Siegel says. "In some environments, this could be really hazardous."

As public knowledge about the dangers of indoor ozone grew, engineers set about redesigning ionizers, trying to avoid releasing significant levels of the gas. Today, manufacturers like Plasma Air and GPS boast that their devices produce tiny levels of ozone, if any at all. Still, small increases in ozone concentrations are associated with increased risk of death from respiratory causes, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which compared 23 years of ozone data in 96 US cities with health outcomes for more than 400 000 patients.

Farmer also warned another school administrator, Chris Wilderman, about a different type of additive purifier: bipolar ionizers. Wilderman, the director of maintenance and operations for one of Colorado's largest districts, was helping to decide how to spend millions in CARES Act funding. Last summer [2020], he installed bipolar ionizers from Global Plasma Solutions in 2 schools that couldn't bring enough outside air into classrooms. He was considering putting GPS units in more buildings when he heard Farmer talking about indoor air quality on NPR. Farmer, at the time, was working with other scientists on what they believe is the 1st peer-reviewed study assessing whether bipolar ionization reduces particulates or forms byproducts in a real-life setting, examining, coincidentally, GPS devices. Though the study, published in March 2021, did not look at the effect of ionizers on viruses, it found that the machines did little to reduce particulate matter in both a test chamber and an occupied office building. And while the purifier appeared to break down some concerning gases, it seemed to produce small increases in others, like acetaldehyde and toluene, which the EPA classifies as hazardous. (One bright spot: the researchers concluded the system was not producing ozone.)

Wilderman says Farmer's advice was "don't get fancy." He decided to put air purifiers with HEPA filters in every classroom in the district. "SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through exhaled aerosols," Farmer explains. "One way to really reduce that risk is to remove as many particles as you can from the air. That's what having a HEPA filter is designed for."

For Wilderman, outfitting a single high school with 143 free-standing HEPA purifiers cost USD 26 884. Putting in GPS ionizers in that same school would have run about USD 350 000. (GPS points out that its ionizers don't require replacement filters.)

As scientists have started to raise alarms, some institutions have reversed course on additive air purifiers. In February 2021, the Sacramento school district pulled photocatalytic oxidation machines from school buildings after a Sacramento Bee investigation led to outcry from the teachers' union. Public schools in Montclair, New Jersey turned off their GPS ionizers after parent objections. And last summer [2020], when a Phoenix megachurch hosting a Trump rally announced it had installed purifiers that could supposedly kill "99 percent of SARS COV-2 within 10 minutes," backlash from experts led the state attorney general to issue warning letters to both the church and the company, Clean Air EXP. Each rolled back its claims. (Clean Air EXP rebranded 4 months later. It now sells under the name PuriFi Labs.)

Yet no US governmental body has attempted to regulate the indoor air cleaner industry systematically. Products that can't pass California's ozone test are sold freely in other states; one ActivePure website, for example, serves different homepages to customers outside the state. The FTC has sent warning letters to a handful of air purifier companies making COVID-related claims but has not publicly announced any follow-up action, according to a spokesperson. And while the FDA regulates medical devices, it's up to companies to decide whether to seek that certification.

In an email to Mother Jones, an EPA spokesperson said it keeps an eye on false and misleading claims from air purifier manufacturers but that companies aren't required to submit safety or efficacy data to the agency. "EPA is concerned about the potential for schools to be victimized," the spokesperson said. But enforcement, for now, is case by case.

"These products just fall in that gray zone where no government authority is really ready to provide oversight or regulation for them," Farmer says. "It's probably not going to happen until someone gets really badly hurt."

All the scientists I spoke with say that the goal should be more peer-reviewed research on what exactly additive cleaners are doing. In the meantime, indoor air-quality experts are urging schools to follow the precautionary principle: "If you don't understand it, do not use it," Zaatari says. She's working on an ASHRAE standard for additive air-cleaner testing and raising money for more research. A handful of scientists recently released an online tool to help convert additive purifier manufacturer data into more informative metrics. Corsi, Stephens, and others have all given webinars cautioning schools to stick to proven methods like increasing the flow of outdoor air and upgrading filters. Farmer, in conversations with school administrators, has recommended they simply duct-tape HEPA filters to box fans: USD 50 apiece, no risk of byproducts.

And in April 2021, a dozen indoor air-quality scientists and engineers co-signed an open letter to schools written by Zaatari and another consultant. "Many districts, constrained by varying degrees of limited budgets, deferred maintenance, and pressure to get kids back in school, have already implemented electronic air cleaning devices, relying on incomplete data and exaggerated claims to make a well-intended, but incorrect decision," they wrote. "Despite the resources invested, we recommend that these districts strongly consider turning off or disabling these electronic air cleaners to prevent unintended harm to building occupants."

[4] Immune response to variants
Date: Tue 25 May 2021

Geers D, Shamier MC, Bogers S et al. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern partially escape humoral but not T-cell responses in COVID-19 convalescent donors and vaccinees. Science Immunology: 6(59), eabj1750. DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abj175025 May 2021 Supplementary Materials immunology.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/6/59/eabj1750/DC1.

Abstract
"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations in the spike (S) protein has raised concern about potential immune escape. Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). 23 HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a 2nd dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.
