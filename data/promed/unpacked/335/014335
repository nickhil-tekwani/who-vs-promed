Increased death toll in Baluchistan outbreak of haemorrhagic fever
------------------------------------------------------------------
The death of 11 people from "haemorrhagic fever" [suspected to be a
consequence of infection by Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, has
spread panic among residents of the Loralai district in Pakistan's western
Baluchistan province. Health ministry officials say dozens of others
affected by the virus have been moved to Quetta and to civil hospitals in
Loralai. The poor communication system in Baluchistan, however, is
preventing the authorities from ascertaining how many people have actually
been affected or have died so far. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus
was last reported in Pakistan in 1976 and in Dubai in 1980. According to a
newspaper report then, about 9 died [in the previous outbreak.
The increasing number of haemorrhagic fever cases in various parts of [the
district, including Dukki, Murgha Kibzai and Sunjavi suggests that something
is seriously wrong in the area. Naimatullah Gichki, the director-general of
the Baluchistan health department, says that all possible measures to cope
with the situation have been adopted. "We have established isolation wards
for such patients in Quetta and Loralai where the patients are being
treated. We have also provided anti-virus capsules [? to the patients," he
said.
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, the suspected cause of the
outbreak, [is a member of the _Nairovirus_ genus (family _Bunyaviridae_) of
tick-borne viruses. In Africa the virus has been isolated from a variety of
animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, hare and hedgehogs, and from a
number of ticks which parasitize them, including _Hyalomma_. In most of the
cases, doctors say the onset of the illness is sudden with fever, chills,
severe muscular pain, headache, vomiting and pain in epigastric and umber
regions. A haemorrhagic state develops from the third to the fifth day and
manifests itself as epistaxis, haemoptysis, haematemesis, malaena and
haematuria.
Health department sources have said that they have obtained blood samples of
the victims, which will be sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) in
Islamabad for laboratory tests. The samples will then be sent to the World
Health Organisation's headquarters in Geneva for a final confirmation. It
has been learnt that the WHO is providing all possible assistance to the
provincial health department, including blood kits and technical guidelines
so that the situation can be assessed properly. A WHO representative has
also proceeded to Loralai to ascertain the facts.

[It must be stressed that there is no positive laboratory confirmation that
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is the agent responsible for this
outbreak, although that is the universal assumption in the media reports
from this area. - Mod.CP
