The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management [DEM] is issuing a warning for pet owners after several wild animals tested positive for canine distemper [CDV], a serious and often deadly virus.

Officials say the vaccine to prevent the disease in dogs is recommended but not mandatory, and warns unvaccinated animals are at an increased risk.

"It's a virus that affects multiple systems in the body," said Shale Bushnell, an emergency veterinarian with Ocean State Emergency Veterinary Specialists. "Generally, respiratory and neurological is what we tend to see, but it can also cause gastrointestinal signs like vomiting and diarrhea as well."

DEM said several raccoons and skunks in Jamestown and Warwick have tested positive for canine distemper.

In a news release, officials said, "Jamestown and Warwick Police advised that over the past 2 months, they have taken calls from residents saying they'd seen sickly-looking raccoons and skunks. Officers euthanized several animals that were exhibiting symptoms such as shaking, walking in circles, and loss of awareness of people approaching them. DEM's Division of Fish & Wildlife submitted these animals for testing and the test results recently confirmed the diagnosis of CDV. Symptoms of the illness typically include an emaciated appearance, disorientation, lethargy, and aimless wandering."

Officials said animals are typically exposed to the virus by an infected dog.

"Puppies and dogs most often become infected through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) to the virus from an infected animal or when dogs have direct contact with droppings from an infected animal," DEM said. "It also can be transmitted by shared food and water bowls (another reason not to leave pet food dishes outside)."

Veterinarians said vaccinating your pet is the best way to protect them. "Most vets give a vaccine booster every 3 or 4 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age and then going at least 16 weeks of age before they're considered immune," Bushnell told NBC 10 News [Fri 4 Oct 2019].

Pet owner [TM] said her dog is vaccinated. "I do walk in the woods with him so I am a little concerned," [TM] told NBC 10 [Fri 4 Oct 2019]. "Get them vaccinated. Especially if there's wild animals, because they come into contact with rabbits or skunks or raccoons, so I would say they definitely should be vaccinated."

[KDB] said her dog is also vaccinated, but worries about the dogs that aren't. "Absolutely have your dogs vaccinated because it's the same as vaccinations in people," she told NBC 10 News. "You're putting other dogs at risk for your dogs not being vaccinated."

DEM said distemper has been rare in Rhode Island. Officials say there's been an uptick in cases related to more rescue dogs being brought in from Southern states where distemper is more prevalent.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing similar behavioral signs might be rabid. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
