524 suspected polio cases reported in Ethiopia
-----------------------------------------------
ADDIS ABABA: The Ethiopian Health Ministry has disclosed that about 524
suspected poliomyelitis cases have been reported in a polio surveillance
campaign throughout the country, the Walta Information Center said on Wed
26 Dec 2001.
Almaz Gebresenbet, polio surveillance representative of the ministry, said
that only one of the 524 children aged under 15 years suspected to have
polio had so far been diagnosed with full blown poliomyelitis, following
examination of the victim's stool specimen both at home and abroad. Stool
specimens of the remaining suspected cases have been sent to Uganda and
South Africa for similar further examinations, she said.
Last month, Ethiopia launched a campaign to immunize some 14 million
Ethiopian children against poliomyelitis, the largest vaccination campaign
ever held in the country. About 51 000 vaccination teams have taken part in
the vaccination drive, while isolated areas will be assessed by mule, boat,
helicopter, and on foot to ensure that every child under 5 years is reached.
Kebede Tadesse, the health minister, said that the eradication of
poliomyelitis was part and parcel of the government's second 5 year health
program, which would prioritize prevention of diseases and promotion of
healthy living. Ethiopia is one of the 5 countries identified as priorities
in the global campaign to eradicate poliomyelitis by the year 2005. The
other 4 are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Nigeria, and Mozambique.

Ethiopian campaign to eradicate polio suffers setback
-----------------------------------------------------
ADDIS ABABA: The largest ever polio vaccination programme in Ethiopia,
designed to bring about full eradication of the disease, suffered a setback
on Thu 20 Dec 2001 after 5 suspected cases of the disease were discovered.
The suspected cases were all found in children under 5 years of age living
in the Somali region of the country. "If this is poliomyelitis then it is a
severe setback," Afewerk Ayele, from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) told the UN's Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN). "It
would be bad for our programme and for the country. It is extremely
unfortunate timing because of the campaign."
UNICEF, in conjunction with the World Health Organization, is hoping to
have vaccinated as many as 14 million children by the end of the year as
part of a massive inoculation program. Some of the remotest parts of the
country have been targeted with teams travelling on foot by mule and some
in helicopters. In the last 3 years Ethiopia has seen only 5 cases of
poliomyelitis. The virus, which attacks children, leaves victims paralysed
for life.
Dr Almaz Senbet, from the Ministry of Health, confirmed the new cases but
said all the children had been brought to the immunization centres too late
to test for polio. "They have the symptoms but they have had them for more
than 2 months, so you cannot detect the virus because it only survives for
2 months. "Even so we think it is polio so we will be targeting the areas
these children come from. The polio campaign tends to bring these people to
the immunization centers and then you discover that they may have it. The
difficulty is that many families do not take their children to health
centers but first try local witch doctors to help cure them. The delay can
make it very difficult for us to identify the real cause," added Dr Almaz,
an expert on polio.
The Health Bureau of the Somali Regional State discovered the children at
the weekend after they were taken to a health center. Bureau Head Dr Ahmed
Mohamed confirmed the suspected cases with the Ministry of Health in Addis
Ababa, but because of the delay no tests could be carried out. The
suspected cases were detected in Shinile, Jijiga, and Kebri Dehar Zones.
Although paralysis is the most visible sign of polio infection, less than 1
per cent of polio infections ever result in paralysis. Almost 800 000
children will have been vaccinated by the time the program is complete in
the region. Ethiopia was the second-to-last country to eradicate smallpox.
Progress in polio eradication in Ethiopia is vital because of its large
population and difficult terrain.
In 1992 less than 10 per cent had been vaccinated against the virus. After
a huge campaign during the 1990s that figure now stands at around 80 per cent.

[In the 1997 postings on polio in Ethiopia (referenced above), an initial
report of an outbreak was further defined as referring to "old cases" of
polio that were being publicized preceding a vaccination campaign in order
to increase awareness. In the present reports included above there is one
recent laboratory-confirmed case mentioned, an additional 5 cases with
onset greater than 2 months preceding detection (in children less than 5
years of age, so presumably cases with onset between 2 months and 59 months
before the announcement), and another report of 524 suspected cases
reported during a polio campaign (presumably during a polio vaccination
campaign conducted in the preceding month).
As part of the polio eradication effort, there is an intensification of
disease surveillance activities looking for cases of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) of which one etiology is poliovirus. An indicator of a good
disease surveillance system is considered to be detection of a baseline
rate of non-polio AFP of 1 per 100 000 population (less than 15 years of age).
(For more information on surveillance indicators recommended in the
poliomyelitis eradication program see:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-surveillance/deseasedesc/RSS_polio.htm#PrincipleUseDataDecMak>).
According to the WHO polio eradication website
(<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>) Ethiopia has
reported (to date in 2001) 297 cases of AFP, with a non-polio AFP rate of
1.2; 56 per cent of reported AFP cases had adequate laboratory specimens
collected and sent for confirmation, with a total of one confirmed case of
wild poliovirus to date.
The above news articles suggest that further AFP cases have been identified
in the past month, showing further improvements in disease surveillance
activities. More information on the current polio situation in Ethiopia
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
