Abstract
--------
Background
Rabies is an acute lethal infectious disease caused by lyssavirus infection. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a global strategic plan to end human rabies deaths by 2030. However, systematic studies of the global rabies disease burden and epidemiological trends are scarce.

Methods
We extracted the disease burden and epidemiological data of global rabies in the preceding 30 years from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019 and performed a comprehensive analysis.

Results
In 2019, the incident cases of rabies worldwide were 14 075.51 (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 6124.33-21 618.11), and the number of deaths was 13 743.44 (95% UI: 6019.13-17 938.53), both of which were lower than that in 1990. With the improvement of the socio-demographic index (SDI), the incident cases, the number of deaths, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and death rate (ASDR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of rabies all showed downward trends. Adolescents and adults under the age of 50 represented the majority of rabies cases worldwide.

Conclusions
The global disease burden of rabies had declined over the past 30 years. Furthermore, the disease burden of rabies was closely related to the SDI level.

[The current report deals with human rabies, exclusively. According to the presented statistics (Table S2), the 10 countries with the highest human rabies ASIR (age-standardized incidence rate), in 2019, were the following: Nepal (1.21), Myanmar (1.04), Niger (0.92), Ghana (0.78), Chad (0.75), Mali (0.72), Somalia (0.68), Ethiopia (0.66), Nigeria (0.60) and Pakistan (0.58). Those countries are signified, as expected, by a low socio-demographic index (SDI). It remains to be checked how far their animal rabies statistics, as well as their respective animal-targetted control efforts, reflect the hierarchy of the human fatalities data.

The study addresses human-related measures as contributing to the "elimination" of rabies, namely, "extensive education and (human) vaccine availability." Canine-addressed measures are mentioned for a single country, Brazil, where the low death toll was "inextricably linked to the introduction of canine vaccination campaigns and the expansion of post-exposure prophylaxis."

Two earlier estimates of the global annual number of human deaths due to rabies have been published: in 2005 (Knobel et al, ref 1) and in 2015 (Hampson et al, ref 2).

Knobel et al concluded that human mortality from endemic canine rabies was estimated to be 55 000 deaths per year (90% confidence interval [CI] = 24 000-93 000).

Hampson et al concluded that globally canine rabies causes 58 991 (95% CI = 25 000-159 000) human deaths annually.

The authors of the current article discuss specifically the discrepancy between their global annual figure (in 2019, 13 743) and the widely quoted figure published by Hampson et al in 2015. While the ASIR figure for deaths in India, during 2019, was 5206.34 (95%UI = 2096.03-6826.33), the figure in ref 2 was 20 847 for India. The differences are attributed by the 2022 authors to data resource variance and different statistical models. Subscribers are encouraged to visit the discussion section of the report for more detail.

The global 59 000 fatalities estimate was subject to discussion in ProMED postings, mainly in 2015. This related, in particular, to the data from India.
