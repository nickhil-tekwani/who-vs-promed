-------------------------------------------------------------------
About 70 snow geese migrating north to Canada have been found dead near
Stillwater, NY, infested with the flatworm parasite _Sphaeridiotrema
globulus_.
NY State Dept. of Environmental Conservation wildlife pathologist Ward
Stone made the identification. He said the flatworm poses no threat to man
or other animals except ducks, swans and other [water?]fowl. He says it
may have been picked up in snails or other food eaten by the geese, perhaps
from the Delaware Bay area or New Jersey [where the geese overwintered].
The flatworm attaches to the lining of the bird's small intestines causing
ulcers, hemorrhages & inflammation, & leading to severe blood loss.
Snow geese are in the middle of a population explosion, having recovered
from a low of 25 000 three decades ago to more than 600 000 today by
adapting to feed off cultivated fields.
