Following an outbreak of legionnaires' disease at a North Portland [Oregon] apartment building, more people are suspected to have the illness based on their symptoms.

Initially, health officials reported that 4 people had to be hospitalized, and one of those people ultimately succumbed to the illness and died. At least one more person has been diagnosed with legionnaire's disease, bringing the confirmed total to 5 people.

On Tuesday [5 Jan 2021], those who live at the Rosemont Court Apartments on North Dekum Street were told to leave their homes.

As of Thursday [7 Jan 2021], the Multnomah County Health Department is advising neighbors in nearby buildings to be aware of any signs of the illness. Now, another 4 people are presumed to have the illness based on new symptoms, the county health department said.

For those who get symptoms, the first to appear are usually flu-like (fever, tiredness, muscle aches, and headache). Signs of a serious _Legionella_ lung infection (pneumonia) include cough and chest pain. Many people sick with _Legionella_ also have diarrhea.

Nearly 100 residents of the building have been temporarily moved into motels until the building's water system and plumbing can be properly cleaned and determined to be safe.

Legionnaires' disease comes from bacteria that are naturally found in fresh water, but they can get into the plumbing system and cause people to fall ill with pneumonia. Health officials said the investigation began on Monday [4 Jan 2021] when several residents were diagnosed with pneumonia. Within hours, the communicable disease investigation team identified the building's water supply as the likely source.

[The news report above says that one additional confirmed case of legionnaires' disease in an outbreak that mainly involves residents of an apartment complex (Rosemont Court) for people 55 years or older in Portland Oregon, bringing the total of confirmed cases to 5 people. More people are suspected to have legionnaires' disease based on their symptoms.

Another news report says that the 5th person to be hospitalized didn't live in the building, but who is said to have "spent time in an adjacent location to Rosemont Court" (https://www.kptv.com/news/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-in-north-portland-worsens-sends-another-person-to-hospital/article_18e48e90-517d-11eb-acb2-532a8fecf504.html). We have not as yet been told of other characteristics of the cases or possible sources for the outbreak that are being investigated.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Rosemont Court is described as "an older historic building" with studio, 1-, and 2-bedroom apartments (https://www.rent.com/oregon/portland-apartments/rosemont-court-4-lnp001E000000nye2DIAQ).
