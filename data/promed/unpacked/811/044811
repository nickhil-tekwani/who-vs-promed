Ohio Department of Health [ODOH] director Amy Acton yesterday [31 May 2019] issued an order to the Mount Carmel Grove City hospital to take immediate action to contain an outbreak of legionnaires' disease. The rare adjudication order came after the DOH found a connection between 7 confirmed cases of the disease in patients at the hospital.

Steps outlined in the order include:
- Flush all hot and cold water lines and fixtures throughout the entire 7-floor, 200-bed facility.
- Implement immediate remediation practices to disinfect hot and cold water lines and fixtures.
- Test and clean all ice machines.
- Ensure the 2 on-site cooling towers are cleaned and serviced.
- Provide any and all test results to the Ohio Department of Health.
- Provide a water management plan to the Ohio Department of Health.

If Mount Carmel Grove City does not implement these actions, Dr Acton will order the hospital to cease accepting new patients.

Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that spreads by inhaling water droplets containing the bacteria. It can be fatal if untreated, but most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics. ODOH and Franklin County Public Health officials will conduct an environmental health assessment at the facility this morning [1 Jun 2019].

At least 7 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed in individuals who recently received treatment at Mount Carmel Grove City, hospital officials said on Friday night [31 May 2019]. The hospital says it is partnering with Franklin County Public Health and the Ohio Department of Health in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the source of the bacteria. They will continue testing over the next few weeks.

In another statement Friday [31 May 2019] night, the Ohio Department of Health says the director issued an adjudication order for the Grove City branch to take immediate action to contain the outbreak. The director says that if the hospital fails to take the appropriate actions, it will be ordered to cease accepting new patients.

"To protect patients, employees, and visitors, we have acted swiftly today [31 May 2019] after my team unraveled a connection between 3 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease in former patients at Mount Carmel Grove City," said Health Department director Dr Amy Acton. "Working in collaboration with Franklin County Public Health, I issued an adjudication order to immediately reduce the risk of further infection. It is our understanding that hospital officials have begun implementing the steps outlined in the order, tonight."

"We are running additional tests on water sources throughout the hospital, and our entire water supply is undergoing supplemental disinfection. We're confident that we can safely maintain full services of the hospital while we study this situation," a spokesperson for Mount Carmel Health System said in a statement. Officials from the Department of Health and Franklin County Public Health will conduct an environmental health assessment of the facility on Saturday morning [1 Jun 2019].

In the adjudication order, the Department of Health says the 1st legionnaires' case occurred one day after the hospital branch's 28 Apr 2019 opening and stayed at the facility through 7 May 2019. Subsequent cases stayed at the facility from 8 May through 20 May 2019. Onset cases ranged from 12-29 May 2019 and were confirmed through urine antigen testing.

The hospital says while the risk of developing the disease is low in most people, individuals with chronic, underlying medical conditions are at increased risk. They are asking anyone who has been hospitalized and developed a cough, muscle aches, headaches, fever, chills, or shortness of breath to contact their doctor.

The Mount Carmel branch in Grove City opened just over a month ago on 28 Apr 2019.

[Grove City, with a population of 41 495 in 2018, in Franklin County, is a suburb of Columbus, the capital of the US state of Ohio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_City,_Ohio). A map showing the location of Grove City can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grove+City,+OH.

Legionella are Gram negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of legionella within several species of protozoa, where legionella replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of legionella to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing legionella. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc1505356. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease at Mercy Hospital in Chicago will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of legionella will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, which only detects _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
