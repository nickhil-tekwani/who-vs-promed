[3] UK confronts monkeypox
Date: Sun 30 Oct 2022 07:30 GMT
Source: Cambridge Independent [edited]
https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/monkeypox-outbreak-to-be-tackled-by-2m-consortium-involving-9280520/


The University of Cambridge is among 12 UK institutions that will work together to tackle the monkeypox outbreak by developing better diagnostic tests, identifying potential therapies, studying the effectiveness of vaccines, and exploring the spread of the virus.

The consortium has GBP 2million [USD 2.3 million] in funding from the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council -- part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) -- for the work.

Among the 25 scientists involved are Cambridge scientists Prof Geoffrey Smith, from the Department of Pathology, and Prof Mike Weekes, from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Department of Medicine.

Prof Weekes said: "Monkeypox has become a really important global pathogen, reaching more than 50 countries worldwide in a matter of months. Although we have an effective vaccine and treatment, global roll-out has so far proved challenging, emphasising the importance of a comprehensive understanding of this virus.

"The UK consortium includes researchers from multiple different disciplines, and I anticipate the data we generate will rapidly help understand how the virus can be targeted in new ways to prevent disease."

Professor Smith said: "Few would have predicted that monkeypox virus would be causing a global epidemic in 2022. The ability to respond quickly to this new challenge has been helped greatly not just by the swift and welcome response of UKRI, but also by decades of support for the study of orthopoxviruses from UKRI and the Wellcome Trust. The information gained from those studies is valuable in the fight against monkeypox virus."

The current worldwide outbreak outside of West Africa, where it originated, was identified in May 2022. It was the 1st time that many monkeypox cases and clusters have been reported in non-endemic areas.

[4] Pain management
Date: Mon 24 Oct 2022

https://www.idse.net/Emerging-Diseases/Article/10-22/-Out-of-Proportion-to-Expectation-CDC-Looks-to-Improve-Monkeypox-Pain-Reporting-Management/68460


Admitting it underestimated the incidence and extent of severe pain in reported monkeypox cases during the current crisis, the CDC is now advocating aggressive pain treatment at the 1st signs of monkeypox lesions.

As part of that effort, the CDC is providing guidance to healthcare professionals that is designed to aid in the development of monkeypox treatment programs.

"Early recognition of mucosal or genital lesions may help prevent severe pain and other complications at vulnerable sites -- e.g., proctitis causing severe pain in the rectum," the CDC wrote in a press statement, stressing the need for pain treatment "tailored to the needs and context of an individual patient."

Perianal and oral mucosal lesions are reported in 40% of US monkeypox cases, and are often associated with severe pain. Penile swelling and genital lesions are other common pain complaints that often require hospitalization (N Engl J Med 2022; 387: 679-691 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2207323; BMJ 2022; 378: e072410 https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-072410; and MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2022; 71[32]: 1018-1022 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e3.htm).


In a letter to healthcare providers and medical societies, CDC Director Rochelle P Walensky, MD, MPH, asked for documentation related to the pain experience in monkeypox patients, stating it has been "out of proportion to expectation."

"We have much to learn about the novel clinical presentations of monkeypox in the 2022 outbreak," Dr Walensky wrote. "The experiences of healthcare providers on the front lines are critical for building the evidence base to inform optimal approaches to pain management." Specifically, the CDC is asking for information regarding incidence, predictive factors, and successful pain control methods, according to the letter.

In addition, the letter stated that studies are underway to evaluate antiviral medications to treat monkeypox virus (MPV) infection, including related pain.

The guidance stresses that healthcare professionals should assess pain in all patients with MPV infection, "and recognize that substantial pain may exist from mucosal lesions not evident on physical exam; validation of the pain experience can build trust in the care provider and care plan."

1st-line treatment for monkeypox lesion pain includes topical steroids and agents such as lidocaine localized, although caution should be used near open sores or broken skin, according to the World Health Organization.

Kevin L Ard, MD, MPH, the medical director of the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center at The Fenway Institute, and the director of the Sexual Health Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, agreed, telling Pain Medicine News sister publication Infectious Disease Special Edition, "We try to address pain as much as we can and that can be with topical treatments or painkillers," Dr Ard said. "Another strategy is to use the antiviral TPOXX [tecovirimat (Siga Technologies)]." Tecovirimat is a core treatment for monkeypox, with anecdotal reports that it shortens lesion healing to about 3 or 4 days rather than 3 or 4 weeks.

To minimize the risk for autoinoculation, persons with MPV infection or their caregivers should use disposable gloves when applying topical medications to lesions. Warm baths of water and baking soda or Epsom salt could be considered for symptomatic relief of rectal pain.

Over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are recommended for general pain, according to the World Health Organization.

Uncontrolled pain following standard treatment may require the short-term use of gabapentin or opioids, according to the CDC. If opioids are prescribed, "immediate-release opioids at the lowest effective dose should be prescribed for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids," according to the agency. Constipation related to opioid use can be prevented or lessened with proper hydration, exercise, and fiber intake. Stool softeners and laxatives can be used as needed.

For management of oropharyngeal symptoms, patients can consider rinsing the mouth with clean saltwater or an oral antiseptic (e.g., chlorhexidine mouthwash), local anesthetic (e.g., viscous lidocaine), and prescription analgesic mouthwash can also be considered.

Oral antihistamines may provide some relief of pruritus associated with monkeypox lesions. Topical agents such as calamine lotion, petroleum jelly, or colloidal oatmeal also may improve symptoms.
