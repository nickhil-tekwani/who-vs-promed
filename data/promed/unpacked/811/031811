Two regional health agencies (ARS) confirmed that "since August 2015, several cases of West Nile had been reported in horses in the Gard, Herault and Bouches-du-Rhone [French departments]. The infected patient in Nimes is the 1st human case reported to date in France since 2003.

West Nile virus is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that are infected only in contact with infected birds. "[Humans] and horses are accidental hosts; they can not transmit the virus [directly]," explained ARS.

In most human cases, the infection is asymptomatic. Flu-like symptoms are common (fever, aches, headache). It can occasionally cause neurological complications.

A note about WNV in the southeast of France: "These human and equine cases confirm virus circulation in the Gard, Herault and Bouches-du-Rhone. People living in these 3 departments need to protect themselves against mosquito bites, particularly during outdoor activities (hiking, horseback riding, hunting, etc.) in natural areas like the Camargue."

Precautions to avoid mosquito bites:
"Wear loose clothing, long-sleeved shirts and long pants and spray them with insecticides; Apply insect repellent recommended by your pharmacist; Use mosquito nets on doors and window screens; Sleep under mosquito nets. There are mosquito nets for cradles. Use electric diffusers inside; Use mosquito coils outside only."

[West Nile virus (WNV) has been actively circulating in the Mediterranean Basin, including France, this year (2015), with several reported equine cases. In mid-August 2015, farms with 2 equine animals affected by West Nile virus were reported in the outskirts of the Camargue National Park.

As Mod.CRD noted on 2 Sep 2015 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150902.3619529): "West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

"Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses.

"According to the information provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of 28 Aug 2015, 13 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU. 17 cases have been reported in neighboring countries since the beginning of the 2015 transmission season.

"Additional information and a map with distribution of West Nile fever human cases by affected area are available at http://tinyurl.com/c7x8elf. - Mod.CRD"

Similar to its presentation in equine animals, WNV infection in humans is usually inapparent-to-mild, and neurological symptoms are relatively rare. A commercial vaccine is available for equine animals but not for humans. WNV transmission in Europe will stop when the 1st killing frosts end mosquito transmission.
