COVID-19 acquired during travel to Africa
-----------------------------------------
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, all African countries have recorded infections and there are now more than 750 000 confirmed cases across the continent. Despite a range of prevention and containment measures against the pandemic, the number of reported new cases is increasing in countries like Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Ghana. Because of limited availability of supplies and local capacity (similar to the situation in many high-income countries when the pandemic started), many countries face challenges conducting a sufficient number of tests and, therefore, there may be substantial under-reporting of COVID-19 cases. Infection in travelers can be a sentinel of high transmission rates.

In Europe, after an initial decrease of daily cases, some countries are now facing the daunting challenge of a potential 2nd wave. In France, the number of daily cases has started to rise again, and more than half of the cases hospitalized in ICUs during the past days in the Paris area are travel-associated, mainly returning from Africa.

In this respect, the following cases have been recently identified via the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (June-July 2020):

- In Brescia (Italy): A VFR [visiting friends and relatives] traveler returning from Egypt is currently in the ICU with COVID-19.

- In Hamburg (Germany): COVID-19 cases were reported in 1 VFR traveler returning from Ghana and 2 sailors who acquired the infection during their landing in either Lagos or Dakar.

- In Paris (France): 8 new cases of COVID-19 occurred among travelers (5 returning from Algeria, 1 from Mauritania, 1 from the Central African Republic, 1 from Cameroon). All 8 were VFR travelers.

These data highlight the current risk of COVID-19 for visitors to Africa and the alarming threat for importation of the virus back to Europe and potentially other countries, which could contribute to a rebound of the epidemic.

The differences in cases we have observed among the 3 European counties may relate to differences in rules regarding returning travelers. France imposes a 14-day quarantine only for travelers returning from countries where a quarantine is demanded in return, regardless of the epidemic situation of the country. In Germany, a quarantine requirement is in place for those returning from regions designated by the Robert Koch Institute as high risk. Italy has kept the mandatory 14-day quarantine rule for all those arriving from a non-EU nation. Enforcement of quarantine measures is also likely to be variable among jurisdictions.

While closing European borders to travelers can be perceived as economically and politically complex, quarantine measures can be simple and effective and should be prioritized to limit the risk of ongoing transmission in Europe due to imported COVID-19 from Africa or elsewhere in the world where the pandemic remains highly active, such as North and South America.

[ProMED would like to thank Drs. Itani, Caumes, Jordan and Castelli for submitting this report. This highlights the need for countries to establish quarantine procedures (including testing of asymptomatic individuals) for individuals arriving from outside their borders as part of control measures to prevent introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 with potential silent community spread. The countries of importation listed in the above report are countries that have all been flagged as having significant transmission of the virus at one point. Low-level reports from any country may not reflect significant silent transmission.

Countries that have markedly contained SARS-CoV-2 transmission see a shift from local transmitted cases to predominantly imported cases, and at some point have had multiple varying-sized clusters occur. As mentioned numerous times, this is a tenacious organism, most efficient in terms of stealth entry and transmission.

Again, many thanks to Drs. Itani, Caumes, Jordan and Castelli for submitting this report. - Mod.MPP]

China has reported 112 new COVID-19 cases in the western region of Xinjiang, taking the total over the past 2 weeks to more than 500. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Xinjiang, which is home to the Uighur minority, has climbed sharply in recent days, despite efforts to limit the spread of the virus in the capital Urumqi.

More than 2 million people have been tested for the virus. Officials said Urumqi had a comparatively high number of people who tested positive for the virus but showed no symptoms. Asymptomatic cases are not included in China's official tally. The region's health authority said it had found a total of 108 asymptomatic cases as of Thursday [30 Jul 2020].

China reported a total of 123 local infections nationwide on Thursday [30 Jul 2020], the highest number since early March [2020].

An outbreak in Dalian, a port city in the northern province of Liaoning, grew by 11 infections to reach 69 cases over the past week. Almost 4.1 million samples from Dalian residents have been collected for coronavirus testing, state media reported early on Friday [31 Jul 2020]. A 2nd round of testing will be launched in high-risk districts. An additional 4 imported cases took China's overall number of COVID-19 cases to 84 292.

[During the period 16 Jul 2020 to 30 Jul 2020, there have been a total of 537 confirmed cases (not counting asymptomatic infections) associated with the outbreak in Xinjiang, the largest outbreak recorded by mainland China since mid-March 2020. The origin of this outbreak has not been defined to the best of my knowledge.

As for the outbreak in Liaoning province, during the period 22-30 Jul 2020, there have been a total of 74 cases associated with the outbreak in Dalian. This outbreak has had cases in Jilin, and Beijing. The outbreak seemed to be associated with a fish processing plant in Dalian and a nearby seafood market. Reminiscent of the seafood market in Wuhan and the seafood market in Beijing. Results of genomic testing of positive samples found in the market and in cases are still awaited.

Viet Nam recorded its 1st death from COVID-19 on Friday [31 Jul 2020] after winning plaudits worldwide for one of the most successful national responses to the pandemic. The country of 96 million had gone 100 days without infection before an unexpected cluster of new cases of unknown origin surfaced in the popular central resort city of Da Nang a week ago.

The health ministry on Friday [31 Jul 2020] reported 82 new infections, 26 of which were imported, marking the Southeast Asian country's biggest single-day jump.

On Thursday [30 Jul 2020], Hanoi started mass coronavirus testing. By noon on Friday, 21 732 people had been tested in the capital, the Hanoi Centre for Disease Control said. Around 21 000 tested negative, it said in a statement, without elaborating.

Hanoi on Thursday [30 Jul 2020] also banned large gatherings and urged tens of thousands of domestic travellers to report to authorities. It shut bars and nightclubs, extending those closures to street food stalls and karaoke lounges from midnight on Friday. Late on Friday, Hanoi authorities said restaurants and supermarkets could remain open but must implement social-distancing measures.

Patient 428, a 70-year-old man who appears to have contracted the disease in Da Nang, died on Friday [31 Jul 2020], the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said. The health ministry has since confirmed the death.

The most recent cases were linked to 3 hospitals and 2 clinics in Da Nang, according to the health ministry, which overnight sent a task force of health experts, along with more than 1000 health workers, to the city. The task force includes 65 health experts who had previously helped fight coronavirus at other epicentres in Viet Nam, the ministry said.

Authorities in Da Nang are building a 1000-bed field hospital to ease the burden on the city's hospitals, 4 of which are under lockdown following a series of cases there.

The newly confirmed infections in Da Nang have lifted the total number of cases in Viet Nam to 546.

Some experts say Viet Nam could be paying for complacency after its initial success stopping the virus, with normal service quickly resuming, face masks used less, and domestic travel surging.

Da Nang had been inundated with visitors taking advantage of promotions to revitalise a tourism sector hurt by border closures and international flight bans.

The current wave is traced to Danang, but the source is unclear.

Date: Thu 30 Jul 2020
Source: Tampa Bay Times, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/07/30/after-99-days-of-success-virus-returns-to-haunt-vietnam/


For 99 days, Viet Nam seemed to have defeated the coronavirus. There wasn't a single reported case of community transmission. Not a single death. A handful of cases were caught and isolated at the border, but otherwise, people were returning to their normal lives. The country of 96 million people was hailed globally as a standout success. But then a week ago, an outbreak began that has now grown to 48 cases in 6 parts of the country, including 3 of the largest cities, and forced authorities to reimpose restrictions many thought they had put behind them. And experts worry the outbreak could be much larger than currently known.

The outbreak began [23 Jul 2020] in the picturesque coastal city of Da Nang, where thousands of tourists were taking their summer vacations on golden beaches. A 57-year-old man was hospitalized with a fever and tested positive. His condition soon worsened and he was put on a ventilator. Health authorities swung into action. But the man's case was puzzling. He hadn't left his hometown for over a month and tests on his family and 100 other possible contacts all came back negative.

Then health workers found 3 other infections in Da Nang over the weekend [25-26 Jul 2020]. And then on [27 Jul 2020], another 11. All of those were other patients or health workers at the Da Nang Hospital, where the man remains in critical condition.

On [27 Jul 2020], authorities encouraged 80 000 tourists to leave the city by providing extra flights. Hotels emptied out and thousands canceled their plans to visit. Then on [28 Jul 2020], the city was put into lockdown. The packed beaches were closed, roamed only by patrolling security guards. But the order of events left some scratching their heads. Surely the fleeing tourists had the potential to spread the virus further?

Indeed by [30 Jul 2020], authorities had found 43 cases, including 2 people in the capital, Hanoi. All of the cases seemed to link back to Da Nang and returning travelers. The cases included an American who had been a patient last week at Da Nang Hospital before moving to another hospital in Ho Chi Minh City in the south. His companion also tested positive.

Authorities are now reimposing broader restrictions. They're closing nonessential services and banning large public gatherings in Da Nang and other nearby cities, and closing bars and clubs in Hanoi. They're also planning to test 21 000 people in the capital who recently returned from Da Nang.

[The] owner of a noodle restaurant in Hanoi, said she will no longer have seated guests and instead will offer only takeout service or deliveries. She said her business is hurting but she will abide by government recommendations. "What is important now is that all citizens join hands together with the government in this fight," she said.

Just how the virus crept back remains a mystery. Authorities say they think the source was from outside Viet Nam because this time the virus is a different strain. "One big difference I've noticed between this wave and the previous one is that the cases we have right now, a lot of them are severe," said Marc Choisy, a Hanoi-based bio-mathematician with the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit. He said such a high proportion of severe cases could indicate that hundreds more asymptomatic cases remain undetected in the community. "It's very likely the disease is transmitting silently at the moment," he said.

The government, meanwhile, has been cracking down on people being smuggled into the country to avoid quarantine, making a string of arrests in cases of smuggled Chinese nationals. But authorities have yet to make any direct links between the people smuggling and the new outbreak.

Viet Nam's struggle to contain the virus even after its initial success has been reflected in other places around the world. Australia was down to single-digit daily increases when an outbreak exploded in the city of Melbourne this month [July 2020]. On [30 Jul 2020], authorities reported more than 700 new cases in and around Melbourne, a record. Other places from Hong Kong to Spain are battling new outbreaks after seemingly having the virus under control.

Viet Nam's quick actions in the face of its latest outbreak reflect the speed with which the government reacted to the initial virus threat, which experts say helped halt its spread. In mid-February [2020], for example, Viet Nam put all 10 000 residents of the town of Son Loi, near Hanoi, under a 3-week lockdown, even though there were only 16 confirmed cases in the entire country at that time. The government also used texts and social media to deliver concise instructions to its citizens. It even added short messages to every phone call. By [22 Mar 2020], Viet Nam had essentially closed itself off to the outside world, stopping most international flights and shutting down the 900-mile (1440-kilometer) land border it shares with China.

Whenever authorities saw even a single case of community transmission, they jumped on it with contact tracing, lockdowns, and widespread testing. The country also drew on its past experience defeating the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was able to limit its confirmed coronavirus cases before the recent outbreak to just 416. But Choisy, the bio-mathematician, worries authorities have caught this coronavirus wave much later in its cycle than the 1st wave. "When you haven't heard about new virus cases for a while, you begin to forget very quickly and you return to normal life," Choisy said. "You get used to it."

[According to the data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), during the period 23-30 Jul 2020, there were 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported by Viet Nam, presumably including imported cases not associated with the outbreak. (Today's report -- 31 Jul 2020 as of 12:38 GMT) includes 86 confirmed cases, presumably including the 82 cases in Da Nang mentioned above.

A 30 Jul 2020 update on the outbreak and response from the Viet Nam CDC mentions a total of 449 564 tests of real-time RT-PCR have been done in the country since the beginning of the pandemic. Since 25 Jul 2020, 4447 tests (out of 4796 samples collected) have been done in Da Nang, 794 (out of 873 specimens collected) in Quang Nam, and 2359 samples were collected in Hanoi. Almost 100 000 RT-PCR tests were distributed by the Ministry of Health to the Center for Disease Control TP. Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang, National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and Hue Central Hospital; Intensive contact tracing is ongoing. "On [30 Jul 2020], Viet Nam recorded 14 new cases in Da Nang and Hanoi. To date, the country has recorded a total of 464 cases, of which 369 cases have been cured (accounting for 79.5%). There are still 95 patients being treated at 14 hospitals and 3 district health centers, of which 04 people had negative results for SAR-CoV-2 from 2 times or more, 14 people had negative results 1 time and 77 people were still positive for SAR-CoV-2". http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/13993/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-30-7-2020.

The story is a familiar one: relaxation of restrictions, encouraging opening of the economy (through encouraging domestic tourism), and suddenly a patient with a severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 is confirmed; and the surge is well underway, with new cases being identified on a daily basis, including numerous hospitalizations. Viet Nam is not the 1st country to have this happen to as we've seen through the past several months. In some cases, lifting of restrictions was premature, with existing high levels of community transmission ongoing, but in the case of Viet Nam, there hadn't been local transmission in months. The virus is stealth, it enters via asymptomatic infections or very mild clinical presentations that are ignored by the infected individual. And the virus is transmitted silently so that it isn't recognized until a severe presentation in an individual who is hospitalized, and chains of transmission are virtually impossible to follow retrospectively.

Reading the MOH report, tests were conducted and/or provided to Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Nha Trang (Pasteur Institute in a city in Khanh Hoa Province), and Hanoi, suggesting extensive testing initiatives planned for areas with known cases and known contacts of cases.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- In the Amazonian region, ensuring access to health services for indigenous populations is a priority. WHO Regional Office for the Americas met virtually with representatives from indigenous organizations together with the Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and called for the "strengthening of health care services in the Amazon through the provision of human resources, supplies and medical devices, including tests, as well as treatments and vaccines when they are available."

- In the Philippines, the delivery of essential health services has continued amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, including the implementation of their Hepatitis programme. The governor of Bataan reminded local governments and health care providers to continue providing non-COVID-19 care while responding to the pandemic.

- According to a joint analysis by WHO and UNICEF, routine immunization rates plummeted in Somalia from March to May 2020, and remain low due to COVID-19. WHO has been working with the Somali Government and partners to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to health care providers and train community health workers to disseminate messages on the importance of routine immunization for children.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 55.0% of the global newly reported cases and 65.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.9 million cases. The USA reported 42.7% of cases (59 629), Brazil 29.2% (40 816), Colombia 7.4% (10 284), Mexico 5.2% (7208), Peru 3.8% (5288), Argentina 4.3% (5939), and Chile 1.3% (1775).

- The European region reported 9.2% of the global newly reported cases and 7.7% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 23.5% (5509) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Israel 9.0% (2099), Spain 8.7 % (2031), Kazakhstan 6.3% (1472), France 5.6% (1307), Ukraine 5.1% (1197), Romania 5.0% (1182), Turkey 4.0% (942), (Germany 0% (0)), Uzbekistan 3.0% (703), the UK 3.3% (763), and Kyrgyzstan 2.72% (631). Spain and France are having renewed increased transmission and Eastern Europe remains active.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of the global newly reported cases and 6.5% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 22.8% (2968), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 20.3% (2636), Saudi Arabia 13.5% (1759), Pakistan 8.6% (1114), Morocco 6.3% (826), Kuwait 5.8% (754), Oman 5.1% (665), Palestinian Authority 4.0% (520), and Egypt 3.1% (409). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 6.3% of the global newly reported cases and 5.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 70.8% (11 362) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 4.6% (736), Algeria 3.8 (614), Ethiopia 3.8% (610), Kenya 3.4% (544), Nigeria 2.5% (404), and Madagascar 1.3% (213). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 19 of the 30 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.48% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 47.1% (1813) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 29.8% (1148), Singapore 8.7% (334), Australia 7.2% (278), China 5.8% (223), and South Korea 0.47% (18). Japan has been hovering around 900+ to 1000+ in the past 3 days, definitely having an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 22.8% of the global newly reported cases and 14.7% of global deaths. India reported 90.2% (52 123) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.2% (3009) and Indonesia 4.1% (2381). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (29 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000+.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported (66 948) cases followed by Brazil (58 271) and India (54 966). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (50.9%). There were 6257 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Russia, Philippines, and Iraq, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2963 to 66 948. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Spain, Bangladesh, Iran, Chile, Indonesia, Israel, Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and France, and their range of reported new cases is 1377 to 2789.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 6.5%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 8.4%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
