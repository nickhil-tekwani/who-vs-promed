China says deadly bird flu reaches remote Tibet
-----------------------------------------------
China's Ministry of Agriculture said on Monday the H5N1 avian flu virus had
been found in the Himalayan region's capital, Lhasa, about 3600 metres (11
800 ft) above sea level.

Other outbreaks, which in China have so far been limited to flocks of
chickens and other poultry, were reported in the southern province of
Guangdong and the central province of Hubei, the ministry said on its Web
site.

The ministry did not say how the virus was thought to have made its way to
Tibet, one of China's poorest regions, which is home to about 2.7 million
people and is famed for its Buddhist tradition. 15 of China's 31 provinces
and major cities have confirmed outbreaks of the avian influenza that has
killed 14 Vietnamese and 6 Thais and led to the culling of millions of
poultry in 8 Asian countries.

Thailand reports 9 new bird flu outbreaks
-----------------------------------------
Thailand announced 9 more outbreaks of bird flu, just days after declaring
it expected to have eradicated the disease by the end of [February 2004].

"We found 14 points in 8 provinces in the former red zones that we have
been monitoring, and a new 9th province is Roi-Et" in Thailand's northeast,
the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Deputy agriculture minister Newin Chidchob said the outbreaks were discovered
in a 2nd round of testing in areas previously hit by avian influenza, the
Thai News Agency (TNA) reported. "The second testing of 10 300 samples in 427
points across the country by 7 testing centers and one institution found the
bird flu in 14 points in 9 provinces," TNA quoted Newin as saying.

The deputy minister reportedly ordered the immediate culling of all
chickens within a one-kilometre radius of the points where bird flu had
recurred, while the fresh Roi-Et outbreak required a cull within a
5-kilometre radius.

"I have ordered the new area (in Roi-Et) culled within 72 hours," he said,
adding that the new outbreak was discovered in a home-raised duck in Roi-Et.

Thailand announced 23 Jan 2004 it had been hit by a massive bird flu
outbreak and went on to identify 163 outbreak points in 40 of the kingdom's
76 provinces including the capital Bangkok.

It launched a huge culling campaign, which saw some 26 million chickens
culled, and at the weekend Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared all
163 outbreak spots had been downgraded to "yellow zones", and said Thailand
aimed to be rid of the virus entirely by the end of [February 2004].
