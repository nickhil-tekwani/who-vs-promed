Suspected malaria in Asir province, Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------
A disease believed to be malaria has swept Al-Qaymah village in Tihamat
Qahtan, Asir Region, the Okaz Arabic daily said Tuesday [14 Oct 2003]. 6
people, including 4 children, contracted the disease. They suffered
vomiting, fever, headache, chest pain, and general weakness, the paper
said. "The so-called mysterious disease is only malaria, which is endemic
in Tihamat Asir," said an official at the hospital.
The source said authorities have launched a campaign to combat mosquitoes
and other disease carriers mainly by spraying insecticides. The source said
all laboratory tests done on the infected persons were positive for
malaria. During the past 2 weeks, he said, all houses in the area were
sprayed and the residents given mosquito nets. An awareness campaign is
also going on, the paper said. Al-Qaymah village has more than 500
families. The nearest health center is 40 kilometers away, the source said.
Comment by Shamsudeen Fagbo, DVM:
With the recent floods following exceptionally heavy rainfalls in
Southwestern Saudi Arabia (SW-SA), large areas were inundated with flood
water, and people were displaced in Jizan province and nearby areas. Roads
were cut off and connections with other parts of the country affected. The
rains were described as the heaviest in decades. SW-SA is hyperendemic for
malaria. Most clinical cases are due to _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Anopheline vectors are abundant all year. The post-flooding rise in the
anopheline population concurrent with an increased number of displaced
persons augments exposure to vectors, increases the circulation of malarial
parasites, and may trigger a resurgence of falciparum malaria.
Chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ endemicity in SW-SA could be further
exacerbated. Past epidemics in the region have been associated with heavy
rainfall.
Previously unobserved forms of malaria may also occur. Ovale malaria,
previously detected in neighbouring Yemen, may emerge in SW-SA, and malaria
could be introduced to other parts of the kingdom. [Inaccurate diagnoses]
may be due to overstressed staff, shortage of required expertise, or
limited access to facilities with such expertise. Disaster conditions
favour these factors, and uncoordinated health emergency responses may
worsen matters.

[ProMED is interested in any further information on the malaria situation
in the southwest province of Saudi Arabia. Clearly the flooding has
produced a situation with greatly increased risk to the human population. -
