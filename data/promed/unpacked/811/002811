---------------------------------------------------------
The multidisciplinary team has reported a total of 57 cases (54

current situation and a retrospective analysis of cases. With the
exception of 2 cases of the septicemic form of plague, all recorded
cases are pneumonic plague.
(see previous report

Out of 18 specimens tested, preliminary laboratory results from
Kisangani Provincial Laboratory confirm 10 positive specimens by
direct examination (sputum).
Contact tracing and follow-up of 125 contacts is continuing. The team is
providing support to the clinical management of cases in Zobia and Medecins
sans Frontieres-Belgium are constructing 2 isolation centers. Social
