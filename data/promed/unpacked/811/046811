The Mukomuko District Agriculture Office (Bengkulu province, Sumatra) provided fungicide assistance to overcome a fungal disease that has attacked rice plants belonging to 2 farmer groups. This assistance is to overcome fungal diseases that attack rice as well as anticipating the spread of this disease to other rice fields.

Some rice plants did not develop tillers by 25 days old. The office said that based on the identification and information received, this is due to fungal diseases during the current uncertain weather. There is a possibility of the spread of the fungal disease to fields next to the rice infected with this disease. Two locations of 25 and 27 hectares, respectively, are threatened with contracting the disease. They hope that spraying can overcome the disease, because otherwise there is a possibility of crop failure.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops. It is unclear how the diagnosis of a fungal cause of the problems above has been arrived at and how reliable it is. However, a large number of fungal and oomycete pathogens are known to affect rice and, in particular, outbreaks of rice blast (_Pyricularia oryzae_) frequently occur in the region (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) and/or pathogen(s), as well as identification of any potential external factors associated with any crop problems, are always essential before effective management strategies can be designed.
