The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 15 Oct 2018:
- A total of 216 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 181 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 181 confirmed, 104 have died and 57 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) installed.
- 32 suspected cases under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.
- No new deaths from confirmed cases.
- 2 new people healed in Beni.

News of the response

Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- All contacts identified around the 2 confirmed cases of Tchomia (including those followed in Bunia) have come out of their 21-day follow-up period. This would indicate that the epidemic in this health zone has been perfectly mastered in almost 3 weeks. The 1st confirmed case of Tchomia had been notified on 21 Sep 2018.
- This is a new achievement for the field teams who, despite the security context, were able to control 8 of the 10 outbreaks, including the epicenter of Mabalako, in less than 4 weeks after the 1st notification of a confirmed case in each of these health zones. This confirms that a rapid medical response (surveillance, isolation center, vaccination) combined with strong community engagement is the most effective way to rapidly contain an Ebola outbreak and limit loss of life.

Community involvement
---------------------
- The coordinator of the response, Dr. Bathe Ndjoloko Tambwe, congratulated the people of Beni, who are becoming more and more committed to the teams of the response. For several weeks, a greater commitment of the community has been observed. Several families presented themselves to the CTE when one of them was sick. Even in the event of a community death (i.e outside an approved health facility), the families call on the emergency teams to take samples and carry out the dignified and secure burial if necessary.
- One of the confirmed cases reported that day was identified thanks to the motorcycle taxi driver who was transporting him to go from Beni to Butembo. When he was stopped in a parking lot in Beni, the driver noticed that his client was showing suspicious signs. Arriving at one of the exit points of the city, the driver then alerted the surveillance teams posted at this location. The teams then sensitized the client and convinced him to accompany them to the CTE of Beni to be tested. The results came back positive and she was admitted to CTE.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 17 976 people have been vaccinated, including 7620 in Beni, 4391 in Mabalako, 1663 in Mandima, 1392 in Katwa, 1085 in Butembo, 520 in Masereka, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 240 to Komanda, 121 to Oicha, 105 to Kalunguta and 50 to Musienene.
- After the escape of a confirmed case in a Mai-Mai area inaccessible to the response teams, local health workers were trained to identify and manage Ebola cases. Finally, after long negotiations, the Mai-Mai agreed to let the returnee team in their territory to be vaccinated. This is a remarkable step forward in community engagement in these hard-to-reach areas.

[According to Wikipedia, the term Mai-Mai or Mayi-Mayi refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups.

This epidemiological report is very upbeat as it relates 2 very positive events demonstrating community engagement in fighting this outbreak. Individuals who were sick presented themselves to the CTE and a taxi driver recognized illness in a passenger and alerted the surveillance team. These events are in contrast to the following e-mail from Save the Children. - Mod.LK]

DRC: Rise in Ebola cases leads to worst week since start of outbreak
[Save the Children, edited]
https://www.savethechildren.net/article/democratic-republic-congo-rise-ebola-cases-leads-worst-week-start-outbreak

Aid workers on the frontline of the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are being met with significant suspicion in many communities in North Kivu -- contributing to the 33 new confirmed cases of the disease last week, the worst on record since this most recent outbreak began in August [2018].

Unless outreach workers on the ground manage to get through to communities -- helping them to understand how to stop the deadly disease from spreading -- there is a risk the virus could spiral out of control and become an international threat, Save the Children is warning.

Heather Kerr, Save the Children's Country Director in the DRC, said: "People in and around Beni are very frightened, as many have seen neighbours or loved ones die in dreadful circumstances from Ebola.

"Unfortunately, our Community Health Workers are often met with hostility, and sometimes violence, when they're approaching homes to talk to families about protecting themselves against the deadly virus. One of our community health workers reported that stones were hurled at our vehicle as they approached a house."

The local Ministry of Health announced new measures on [Sat 13 Oct] to stem the country's most recent outbreak of the deadly virus in conflict-affected North Kivu -- one of the regions hardest hit by the outbreak -- including a social media campaign, and the recruitment of local staff to trace people who have been in contact with confirmed cases.

"Our coordinated responses with other agencies in North Kivu have also been severely hindered by the recent outbreaks of violence in Beni town. Despite all these challenges, we'll continue to do whatever it takes to protect as many children and their families as we can from contracting this devastating disease."

There have been 214 Ebola cases so far (179 confirmed, 35 probable), with 139 deaths (104 cases confirmed, 35 probable), according to the latest figures from the WHO.

Working alongside the Ministry of Health, Save the Children has recruited and trained 230 Community Health Workers who travel door-to-door and inform families on how to prevent the spread of the disease through simple steps like handwashing. The aid organisation is also tracing contacts of confirmed cases to make sure they access treatment centres if they have contracted the virus. To date, Save the Children has reached more than 290 000 people, including 163 200 children with life-saving messaging.

[In response to the Ebola outbreak in conflict-hit DRC..., Save the Children urgently deployed its Emergency Health Unit and in country team to the area. They have helped trace the contacts of confirmed cases and identify people who may have the disease, before referring them to Ebola treatment centres.

In August [2018], Heather Kerr, Save the Children's DRC Country Director, said:
"Children are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus, not just because they can contract it, but also because they could be orphaned if their parents or caregivers lose their lives, leading to stigmatization within the community. We're also concerned for the safety of civilians and humanitarian workers in the outbreak zone, with multiple armed groups operating in the area. The insecurity could slow down our efforts to respond to this outbreak and save lives. We must do everything in our power to prevent the Ebola outbreak spreading further. Our Emergency Health Unit will help do just that." (excerpted from https://www.savethechildren.net/article/democratic-republic-congo-insecurity-could-slow-containment-new-ebola-outbreak) - Mod.LK]

[2] PHEIC not declared
Wed 17 Oct 2018. Meeting of IHR Emergency Committee
[edited]

Statement on the October 2018 meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

The meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the DRC took place on [Wed 17 Oct 2018], from 1PM to 5PM Geneva time (CET).

Conclusion
----------
It was the view of the Committee that a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) should not be declared at this time. But the Committee remains deeply concerned by the outbreak and emphasized that response activities need to be intensified and ongoing vigilance is critical. The Committee also noted the very complex security situation. Additionally, the Committee has provided public health advice below.

Proceedings of the Meeting
--------------------------
Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee met by teleconference; presentations were made by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the DRC on the epidemiological situation, the response strategies, and recent adaptations, including implementation of rapid response teams at community level, with a focus on Beni. A representative of the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (MONUSCO) reported on the work of MONUSCO, including its logistics and security activities to support the response. During the informational session, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on the situation and the response to the current Ebola outbreak and preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.

The Committee's role was to provide to the Director-General its views and perspectives on:
- Whether the event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
- If the event constitutes a PHEIC, what Temporary Recommendations should be made.

Current situation
-----------------
On [1 Aug 2018], WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of the DRC of Ebola Virus Disease in North Kivu province. Cases were also subsequently found in Ituri Province. From 4 May to 15 Oct 2018, 216 EVD cases were reported, of which 181 are confirmed and 35 are probable; 139 total deaths have occurred, of which 104 are confirmed and 35 are probable. The global case fatality rate stands at 64% overall, and at 57% among confirmed cases.

A total of 9 neighbouring countries have been advised that they are at high risk of spread and have been supported with equipment and personnel. Particular emphasis has been placed on Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan in terms of preparedness activities.

Key challenges
--------------
After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, the Committee concluded that this Ebola outbreak is taking place in a particularly complex context and poses several important challenges:
- This outbreak is taking place in an active conflict zone amidst prolonged humanitarian crises. Approximately 8 major security incidents have occurred in the Beni area in the past 8 weeks. These factors have complicated contact tracing and other aspects of the response.
- Community mistrust, stemming from a variety of reasons, including the security situation, and people who avoid follow-up or delay seeking care, remain significant problems that require deepening engagement by community, national and international partners.
- New cases being identified without epidemiological links are of great concern and require further detailed epidemiological mapping.
- The assessment of the risk of spread is low at global level but it is very high at both national and regional levels. There has been no change to the risk assessment since [28 Sep 2018].
- Ring vaccination efforts have achieved high coverage rates among eligible populations but rely heavily on highly performing contact tracing in DRC and all countries that may be affected.

The Committee also noted positive developments:
- The Committee commended the government of the DRC, WHO, and all response partners for the progress made under difficult circumstances.
- All pillars of the response are working at scale and are being adjusted in real time.
- Surveillance activities are commendable but need to be intensified.
- MONUSCO is providing needed support for logistics and security for the response.
- Investigational vaccines and therapeutics are being used for the first time at scale.
- Screening at border crossings is being undertaken on a very large scale.
- Preparedness activities in neighbouring countries are ongoing, although these will require substantial additional financial support.

In conclusion, the Emergency Committee, while advising that a PHEIC should not be declared at this time, offered the following Public Health Advice:
- The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners must intensify the current response. Without this, the situation is likely to deteriorate significantly. This response should be supported by the entire international community.
- A critical determining factor is the safety and security of the population, which, in turn, affects the community's perception of the response. The safety and security of responders should be ensured, and the protection of health workers and health facilities be prioritized.
- Therefore, we commend the outreach to the United Nations Security Council and hope it will remain engaged in this matter.
- Special emphasis should be placed on the response in Beni and Butembo, including continuing attention to community engagement.
- Efforts to link epidemiological data with real-time full-genome sequencing should be supported. This will clarify chains of transmission.
- Encourage consideration of population-based Ebola control strategies, for example, the SAGE recommendations on geographic vaccination strategies.
- Licensure of vaccines should be urgently sought and efforts made to increase the limited global supply.
- Because there is a very high risk of regional spread, neighbouring countries should accelerate preparedness and surveillance, and request partners to increase their support. For example, they should consider vaccination of health care workers and front-line workers in high-risk districts neighbouring DRC.
- It is particularly important that no international travel or trade restrictions should be applied.
- Exit screening, including at airports, ports, and land crossings, is of great importance; however, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value.
- The DG should continue to monitor the situation closely and reconvene the Emergency Committee as needed.

The Committee emphasized the importance of continued support by WHO and other national and international partners towards the effective implementation and monitoring of this advice.

Based on this advice, the reports made by the affected State Party, and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment and on [17 Oct 2018] did not declare the Ebola outbreak in the DRC a PHEIC. In light of the advice of the Emergency Committee, WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice.

[Three PHEICs have been declared to date: 2014 Polio declaration, 2014 West Africa Ebola Outbreak, 2016 Zika declaration. But meetings have been convened several times in the past for other diseases, specifically MERS-CoV and Yellow Fever where PHEICs were not declared. The committee recommended enhanced preparedness and surveillance, and increased support from partners. They acknowledged the challenges of the outbreak, but felt at this moment in time, a PHEIC is not needed. They will reconvene if necessary. - Mod.LK]
