Continued slow increase in influenza activity across Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 2/2011 by 46 Member
States in the WHO European Region.
- Influenza activity has progressed across the Region following a
west-to-east trend.
- 44 percent of sentinel specimens were positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 remains the dominant virus,
particularly in the western part of the Region.
- Countries continue to report cases of severe disease caused mainly
by pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infections (see network comments).

Current situation - week 02/2011
--------------------------------
Of the 38 countries reporting on consultation rates for
influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI),
20 reported increases while 2 reported decreases. In the remaining 16
countries, consultation rates were largely unchanged. In general, the
highest consultation rates were reported for children aged 0-14
years. Information on the intensity of influenza activity was
available for 40 countries.

Most countries reported medium (24) or low (13) activity, while 1
(Luxembourg) reported very high influenza activity and 2 others
(Ireland and Norway) reported high activity. Influenza was reported
to be widespread in 15 countries, regional in 7 countries and local
in 7 countries; 11 countries reported no or sporadic activity.
Influenza levels were highest in the western part of the Region. Of
the 23 countries reporting on the impact of influenza on health care
systems, 19 described it as low overall. Ireland reported severe
impact on its health care capacity, while 3 other countries (Estonia,
Georgia and Israel) reported moderate impact.

Virological situation - week 2/2011
-----------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 continued to predominate in western
and northern Europe, while influenza A and B mainly co-dominated in
the eastern part of the Region. Influenza B was reported to be
dominant in a few countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 2886 respiratory specimens, of which
1263 (44 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 912 (72 percent)
were influenza A and 351 (28 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 813 were subtyped: 769 (95 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 44 (5 percent) as A(H3). In the 24 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 12 percent
to 76 percent, with a median of 44 percent (mean: 43 percent).

In addition, 4515 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 3183 (70 percent) influenza A and 1332 (30 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 1875 were subtyped: 1842 (98
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 33 (2 percent) as A(H3). In addition,
20 countries reported circulation of respiratory syncytial virus.

Since week 40/2010, 620 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 361 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 184 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 62 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; and 13 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

Based on the genetic characterization of 62 influenza viruses, 41
belonged to the pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 9
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 5
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 1 belonged to the A(H3) clade
represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 4 belonged to the
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); 1 belonged to the
B/Florida/4/2006 clade (Yamagata lineage), and 1 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Cumulative virological update - weeks 40/2010-2/2011
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 22 579 influenza virus detections were reported, of which
16 055 (71 percent) were influenza A and 6524 (29 percent) influenza
B. Of the influenza A viruses, 9866 were subtyped: 9327 (95 percent)
as pandemic influenza A(H1), 537 (5 percent) as influenza A(H3) and 2
(less than 1 percent) as influenza A(H1).

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to rise, following a
west-to-east progression across the Region. However, several
countries are reporting low influenza activity, mainly in the central
part of the Region. In week 2/2011, 44 percent of sentinel samples
tested positive for influenza, similarly to previous weeks. Pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 remains the dominant virus in circulation in
most countries.

[As in the previous week about half (44 percent) of respiratory
infections could be attributed to influenza virus infection,
respiratory syncytial virus possibly being a significant minor
component. ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to rise, following
a west-to-east progression across the Region. However, several
countries are now reporting low influenza activity,

Overall, of the influenza positives, 71 percent were influenza A and
(29 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 95 percent were
identified as pandemic influenza A(H1), 5 percent as influenza A(H3)
and less than 1 percent were similar to the previous seasonal
influenza A(H1) outbreak strain.
