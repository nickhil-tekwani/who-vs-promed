Dear ProMED-mail editor, please find enclosed an official response of the
Swiss
Reference Laboratory for Animal TSE on the mentioned article.

Official response of the Swiss Reference Laboratory for Animal TSE to the
article:
"BSEs hidden horror" by Debora MacKenzie (http://newscientist.com; June 13,
1998)
June 12, 1998
The Swiss reference laboratory for animal TSE (reference lab) is located at
the Institute of Animal Neurology at the University of Bern. In order to
determine true incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in
Switzerland, the reference laboratory has been contracted by the Swiss
government to monitor TSE's and to conduct studies on the presence of
preclinical BSE in the Swiss cattle population. These studies included the
development and validation of BSE tests, development of transgenic mice,
sampling and examining CNS material from Swiss cattle and epidemiological
investigations. The reference lab is not part of the Swiss Federal
Veterinary Office as indicated in the article by Deborah MacKenzie of the
New Scientist of Today.
We are dismayed by the serious inaccuracies in the article about the
"shocking" BSE test results in Switzerland. The interpretation of the
results in respect to the validation of the diagnostic tests and true
incidence of BSE in the cattle population in our country is unscientific
and potentially misleading. We hereby present a brief account of the
presented errors and the scientific data and conclusions derived from our
studies to date.
Critical statements in New Scientist article to be addressed
1. "Hundreds of thousands of apparently healthy cattle could be infected
with BSE, new Swiss data suggest. For every case of mad cow disease in
Switzerland, more than 100 animals may be "silently" carrying the infection"
2. ""The official theory is that only sick cows ate a lump of infectious
feed, but other cattle may be infected, and just haven't shown symptoms".
The Prionics test has confirmed this. Of 1761 healthy cows slaughtered in
the culling programme, eight tested positive for BSE. Six of these were
also picked up by the veterinary office using other tests."
3. "Eight infected cows out of 1761 gives a rate of "silent" infection of
4.5 per thousand animals, more than 100 times [that of Switzerland 1997
rate of clinical BSE."
4. "Epidemiological data suggest that a similar pattern may emerge."
Scientific background and response
In 1997, all herd mates of Swiss BSE cases born before December 1990 (the
date of the Swiss ruminant feed ban) and all herd mates of Swiss BAB cases
(regardless of age) were culled. These animals were examined in the
reference laboratory by histology and immunocytochemistry (IHC) to
demonstrate the accumulation of the protease resistant (infectious) prion
protein. Immunocytochemistry has been used to detect a variety of antigens,
including prion protein, in tissue sections since many years. The latter
technique involves antibodies specifically directed against the bovine
prion protein which we had raised in rabbits. It is known from experimental
pathogenesis studies in BSE in cattle that accumulation of the infectious
prion protein becomes detectable by immunocytochemical methods before
spongiform change and clinical signs occur. Preliminary data suggest that
this may be up to 6 months prior to the occurrence of clinical signs (Wells
et al., 1998). Of the animals tested, 6 were found to have accumulation of
the infectious prion protein in the brainstem. Three of those in addition
had mild spongiform changes.
All samples were made available to the company Prionics (B. Oesch, M.
Moser) during a validation phase of a BSE test developed by Prionics at the
University of Zurich. The Prionics test is also based on the detection of
infectious prion protein with western blot (WB) techniques using antibodies
following electrophoresis of brain tissue extracts. The WB technique exists
since many years and is widely used in the biomedical sciences. The use of
the WB for the detection of prion protein in BSE was first published in
1992 in Great Britain but remained essentially a research tool. Prionics
has modified this technique in such a way that large numbers of samples can
be examined in a short period of time, thus allowing its use as a routine
diagnostic test. Prionics has also developed excellent monoclonal
antibodies against the infectious prion protein.
The WB validation also included confirmed cases of BSE as well as confirmed
negatives. The results were evaluated by Prionics together with the
reference laboratory and a final report written and signed by the two
laboratories in spring of 1998 was submitted to the Swiss FVO. The Prionics
test detected 6 positive cases among the 1761 animals culled in the
slaughter programme. Four of these cases were identical to the ones found
by the reference laboratory. The 2 remaining cases detected by Prionics had
been negative in the IHC. In contrast, the 2 additional cases that were
detected with standard methods were negative in the Prionics assay. Thus a
total of 8 positive reactors were found, 4 of which overlapped. Both
Prionics and the reference laboratory agreed in the final report to declare
the 4 overlapping reactors definite positive cases. The remaining 4 animals
were considered questionable, requiring further investigation. Meanwhile,
all 8 reactors have been examined, again in a blinded fashion, in the
laboratory of Prof. Kretschmar, University of Guttingen, Germany using a
new very sensitive assay in tissue sections. The new assay confirmed the
diagnosis in one of the two questionable cases diagnosed by the reference
laboratory. The two questionable cases diagnosed by Prionics were not
confirmed. In total, 5 out of 1761 herdmates of confirmed BSE cases were
confirmed PrP positive and considered preclinically infected.
It is of no surprise to scientists that for any disease with a long
incubation period (time between infection and outbreak of clinical signs),
one has to expect a larger proportion of the infected population to be in
the incubation period (preclinically infected) than showing clinical signs.
This is especially true in the case of BSE where the exposure to
contaminated meat and bone meal (MBM) occurred over a period of several
years and where the incubation period can vary considerably between
individual animals: Swiss BSE field cases were between 31 months and 11
years old with an average of 5-6 years.
Until recently, no studies have been reported on the prevalence of
preclinical BSE in the slaughter animal population. The limiting factor for
these studies remains the fact that the tests currently available only
detect animal in the late incubation period (within 6 months of the
outbreak of clinical disease). Estimates of preclinically infected animals
that were slaughtered on a routine basis and that entered the food chain
undetected are based on modelling approaches. A mathematical model
developed in 1996 in Great Britain on the basis of the MAFF BSE statistic
estimated that a large number of preclinically infected cattle had already
entered the human food chain in the UK (Anderson et al., 1996).
A backward calculation model on the expected number of animals that had to
be infected during their first year of life to produce the number of
observed cases from each birth cohort since 1984 (the birth year of the
first BSE case observed in Switzerland) was performed for the Swiss BSE
epidemic. We estimated that the maximum number of preclinically infected
animals in Switzerland was reached in 1990 (with potentially 1200 affected
animals among the 900000 heifers and cows in the population that year).
After 1990, most likely as a result of the feedban, the model shows a
pronounced downward trend in the expected number of preclinical cases in
the general cattle population with less than 100 preclinical cases still
present in the 1997 population. Each year, approx. 70000 heifers and 200000
cows are slaughtered in Switzerland.
The results of these studies should be interpreted as follows:
- The sensitivity of the Prionics WB is similar to the one of the IHC and
certainly not higher as suggested by the media. With the sensitivity of the
techniques available to date, animals in incubation (preclinical cases)
will be detected by demonstration of the accumulation of the protease
resistant protein in the final 6 months of the incubation period only;
- Demonstration of accumulation or infectious prion protein, even in the
absence of clinical signs and spongiform changes, is a strong indication
for BSE; however, as with every test system, false positive results are
possible;
- In contrast to the statement made by D. MacKenzie, researchers have
always suspected a large number of preclinically infected animals in the
population. For that reason, measures have been taken (destruction of
slaughter animals over the age of 30 months in the UK, limitation on the
use of high risk organs like brain and spinal cord) to prevent the spread
of infection from products of slaughtered preclinically infected animals to
humans;
- Of the 1761 herd mates of BSE cases destroyed in the culling programme, 5
positive in IHC and the new assay, i.e. in the late stage of incubation,
not 8 as stated in the article. It is incorrect that these preclinical
cases of BSE were detected (the first time) by the new "sensitive" assay of
Prionics; the cases had been identified before in the frame of a study
conducted by the reference lab and, together with other samples, were used
for the validation of the Prionics western blot.
- We consider the culled population of BSE herdmates a high risk group with
proven exposure. The prevalence of preclinical disease observed within this
cohort should therefore be considerably higher than the true prevalence of
preclinical BSE cases in the general cattle population. Any direct
extrapolation showing huge numbers of preclinically infected animals for
1997, as done by D. MacKenzie, is not appropriate;
- As demonstrated before in the Swiss simulation, we expect (with advancing
time) a further decreasing proportion of preclinically infected animals in
the Swiss cattle population. This is due to elimination of exposure (feed
ban and similar measures) and the decrease in animals from exposed birth
cohorts that are still present in the population (aging of the cohorts);
- We currently have no epidemiological data to support that "a similar
pattern" (high prevalence of preclinical infection) may emerge in the
planned prevalence study at slaughter, as incorrectly stated by D.
MacKenzie.
Supporting our line of reasoning is a statement published by the moderator
of ProMED-mail (e-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org) as a response to D.
MacKenzies article:
"One should remember that these 1761 healthy cows were taken from herds in
which one or more clinical BSE cases had been previously identified and
slaughtered. And 6/8 Prionic +ve animals showed positive on other
veterinary tests suggesting that if they had not been slaughtered some if
not all six would have eventually demonstrated BSE. It has been held in the
UK for some time now that preclinically affected animals would have been
slaughtered and butchered as a matter of course. What risk such animals
pose is argumentative with the current restrictions. - Mod.MHJ"
