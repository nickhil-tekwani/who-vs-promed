It would be nice to receive some better clinical description than
"acute vomiting, diarrhoea, trembling lethargy and fever" for this
one.

It could almost be like one I was very peripherally involved with more
than 25 years ago in Australia.

Almost every year in Alice Springs, cases of severe, acute
non-responsive hepatitis (vomiting, some diarrhoea, lethargy) would
occur seasonally. We examined pet food suppliers (a relatively common
factor was the town's only fresh meat pet food supplier), but failed
to turn up anything particularly noteworthy other than that he sourced
and prepared a lot of fresh horse meat.

One day a regular client with many large dogs presented with 1 case.
He didn't, however, get meat from the local pet food supplier. A
couple of days later he turned up again with 2 more cases -- all of
which we were not able to save. A colleague visited his place of
residence and collected some fresh frozen horse meat from a freezer
there (which he had been feeding his dogs for about a week before they
fell acutely ill). He reported that it had been a 'walkabout' horse
that he had destroyed for his dog foods.

That meat was then fed to a group of control pound dogs (scheduled for
euthanasia) and their liver enzymes were monitored twice daily. About
3-5 days into feeding, their enzymes started to rise quite quickly and
the dogs were immediately euthanized.

It turned out to be indospicine, a toxic principle found in a native
legume of the dry Australian inland, _Indigofera_ spp, particularly
prevalent in better seasons (which there had been a run of at the
time). Horses were eating the legume and the toxin was, unbeknown
until then, accumulating in their skeletal muscle tissues as well as
causing chronic liver damage. Horses with chronic liver damage were
developing hepatic encephalopathy (known locally as 'walkabout
disease' because of their incessant pacing), they were being
destroyed, and their carcasses then fed to dogs.

Subsequently proven through trials using the pure toxin, of which
CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation;
Australia's national science agency] had possibly the only purified
supply at the time.

The result was a series of official measures to ensure that meat from
horses raised in the area of occurrence of the _Indigofera_ spp
involved were excluded from both pet food and horses slaughtered for
export and human consumption. It also resulted in the permanent
closure of at least 2 horse abattoirs operating at that time, largely
sourcing very environmentally damaging feral horses from the dry
inland expanses.

[Dr. Thomson is right in that the articles give us precious little in
the way of clinical signs. Nor have we seen any lab reports.

His account is most interesting and serves as a reminder that
secondary toxicities do occur. - Mod.TG]
