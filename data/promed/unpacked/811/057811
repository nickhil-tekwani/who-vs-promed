France has started a trial to vaccinate ducks against highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI]. The Ministry of Agriculture reports that 2 vaccines are being tested that can protect the birds against infection and prevent the virus from spreading.

Minister Julien Denormandie had previously announced that he was looking at vaccination to combat the recurring epidemics of highly pathogenic avian influenza. The trial, now underway, is being held in regions most affected by those outbreaks. It is supervised by veterinary experts and by the National School of Veterinary Medicine in Toulouse.

"The trial should make it possible to collect scientific evidence about the effectiveness and importance of vaccination in the fight against bird flu. The results of this study are expected by the end of 2022 and, if appropriate, will be shared at the European level to develop a vaccination strategy," the ministry said.

So far, more than 1370 infections with HPAI have been detected in France. A total of 16 million birds have been culled, 11 million of which are in Vend√©e and neighbouring regions in the west of the country. Because new infections are still being reported almost daily, the highest risk level continues to apply to that region.

Denormandie believes that, because of the favourable development, in the rest of the country the risk can be reduced from high to modest. This means that the confinement obligation will also be lifted in most of the territory.

[Seeking to stamp out the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza, France and other countries have been culling record numbers of poultry: more than 16 million birds since December 2021 in France alone. Last year [2021], the cost there exceeded EUR 150 million [USD 161.7 million]. Now, faced with the desperation of farmers, France, the Netherlands, and other hard-hit countries have restarted research into a solution long considered taboo: vaccinating flocks. For this information, presented in https://www.science.org/content/article/wrestling-bird-flu-europe-considers-once-taboo-vaccines, ProMED is grateful to Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi.

According to WOAH* [see note below] International Terrestrial Code, chapter 10.4, "Infection with High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza," article 10.4.1.6, "the use of vaccination against avian influenza may be recommended under specific conditions. Any vaccine used should comply with the standards described in the Terrestrial Manual.

"Vaccination will not affect the high-pathogenicity avian influenza status of a free country or zone if surveillance supports the absence of infection, in accordance with Article 10.4.28 ["Surveillance for demonstrating freedom from infection with high-pathogenicity avian influenza"], in particular, point 2 ["Additional requirements for countries, zones, or compartments that practise vaccination"].

"Vaccination can be used as an effective complementary control tool when a stamping-out policy alone is not sufficient. Whether to vaccinate or not should be decided by the Veterinary Authority on the basis of the avian influenza situation as well as the ability of the Veterinary Services to implement the vaccination strategy, as described in Chapter 4.18 ["Vaccination"; http://tinyurl.com/4xdsnryy]."

During the 3 waves of HPAI experienced in France during the 2021/2022 winter season (the largest in March 2022), a total of 1372 outbreaks were reported as of 5 May 2022. The epizootic affected mainly palmipedes but also others, including turkeys.
