Duck plague won't infect people, pets
-------------------------------------
A concerned resident reported dead and sick Muscovy ducks on the
shore side of Big Lake Park in Plano [TX].
Jamey Cantrell, Animal Services manager for the city of Plano, said
the ducks in question were tested and found to have acquired duck
virus enteritis, or duck plague, a naturally occurring common
internal virus that Muscovy ducks are highly susceptible to. Mr.
Cantrell said the virus cannot be transmitted to pets or humans but
warns residents who find dead or sick ducks not to touch them, and to
call Plano Animal Services at 972-769-4360.

[Duck Viral Enteritis is also known as duck plague. The following is
from the Merck Manual:
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/201000.htm>
"Duck viral enteritis is an acute, highly contagious disease of
ducks, geese, and swans of all ages, characterized by sudden death,
high mortality (particularly among older ducks), and hemorrhages and
necrosis in internal organs. It has been reported in domestic and
wild waterfowl in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa, resulting
in limited to serious economic losses on domestic duck farms and
sporadic, limited to massive die-offs in wild waterfowl.
There is no treatment. Prevention is based on maintaining susceptible
birds in a disease-free environment. Contact with wild, free-flying
waterfowl and direct or indirect contact with contaminated birds or
material (free-flowing water) should be avoided. Control is effected
by depopulation, removal of birds from the infected environment,
sanitation, and disinfection. A chicken-embryo-adapted, modified live
virus vaccine has been approved for use in domestic ducks, in
zoological aviaries, and by private aviculturists. A 0.5-mL dose is
administered SC or IM to domestic ducklings >2 wk old, with a booster
inoculation 1 year later. The vaccine is not approved for use in wild
ducks." - Mod.TG]
