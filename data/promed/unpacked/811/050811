State Health Department Confirms Presence of West Nile Virus in Four
Additional Counties
------------------------------------------------------
ALBANY, August 4 Â— Birds submitted to the New York State Department of
Health for laboratory testing from Columbia, Erie, Rensselaer, and
Schenectady counties were found to be infected with West Nile virus, Health
Commissioner Antonia C. Novello, M.D., M.P.H., Dr.P.H., said today,
indicating the likelihood that the virus is present throughout the State.
"We continue to find West Nile virus in birds in counties well outside of
the area originally affected and it is likely that the virus is present
throughout New York State," Dr. Novello said. "With the addition of 9
counties showing evidence of West Nile virus over the past 2 days, it is
important that New Yorkers adhere to our advice and continue to take common
sense precautions relating to personal protection and they should continue
to reduce stagnant water where mosquitoes breed."
Three of the 4 counties announced today had West Nile positive crows:
Erie (the Town of Tonawanda), Rensselaer (City of Troy), Schenectady (City
of Schenectady). The bird found to be infected in Columbia (Town of
Kinderhook) is a swan. The State Health Department's Wadsworth Laboratory
confirmed the presence of virus in the bird specimens, based on repeated
positive results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.
Of the 5 additional counties announced yesterday, 3 of the counties had
West Nile positive crows: Albany County (specimen submitted from the Town
of Colonie), Warren County (specimen submitted from the Town of
Warrensburg) and Washington County (specimen submitted from the Town of
Greenwich). In Dutchess County, the virus was confirmed in a blue jay from
Wappinger Falls, and the Putnam County bird specimen was a house sparrow
submitted from the Town of Southeast.

[Check out the NYS bird map at
<http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/westnile/birdmap.gif>. Erie County is
in the extreme west of NY state. From there it is a short flight across the
river to Canada, & not very far "as the crow flies" to NW Pennsylvania,
Ohio & Michigan. It is also obvious from that map that there must be
positive birds in all the adjoining counties in Massachusetts & Connecticut
across the eastern border of NY State, but to date only 2 crows have been
reported positive in Mass. (one in Boston, the other in Middlesex County,
both on the east coast), & none in Conn. - Mod.JW
[ProMED-mail has since learned of 2 additional infected birds in
Massachusetts, which will be discussed in the piece below. - Man. Ed. DS

West Nile virus-infected robin indicates local spread in bird population
around Boston
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSTON: - A dead robin infected with the West Nile virus has been found in
a Boston neighborhood, confirming that mosquitoes are spreading the [virus
locally, Massachusetts authorities said on Saturday. While dead crows have
also been found around Boston with the virus, they [i.e. this species of
bird when not dead can migrate up to 200 miles. The discovery of the first
small bird known to be infected, however, indicated West Nile virus was
being transmitted [to other species of birds within the area, public
health officials said. Health officials said the robin, found in Boston's
Jamaica Plain neighborhood, was one of two birds to test positive for West
Nile virus in recent days, bringing the total number of birds infected with
the disease in Massachusetts to four.
West Nile was first confirmed in Massachusetts after testing on a dead crow
found July 22 in a wooded area of Jamaica Plain. Since then, the city of
Boston and surrounding suburban towns have initiated spraying campaigns to
eradicate mosquitoes in the area. On Thursday, state officials said a
testing of 7,000 mosquitoes and more than 200 birds turned up no signs of
the virus. Worried citizens have deluged the state's public health
department with dead bird reports. West Nile virus, named for the region in
Uganda where it first appeared in 1937, had never been detected in the
Western Hemisphere until it killed seven people and sickened 62 others in
the New York region in 1999.
This [evidence of local spread in Massachusetts comes as U.S. officials
reported this year's first human case of West Nile virus. A 78-year-old
Staten Island, N.Y., man was recovering at home after spending a week in
the hospital. West Nile [virus is spread to humans by the bite of a
mosquito. A mosquito can become infected by biting an [infected bird and
can then spread West Nile virus further by biting uninfected birds.
