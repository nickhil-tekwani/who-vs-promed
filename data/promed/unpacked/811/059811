Avian influenza: death of 16th case in Thailand; pandemic vaccine development
-----------------------------------------------
Situation in Thailand
---------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has today [Mon 4 Oct 2004]
confirmed a further case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza A
virus. The case, which was fatal, was a 9 year old girl from the northern
province of Phetchabun. She developed symptoms on 23 Sep 2004, was admitted
to hospital on 27 Sep 2004, and died of severe respiratory disease on Sun 3
Oct 2004. Investigation of the case has identified exposure to diseased
chickens as the most likely cause of infection. Following the death of
chickens in the child's household, she assisted in preparation of the birds
for cooking, including the plucking of feathers. WHO stresses the
importance of educating populations in affected countries, especially those
living in remote rural areas, about the danger of contact with diseased birds.
Since the beginning of this year [2004], Thailand has reported 16
laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 infection, 11 of which have been fatal.
4 of these cases have occurred during the past 4 weeks. Last week [final
week of September 2004], Thai officials announced a probable case of human
to human transmission in a family cluster of cases. Analysis of specimens
from this cluster is presently under way at a WHO collaborating laboratory
to determine whether the virus has changed its genetic make-up. Heightened
surveillance for further cases has provided no evidence that efficient and
sustained human to human transmission is presently occurring in Thailand.
Status of vaccine development for an influenza pandemic
-------------------------------------------------------
A vaccine could reduce the high morbidity and mortality normally associated
with influenza pandemics, if available sufficiently early. Significant
efforts are needed to expedite vaccine development to take advantage of
this preventive option.
Progress is needed on 3 fronts. Firstly, countries experiencing outbreaks
need to rapidly share human and animal viruses with laboratories in the WHO
Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Analysis of these viruses determines
the possible need for changes in the prototype vaccine "seed" strains which
WHO makes available to the pharmaceutical industry.
Secondly, companies need to engage in research on pandemic vaccine
development that includes pilot production of small batches for clinical
testing. National licensing agencies in Europe and North America have
developed regulatory guidelines for industry.
Thirdly, public health agencies need to engage in discussions with
pharmaceutical companies to explore areas of common interest in vaccine
development and to identify areas where support is needed. Since 2003, when
2 cases of human H5N1 infection occurred in Hong Kong, WHO has worked to
identify and resolve problems in order to pave the way for rapid
development and production of a pandemic vaccine.
Vaccine manufacturers respond to market forces. Companies may be reluctant
to produce a vaccine for an event, such as a pandemic, that cannot be
predicted with any certainty and might not be caused by currently
circulating strains. Some uncertainty has also centered on rights to use
the special technique of reverse genetics, a patented procedure, that is
needed to produce the prototype "seed" vaccine against H5N1.
At the beginning of April 2004, WHO made the prototype seed strain for an
H5N1 vaccine available to manufacturers. To date, only 2 of the world's
roughly 12 major companies producing influenza vaccines have taken work on
a pandemic vaccine significantly forward. These 2 companies, Aventis
Pasteur Inc. and Chiron Corp., both located in the USA, have produced small
batches of vaccine for use in clinical trials. These trials, which require
several months for the compilation and analysis of data, are needed to
fine-tune vaccine composition, test safety, and to meet other licensing
requirements. Trials are not expected to begin before the end of the year
[2004].

[With the death of the young girl in the province of Phetchabun, the total
number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Thailand becomes 16 (with 11
deaths). Taken together with the 27 cases and 20 deaths in Viet Nam, the
overall totals for East Asia become 43 cases and 31 deaths. - Mod.CP]
