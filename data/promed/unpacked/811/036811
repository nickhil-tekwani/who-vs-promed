Japanese experts panel says no use testing young cows for BSE
-----------------------------------------------
A Japanese panel of experts on mad cow disease [BSE, Bovine Spongiform
Encephaloapthy] said, in a draft, that testing young cattle for the disease
is not technically feasible, suggesting the government's blanket screening
rules could be eased.
If the government adopts the report, it could also clear the way for a
resumption of US beef imports, as Japan would also be likely to drop its
insistence on blanket testing of all American cattle.
Younger cows, particularly those younger than 30 months old, are generally
not considered at risk of developing bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the
report said Fri 16 Jul 2004. In any event, younger cows do not accumulate
enough abnormal prions -- the protein believed to cause the disease -- to
be detected by current tests, the report said. "The capability of the
current testing technology is limited. It is not capable of detecting
infections during the incubation period," the report said. The panel is a
part of the Food Commission under the Cabinet Office.
The report added, however, Japan's blanket testing regime has resulted in
the discovery of mad cow infections in young cows, such as a 21-month-old,
and a 23-month-old cow. Japan introduced measures to screen every cow
slaughtered for consumption, after it became the only country in Asia to
have confirmed BSE with the discovery of its 1st case in September 2001.
The panel also emphasized the importance of excluding "risk materials,"
such as the brain, spinal cord, and eyes, from food-distribution systems,
said administrative officials for the panel.
Japanese and US officials will hold a 2-day working-level talk, starting on
Jul 21 2004, in Tokyo over the beef import ban.
The panel's discussion followed a series of news reports saying the panel
was drafting a recommendation to the government to suggest that Tokyo
should stop mad cow screening for young cows. The draft, made available
late Fri 16 Jul 2004, stopped short of that, however, and Cabinet Office
officials said they were not aware of any such report.
Japan banned beef imports from the United States following the discovery,
in December 2004, of the 1st case of mad cow disease there. Japan has
argued that, before Japan can lift its ban, the United States must screen
all slaughtered cows for BSE. Washington has rejected Tokyo's demand,
saying the blanket testing for young cow was not scientifically meaningful.

[2] FDA issues a warning about BSE and cosmetics

FDA recommends firms not use high-risk cattle protein in cosmetics
-----------------------------------------------
The FDA is urging cosmetic firms to not use certain cattle-derived
substances in their products, because consumers run a slight risk in
acquiring the human version of mad cow disease if they apply cosmetics
tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to open cuts. The
recommendation is included in the FDA's risk assessment dealing with the
potential for BSE in cosmetics.
The FDA notes that the primary path of human exposure to BSE is through
ingesting beef, and other food, from cattle, but points out that small
doses of the infectious prions that cause mad cow disease can be found in
cosmetics.
But, "large uncertainties" exist about the number of cosmetic products on
the market that may pose a risk to human health, the agency says, adding,
that any estimate of the risk, or rate at which BSE may be expected to
occur, would be imprecise.
Moreover, the agency points out that considerable doubt exists about the
origin of protein used in making cosmetics, the effect of processing on
prion concentrations, and the transmission rates for dermal and ocular
exposure. The risk assessment states that what scientists do not know about
the transmission of BSE from food also goes for cosmetics.
The FDA's assessment is qualitative, but, it provides a "logical structure
that a quantitative model could use if one were constructed," according to
the agency.
But, some conclusions can be drawn about the risk to human health without
quantitative data, the agency says. "For example, the number of
BSE-affected cattle, and the variability in human susceptibility, will
impact the risk of both food- and cosmetic-associated [BSE]."
Some of the agency's uncertainties, however, may affect both sides of a
cost-benefit analysis, the FDA says. "In particular, if there is not
substantial use of cattle-derived protein in making cosmetics, then there
will be little exposure, and, also, little economic consequence from
regulating use. Conversely, high use would require substantial substitution
and alternative means of animal-by-product disposal."
The Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association would not comment on the
FDA risk assessment, as the organization is still reviewing the document, a
group spokesperson said.
