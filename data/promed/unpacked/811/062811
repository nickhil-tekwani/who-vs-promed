Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV, [genus, tobamovirus]) has been identified
on pepper in Florida several times since 1997. Initial observations were on
ornamental peppers (_Capsicum chinense_, _C. frutescens_, and _C. annuum_
[sweet pepper]). However, in the winter growing seasons of 1999 and 2000,
PMMoV was detected in several bell pepper (_C. annuum_) cultivars in
commercial production fields in south Florida.
Symptoms in bell pepper plants were observed to vary with plant age and
cultivar, and included stunting of young plants and puckering and yellow
mottling of leaves. Fruit was deformed (lumpy and mottled) and slightly
reduced in size. Older fruit exhibited brown streaks and, in some
cultivars, an undesirable color at maturity. Incidence in commercial bell
pepper fields varied from <1 to 30 percent. Symptoms on mechanically
inoculated
indicator hosts, analysis of viral-associated double-stranded RNA, and
inclusion body morphology suggested the presence of a tobamovirus. PMMoV
was specifically identified by serological testing using ELISA (Agdia,
Elkhart, IN).
To our knowledge, this is the first definitive identification of PMMoV (2)
in Florida, although a prior isolation of the same or a similar virus was
made in 1964 and reported as the Samsun latent strain of Tobacco mosaic
virus (1). The occurrence of this seedborne virus in an area of intensive
commercial pepper production requires careful monitoring to avoid future
significant losses.

[This tobamovirus was first reported in _C. annuum_ in South Carolina,
U.S.A. in 1952. Symptoms include mild chlorosis and stunting, especially if
plants are infected when young. Fruits can be small, malformed, mottled and
may have necrotic depressions, thus rendering them unmarketable. PMMoV is
transmitted by close contact between plants, by virions on the surface of
seeds, and by grafting. The virus has been reported in many countries
(Argentina, Australia, Denmark, France, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA), most recently in Canada in 1997.
Control of the disease is best achieved by the use of resistant cultivars.
