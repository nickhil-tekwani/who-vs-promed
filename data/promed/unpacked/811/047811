Wilt worries for oilseed rape
-----------------------------
Verticillium wilt, confirmed in UK oilseed rape last year [2007] for the
1st time, is adding to the problems of premature ripening caused by
sclerotinia in this season's [2008] stands, warns ADAS [Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service].

Growers are advised to check crops now for the symptoms. These typically
consist of a dark brown stripe running up one side of the main stem. Closer
inspection may reveal grey micro-sclerotia as the surface layers start to
decay.

The wilt disease is becoming more widely recognised as awareness of the
symptoms has grown, according to the service's Crop Action notes. It can be
detected at 0.1 per cent of plants affected in some crops. But badly
affected fields may have more than half the plants hit with either whole
plants or just side branches ripening prematurely. On farms where
verticillium is obvious growers are urged to extend rotations to at least
one in 4 and longer if possible where the infection is severe.

[Verticillium wilt of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_) is caused by the
soilborne vascular fungus _Verticillium longisporum_. This species is
pathogenic only on _Brassica_ species and occurs in many European countries
including France, Germany, and Sweden, as well as in Japan. It was recently
also recorded in the USA, and was reported in the UK for the 1st time in
2007 (see ProMED-mail post no. 20071001.3239). The growing area of intense
rapeseed cultivation has rendered the pathogen an increasing threat to
oilseed rape production particularly in Europe.

Unlike other _Verticillium_ species, _V. longisporum_ does not induce
wilting, but premature senescence and ripening which may severely reduce
yields by up to 50 per cent. It can survive in dead plant tissue and soil
for extended periods. Sufficient genetic resistance is not available in
oilseed rape, but interspecific hybridisation may provide a resource for
developing resistant crop lines. _V. longisporum_ appears to be a
host-adapted pathogen. Other species in the genus specialise in different
host families, for example _V. dahliae_ affects solanaceous plants and _V.
albo-atrum_ is associated with a wilt of hops.

Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mold), is caused
by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This soilborne fungus is one of
the most nonspecific (around 400 known hosts) and successful of plant
pathogens and is present worldwide. On oilseed rape, infected leaves
collapse around the stem, then stem lesions showing a typical bleached
appearance develop. The pathogen is primarily soilborne and has a complex
disease cycle.

Management for both diseases includes cultural practices (such as long term
crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum) and
fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective
against soilborne fungal pathogens.
