Nwoya district Member of Parliament, Richard Todwong has said the recent outbreak of Hepatitis B in the district is due to the importation of commercial sex workers from the neighboring districts of Nebbi and Kiryandongo. Todwong alleges that business people who own bars, lodges, and farms are hiring prostitutes from Pakwach town council [Nebbi] and Karuma town [Kiryandongo] board for their customers and notes that this could be the reason behind the rampant cases of sexually transmitted diseases including hepatitis B, syphilis and HIV/AIDS among others.

"Health workers, please make it mandatory for everyone who visits your health facility to undergo a hepatitis B examination if you want to fight and get rid of this deadly virus effectively," Todwong advised.

Nwoya district secretary for health and education Geoffrey Ojok says 3 sub counties of Purongo, Anaka, and Anaka town council have the highest numbers of hepatitis B cases. Ojok notes that the 1st case was reported in Anaka town council in December 2014 after a primary one pupil together with 7 members of her family were diagnosed with the disease. He however says they were treated and all recovered.

"As a result of the outbreak, the district instituted a task force to carry out massive mobilization and sensitization of the community to encourage people to go for hepatitis B medical tests and treatment," Ojok said. He added that, "Early this year 2015, many cases of hepatitis B disease infections were also reported in Corner Oliwyo and Purongo trading centre in Purongo Sub County and Agung trading centre in Anaka sub county situated along the Karuma-Pakwach -- Arua high way where commercial sex businesses is very high."

[Hepatitis B can surely be transmitted sexually especially during acute infection or when chronic hepatitis B carriers are HBeAg positive and an unregulated sex industry along transportation route will serve to transmit HBV as well as syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV. The cluster of cases in one family described, however, sounds like a family where the mother transmitted the virus to her offspring neonatally. Additionally, it is unclear what therapy was used for HBV since overall cure rates are not high and require long term therapy. The best way of preventing HBV transmission involves universal immunization with the subunit vaccine, barrier protection for sexual exposure and screening of blood and blood products for transfusion. - Mod.LL
