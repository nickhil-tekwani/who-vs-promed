A 5th case of a deadly and highly contagious pig virus has been confirmed in Ontario.

The provincial agriculture ministry says a pig from a farm in Simcoe County north of Toronto tested positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea on Saturday [1 Feb 2014] morning. It's the 3rd hog to test positive this week in the outbreak, which saw its 1st confirmed case on 22 Jan 2014.

Ministry spokeswoman Susan Murray says more pigs are expected to test positive for the virus, which has killed millions of piglets in the U.S.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week it will issue permits allowing veterinarians to import a vaccine for the virus as a precautionary measure. Officials stress that there is no risk to human health or food safety.

A group representing the province's hog farmers has said the virus is spread through contact with manure, which can cling to trucks, trailers, and even clothing and boots.

Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne discussed a cohesive national approach to battling the outbreak with her federal, provincial, and territorial counterparts on Thursday [30 Jan 2014].

Wynne said she is committed to helping the Ontario pork industry increase compliance with enhanced biosecurity protocols and national information sharing to mitigate the impact of the virus.

An illness that only affects pigs is making its way across the Midwest, including here in Minnesota. The porcine epidemic virus (PED) killed more than 7000 pigs at a facility near Good Thunder last December 2013.

Pork producers say newborn piglets are most susceptible, and it's always fatal. The virus' devastation cost the facility about USD 500 000.

Hog farmer Michael Sohre says there are ways to help stop the spread: "Disinfecting your boots and wearing clean clothes and making sure, if you need to go onto somebody else's farm, to put boots on, and disinfect your boots when you're done," Sohre said.

Pork producers say insurance does not cover the financial damage, meaning farmers aren't being reimbursed for the money lost after their pigs die.

[We are likely to continue seeing the spread of this disease, especially in the north, until warm weather helps break the cycle. This virus appears to like cold weather. For those in the north and for swine producers, summer cannot come quickly enough, yet those in the south may not feel that way, as summer is longer and hotter and sadly more drought producing.
