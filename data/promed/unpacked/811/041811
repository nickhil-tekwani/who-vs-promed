According to Xinhua News Agency, a spokesperson for the News Office
of the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday [17 Jun 2007] that at
the start of June [2007], Chongqing, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and
Shaanxi provinces had outbreaks of highly pathogenic pig blue ear
disease.
Because locales made preparations extremely early this summer,
improving preventative dynamics and putting in place comprehensive
preventative measures, highly pathogenic pig blue ear disease is
somewhat milder than during the same period last year [2006], with
sporadic occurrence [only]. There has not been widespread occurrence.
The Ministry of Agriculture has transferred more than 20 million
milliliters of pig blue ear disease vaccine and the Ministry of
Finance is releasing 285 million CNY [USD 37.4 million] in
supplemental vaccine funds. Vaccination work is now being carried out
in key locales. All regions are intensifying outbreak reporting
systems, in accordance with the Ministry of Agriculture's outbreak
monitoring schemes and reporting system requirements. When suspected
outbreaks are discovered, quick verification, prompt diagnosis, and
prompt reporting via the animal disease surveillance network [is done].

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver
[In a recent media-derived information (see ProMED-mail
20070612.1913), the following provinces were mentioned to have been
affected by the so-called "swine high fever disease" (SHFD) -- in
which porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS, also called
blue ear disease) seems to play a role -- since its 1st appearance in
mid 2006: Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Yunnan, some areas of
Guandgong, some areas of Guangxi, the western part of Shandong,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Beijing/Tianjin/Tangshan, Liaoning,
Jilin, and Inner Mongolia. Other reports mention different data.
For an administrative map of China, see
<http://www.fas.usda.gov/pecad/remote/china/chinamap.gif>.
The flood of data, originating from various (official, semi-official,
unofficial, central, provincial, and foreign) sources, with
contradictory pieces of information on SHFD, its etiology and
distribution, could be put on hold if/when detailed, 1st hand,
authoritative results of laboratory investigations from each affected
province become available, pertaining -- in addition to PRRS (blue ear
disease) -- to the entire range of potential causal agents (including
classical swine fever/CSF, African swine fever/ASF, avian influenza,
and foot-and-mouth disease/FMD) and preferably officially submitted
to the OIE. It would be reassuring if samples were to be submitted for
confirmation to OIE's ASF (World Organization for Animal Health,
African swine fever) reference laboratory(ies). - Mod.AS]
