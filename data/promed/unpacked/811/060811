Lassa fever: Arenaviruses and rodent taxonomy
---------------------------------------------
In a recent posting on Lassa fever dated 9 Apr 2003 [Lassa fever - Sierra
Leone 20030409.0863], the moderator in his otherwise excellent commentary
referred to rodent taxonomy, stating that "Arenaviruses are associated with
only 2 of the 30 families of rodents; the Muridae (house mice and rats) and
the Cricetidae (voles, deer mice, and gerbils)."
However, rodent taxonomy changed substantially in 1993 with the publishing of:
Wilson, D. E., and D. M. Reeder (eds). 1993. Mammal Species of the World.
Smithsonian Institution Press, 1206 pp.
The contents of this book are also available on the Smithsonian web site:
<http://www.nmnh.si.edu/msw/>
The essential change, concerning rodent hosts of some well-known virus
groups like arenaviruses and hantaviruses, was that we now have a large
family Muridae, which includes a number of subfamilies, like Murinae (house
mice and old world rats), Arvicolinae (voles and lemmings), Cricetinae
(hamsters), Sigmodontinae (New World mice and rats like deer mice and
cotton rats), Gerbillinae (gerbils), etc.
For virologists, the significance of this new rodent taxonomy is that at
subfamily level mentioned above, it fits very well with the phylogeny of
hantaviruses and arenaviruses. Also at the rodent generic level, the match
is good, even if some host switches have taken place.

[I am indebted to Professor Henttonen for providing this update concerning
the current taxonomy of rodents, and I hope that other virologists and
microbiologists will take note. The incorrect rodent taxonomy which I
quoted was extracted from a comprehensive review of arenaviruses published
as recently as 1998. ProMED-mail welcomes this opportunity to accelerate
the dissemination of information between disciplines.
Professor Henttonen has also drawn attention to the nomenclature anomaly
whereby in normal taxonomy (i.e., other than the taxonomy of viruses!),
family names are not rendered in italics, only species and genera. The
taxonomy of viruses is still an evolving discipline, and it may be that
virologists will come to accept the general convention. I rather think,
however, that virologists will consider that in this respect they are
leading the way. - Mod.CP]
