1st identification of Tobacco mild green mosaic virus on _Capsicum
annuum_ in Taiwan
-----------------------------------------------

Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University, Taipei,
Taiwan 10617, Republic of China. Accepted for publication 03/12/04
Peppers (_Capsicum annuum_) are important vegetables, and some
cultivars are planted as ornamental plants because of their colorful
fruits. In 2003, mild chlorosis and necrotic lesions were observed on
pepper plants in the northern part of Taiwan.
When pepper leaf extracts from plants showing symptoms were
mechanically inoculated onto leaves of _Chenopodium amaranticolor_
and _C. quinoa_, chlorotic lesions developed on the inoculated
leaves. After 3 successive single lesion isolations on _C.
amaranticolor_, an isolate of a virus was obtained. This isolate
caused only local lesions on inoculated leaves in many _Nicotiana_
spp. but produced systemic mosaic on _N. benthamiana_ and _N.
debneyi_. In addition, inoculated pepper plants exhibited mild
chlorosis symptoms and later became necrotic, followed by leaf drop.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous rigid rods,
approximately 300 nm in length, suggestive of tobamoviruses. There
are at least 6 known tobamoviruses that are able to infect peppers:
Paprika mild mottle virus (PaMMV), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV),
Ribgrass mosaic virus (RMV), Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV),
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) (Brunt et
al., 1996).
To identify the unknown virus, a poly(A) tail was added to the 3' end
of the purified viral RNA using poly(A) polymerase, and cDNA
fragments were subsequently amplified using a SMARTT RACE cDNA
Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), before being
cloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, USA).
2 independent clones were sequenced, and a BLAST search was performed
against the NCBI database. The results clearly indicated that the
clones contained a partial sequence of TMGMV with a 98 percent
nucleotide identity to a Japanese isolate of TMGMV (accession number
AB078435).
To our knowledge, this the 1st report of TMGMV identified in Taiwan.

[TMGMV probably occurs in all tropical and subtropical regions where
_Nicotiana glauca_ is distributed (North America, Australia and many
European and African countries, including Madeira, the Mediterranean
and Canary Islands. Tobacco mosaic and odontoglossum ringspot viruses
are closely related, and cucumber green mottle mosaic and sunn-hemp
mosaic tobamoviruses are distantly related. Disease management
involves application of phytosanitary measures, especially avoiding
contact between infected and virus-free plants. Production benches
and equipment used in glasshouse production systems must be
sterilized. - Mod.DH]
