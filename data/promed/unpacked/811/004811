We received a rapid reply to our query on the results of genetic testing of the poliovirus type 2 isolated in environmental samples taken from the Western Sewage Treatment Plant in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The poliovirus isolate was genetically characterized as most probably an immunodeficiency-related vaccine derived poliovirus (an iVDPV). The genetic characterization was suggestive of chronic carriage for several years with no relationship to prior or present cVDPV isolates.

[We would like to thank our EpiCore project member for the very rapid reply to our RFI asking for more information on the genetic characterization of the poliovirus 2 isolate. As Australia stopped using the OPV in 2005 (12 years ago), from the studies on this isolate it is highly likely that this came from an individual who was vaccinated in another country before coming (or returning) to Australia. I suspect the Public Health and Clinical community if they do not already know this individual are trying to identify where this individual is to monitor the continued excretion of the iVDPV2 in his/her stool.

An excellent review on reported cases of iVDPV cases during the period 1962-2012 can be found at: Guo J, Bolivar-Wagers S, Srinivas N, Holubar M, Maldonado Y. Immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV) cases: A systematic review and implications for polio eradication. Vaccine. 2015;33(10):1235-1242. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.01.018.

Abstract
"Background:
"Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), strains of poliovirus mutated from the oral polio vaccine, pose a challenge to global polio eradication. Immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) are a type of VDPV which may serve as sources of poliovirus reintroduction after the eradication of wild-type poliovirus. This review is a comprehensive update of confirmed iVDPV cases published in the scientific literature from 1962 to 2012, and describes clinically relevant trends in reported iVDPV cases worldwide.

"Methods:
"We conducted a systematic review of published iVDPV case reports from January 1960 to November 2012 from 4 databases. We included cases in which the patient had a primary immunodeficiency, and the vaccine virus isolated from the patient either met the sequencing definition of VDPV (>one percent divergence for serotypes 1 and 3 and greater than 0.6 percent for serotype 2) and/or was previously reported as an iVDPV by the World Health Organization.

"Results:
"We identified 68 iVDPV cases in 49 manuscripts reported from 25 countries and the Palestinian territories. Up to 62 percent of case patients were male, 78 percent presented clinically with acute flaccid paralysis, and 65 percent were iVDPV2. A total of 57 percent of cases occurred in patients with predominantly antibody immunodeficiencies, and the overall all-cause mortality rate was greater than 60 percent. The median age at case detection was 1.4 years [IQR: 0.8, 4.5] and the median duration of shedding was 1.3 years [IQR: 0.7, 2.2]. We identified a poliovirus genome VP1 region mutation rate of 0.72 percent per year and a higher median percent divergence for iVDPV1 cases. More cases were reported from high income countries, which also had a larger age variation and different distribution of immunodeficiencies compared to upper and lower middle-income countries.

"Conclusion:
"Our study describes the incidence and characteristics of global iVDPV cases reported in the literature in the past 5 decades. It also highlights the regional and economic disparities of reported iVDPV cases."

Additional information on iVDPVs, for the period January 2016 through June 2017 is available in: Jorba J, Diop OM, Iber J, et al. Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses - Worldwide, January 2016-June 2017. MMWR 3 Nov 2017 66(43);1185-1191 available at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6643a6.htm?s_cid=mm6643a6_w. The authors mention that there was identification of 17 iVDPV infections reported from 11 countries including 14 which were newly detected infections. All but 3 were iVDPV2 viruses (there were 3 iVDPV3 viruses identified). Since the introduction of OPV, the cumulative serotype distribution data show that iVDPV2 are the most common (69 percent), followed by type 3 (14 percent) type 1 (12 percent) and heterotypic mixtures (i.e., types 1 and 2 or types 2 and 3) (5 percent).
