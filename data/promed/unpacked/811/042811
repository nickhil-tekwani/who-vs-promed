The following serologic information might contribute to the current
discussion about the efficacy of this year's influenza vaccine. We would
also like to echo earlier comments that it is not unusual to see influenza
in vaccinated persons especially those who are frail, elderly and
institutionalized. Staff immunization should be emphasized.
This year in British Columbia, we have done a study involving serologic
testing for antibody to H1N1, H3N2 and B influenza antigens following
vaccination. We have done serology at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks post
vaccine in elderly, non-institutionalized patients. We have so far found
the proportion of patients with serologic evidence of protection (i.e.
serum haemagglutination inhibition levels of 40 or above) as follows:
H1N1 H3N2 B
Baseline (30) 47% 27% 20%
6 weeks (59) 73% 69% 23%
12 weeks (28) 57% 46% 11%
This information is very preliminary and we are awaiting further results.
It is not known to what extent serologic evidence correlates with disease
protection. However, response to the B component does not appear good
while response to the A component is within the expected range. Our
influenza vaccine this year included A/Sydney/5/97, A/Beijing/262/95 and
B/Harbin/7/94. B/Harbin has been a vaccine component for the past 5 years
in Canada.
Most influenza illness reported in our province to date has been influenza
A. There may be some underreporting of B since illness with B tends to be
milder. Either way, serologic response to the B component of this year's
vaccine perhaps warrants further review.

[Vaccine-induced serologic titers, especially if in lower ranges like 40 or
less to circulating influenza viruses (HI titers), may not correlate well
with protection from infection or severe disease. Moreover, as noted in
recent postings, both vaccine "take" and protection after developing a
vaccine-induced serologic response may be partly determined by other
factors such as age. But very low prevalence rates of antibody within a
few months of influenza vaccination (e.g., 11 per cent to influenza B)
would seem abnormally low even in elderly populations. - Mod.DM
