Emergency measures to save spring lambs by allowing farmers to move
sheep, trapped in fields by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) controls, were
announced by the Government yesterday as the epidemic continued to
tighten its grip.
As the number of confirmed cases in the United Kingdom rose to 127, an
increase of 20 on the previous day, Jim Scudamore, the Government's Chief
Veterinary Officer, admitted farms had been hit by a "second wave" of
infection. Sheep and cattle which had been infected with the disease by
earlier known victims were only now showing symptoms.
Mr Scudamore said control orders and the movement of livestock which were
due to end on Friday would have to be extended for an indefinite period.
The number of cattle and sheep and pigs culled or awaiting destruction rose
to more than 100 000. Asked whether the epidemic was now out of control Mr
Scudamore, who said the disease would be around for a long time, replied:
"It depends what you mean by out of control."
While the emergency ban on livestock movements imposed by the Government
at the start of the epidemic had stopped the widespread dispersal of the
disease, the virus was striking more animals within herds and flocks
connected in some way with the earliest outbreaks. These outbreaks are
believed to have been spread by sheep traded through a number of markets.
The earliest known cases of the disease were on a pig farm at
Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland. Large numbers of sheep had been moved
in the days before the outbreak was first spotted, and MAFF were still
tracing all of them. Mr Scudamore said: "There is no perception of how
much movement or mixing of sheep has gone on. The crucial question is are
there many more [undiscovered diseased farms and if so how many of these
are incubating the disease which we have not yet found. That's the
question which we accept we cannot answer."
Under the new animal welfare measures farmers will be able to apply for
licences to move pregnant stock in infected and controlled areas - but
not within a radius of about 2 miles (3 kilometres) of an infected farm.
Farmers and animal welfare organizations, including the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, had called for measures to protect
ewes and sows about to give birth. Many sheep and pigs need to be moved
to sheltered quarters to ensure their offspring are kept warm to enable
farmers and vets to give speedy assistance.
The new licences will cover the movement of animals up to just 0.5km in
cases such as moving dairy cattle and of no more than 5km for pregnant
ewes. Ben Gill, president of the National farmers' Union of England and
Wales, welcomed the new animal measures. "The decision will allow some
desperate farmers to move animals to fresh pastures or gather in sheep
from remote fields for lambing."
An emergency maternity unit for ewes was set up in a catering marquee in
a field in Northamptonshire yesterday. Last night the first of 60 ewes
belonging to Philip Bott of Cold Ashby, near Northampton, was in the last
stages of labor. The marquee is expected to be full of lambs within days.

Farm leaders are urging the slaughter and disposal of animals affected by
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) to be speeded up, as the number of new cases
shows no signs of easing. The National Farmers' Union says some of its
members have waited for days before Ministry of Agriculture officials
arrived to oversee the destruction of
potentially infectious livestock.
Confirmed cases were climbing again on Saturday, with the total reaching
139 by the evening.
The government's chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said the speed
and scale of the infection had come as a shock. "It is a very rapid spread
throughout the whole country," Mr Scudamore said, noting well over a 100
cases had now been confirmed in only a fortnight.
Junior agriculture minister Baroness Hayman said a scheme for rendering
rather than burning carcasses on farms was now operational, using a single
plant in Cheshire. But MAFF dismissed fears of moving infected carcasses to
the rendering plant could mean the contagious disease spreading to areas
previously unaffected. A spokesman said: "These are sealed leak-proof
lorries [trucks being used - if there was a risk we wouldn't be doing it."
New cases were confirmed on Saturday at 4 farms in Cumbria, 3 in Scotland,
2 in Devon, 2 in Co Durham and 1 in Anglesey, bringing the day's total to
12. Friday was the worst day yet in terms for confirmed outbreaks, with 20
new cases announced by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF). The tally shattered hopes the disease, which typically has a 14 day
incubation period, would peak by Thursday.
It is now thought the virus is being harbored by sheep, in which it is more
difficult to spot than in cattle or pigs.
According to the latest MAFF figures, the total number of animals facing
slaughter is now 114 000, of which 82 000 have already been killed.

[Although we all applaud the humane acts of assisting the birthing animals,
the larger issue appears to be the continuing outbreak of the disease. The
second article indicates there is a a delay between diagnosis and
termination/incineration of the animals. Outbreaks will continue as long
there is this delay. During '67-'68 outbreak, we only turned the corner
when the majority of herds were killed THE SAME day as
diagnosis. If you wait, the herd/flock is still pumping out virus,
infecting others. This is very important. My thanks to Dr. Hugh-Jones for
his insight with this disease. - Mod.TG
