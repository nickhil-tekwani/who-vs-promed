Mexico: Outbreak of Varicella (Chickenpox) in Yucatan State
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of varicella [chickenpox] that so far has affected more
than 1000 persons, both children and adults, has placed the health
authorities of the state of Yucatan on alert, as they face the risk
of acute dissemination of the disease over the coming weeks.
Jose Pereira Carcano, Health Secretary, indicated that to date, 1060
cases of the disease have been reported throughout the state, a
number more than 100 percent higher than that registered during the
same period in 2003.
In addition, over the past few weeks, health officials have detected
rotavirus infection in some 30 people as well as 8 cases of dengue
fever, one of which was of the haemorrhagic type. These findings have
contributed to the concern expressed by health authorities.
