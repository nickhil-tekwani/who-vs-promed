Pakistan, Oman, Brazil and South Africa [and other countries -
Mod.DHA] are facing similar problems of severe crop losses due to
mango sudden death syndrome [MSDS]. The disease has wiped out
thousands of mango trees in all these countries, causing reduction in
production and threatening ancient valuable mango germplasm.

Collective and constant efforts to examine and identify genetically
resistant germplasm are needed, as stated by Iqrar Ahmad Khan,
University of Agriculture Faisalabad. A collaboration of University
of Agriculture Faisalabad, Bahuddin Zakariya University Multan and
Sultan Qaboos University Oman [was set up] to characterise the
indigenous mango germplasm for MSDS resistance and other potential
economic traits.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits
worldwide. Sudden decline (or quick decline, sudden wilt) is of great
economic importance since the trees die within a very short time. The
fungi _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ or/and _Ceratocystis fimbriata_ have
been reported to be associated with this disease in different areas.
Recently, 2 additional new fungal species were identified in affected
trees in Oman and the United Arab Emirates: _C. manginecans_ and _C.
omanensis_ (ProMED-mail post 20091214.4240).

It has been suggested that nutrient deficiencies and environmental
stress factors may increase the susceptibility of mango trees to
sudden decline. Bark beetles (_Hypocryphalus mangiferae_) were
previously shown to carry _C. fimbriata_ and _L. theobromae_ and are
also thought to be responsible for transmitting the new species.

Some fungicides were found to be helpful if applied quickly enough,
but genetic resistance is considered the best means of disease
management. Control programmes established in Oman use exotic
rootstocks from various countries with degrees of resistance to
sudden decline which are grafted with scions of local varieties. It
is hoped that this will produce trees suitable to local conditions
but showing resistance to the pathogens. Screening of indigenous
germplasm, as in the project described above, will be an important
means of finding possible genetic resistance in mango varieties for
breeding and/or use as rootstocks.
