1st report of Barley yellow mosaic virus in barley in Spain
-----------------------------------------------------------

Filippo Re 8, 40126-Bologna, Italy. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 105, published
online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0105A, 2005. Accepted for publication 7 Sep 2004.
Recently, the presence of Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV) and the weakly
serological detection of Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) were reported
in Spain (1); both viruses are members of the genus Bymovirus (family
_Potyviridae_). Random and symptomatic surveys were conducted during
February and March of 2003 in barley fields in north eastern Spain to
determine the occurrence of BaMMV and BaYMV.
Leaves from 316 samples collected in 15 fields were analyzed using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with commercial antisera specific
for BaYMV and BaMMV (Loewe Biochemica, Munich) as well as antisera against
both viruses (provided by T Klumen). Positive ELISA samples were further
analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
with specific primers that amplify 445 bp of BaMMV (1) and 433 bp of BaYMV (2).
Complete agreement was observed between the ELISA and RT-PCR results. Mixed
infections of BaYMV and BaMMV were detected in 10 samples, BaYMV in 5
samples and BaMMV in 3 samples. Samples positive for both viruses that
exhibited clear mosaic symptoms were collected in 2 fields.
RT-PCR products from 5 BaYMV-infected samples were cloned and sequenced and
showed 96 to 98 per cent identity to BaYMV isolates previously reported
from Europe (Genbank Accession Nos. AJ1515479-85 and X95695-7) and 92 to 95
per cent identity with isolates reported from Asia (GenBank Accession Nos.
AB023585-96, AJ132268, AJ224619-22, AJ224624-28, AF536944-46, AF536948-58,
D01091, D00544, and Z24677). Sequence identity of Spanish isolates was 96
to 99 per cent.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BaYMV infecting barley in Spain
and illustrates the association of both Bymoviruses infecting barley.

[BaYMV and Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV) are transmitted by the
soil-inhabiting and spore-forming bacillus _Polymyxa graminis_. Both
viruses occur on barley in Europe and Asia and are economically important,
soilborne pathogens of winter barley. Until recently, laboratory diagnosis
of these pathogens has relied upon ELISA using polyclonal antiserum.
Because of inherent virus particle instability, combined with the inability
to sap-transmit BaYMV, high quality antiserum has been difficult to obtain
and ELISA is often unsatisfactory. As an alternative approach, 2 TaqMan
assays (1 BaYMV-specific and the other BaMMV-specific) have been developed.
These assays have been validated for 3 seasons, by testing samples in
parallel with ELISA. TaqMan assays are a more reliable detection method
than ELISA, especially with late-season and mixed infection samples. Both
fungi acquire the viruses following encystment on host roots, which then
germinate to form a pre-penetration swelling termed an adhesorium. The
protoplast is "injected" into the plant host cell by a bullet-like
mechanism, causing infection in the root. The protoplast then grows into a
multinucleate plasmodium which eventually converts into a sporangium to
release further zoospores. As an alternative, the multinucleate plasmodium
can convert into numerous thick-walled resting spores which are released
when the host cells decay and can survive as an inoculum pool for many
years in soil.
