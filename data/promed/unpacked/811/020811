In the past 2 months, a total of 36 patients with Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been admitted to Herat Regional Hospital, 4 of whom have died to date. Compared to the same period in the past year, the number of cases this year [2018] has doubled. Distress sales of livestock due to the ongoing drought are suspected to be partly responsible for the higher number of CCHF cases. WHO will hold case management trainings for 160 health workers.

[ProMED-mail thanks G. Folkers for this important update on CCHF cases in Afghanistan during the last 2 months in Herat region.

It is indeed a cause of concern that the number of cases has increased, with 4 fatal cases. Even though, traditionally, the number of CCHF cases increases corresponding with the increase in tick activity in summer months, these case numbers from one region makes one wonder about the situation in other endemic regions of the country. The planned training on case management mentioned in the report can be very helpful in treating CCHF cases once they have presented at a health facility. Among the preventive measures that the general public and high-risk groups may be advised to take is to protect themselves from tick bites and the blood or tissues of infested animals. - Mod.UBA
