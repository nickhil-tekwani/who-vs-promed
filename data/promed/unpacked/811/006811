The discovery of 5 cases of hepatitis A at a Bronx restaurant have alarmed Health Department officials, who are urging other patrons of the restaurant to seek medical attention as soon as possible.

One employee and 4 patrons at New Hawaii Sea Restaurant in the Bronx have reportedly been diagnosed with hepatitis A [virus infection]. The New York City Health Department is warning people who ate at the restaurant's 1475 Williamsbridge Road location between 7-19 Sep 2013 to get a hepatitis A vaccine as soon as possible. If people are vaccinated within 14 days of exposure, vaccination can prevent the disease from occurring.

They said those who consumed food from the restaurant through catering or delivery should also seek a vaccine, and all leftover food should be discarded immediately.

Hepatitis A is contracted by consuming food contaminated by someone with the infection. Symptoms of a hepatitis A infection include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea. People typically develop symptoms about one month after being infected, the Health Department said, though it can be as soon as 15 days or take as long as 50 days.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

According to the World Health Organisation, hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Hepatitis A viruses can persist in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens.

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. In developed countries with good sanitary and hygienic conditions, infection rates are low, but disease may occur among adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, such as injecting-drug users, men who have sex with men, people travelling to areas of high endemicity, and in isolated populations such as closed religious communities. However, recently, ProMED-mail reported a hepatitis A outbreak associated with a restaurant in New Hampshire, and this may become an additional occasional route of infection.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Nearly 100 percent of people develop protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a single dose of the vaccine. Even after exposure to the virus, a single dose of the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects. Still, manufacturers recommend 2 vaccine doses to ensure a longer-term protection of about 5 to 8 years after vaccination.
