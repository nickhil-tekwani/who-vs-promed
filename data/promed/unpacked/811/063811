4 members of a family in Viet Nam's Mekong Delta
are being tested for possible avian influenza
after being hospitalized with symptoms similar to
the disease, a health official said on Sat 30 Dec
2006. [Symptoms of avian flu are no different
from those of human flu; what raised the red flag
here was the history of eating a chicken that had
died a few days earlier -- see below. - Mod.JW]
Test results would not be available for a week,
but if positive for the H5N1 virus, the family
would be the 1st human cases of bird flu in Viet
Nam for more than a year following a resurgence
of the disease in domestic poultry.
The 37-year-old mother and her 3 sons are in
stable condition, according to Dr. To Van Man,
director of emergency department of a medical
centre in southern Ca Mau province. "They have
been treated in isolation since admission," Man
said. "We have treated them with Tamiflu although
we are not sure if they have bird flu." [Tamiflu
is also effective against human flu if administered early enough. - Mod.JW] .
The mother told doctors that her family had eaten
a chicken that had died of an unknown disease 4
days before her oldest son, age 13, fell ill with
high fever and trouble breathing. She and her
younger sons, ages 7 and 3, became sick soon after.
Vietnam has seen 42 people die of bird flu --
which is caught from close contact with sick
poultry ï¿½- since 2003. The country had driven the
disease into remission through an aggressive
poultry vaccination programme, but last week
officials confirmed it had returned in 3
provinces including Ca Mau, 250 kilometres south of Ho Chi Minh City
At least 160 [157 according to WHO as of 27 Dec
2006 - Mod.CP] people worldwide have died of the
H5N1 virus, which has sparked concern for its
potential to become into a widespread human
disease. At this moment, the H5N1 virus is not
easily contagious among people, but scientists
are watching it closely and say that if the virus
is left unchecked, it could mutate to allow human-to-human transmission.
There is no human vaccine for H5N1, but poultry
can be inoculated and international health
experts have recommended trying to contain the
virus in poultry so it does not have a chance to
adapt to infect humans more easily.

6 people were isolated under suspicion of bird
flu infection in the Mekong Delta's Ca Mau and
Soc Trang provinces, all of them reportedly had
eaten chickens, said local health officials on Fri 20 Dec 2006.
Huynh Trung Kien, acting manager of Ca Mau's
health department said 4 cases, all in a family
in Nam Can district, were hospitalized with
symptoms like coughs and high fever after they
consumed chickens last week. The victims were
immediately quarantined with their samples
submitted to laboratory for testing, Kien said.
Nguyen Huu Minh, deputy head of the animal health
department of Soc Trang reported 2 people in My
Tu district had difficulty breathing after eating
chicken. He added bird flu had yet to spread to
Soc Trang and the patients had reportedly eaten
healthy poultry. Minh said the results from tests
run on the 2 had not yet been received.
To date, bird flu [in poultry] has resurfaced in
10 Vietnamese communes in 6 districts in Ca Mau,
Bac Lieu and Hau Giang provinces.

[The reappearance of avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus in Viet Nam and the resurgence of poultry
disease after more than a year of absence has
been an unwelcome and discouraging event. The
appearance of suspected human cases in 1 of the 3
provinces currently suffering outbreaks of H5N1
disease in poultry (and one other with as yet no
reported poultry cases) is an even greater
misfortune for a country that had uniquely
achieved success in eradicating the disease from
both poultry and the human population. - Mod.CP/JW]
