New York crow die-off linked to avian virus
-------------------------------------------
A mysterious die-off of hundreds of crows throughout New York state
has been linked to the avian reovirus, a pathogen that has threatened
the poultry industry in the past, relentlessly sweeping through
flocks, state wildlife officials said Thursday [3 Jan 2008].
The virus is a bird pathogen and is not likely to jump the species
barrier to cause infections in humans. However, state health
officials are taking no chances and scientists at Wadsworth
Laboratory, a division of the State Health Department, are studying the virus.
State wildlife pathologist Ward Stone, who was instrumental nearly a
decade ago in identifying the pathogen that turned out to be the West
Nile virus, said the sudden sweep of death among crows has caught
scientists by surprise.
"Initially, I didn't know what it was," Stone told Newsday Thursday.
"You really don't know until you do the post-mortem examinations," he
said, which include preliminary viral typing. Additional specimens
are being sent to a federal wildlife laboratory in Madison, WI, which
is expected to provide further molecular details about the strain.
"It's causing necrotizing enteritis," Stone said, referring to a
severe hemorrhagic intestinal disorder that leaves few survivors. The
virus is feared by executives in the broiler chicken industry, which
produces most of the poultry sold in the United States. Epidemics
have swept through flocks, destroying potential profits.
Stone added that various reovirus strains have been identified in the
United States and Canada in recent years but only a small number of
crows in New York contracted the virus and died.
Now, a dramatic shift in viral spread, which became most noticeable
shortly after Christmas, has all the makings of a bird epidemic.
Crows not only have died but sometimes have succumbed in large
groups. Stone suspects when temperatures warm, as expected next week,
causing snow to melt in many upstate communities, more dead crows
will be found.
So far, dead crows have been found in Albany, Dutchess, Jefferson,
Montgomery, Orange and Steuben counties. The largest number of dead
birds -- about 100 -- have been found in Poughkeepsie [see map at end].
Stone said it's only a matter of time before dead crows are spotted
on Long Island as well as in Queens and Manhattan. He also suspects
the infection will sweep into Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Health officials on Long Island have not found anything suspicious.
Wendy Ladd, spokeswoman for the Suffolk County Health Department,
said communities are already aware that dead crows are to be reported
because of the summertime spread of West Nile disease.
"We have not seen any increase in dead crows," Ladd said yesterday.
"We have a bird hotline for people to call and we haven't gotten any
calls about it."
Cynthia Brown, spokeswoman for the Nassau County Health Department,
also reported silent hot lines. "I have not heard any unusual crow
kill-offs," she said.
Crows, Stone said, tend to live in the winter in large social groups
composed of many smaller families and individual birds. Wintertime
clustering helps explain why so many crows are dying simultaneously.
Crows tend to live in small families during other seasons.
No other types of birds have been affected, but state biologists are
monitoring ravens, magpies and blue jays, which are closely related
to crows and have similar nesting habits.

[Poultry producers are certainly hoping this virus does not spread to
their operations. If these were poultry, there are methods of
prevention and control, but with wild birds, those methods do not seem
appropriate. - Mod.TG
