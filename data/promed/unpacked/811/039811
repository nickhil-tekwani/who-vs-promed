The Health Ministry announced on Mon 31 May 2021 that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a zoonotic virus, had claimed 13 lives across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic so far this year [2021]. The ministry noted that the fatality rate from the tickborne disease had noticeably dropped to 3.28% last year [2020], from 5.64% in 2018.

The ministry's figures, quoted by Anadolu Agency (AA), show 243 cases reported this year [2021] across the country.

CCHF is a widespread disease that is caused by a tickborne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family that results in severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Animals are carriers, and tick bites or contact with blood or body fluid from an infected person or animal can spread the virus. Common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, general body pain, and fatigue.

Personal protection measures are vital for disease control. The disease is common in more than 30 countries, particularly in the Middle East, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. The Health Ministry says up to 25% of those infected with the virus contract the disease in other countries, and in some, it is up to 80%, while it is only up to 5% in Turkey. CCHF cases are concentrated in the northern parts of central Anatolia, where the country's agricultural hubs are located, in the central areas of the Black Sea region at the north of the country, and north of the eastern Anatolia region.

The Health Ministry has guidelines in place for health care staff tackling cases, while a monitoring system tracks patients and ensures proper isolation. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also runs programs to eradicate the tick population in provinces where clusters of cases are reported. The government also conducts awareness campaigns in rural areas where cases are more common to inform citizens about the disease, how to protect themselves from CCHF, and other measures they can take.

Experts urge people to wear protective clothing, covering all bare parts of the body, and to avoid areas with a risk of ticks, such as farms, orchards, forests, picnic spots, fields, etc. It is recommended to tuck trousers into socks while going to such places. It is also recommended to wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.

Experts say the body should be checked for ticks after returning from high-risk areas, and the tick should be removed with the aid of a glove or similar material instead of bare hands. If it cannot be removed, the nearest hospital or clinic should be visited.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered to be one of the major emerging disease threats spreading to and within the European Union following an expanding distribution of its main vector, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_. The first detection of CCHF cases in Turkey was in 2002; since then, more than 9700 cases have been reported, with an overall mortality rate just under 5%. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Covid-19 & CCHF coinfection

A female patient made Turkish medical history as the 1st patient to be infected with both the coronavirus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a zoonotic virus, at the same time. She also managed to recover. The woman, in her 60s, was recently admitted to the hospital at Karadeniz Technical University (KTU) in the northern province of Trabzon. She had symptoms including high fever, fatigue, and respiratory failure. Experts say though rare, it may become more common as the coronavirus pandemic continues, along with CCHF, which killed 13 people across the country this year [2021].

Professor Selcuk Kaya, head of the infectious diseases department at the university, says they were double-checking patients who had both the coronavirus and the tickborne disease, noting that both show similar symptoms.

"The patient was admitted 10 days ago with a preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19. We were already on alert for CCHF as this is a region where CCHF cases are common, especially in high-altitude areas in the (regional) provinces of Gumushane, Bayburt and Giresun. When she was diagnosed with both, we launched a treatment process, 1st for COVID-19 and then supportive therapy for CCHF. In 10 days, her blood levels and overall health were back to normal, and she did not need intensive care," Kaya said.

Kaya said it was inevitable to come across such a case when both diseases were prevalent in the region but that it was important to diagnose it correctly. "Without extra attention, she would be applied treatment only for COVID-19," he added.

[SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus of around 30 kb and is classified to B coronaviruses. On the other hand, CCHF, caused by a single-strand, enveloped RNA virus belonging to the genus _Orthonairovirus_ in the family Nairoviridae, is a zoonotic viral disease and is transmitted to people through a tick bite. However, transmission via the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons can also be seen.

Fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgia, petechia, and ecchymosis are common clinical presentations of CCHF, whereas fever, dry cough, weakness, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell are common symptoms of COVID-19. CCHF results in hemorrhage, while COVID-19 can cause thrombosis [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266772/].

Coinfections with the 2 viruses have not been documented or reported before, but CCHF should be considered in differential diagnoses, particularly in COVID-19 cases in endemic regions. - Mod.UBA
