Summary
-------
Parapoxviruses are a genus of the double-stranded DNA family of
poxviruses that infect ruminants, and zoonotic transmission to humans
often results from occupational exposures. Parapoxvirus infection in
humans begins with an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, followed by
the development of one or more erythematous maculopapular lesions that
evolve over the course of several weeks into nodules. In 2009,
parapoxvirus infection was diagnosed in 2 deer hunters in the eastern
United States after the hunters had field-dressed [removed the
entrails from] white-tailed deer. We describe the clinical and
pathological features of these infections and the phylogenetic
relationship of a unique strain of parapoxvirus to other
parapoxviruses. Deer populations continue to increase, leading to the
possibility that there will be more deer-associated parapoxvirus
infections.

[The infections described in the 2 case reports are molecularly
confirmed human parapoxvirus infections linked to deer exposure in the
United States. DNA sequence analysis of the virus infecting these
hunters suggests that the causative agent is a novel parapoxvirus and
phylogenetic analysis clearly differentiated these isolates from the
better known orf virus.

The authors in their discussion note that parapoxviruses cause
infections in ruminants (sheep, goats, and cattle) throughout the
world. Proliferative dermatitis develops in the mouth, teats, and skin
of infected animals. Parapoxvirus infections can be fatal in young
animals. Humans can become infected with parapoxviruses after direct
contact with infected animals, and fomites might also lead to human
infection. Parapoxvirus species that affect humans typically vary
according to the host; orf virus infection occurs in sheep and goats
and bovine papular stomatitis and pseudocowpox virus infection occur
in cattle. There are also several other parapoxviruses that affect
species other than common domestic ruminants. Parapoxviruses have been
isolated from red deer in New Zealand and from reindeer in northern
Europe. Human infection from cervid-borne parapoxviruses has rarely
been reported.

The authors comment further that remarkably the number of white-tailed
deer [the source of this new parapoxvirus] in the United States has
risen dramatically during the 20th century, from fewer than 500 000 in
1900 to more than 18 million in 1992. There are more than 10 million
deer hunters in the United States, and as human exposure to deer has
increased, so has the emergence of deer-associated zoonotic
infections. - Mod.CP]
