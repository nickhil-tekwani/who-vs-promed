Utah: first case of hantavirus infection in 2003
------------------------------------------------
A 40 year old man from Millard County has contracted hantavirus
[infection], the first case in the state this year, health officials said
on Tue 22 Apr 2003. The man lives in the central Utah town of Hinckley and
became ill last week after sweeping his garage and spending several hours
restoring an antique automobile. Blood tests confirmed the case late on Fri
18 Apr 2003, stated Robert Resendes of the Central Utah Public Health
Department. "His head was in this old car. He was in there vacuuming and
working on a really old car with his son," Resendes said. "I'd put my money
on that one" as source of the virus exposure.
Humans get the virus through rodent feces and urine that become airborne --
often in confined, dusty spaces such as sheds or garages. His son has shown
no signs of [hantavirus infection]. The man was breathing with help from a
ventilator at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, but is expected to be
removed from the machine today and will probably make a full recovery,
Resendes said.
Hantavirus has been found in 11 of the state's 23 counties, but generally
does not appear until the weather is warmer. "This is a little early,"
Resendes said. "I don't know what is going on." Hantavirus has been inhaled
and diagnosed in about 280 Americans, 38 per cent of whom have died. Of
Utah's 29 confirmed hantavirus cases since 1959, 7 people [24 per cent]
have died, according to Resendes.
Patients also can catch the virus by touching their nose or mouth after
handling materials contaminated with the virus or through an infected
rodent's bite. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and
occasionally nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The primary symptom,
Resendes said, is difficulty breathing, which is caused by fluid building
up in the lungs. Symptoms of hantavirus infection usually appear within 2
weeks of infection, but can show up as early as 3 days or as late as 6
weeks after infection.
"All we can offer is supportive treatment," Resendes said. "You can only
keep the person oxygenated." According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the best way to prevent hantavirus [infection] is to
avoid areas known to be infested with rodents. When cleaning mouse
droppings, spray them first with a solution of household bleach and water,
and wear rubber gloves and a mask.

[Previous cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Utah, when laboratory
data have been reported, have been attributed to Sin Nombre hantavirus
infection. Confirmation of the diagnosis in this new case in Utah would be
a matter of general interest. - Mod.CP]
