Viet Nam: Death of Cambodian Woman Attributed to Avian Influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------
A Cambodian woman became the first person confirmed to have died from avian
influenza outside Vietnam [or Thailand] in an outbreak that has killed 13
people in a month, a doctor said on Monday [31 Jan 2005]. The 25-year-old
woman who died on Saturday in a Vietnamese hospital tested positive for the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus, said Phan Van Tu, a doctor at the Pasteur
Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, where the test was conducted. Relatives had
reported dead poultry in her village and her brother died 4 days earlier
with similar symptoms, but no tests were done on him, he said.

Cambodia: Notification of Cause of Death Not Yet Received
---------------------------------------------------------
A Cambodian official said his government has yet to receive word from Viet
Nam about a Cambodian [woman reported to have] died of avian influenza, as
a local newspaper reported the woman's brother had died of similar symptoms.
"We are contacting the Vietnamese authorities about the case, but we have
not yet received any official information," said San Vanthy, an agriculture
official responsible for monitoring bird flu. "We have sent officials to
the area to monitor and we have banned imports of poultry throughout the
area," he said.
The woman from Cambodia's Kampot province along the Vietnamese border died
of [suspected] avian influenza on 30 Jan 2005, two days after being
admitted to Vietnam's southern Kien Giang provincial hospital. The Cambodia
Daily quoted the woman's father as saying that her 14-year-old brother had
died in mid-January with similar symptoms, and that other members of the
family were suffering from high fevers and respiratory problems. "In
December my chickens, about 50 --- 5 hens and the rest chicks --- fell sick
for a few hours and then died," the woman's father, told the newspaper. "2
or 3 died every day. The dying period was 20 days, ending in early January
[2005]," he said. Then his son, became sick and went to a doctor for
treatment, but did not recover, [the father] told the paper. When his
daughter fell ill, he said he took her to Viet Nam for treatment, but she
died in hospital.
Cambodia has not officially announced any outbreaks of the virus infection
so far this year.

Cambodia: Official Confirmation of Cause of Death Not Yet Received from
Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cambodian government is still not sure on Tuesday [1 Feb 2005] whether
the woman who died in Viet Nam had contracted avian influenza; "We are
contacting the Vietnamese about the case, but we have not yet received any
official information," San Vanthy, an agriculture official responsible for
monitoring bird flu. The government has also sent officials to the village
to investigate and determine the facts.
If confirmed, the woman would be the 1st person killed by the H5N1 poultry
virus in Cambodia. The 25-year-old woman from Cambodia's Kampot province
along the border with Viet Nam died on 30 Jan 2005, two days after
undergoing treatment in Viet Nam's Kaing Eang provincial hospital.
Moreover, the woman's 14-year-old brother had also died on 21 Jan 2005
after suffering avian influenza-like symptoms and that other members of the
family are currently suffering from high fever and respiratory problems,
according to local media reports on on Tuesday [1 Feb 2005]..
The Cambodian government banned the import of poultry and poultry products
from Viet Nam and Thailand on 31 Dec 2004, as avian influenza continues to
kill people in the 2 countries. And officials were asked to be extra
careful when examining livestock and related products.

[It is likely that 3 members of a Cambodian family have contracted avian
influenza from an outbreak of avian influenza in a region of Cambodia close
to the border with Viet Nam. All 3 died and the eldest who was treated in a
hospital in Viet Nam is reported to have tested H5N1 virus positive.
However, the details remain confused and official confirmation of positive
identification of avian influenza virus (H5N1) in the 25-year-old Cambodian
woman at the centre of the reports appears not to have been communicated to
the Cambodian authorities. - Mod.CP]
