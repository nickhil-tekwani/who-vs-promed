Epidemiological team set up to look into source of brucellosis outbreak in
Cornwall
--------------------------------------------------
A specialist epidemiological team has been set up by the new Chief
Veterinary Officer Dr Debby Reynolds to look into the source of the
brucellosis outbreak in Cornwall.
The team, led by veterinary epidemiologist Professor John Wilesmith,
includes specialists in surveillance and epidemiology from both the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency and Defra. The team will supplement and
support the existing local epidemiological investigation team that has been
working on the outbreak since it was first disclosed in March 2004.
Defra today announced the lifting of the final movement restrictions on
neighbouring holdings in Cornwall after the last tests on a batch of cows
in the south east of the county were found to be negative.
The premises of origin of the reactor bull -- suspected as the source of
the outbreak -- have been tested, with negative results.
The specialist group will liaise closely with the State Veterinary Service
and will look at the history of the herd breakdown, the full tracing
results and imports.
Dr Reynolds said it was vital that no stone was left unturned in attempting
to find the source of the outbreak following the 1st confirmed case of
brucellosis in England since 1993.
"While we are delighted to be able to remove the movement restrictions
imposed on neighbouring holdings, the backward and forward tracings of
animals that left the infected herd have not revealed the source of the
outbreak. The small epidemiological team will look at the brucellosis
testing history of the infected herd, the relationship between cows, bulls,
and youngstock, cattle movements on and off over the past 2 years, any
known unrecorded cattle movements, the herd's breeding programme, and any
unusual mixing of livestock.
"We are also continuing to look at imports of stock into Devon and Cornwall
over the past 3 years," she added.

[In ProMED-mail's initial posting on the brucellosis outbreak in Cornwall
(20040319.0761), DEFRA informed the detection of 5 "reactors" in a 35-cow
herd, near Liskeard; it further stated: "[the herd] has been under
restriction since unexplained abortions were reported in the herd earlier
in March 2004. Further serological results are expected from the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, very shortly. The 5 reactors will be culled
and if the laboratory culture results are positive, the whole herd will be
slaughtered".
Since the news release above does not include information on the mentioned
laboratory culture results, ProMED-mail contacted DEFRA for clarifications.
The following information has been immediately received from Dr Alick
Simmons, Head of Veterinary Endemic Diseases and Zoonoses Division, Animal
Health and Welfare Directorate General, DEFRA:
"The whole herd was slaughtered on the strength of a _Brucella abortus_
biovar 1 isolate from one of the aborting cows. 3 other cows aborted with
culture positive vaginal swabs or foetal stomach contents. Culture results
are awaited from the remainder of the slaughtered animals including the bull.
The confusion might arise from the fact that we slaughtered the 4 cows and
a bull as reactors before we confirmed infection. That is quite normal and
in accordance with practice: we slaughter some 30 CFT and ELISA reactors
per year, which after slaughter turn out to be false-positive,
culture-negative reactors.
The bull in question was traced back to its herd of origin and that herd
was restricted and tested. The results of the source herd are clear and
restrictions have been lifted. Further investigations into the source are
underway".
We are most grateful to Dr Simmons for his kind, authoritative
clarification and look forward to the results of the enquiry by the
specialist epidemiological team. - Mod.AS]
