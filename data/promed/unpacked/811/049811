The cloning of people is an ethical question which will doubtless and
correctly be the subject of new laws in most countries.
The cloning of plants is not really a problem since we are essentially
doing this already. Most plants within a variety are so genetically
similar that the quoted worry about disease actually happens. The
extensive use of a single superior variety in wheat has resulted in
severe disease (eg yellow rust in wheat) outbreaks in the UK about every
decade. These days, these are relatively easily controlled with
pesticides. However, since there are many varieties, it is easy to
switch production the following year.
The cloning of animals is, I agree, potentially hazardous. In practice
for short lived species, such as poultry, we are there already and the
damage is as limited as it is with plants. Pigs may follow suit in due
course, but most likely [only] as boars and/or semen, which at least
maintains some genetic diversity. Pigs already have different boar lines
for sows (breeding) vs animals destined for fattening.
Cattle, with their slow breeding and multiple breeding criteria, are
unlikely to be cloned for commercial production precisely due to the
fears expressed above. However I would not be surprised to find bulls
produced with multiple advantages inserted genetically. For biochemical
production units, where an animal expresses, say, factor 8 in the milk,
cloning would be very useful.
Cattle breeding is not quite as straightforward as one might imagine.
The target is a healty, long lived, fertile and efficient animal.
Unfortunately many disadvantageous traits only appear after the animal
is over 5 years old. So a predisposition to bad udders, mastitis, bad
feet etc can seriously affect a herd if a bull is selected that throws
these traits before they are identified (common). Consequently cattle
farmers (particularly dairy ones) like to spread the risk and often
change semen annually as well as using several different sources. It is
for this reason that I suspect significant genetic manipulation will be
a long time comming for cattle.

Another side of the issue is to consider why we would want genetically
identical individuals (rodents or whatever) for pharmaceutical/ chemical
testing when we would then not understand the adverse side affects or even
be able to develop an appropriate treatment for a genetically diverse
population.
Even if there were genetically engineered races of people, what about those
that are genetically diverse? Would that group of people/animals no longer
benefit from treatments or would there even be any existing treatments [for
such genetically diverse people-mod. pc]? Would we be able to recognize a
disease/illness in a biologically diverse population if we persist in
studying it in a genetically homogenous population?
I think that these and a multitude of other questions concerning medical
issues for both human and animal populations should be carefully considered
before any cloning is really unleashed on an unsuspecting world. This
smacks a lot of how Hitler wanted to take over the world. Are we simply
providing some genius/lunatic with the ability?

I can't help observing that, in the spirit of robbing Peter to pay Paul,
the recent successes in mammalian cloning, the ethical issues
notwithstanding, must provide solace to those concerned about declining
human sperm counts.
