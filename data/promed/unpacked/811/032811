The link to the Clinical Infectious Diseases publication requested by Dr
Teguh Prajitno in the ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human
(92): Indonesia, serosurvey 20070605.1821", which relates to the
methodology of determining antibody titers, is the following:
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/issues/v45n1/50338/50338.html>).
The publication by Myers and colleagues in the 1 Jul [2007] issue of
Clinical Infectious Diseases described the use of a micro-neutralization
assay based on that reported by Rowe T, Abernathy RA, Hu-Primmer J, and
colleagues: Detection of antibody to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in human
serum using a combination of serologic assays. J Clin Microbiol 1999; 37:
937-43. Micro-neutralization assays were done to detect antibodies to H4-12
and hemagglutination inhibition (following the US Centers for Disease
Control-CDC protocol) was used for H5-7.
