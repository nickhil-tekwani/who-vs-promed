Six cases of tickborne encephalitis have been reported in Vologda, 4 in Sokolsky district, 2 in the Vozhega and Vytegorsky districts and single cases in the Vologda, Verhovazhskom, Gryazovets, and Kharovsk areas (that is, 18 in total). Another 26 people are under observation as suspected cases of tickborne encephalitis virus infection. In addition, during the same 6 month period, 94 cases of tickborne Lyme disease -- another disease that is transmitted by ticks -- were reported also. However, this figure is 37 per cent lower than that for the same period last year [2012].

Since the beginning of surveillance, 10 756 cases of tick bites have been recorded, 2738 of them involving children under 17 years of age. A total of 1929 people, including 442 children, have been vaccinated. Emergency administration of tickborne encephalitis virus immunoglobulin was provided for 2594 people, including 2272 children up to 17 years of age and 322 adults.

The Laboratories of Hygiene and Epidemiology for the Vologda region, located at Vologda City Hospital, have so far examined 1730 ticks, including 1285 removed from patients, and found tickborne encephalitis virus in 7 of them. In a survey of ticks in the environment (445 ticks), 10 were positive for tickborne encephalitis virus, whereas 77 of 117 samples were positive the Lyme borreliosis agent.

[It seems that Lyme disease is a greater problem in the region than tickborne encephalitis virus infection, possibly on account of the availability of an effective vaccine and specific immunoglobulin for protection against tickborne encephalitis virus infection.

The Vologdskaya oblast is a federal subject of Russia. Its administrative center is Vologda city. The oblast is rich in woodland and arable land. Large reserves of wood and fresh water are the main natural resources, hence the prevalence of ticks and the diseases they transmit. - Mod.CP
