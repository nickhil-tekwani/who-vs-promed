Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Nov 2019
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 82 / 3 / 0 / - / -
Affected population: Free-range pig farm with 11 breeding pigs (2 males and 9 females), 14 unweaned piglets and 57 fattening pigs. The farm is located on the edge of a forest; biosecurity conditions do not guarantee the absence of wild boar introduction.

Swine / 3.66 / 0 / 0 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: The disease was detected as a result of a planned surveillance in free-range farms. No animals have been introduced for more than 2 years (self-renewal of sows). No animals have gone out to other farms; they have only been sent to a slaughterhouse for direct meat sale to consumers. There are no swine farms within a 5-km (3.1 mi) radius around the farm. The probable origin of the contamination is the contact with wild boars.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: Disinfection; slaughter; ante- and post-mortem inspections.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Anses - Ploufragan-Plouzane-Niort Laboratory, Ploufragan site (regional reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / Competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 18 Dec 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
