Plague detected at Plumas Eureka State Park. No human cases detected so far
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plumas County Environmental Health reports that a rodent found in the
Plumas Eureka State Park area has tested positive for plague. This
report is the 1st sign of plague activity in Plumas County in many years.

Plumas County Environmental Health is working with the State
Vector-Borne Disease program and will be monitoring this situation.
Plague warnings will be posted in the Plumas Eureka State Park Area
and surrounding campgrounds. Additional surveillance activities will
also begin in these areas.

Plague is a highly infectious bacterial disease which primarily
affects rodents. Humans and their pets (dogs, and especially cats)
can get plague if they visit areas where wild rodents are infected.

"At the present time, there have been no cases of human plague in
Plumas County. However, it is vital that the disease be diagnosed and
treated in its early stages," states Dr Valeska Armisen, health
officer for Plumas County.

In humans, the initial symptoms of plague include fever, chills,
muscle aches, a feeling of weakness and, commonly, swollen and tender
lymph nodes. The usual incubation period is 2 to 6 days, but contact
a physician immediately if you become ill within 7 days of being in a
plague-affected area. Plague is curable when diagnosed early. You can
help with diagnosis by telling your doctor where you have been and
that you may have been exposed to plague.

People can get the disease from animals in several ways. The most
important route of transmission is through bites of fleas from
infected rodents, but direct contact with sick or dead animals should
also be avoided.

The most important wild rodents that can carry plague are squirrels
(especially ground squirrels), chipmunks, wood rats, mice, and
marmots. Plague is lethal to many rodents. Therefore, a sick or dead
rodent is a possible warning that plague may be in the area.

It is important to note that while it is not uncommon to find plague
in wild animals in Plumas County, no human cases have been confirmed
in several years. Nonetheless, Plumas County residents and guests are
urged to take the following general precautions to help prevent the
spread of plague:
- avoid all contact with rodents and their fleas. Do not touch sick
or dead rodents, but report them to campground hosts or park rangers
- do not camp, sleep or rest near animal burrows
- do not feed rodents in campgrounds and picnic areas. Store food and
refuse in rodent-proof containers
- wearing long pants tucked into boot tops can reduce your exposure
to fleas. Insect repellent sprayed on socks and trouser cuffs also may help
- leave pets at home if possible. If not, keep pet confined or on a
leash. Do not allow pet to approach sick or dead rodents or to
explore rodent burrows
