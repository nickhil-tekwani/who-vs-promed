Measles virus is continuing to circulate in France. Insufficient
children have been vaccinated, and the consequences have been
dramatic.

Measles is a highly contagious infection. Its progress had been
halted by vaccination, but new outbreaks have been detected recently.
The increase is alarming because 10 500 measles cases have been
reported since 2008, and 34 000 cases have been reported during the
1st 2 months of 2011.

The virus is spread by secretions from the nose and pharynx as a
result of sneezing and coughing, and only rarely from contaminated
surfaces. The incubation period lasts 10 days and is followed by
symptoms such as coughing, rhinitis or conjunctivitis. Measles is
mostly a childhood illness but infants and young adults are most
affected in the current outbreak, and it is in these age groups that
the disease can cause complications.

The measles epidemic is gaining ground in Switzerland. Since last
December 2010, 486 cases of measles have been reported in 20
districts. Among the reported cases, 9 percent of patients were
hospitalized, and 5 percent suffered from pneumonia.

Since last December 2010, 486 cases of measles were reported in 20
cantons. According to the Bulletin of the Federal Office of Public
Health (BAG), a comparison with 59 cases in the 1st 11 months of 2010
shows that we are dealing with a new epidemic of measles in
Switzerland. No fewer than 195 cases have been reported for the month
of April 2011, and already there have been 47 in early May 2011. The
regions most affected are Basel and surroundings with 63 cases and the
cantons of Geneva and Vaud, with 179 and 103 cases respectively,
partly related to imports from neighboring France, where a large
outbreak is rampant at present. The outbreaks in these 2 cantons are
still developing. Since last month [April 2011], the number of reports
of measles cases are also increasing in Eastern Switzerland. The
proportion of cases occurring in Eastern Switzerland rose from 10
percent in March to 35 percent in April 2011.

Among the cases reported since December 2010, 42 percent were in
people aged 20 years or more. 87 percent had not been vaccinated, and
7 percent were under-immunized. Nine percent of patients were
hospitalized, and 5 percent suffered from pneumonia. Two cases
illustrate the possible consequences of measles virus infection: a
pregnant woman who was unvaccinated transmitted the disease to her
newborn, and following a measles-related encephalitis, a 36-year-old
patient had to be treated for 2 months in a rehabilitation center .

NHS Warrington is urging patients under 25 who have missed their MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to see their GP, following a
recent confirmation of cases of measles in Cheshire.

There is an ongoing epidemic of measles in Europe, with the number of
confirmed cases in England and Wales rising sharply this year [2011].

Already this year [2011], there have been a similar number of cases
as the whole of last year.

The plea from NHS Warrington follows 2 confirmed cases -- both
children -- and a number of probable cases, reported in Cheshire in
the last few weeks. None of these patients had received the required 2
doses of the MMR vaccine. Dr Marioth Manche, deputy director of Public
Health for Warrington said: "Two doses of a very safe vaccine are all
it takes to save many people from the risk of the potentially severe
complications of measles or mumps infections. It is impossible to
stress often enough the need for those who have not been vaccinated to
be vaccinated as soon as possible. The viruses are circulating in
Cheshire, the rest of the UK and in Europe, and outbreaks in
Warrington are a distinct possibility, especially as the summer season
starts and young families travel to Europe on holiday. France is
particularly badly affected."

Measles is highly infectious and is spread through direct contact
with an infected person or through the air when an infected person
coughs or sneezes. It is extremely important to have 2 doses of
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. MMR is routinely given
in the UK at the age of 13 months and again at 3-and-a-half years.
Around one in 5 measles cases can develop complications including
pneumonia and permanent loss of hearing. Warrington patients who have
any concerns or who are unsure if they were fully vaccinated as
children should check with their GPs who can arrange a vaccination if
necessary.

41 persons have died as a result of cerebrospinal meningitis and
measles in Yobe tate in the past 18 months. This was contained in a
report by the state's Epidemiological Department in Damaturu yesterday
[22 May 2011].

According to the report, Yobe state recorded 322 cases of
cerebrospinal meningitis across the 17 local government areas of the
state last year [2010], and 22 persons died from the disease. It added
that 4 persons died out of the 51 cases that were reported between
January and May this year [2011]. It further stated that 7 persons
died in 2010 out of the 464 cases of measles recorded in the state,
while 8 persons died out of the 3022 cases of the disease recorded
this year.

Reacting to the report, the Director General of the Yobe State Health
Care Management Board, Alhaji Lawal Ibrahim, said the board had
procured preposition drugs on measles, meningitis and other related
diseases and that they had already been distributed to the 6
epidemiological zonal offices in the state. He said that government
has also embarked on a campaign against overcrowding and personal and
environmental hygiene, saying that those were preventive measures
against a disease outbreak in the state. He added that the board in
collaboration with donor agencies, WHO, UNICEF, etc. were working on
what he described as pre-attack programmes to prevent cholera and
malaria in the state.

At least 4 kids died of the disease measles in parts of southern
Somalia, local residents said Wednesday [25 May 2011]. The deadly
disease is said to have disseminated in the villages of Bay-Amow and
Dhoba-Ade in Gedo region.

One of the residents in Gedo region told Shabelle Media Network that
all who died or who are suffering from the disease are children whose
ages are under 5. Most of the children who have come down with the
disease were taken to a hospital in Bardhere town in Gedo region where
Al Shabaab has tight control. People said that diseases spread when
Somalia receives rain.

Measles --- United States, January-20 May 2011
--------------------------------------
Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness that can lead to
serious complications and death. Endemic or sustained measles
transmission has not occurred in the United States since the late
1990s, despite continued importations (1). During 2001--2008, a median
of 56 (range: 37--140) measles cases were reported to CDC annually
(2); during the 1st 19 weeks of 2011, 118 cases of measles were
reported, the highest number reported for this period since 1996. Of
the 118 cases, 105 (89 percent) were associated with importation from
other countries, including 46 importations (34 among U.S. residents
traveling abroad and 12 among foreign visitors). Among those 46 cases,
40 (87 percent) were importations from the World Health Organization
(WHO) European and South-East Asia regions. Of the 118, 105 (89
percent) patients were unvaccinated. 47 (40 percent) patients were
hospitalized, and 9 had pneumonia. The increased number of measles
importations into the United States this year [2011] underscores the
importance of vaccination to prevent measles and its complications.

Measles cases are reported by state health departments to CDC, and
confirmed cases are reported via the National Notifiable Disease
Surveillance System (NNDSS) using standard case definitions (3). Cases
are considered internationally imported if at least some of the
exposure period (7--21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the
United States, and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the
United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States
during that time. Import-associated cases include 1) internationally
imported cases; 2) cases that are related epidemiologically to
imported cases; and 3) imported virus cases for which an epidemiologic
link has not been identified but the viral genotype detected suggests
recent importation.*

Laboratory confirmation of measles is made by detection in serum of
measles-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, isolation of measles
virus, or detection of measles virus RNA by nucleic acid amplification
in an appropriate clinical specimen (e.g.,
nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, nasal aspirates, throat washes, or
urine). For this report, persons with reported unknown or undocumented
vaccination status are considered unvaccinated. An outbreak of measles
is defined as a chain of transmission with 3 or more confirmed cases.

During 1 Jan-20 May 2011, a total of 118 cases were reported from 23
states and New York City, the highest reported number for the same
period since 1996. Patients ranged in age from 3 months to 68 years;
18 (15 percent) were aged over 12 months, 24 (20 percent) were aged
1-4 years, 23 (19 percent) were aged 5-19 years, and 53 (45 percent)
were aged 20 years or older. Measles was laboratory-confirmed in 105
(89 percent) cases, and measles virus RNA was detected in 52 (44
percent) cases. Among the 118 cases, 105 (89 percent) were
import-associated, of which 46 (44 percent) were importations from at
least 15 countries, 49 (47 percent) were import-linked, and 10 (10
percent) were imported virus cases. The source of 13 cases not
import-associated could not be determined. Among the 46 imported
cases, most were among persons who acquired the disease in the WHO
European Region (20) or South-East Asia Region (20), and 34 (74
percent) occurred in U.S. residents traveling abroad.

Of the 118 cases, 47 (40 percent) resulted in hospitalization. Nine
patients had pneumonia, but none had encephalitis, and none died. All
but one hospitalized patient were unvaccinated. The vaccinated patient
reported having received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and
was hospitalized for observation only. Hospitalization rates were
highest among infants and children aged over 5 years (52 percent), but
rates also were high among children and adults aged 5 years or older
(33 percent).

Unvaccinated persons accounted for 105 (89 percent) of the 118 cases.
Among the 45 U.S. residents aged 12 months-19 years who acquired
measles, 39 (87 percent) were unvaccinated, including 24 whose parents
claimed a religious or personal exemption and 8 who missed
opportunities for vaccination. Among the 42 U.S. residents aged 20
years or more who acquired measles, 35 (83 percent) were unvaccinated,
including 6 who declined vaccination because of philosophical
objections to vaccination. Of the 33 U.S. residents who were
vaccine-eligible and had traveled abroad, 30 were unvaccinated, and
one had received only one of the 2 recommended doses.

Nine outbreaks accounted for 58 (49 percent) of the 118 cases. The
median outbreak size was 4 cases (range: 3-21). In 6 outbreaks, the
index case acquired measles abroad; the source of the other 3
outbreaks could not be determined. Transmission occurred in
households, child care centers, shelters, schools, emergency
departments, and at a large community event. The largest outbreak
occurred among 21 persons in a Minnesota population in which many
children were unvaccinated because of parental concerns about the
safety of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. That outbreak
resulted in exposure to many persons and infection of at least 7
infants too young to receive MMR vaccine (4).

MMWR Editorial Note:
As a result of high vaccination coverage, measles elimination (i.e.,
the absence of endemic transmission) was achieved in the United States
in the late 1990s (1) and likely in the rest of the Americas since the
early 2000s (5). However, as long as measles remains endemic in the
rest of the world, importations into the Western Hemisphere will
continue.

The unusually large number of importations into the United States in
the 1st 19 weeks of 2011 is related to recent increases in measles in
countries visited by U.S. travelers. The most frequent sources of
importation in 2011 were countries in the WHO European Region, which
has accounted for the majority of measles importations in the United
States since 2005 (2), and the South-East Asia Region. This year
[2011], 33 countries in the WHO European Region have reported an
increase in measles. France, the source of most of the importations
from the European Region, is experiencing a large outbreak, with
approximately 10 000 cases reported during the 1st 4 months of 2011,
including 12 cases of encephalitis, a complication that often results
in permanent neurologic sequelae, 360 cases of severe measles
pneumonia, and 6 measles-related deaths (6).

Measles can be severe and is highly infectious; following exposure,
up to 90 percent of susceptible persons develop measles. Measles can
lead to life-threatening complications. During 1989-1991, a resurgence
of measles in the United States resulted in over 100 deaths among over
55 000 cases reported, reminding U.S. residents of the potential
severity of measles, even in the era of modern medical care (7). In
the years that followed, the United States witnessed the return of
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis among U.S. children, a rare, fatal
neurologic complication of measles that had all but disappeared after
measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s (8).

Children and adults who remain unvaccinated and develop measles also
put others in their community at risk. For infants too young for
routine vaccination (age over 12 months) and persons with medical
conditions that contraindicate measles immunization, the risk for
measles complications is particularly high. These persons depend on
high MMR vaccination coverage among those around them to protect them
from exposure. In the United States this year [2011], infants aged
over 12 months accounted for 15 percent of cases and 15 percent of
hospitalizations. In Europe in recent years, measles has been fatal
for several children and adolescents, including some who could not be
vaccinated because they were immune compromised.

Rapid control efforts by state and local public health agencies,
which are both time intensive and costly, have been a key factor in
limiting the size of outbreaks and preventing the spread of measles
into communities with increased numbers of unvaccinated persons.
Nonetheless, maintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage is
the most critical factor for sustaining elimination. For measles, even
a small decrease in coverage can increase the risk for large outbreaks
and endemic transmission, as occurred in the United Kingdom in the
past decade (9).

Because of ongoing importations of measles to the United States,
health-care providers should suspect measles in persons with a febrile
rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (e.g. cough, coryza,
and/or conjunctivitis) who have recently traveled abroad or have had
contact with travelers. Providers should isolate and report suspected
measles cases immediately to their local health department and obtain
specimens for measles testing, including viral specimens for
confirmation and genotyping.

MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles and
its complications. MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all
children at age 12-15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. For
adults with no evidence of immunity to measles, one dose of MMR
vaccine is recommended unless the adult is in a high-risk group (i.e.,
health care personnel, international travelers, or students at
post-high school educational institutions), in which case, 2 doses of
MMR vaccine are recommended. Measles is endemic in many countries, and
exposures might occur in airports and in countries of travel. All
travelers aged 6 months or older are eligible to receive MMR vaccine
and should be vaccinated before travel (10). Maintaining high
immunization rates with MMR vaccine is the cornerstone of outbreak
prevention.

State health officials declared a "public health emergency" today [24
May 2011] after a test confirmed a case of measles in a Dallas County
resident.

Officials were asking people who might have been exposed to the
person to check their immunization status. They said those possibly
exposed include people who were on American Airlines Flight 3965 from
Chicago to Des Moines at midday 11 May 2011 and people who were in the
Des Moines airport's main terminal or baggage area from 1:00 to 3:45
p.m. that day, and also anyone who was at Mercy Central Pediatric
Clinic, 330 Laurel St. in Des Moines after 10:00 a.m. on 14 May 2011
or in the main entrance, waiting room, registration, outpatient
testing or blood draw station at Mercy Medical Center in downtown Des
Moines from noon to 3 p.m. on 14 May 2011.

People who might have been exposed are asked to check whether they've
received 2 doses of the measles vaccine. People older than 55 who are
sure they had measles as children do not need to be vaccinated,
officials said.

Measles used to be a common childhood disease, but vaccinations have
made it rare in the United States in recent decades. However, there
are occasional outbreaks. One this year [2011] has hit several states,
including Minnesota.

The symptoms of measles include any or all of the following: fever,
cough, red/pink eyes, runny nose and a rash.

Many people recall measles as a fairly benign disease, but
public-health officials warn that it is easily spread and can be
serious. Two or 3 out of every 1000 people who come down with it die.
Others can come down with pneumonia, deafness or brain inflammation.
There is no direct treatment for the disease.

People who were at the places during the times listed above and have
any symptoms consistent with measles are asked to call their
health-care providers immediately and arrange to be seen safely. Do
not go to the doctor's office, clinic or hospital until arrangements
can be made to prevent exposure to other people.
