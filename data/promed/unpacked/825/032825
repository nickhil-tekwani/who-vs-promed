Polio diagnosis confirmed in 2 Tajik children in Russia's Chelyabinsk region
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have proved polio diagnosis in 2 Tajik children in
Russia's Urals Chelyabinsk region, the press service of Russia's
consumer rights watchdog (Rospotrebnadzor) South Urals administration
told Itar-Tass on Thursday [10 Jun 2010].

According to the Rospotrebnadzor administration, one of the sick
children was 8 years old, the other one was 17 [years old]. Both were
illegal migrants. One lived in Magnitogorsk, the other in Chelyabinsk.

"The 2 turned for medical help in due time. They were hospitalized in
infectious disease clinics. Later, parents of the 17-year-old patient
took him back to Tajikistan, while the 8-year-old child is still in
hospital, in a satisfactory condition," the press service said.

Neither of the 2 left Russia in 2010 and might have contracted the
disease while staying on the territory of the Chelyabinsk region
through contacts with other Tajik citizens arriving from Tajikistan,
the press service said and added that local health authorities were
taking measures to contain polio hotbeds.

It is highly likely that the local health administration will stage
polio inoculation of all Tajik citizens residing in the Chelyabinsk
region.

These are not the 1st polio cases to be registered in Russia's Urals
region. Previously, poliomyelitis was diagnosed in a 20-year-old Tajik
citizen, who was then hospitalized, and now, according to medics, is
in a stable condition.

The polio situation is worsening both in Tajikistan and Russia. Thus,
according to Rospotrebnadzor, more than 500 polio cases have been
registered in Tajikistan. As of now, 15 polio patients have died.

[2] WHO-EURO update

Latest epidemiological update on polio outbreak in central Asia 3 Jun 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 1 Jun 2010, Tajikistan had reported 564 cases of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP), 183 of which had been laboratory confirmed for wild
poliovirus type 1. All laboratory-confirmed cases reported so far are
from the south-western part of the country and the capital, Dushanbe.
The number of cases reported has declined in week 22. 14 AFP cases are
negative for wild poliovirus.

The National Polio Expert Committee of Tajikistan met on 1 Jun 2010 to
review and classify AFP cases. It will continue to meet to ensure that
all cases are appropriately classified.

Tajikistan has concluded 2 nationwide rounds of vaccination, using
monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). During the 1st round,
more than 1.1 million children under 6 years of age were immunized:
99.4 percent of the target group. The 2nd round saw a similarly high
coverage rate. The 3rd round of the vaccination programme began on [1
Jun 2010], with a target group expanded to include all children under
15 years of age. A 4th round will be held for this group on 15-19 Jun
2010.

WHO's international expert team in Tajikistan continues to conduct
outbreak investigation and epidemiological assessment, and provides
technical assistance to the Government, along with the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other key partners. The WHO considers
Tajikistan's vaccination programme successful so far, and is working
closely with the Ministry of Health on assessing needs for additional
rounds. A WHO regional reference laboratory in Moscow, Russian
Federation continues to test samples from patients with AFP.

The WHO has sent one of its experts in rehabilitation to assess the
services provided to people affected by polio. He has met with the key
stakeholders and will conclude his assessment with training for
physicians treating these people.

The WHO also works closely with Tajikistan's neighbours in the WHO
European Region (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
on prevention and response measures. These countries' governments have
strengthened surveillance, and have begun or will soon begin
vaccination campaigns. With its international partners, the WHO has
sent expert teams to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to help strengthen
surveillance and to support national and subregional vaccination
activities.

Uzbekistan
----------
In Uzbekistan, 41 AFP cases have been reported since January 2010; 26
are negative for poliovirus, while 15 are pending laboratory results.
With UNICEF and other partners, WHO is helping to implement and
monitor a 3-round national polio vaccination campaign, aiming to reach
almost 2.9 million children under 5 years of age. The 1st round was
held on 17-22 May [2010], and the Uzbek Ministry of Health reported
coverage exceeding the number originally targeted, as the children
vaccinated included some who were not registered with public health
centres before the campaign.

The 2nd round of the vaccination campaign is scheduled for 7-13 Jun
2010. The WHO Regional Director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, will
visit Uzbekistan during this period at the invitation of the Minister
of Health. In the capital, Tashkent, Ms Jakab will meet leading
representatives of the Government and public health authorities to
discuss polio vaccination and a range of other public health
challenges in Uzbekistan.

The 3rd round of nationwide polio vaccination is tentatively planned
for 5-9 Jul [2010].

[If the information provided in the newswire is correct, and the
viruses isolated from these 2 new cases is a wild polio virus (WPV),
then these cases represent the 1st documented local transmission of
the WPV within Russia.

If one looks at the vaccination coverages with 3 or more doses of the
oral polio vaccine (OPV) reported to WHO by country and year since
1986 (see table below) one sees that since approximately 1997,
coverages have been above 90 percent in all 3 countries. But, prior to
1995, the coverages have been below 80 percent in one or more of the
countries, especially the Russian Federation where reported coverages
fell below 70 percent. If these coverage data are correct (and one
does recognize that administrative data such as these reflect doses
given to the target population less than one year of age), then there
are most likely pockets of susceptible population born between 1985
and 1994 -- ages 16 - 25 years old. Information on the age
distribution of the cases would be helpful.

Vaccination coverages with 3 or more doses of OPV by country and year:

According to the latest case counts from the polio eradication
website, as of 8 Jun 2010, there have been 183 confirmed cases of
polio in Tajikistan and an additional 456 acute flaccid paralysis
cases are pending laboratory confirmation.
