According to Ulises Diaz Zorrilla, National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP), Persian lime exports are at risk due [to] leprosis which is why the sector needs to conduct field investigation to control the disease. Leprosis has spread in almost all of the country, including Veracruz.

[He] said that the disease came from orange, grapefruit and mandarins and had recently been detected in Persian lime. He recommended [that] producers thoroughly study their plantations, so that they can detect [and] control the diseases that are detrimental to production. "We have observed many suspicious samples here in the region." If said samples are positive, producers will be notified to carry out the proper management.

[Citrus leprosis is a devastating disease caused by _Citrus leprosis virus C_ or _Citrus leprosis virus C2_ (CiLV-C or CiLV-C2; only members of genus _Cilevirus_, not assigned to a family or order). However, research is ongoing and additional viruses associated with leprosis, as well as a new mite transmitted genus of Dichorhavirus have been proposed (see links below).

So far, citrus leprosis has only been reported from the Americas where it has caused large losses and appears to be spreading. Symptoms may include lesions on fruits, leaves and twigs, premature leaf and fruit drop, defoliation, severe necrosis of new shoots, dieback of branches, bark scaling, as well as reduction of the canopy leading to serious tree decline and significant yield losses. The viruses only affect _Citrus_ species, and sweet orange varieties (_C. sinensis_) are particularly susceptible. Other species and hybrids have variable levels of resistance and some may not show symptoms serving as latent virus reservoirs.

CiLV-C and CiLV-C2 occur in the cytoplasm of infected host cells, but other forms of the viruses exist that occur in the nucleus. The cytoplasmic forms have been shown to be the prevalent types in orchards. Both types are spread by the flat mite (or false spider mite, _Brevipalpus phoenicis_) and other related mite species. Unlike many other plant viruses, the leprosis viruses do not become systemic, which means each lesion represents a feeding puncture of an infected vector. Infectious mites may be spread with plant material such as budwood or rooted plantlets, and the leprosis risk is particularly high for areas where vector species are already present. Since the vectors are widespread, leprosis is considered a threat to citrus industries worldwide and has been placed on the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Disease management may include cultural methods to reduce virus and vector reservoirs, but mainly relies on controlling the mites. Most currently available miticides are effective and are applied once the vector reaches economic thresholds. Biological control by mite predators is being used occasionally. Disease levels often increase when crop prices fall due to farmers saving costs by reducing chemicals. Crop varieties with increased levels of resistance are available, but none of the commercial sweet orange varieties are resistant to leprosis.

Persian lime, also called Tahitian or seedless lime (_Citrus x latifolia_), is the most widely cultivated lime for commercial use.
