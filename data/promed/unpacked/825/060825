A new disease has been killing flocks of turkeys in the Southeast since
1995. Now, scientists with USDA's (United States Department of Agriculture)
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and North Carolina State University
have identified one of its hiding places--and its first internal target:
the turkey's disease-fighting lymph tissue.
Poult Enteritis Mortality Syndrome, or PEMS, weakens the turkey's immune
system, leaving it highly vulnerable to bacterial and parasitic infections.
But the new discovery could lead to better understanding
and--eventually--treatment and prevention. PEMS outbreaks in the Southeast
have cost the turkey industry millions of dollars in losses annually. Other
outbreaks have been reported in Texas and Virginia. PEMS-related mortality
ranges between 25 to 96 percent in affected flocks. Birds that recover
reach only about 40 percent of typical market weight. The syndrome is
apparently a deadly combination of viruses.
Specific causative agents have not yet been identified, according to
microbiologist Stacey L. Schultz-Cherry at the ARS Southeast Poultry
Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. But she and ARS colleagues,
collaborating with NCSU (North Carolina State University) veterinarian John
Barnes in Raleigh, North Carolina., found that PEMS strikes first in the
thymus, or lymphoid glands of turkeys. Very few viruses are known to grow
in the thymus. The ability of a virus to infect the thymus is a special
concern because it is a designated disease fighter.
The researchers recently isolated 1 virus from the thymus of a turkey sick
with PEMS. They are attempting to identify it and determine its role in
PEMS. The research will aid in developing diagnostic tools and treatments
to prevent future outbreaks. Increased vigilance on turkey farms has
decreased the incidence of PEMS, But before scientists can develop
effective treatments, they need to learn much more about the causative
agent or agents and their effects on the turkey's immune response.
Schultz-Cherry is scheduled to present detailed findings on July 13 at the
American Veterinary Association Meeting in New Orleans. ARS is the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's chief scientific wing.
