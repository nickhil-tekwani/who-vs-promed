USA: suspected norovirus outbreak at Orcas Island under investigation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
State Health Department officials expect to begin an investigation today
into a suspected norovirus outbreak that shut down a YMCA summer camp on
Orcas Island over the weekend [see: Viral gastroenteritis update 2003 (20)
20030825.2143]. About 150 children and several counselors at Camp Orkila
fell ill with what officials said could be norovirus infection, a highly
contagious illness that causes stomach and intestinal discomfort. Campers
who got sick, along with many of the 200 or so who didn't, were taken back
to the mainland city of Anacortes on Saturday on a Washington state ferry.
Dozens of others, who were quarantined on Orcas Island until arrangements
could be made to pick them up, left camp throughout the day yesterday. A
remaining group of 20 kids was expected to leave today. YMCA spokeswoman
Monica Elenbaas said most of the children who were ill over the weekend
were no longer showing symptoms.
The next step for Camp Orkila, said Director Paul Kamin, is to get ready
for a family camp planned for next weekend. He said families scheduled to
attend should be notified starting today, so they can make up their own
minds whether to take part in the event. "We've got basically a week to go
back and do what we need to do to clean the place up," Kamin said. "It'll
be cleaner here than ever before." Camp officials will work with San Juan
Island and state health inspectors to make sure the facilities are safe.
The outbreak apparently started after one infected child arrived with a
group of campers last Monday (18 Aug 2003]. The camper already had traveled
and played with other children before showing symptoms. The camp's doctor
suspected a norovirus infection outbreak, but an official determination
won't come until health officials run tests, Kamin said. More than 3000
campers stay at Orkila each summer.
Noroviruses turn up when fecal matter [or vomitus, which is commoner with
noroviruses. - Mod.SH] contaminates food or water. The virus often is
spread when people don't wash their hands after using the restroom, then
come into close contact with others or touch something that other people
later put in their mouths. More than 23 million Americans come down with
the illness each year. The main symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and
abdominal pain. It is not life-threatening.

USA: North Atlantic cruise cut short by suspected norovirus outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------
An ocean liner docked on Tuesday after cutting short a cruise across the
North Atlantic because more than 300 people had become sick with suspected
norovirus infection. Only 2 passengers remained ill when the Regal Princess
docked, said Steve Nielsen, vice president of Caribbean and Atlantic
operations for Princess Cruises. They remained aboard the ship for
treatment, he said. The remainder of the 1500 passengers and 679 crew
members were being allowed off the ship, and buses were brought to the dock
to take them on to other destinations. The illness, which causes nausea and
vomiting, is highly contagious but lasts only 24 to 48 hours.
The ship had set out on 8 Aug 2003 from Copenhagen, Denmark, for a 16 day
voyage with stops including Britain, Ireland, and Iceland. Because of the
illness, the ship skipped a planned stop in Newfoundland and docked in New
York one day ahead of schedule.
Nielsen said passengers started to get ill on the 3rd day of the cruise,
and eventually a total of 296 passengers and 44 crew members came down with
the viral infection.
"There were incidents of gastrointestinal illness," said Julie Beson, a
spokeswoman for Princess Cruises. "We immediately put measures into place
that we developed with the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) to [contain the infection]. "Those measures included
disinfecting the ship in mid-voyage, everything from elevator buttons to
handrails," she said. "We suspect that because of the pattern of the
illness that one or 2 passengers probably unwittingly brought this on
board," added Beson. Nielsen said passengers returning home by plane would
be refunded for any changes to their airfare. Norovirus infection affected
thousands of cruise ship passengers in 2002. The viruses are spread through
food and water and close contact with infected people or things they have
touched.

[Most previous outbreaks of norovirus infection have occurred in cruise
ships leaving from North American ports, although in some instances the
infection may have been introduced by cruise passengers arriving by air
from Europe. In the present outbreak on board the Regal Princess, the
infection appears to have been introduced by one or more of the passengers
embarking at Copenhagen. The outbreak appears to have been contained by
early recognition of the problem and implementation of containment
measures. - Mod.CP]
