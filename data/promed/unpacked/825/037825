On Mon 7 May, it was announced that the mystery fever that has claimed 3
lives in Nadia [district of West Bengal] is being blamed on a rare virus
that is spread by pigs and bats and which killed 49 people in Siliguri 6
years ago.
Nipah virus, discovered in Malaysia in 1999, has since been known to strike
only 2 other places, Bangladesh and Bengal [that is, the West Bengal state
of India], causing epidemics in both. The Nadia infection, which now
afflicts at least 30 people, was 1st thought to be a new strain of dengue.
But blood samples of the 3 dead patients have tested positive for Nipah
[virus] at the National Institute of Virology in Pune [in the western
Maharashtra state of India].
The wife of one of the 3 dead confirmed that bats are common in her
Krishnagar locality. "They even enter our home and bite us, but we never
bothered about it before," she said. [Nipah virus is transmitted to humans
and pigs via bat urine and saliva-contaminated fruit, not usually by bites.
- Mod.CP] She has a temperature and is undergoing regular check-ups at the
district hospital. "Fruit bats are its [Nipah virus's] natural hosts," a
virologist said. "The bats can infect pigs and both can infect humans.
Transmission requires close contact with infected tissues or body fluids.
We have asked families to cut the leaves of fruit plants and stop eating
pork," said Mohan Basu, deputy chief medical officer of heath, Nadia
district. [However, it is not certain that all 30 patients have the Nipah
virus.]
The hitherto unexplained fever had afflicted 50 people since February
[2007] but some 15 have recovered and 2 of the 5 dead actually died of
encephalitis. No medicine has been found to work against Nipah, which
spreads rapidly and has a high mortality rate. It killed 105 of 265
patients in Malaysia, 18 of 30 in Bangladesh in April 2004, and 3/4 of the
66 it infected in Siliguri [West Bengal] in 2001. In Siliguri, most
patients were either hospital employees or visitors, suggesting
human-to-human spread is a possibility. Virologists said domestic cats and
dogs are suspected carriers, too. Death can occur in 48-72 hours. The
symptoms are high temperature, muscle pain, nausea, and convulsions leading
in some cases to a coma.

The rare, animalborne Nipah virus has killed 5 people in the eastern Indian
state [of West Bengal], prompting authorities to declare a state of alert,
officials said on Tue 8 May 2007. A health official and 4 members of a
family have died from the illness since early April [2007], said Mohan
Basu, a doctor in West Bengal state's Nadia district.
Nipah virus is usually spread by fruit bats or pigs. There have been no
known cases of human-to-human infection, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). The last [1st - Mod.CP] major Nipah outbreak occurred
in Malaysia, where 265 people were infected in 1998-99. The virus was then
blamed for 105 human deaths. Nearly a million pigs, believed to have spread
the disease, were slaughtered before the Malaysian outbreak was controlled.
The virus, which causes encephalitis, is lethal in about 50 per cent of
infected humans. No drugs have proven effective against it. Nadia is 120 km
(75 miles) north of West Bengal's capital, Calcutta, and borders
Bangladesh, which had a Nipah outbreak in 2004. "Initially we thought that
the cases were of dengue (a mosquitoborne viral disease), but a test later
confirmed that it was Nipah virus that caused the deaths," Basu said.
The outbreak was confirmed by the region's senior health official, Nipati
Roy. The virus was found in samples that were sent to the National
Institute of Virology. "We are sending streams of blood samples taken from
bats and pigs and even household pets," Basu said. "We are keeping a close
surveillance." Basu said he suspected that the virus had been spread by
fruit bats in Nadia, and that residents have been warned to avoid the
flying mammals.

[Nipah virus infection has been confirmed as the cause of 5 previously
undiagnosed cases of illness in the Nadia district of West Bengal [see the
4 most recent "see alsos" below]. The precise status of the 30-50 people
still under surveillance is uncertain. The source of the outbreak and the
involvement of bats, pigs, and domestic cats and dogs have still to be
established. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
