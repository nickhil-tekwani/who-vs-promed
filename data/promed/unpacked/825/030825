Imagine what we are feeling in developing countries. Very often we have to
give so many presumptive diagnosis based only on clinical grounds and basic
laboratory results. Most serologic probes are done in private
laboratories, and if the patient is not still in serious condition, the
parents are not willing to pay for them.

[If the only diagnosis that can be made is a presumptive one, then that's
all that can be done. The problem I have is with results that yield
presumptive diagnoses but are reported a "confirmed". String now cut. -
