A 2-year-old girl has died of meningococcal disease in Arsenyev. The kindergarten that the child was attending has been temporarily closed for quarantine.

The diagnosis of meningitis was confirmed on 10 Dec 2012. The child was admitted to a children's hospital, but the infection developed rapidly, and the girl could not be saved, said the press service of the city hall. All children and adults who have been in contact with the child have been vaccinated.

[As reported by Arsenyev City Hospital, cases of meningitis are recorded each year. In 2000, a one-year-old child died after severe meningococcal disease. With regards to the current case, a nursery in the kindergarten has been temporarily closed. Medical observation has been organized for children of the nursery group. - Corr.BA]

[Although not mentioned in the above news report, antibiotics are recommended to prevent secondary infection in close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease. These at-risk contacts include household members, roommates, attendees at the same child-care center, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions through close social contact during the 7 days before onset of disease in the index case, such as through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or endotracheal intubation. Risk is also high in travelers who have prolonged contact with local populations in the Africa meningitis belt during an epidemic. The Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia has also been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal disease in returning pilgrims and their contacts.

Because the risk for illness in contacts is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient. Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value. Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm and http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for).

Primorsky, also known as Primorye, is a federal subject of Russia (a krai) with a population of 1 956 497 (2010 census) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai). Primorsky means "maritime" in Russian, hence the region is sometimes referred to as Maritime Province or Maritime Territory. Its administrative center is in the city of Vladivostok. Arsenyev is a town with a population of 56 742 (2010 census) in Primorsky Krai, located about 250 km (160 miles) northeast of Vladivostok. A map of Russia showing the location of Primorsky is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Primorsky_in_Russia.svg.
