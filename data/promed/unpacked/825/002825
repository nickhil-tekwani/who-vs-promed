Influenza update no 198
-----------------------
- Although in many European countries influenza-like illness activity started to increase, influenza detections in the northern hemisphere temperate zones remained low.
- Influenza transmission in southern Asia was low. In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, and in the south of China influenza detections decreased. In South East Asia, influenza activity decreased in Thailand and Viet Nam, but increased in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic. In this area, co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus was reported.
- In the Caribbean region of Central America and tropical South America countries, reported cases of influenza A infection remained at low levels among most Caribbean islands and Central American countries, with increased reports of influenza B in certain countries. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continued to predominate in certain countries, but the RSV activity largely remained within expected seasonal levels.
- Influenza activity peaked in the temperate countries of South America and in South Africa in late June [2013]. Temperate South American countries reported cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 A (H3N2) and influenza B, and acute respiratory activity remained low.
- In Australia and New Zealand, numbers of influenza viruses detected and rates of influenza-like illness decreased. Co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses was reported in both countries.
- Additional and updated information on non-seasonal [predominantly avian] influenza viruses can be found at <htp://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/index.html>

Outbreaks of seasonal influenza are currently at a low level in both hemispheres and no antigenically novel viruses have made an appearance. The seasonal influenza viruses in circulation remain A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B virus in varying proportions. Currently human cases of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses are occurring sporadically at low frequency. - Mod.CP]
