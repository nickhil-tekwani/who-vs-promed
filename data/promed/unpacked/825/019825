About 4000 customers could be at risk after a worker at a Jamba Juice
store in San Jose, California, developed hepatitis A, the chief
medical officer for Santa Clara County said on Thursday [23 Aug 2007].
"During the time she was infectious, she was also working at Jamba
Juice, so we were concerned that even though there is a corporate
policy of good hand washing, you can't be 100 percent sure," Martin
Fenstersheib said in an interview. "There is a potential risk for
people who were in that facility drinking the Jamba juice during the
time she worked," he added.
Hepatitis A, a rare occurrence in food service workers, is
transmitted through oral and fecal contact. It can cause jaundice,
fatigue, stomach cramps, and other ailments. Medical officials are
advising anyone who may have been affected to get a vaccination.
Fenstersheib based his number of potentially affected customers on
data provided by the company for the time the unidentified worker was
on the job during the 1st 16 days of August [2007].
The worker's doctor reported the case to county health officials on
Wednesday [22 Aug 2007]. Because the disease takes about a month to
incubate, there are no other known cases from exposure to the worker
at present, according to health officials. The store was closed
briefly for cleaning and disinfection and has since reopened.
"Jamba Juice will pay eligible individuals, who satisfy the
reimbursement requirements, their reasonable, out-of-pocket medical
expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis A," Paul
Clayton, Jamba Juice's chief executive, said in a statement. "We
acted quickly to resolve this situation and the store is now open.
