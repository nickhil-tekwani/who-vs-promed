According to the Department of Animal Production of the Regional Office for Agricultural Development (CRDA) of Manouba, 2 cases of FMD were found in the cattle population in Tebourba.

Blood samples were sent to the Veterinary Research Institute of Rabta to confirm the suspected cases.

[It is not clear why blood and not tissue samples (from lesions) have been submitted to the laboratory for confirmation (of the clinically suspected animals). Laboratory results are anticipated with interest.

Tebourba is a town in the governorate Bizerte, which is the northernmost of the 24 governorates of Tunisia.

The epizootic, caused by FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage Ind-2001d, reportedly started on 25 Apr 2014 and has rapidly spread to most parts of the country, causing, so far, 47 reported outbreaks. In case the current outbreaks are confirmed, this means its further spread in Bizerte, where, previously, one outbreak was reported.
