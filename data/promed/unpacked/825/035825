A "Red Tide" event that occurred off the coast of El Salvador [late in 2005
and perhaps early 2006] directly caused the deaths of some 200 sea turtles,
according to test results released today by the Wildlife Conservation
Society (WCS) and other organizations.
Responding to requests from the Salvadoran government and the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) for assistance, WCS veterinary
pathologist Dr. Julie White journeyed to the southern coast of El Salvador
in January 2006 to help determine why these ocean-going reptiles -- mostly
olive ridley turtles and a few green and hawksbill turtles -- were dying in
such high numbers. Tissues collected from dead turtles, and analyzed by
both U.S. biologists and researchers from the Mexican Autonomous
University, revealed the culprit: saxitoxin, which is produced by the
species of algae and sea plankton that cause the phenomenon known as "Red
Tide."
"The rapid response and subsequent diagnosis in this outbreak demonstrates
the power of collaboration among governments and non-governmental
organizations," said White, who collected tissue samples in January. "We
are still testing samples from other turtles that died during this period,
but we can say with some certainty that Red Tides first reported in
November 2005 resulted in widespread sea turtle mortality."
The first reports of these deadly algal blooms came in November along El
Salvador's southern coast, followed by reports of humans becoming sick.
This was followed by the closure of shellfish beds in the area, a warning
from the government against eating shellfish from affected areas, and the
first instances of dead and dying sea turtles washing up on shore were
reported in the 2nd week in December 2005. Dr. White then performed
post-mortem examinations on one of the turtles, while simultaneously
training Salvadorian colleagues in tissue collection techniques. Samples
were then sent to Florida's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, where
technicians then found high levels of saxitoxin, which affects the nervous
systems of humans and animals alike. Since then, no further deaths of large
numbers of sea turtles have been reported from El Salvador, although a
similar sea turtle die-off was reported in Panama in early February. In El
Salvador, the levels of toxins in shellfish have decreased but are high
enough to maintain the ban on harvesting shellfish.
Red Tide events have become increasingly common around the world, causing
significant impacts on wild marine animal populations, massive economic
losses to shellfish producers, and occasionally human deaths. While the
algal blooms are a natural occurrence, human wastes such as run-off
containing fertilizers and sewage from urban areas have been postulated as
triggers for these events.
Response to the sea turtle die-off was a coordinated effort involving WCS,
USAID, the Salvadoran Ministry of Environment (MARN), the Salvadoran
Ministry of Agriculture's Division of Fisheries (CENDEPESCA), and FUNZEL, a
non-profit wildlife rescue and rehabilitation organization. Tissue samples
were tested in labs operated by the National Marine Fisheries Service and
the University of Florida.

[Saxitoxin is a toxin or poison elaborated by _Gonyaulax spp_ (a genus of
dinoflagellate protozoan) during certain environmental conditions. The
dinoflagellate is consumed by mollusks, fishes, etc. without causing any
ill effects in most of them. However, when mammals consume those mollusks
or fishes, saxitoxin acts as a neurotoxin causing respiratory paralysis and
other effects. It is also known by the more common name of paralytic
shellfish poisoning because the toxin is then contained within the edible
mollusks.
The Olive Ridley Sea Turtle (_Lepidochelys olivacea_) is the smallest of
the sea turtles, usually less than 100 pounds and named for the olive color
of its heart-shaped shell. This particular turtle has a narrow range of
habitats. It is found in the tropical waters of the northern Indian Ocean,
the eastern Pacific Ocean, and in the eastern Atlantic along the coast of
Africa.
