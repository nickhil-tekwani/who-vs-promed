Researchers continuing to examine the results of the chronic wasting
disease (CWD) sampling effort during the 2002 Wisconsin hunting seasons
report the data indicates older bucks have a higher prevalence of the fatal
brain disease and the disease is not uniformly distributed within the
infected area.
"We examined the data from nearly 2000 adult deer within the area where CWD
is most prevalent. For yearling deer, we found CWD at equal levels in male
and female yearlings, 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively," said Dr.
Mike Samuel, lead CWD researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Cooperative Wildlife Research Center, housed at the University of
Wisconsin. "But when the deer in our sample reach 3 years of age, males are
showing double the prevalence -- 16.3 percent in males compared to 8.1
percent in the females. This is similar to information reported from
Colorado earlier this year."
As for distribution of the disease across the landscape, testing of the
deer removed from the intensive harvest zone last year show a core area in
Dane and Iowa counties where the disease was found in about 7 percent of
the deer.
"This kind of concentrated disease pattern is consistent with our
understanding about CWD and what we know about the home range and social
behavior of white-tailed deer," Dr. Samuel said. "It is not surprising to
find a disease concentration given the social nature of deer. Studies have
found female white-tailed deer often occupy about a 1-square mile area
during their entire life and tend to live near related females. Once a
disease gets started, the infection would tend to spread outward somewhat
similar to ripples on a pond."
Tom Hauge, director of the DNR Bureau of Wildlife Management, said the
results suggest several possibilities about how the disease is transmitted
that, with further analysis, may help identify new ways to manage the disease.
"As DNR Secretary Hassett voiced before a national review panel earlier
this spring, we intend to 'learn and adapt' our CWD control efforts as new
information points the way", Hauge said. "The identification of the high
CWD concentration area will help us communicate with the landowners and
hunters in that area. Wisconsin will not be successful in controlling this
disease without their help."
Dr. Samuel said that researches on the CWD Taskforce had expected that the
prevalence of the disease would increase with age in both sexes because
older animals have been exposed for a longer period of time. The USGS
Cooperative Wildlife Research Center is one of several CWD Taskforce
partners, which also includes the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, sharing in new research on CWD.
"What is interesting in these results is the increasing prevalence of
infection found in adult males compared to females, indicating that males
have a higher risk of infection than females," Dr. Samuel said.
Hauge said the CWD Taskforce has several research efforts underway or about
to start up that look at the transmission question.
"We have more to learn about what factors cause the increased infection in
males," Hauge said. "For instance, if environmental transmission plays a
role in spread of the disease, then it follows that males, who have larger
home ranges than females, would logically experience more exposure. Another
scenario that needs more investigation is the potential of females
transmitting CWD to males during the breeding season. Once again, males
cover a lot of ground during the breeding season and contact many different
females physically as well as through urine scenting or other behaviors. A
third possibility might be male-to-male transmission in the bachelor groups
that form in late winter to mid summer."
While the data indicates that older bucks are more likely to be infected
than does, Hauge said, researchers do not think that killing just all the
older mature bucks would solve the problem.
"CWD is also present in other, more common, segments of the population.
From a disease management viewpoint, the priority is to reduce the overall
population numbers and reduce the opportunity for animals to animal
contact. Landowners and hunters can really help control this disease by
maximizing the harvest of does on their lands in the infected area," Hauge
said.
Researchers are also interested in learning more about both
female-to-female and male-female transmission. Samuel notes that female
deer form genetically-related matrilineal groups, and these groups tend to
exclude female deer from other matrilineal groups. Interaction between
related females within a social group is much more intense than between
individuals from unrelated groups.
Multi-agency research studies involving the DNR, USGS, and University of
Wisconsin-Madison have already been initiated to better understand how CWD
might be transmitted within and among related groups of females and among
males and females during the breeding season.
"We have a large and valuable database from last year's surveillance effort
thanks to the great cooperation of landowners and hunters. We plan to use
it to learn as much as we can about CWD," Hauge said.
