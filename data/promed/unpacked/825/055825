MALARIA - GERMANY EX THAILAND

On 4 Apr 2006 we performed post-mortem diagnosis in a 36-year-old
German woman returning to Berlin after a 6-month trip to Thailand.
Blood films revealed _Plasmodium falciparum_ infection with a
parasitemia of about 15 percent. Because of the distorted parasite
morphology in the post-mortem blood sample, the diagnosis was
confirmed by _P. falciparum_-specific PCR.
The woman had returned to Germany on 19 Mar 2006 after a 6-month stay
in Thailand where she had visited Khoalak, Bangsak, Koh Phangan, and
Ranong. Soon after her return she felt sick and developed fever,
chills, diarrhea, cough, and dyspnea. According to her partner, her
conditions subsequently worsened from day to day. She did not seek
medical care and died on 29 Mar 2006 at home.
In accordance with German recommendations she had not taken
antimalarial prophylaxis.

[We thank Drs. Weitzel and Mockenhaupt and Professor Harms for this
report. It serves as a reminder that malaria continues to be a
threat to travelers to endemic areas and of the life-threatening
nature of falciparum malaria to the non-immune. Many travel
specialists would recommend malaria prophylaxis for travelers to
Thailand. Atovaquone/proguanil may be preferred because of
mefloquine resistance seen in the region. Precautions against
mosquito bites are also crucial. - Mod.LM]
