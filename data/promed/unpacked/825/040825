Bed nets for malaria used for fishing
-------------------------------------
The green net stands out in a heap of fishing gear in one of the boats at
Liunda Beach on the shores of Lake Victoria in Bondo District. It is a
mosquito net that has been turned into fishing gear.

Intended for the bedroom to combat malaria, mosquito nets are fast finding
a new role. This turn of events is raising concern among public health
experts and fisheries managers. Apart from reversing the gains made in the
fight against malaria, this misuse also poses a risk to fish stocks in Lake
Victoria.

According to Dr Ayub Manya, a senior official in the Ministry of Public
Health, the use of mosquito nets among women and children in fighting
malaria remains abysmally low in Bondo although the district leads among
the areas in the country that have received nets.

The district has received a substantial number of nets from the Government
and non-governmental organisations. This year, more than 20 000 nets have
been distributed. District deputy public health officer Asher Okanga says
about 3000 malaria nets received in November last year were distributed in
the area in April. A further 21 279 nets received from the Kenya Medical
Research Institute/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other
organisations have also been distributed in the district in a recently
concluded campaign against malaria.

This is in addition to the 46 000 that were distributed in 2006. But
instead of using the nets against the killer disease, Dr Manya says,
communities along the lake are turning them into fishing gear. He says some
people are using the nets to dry small fish, locally known as omena.

In a recent net treatment programme conducted countrywide, most of the
residents in Bondo District turned up with torn nets for exchange.
Concerned by the trend, the Public Health ministry, in conjunction with
public health institutions, decided to change the colour of the mosquito
nets to differentiate them from the white fishing ones. However, this has
not helped matters. Mr Okanga says the green-coloured nets are still
finding their way onto beaches.

During routine patrols by a team of public health officials on the beaches
last week, he adds, fishermen were found to be using them openly. "It is
easy to differentiate mosquito nets from the rest since they are made from
nylon material," he explains. The misuse of bed nets has not been reported
in Bondo District alone.

A recent study conducted jointly by researchers from Maseno University's
School of Public Health, the International Centre for Insect Physiology and
Ecology and Nagasaki University in Japan reported similar findings in Suba
District.

The study, whose findings were published online in a recent issue of the
Malaria Journal, discovered that up to 83 per cent of beach areas in 7
major fishing villages in Gembe West sub-district in Suba was covered by
the mosquito nets. They were used for drying the fish.

Sustainability
--------------
In total, 283 mosquito nets were found to be in use. There were also 72
cases where the nets were used for fishing. Apart from reversing the gains
made in the fight against malaria, the misuse of the nets poses a threat to
the already declining stocks in Lake Victoria. Fisheries managers say the
small mesh sizes of the mosquito nets could catch juvenile fish, thus
threatening the sustainability of the resource.

[The description of misuse of mosquito bednets is a worrisome
observation/reality. From a distance it is easy to attempt to criticize
program activity failures as due to a lack of health education to ensure
that the impregnated bednets are used as malaria prevention tools, but
economic realities set in, and if one's livelihood is at stake, the option
is to have food on the table and access to anti-malarials rather than to be
potentially malaria free, but without food on the table. This highlights
the need for medical anthropologists and health communication specialists
to resolve these challenges. - Mod.MPP

From the point of the population it may make sense to prioritize economic
income from fishing compared to malaria control. ProMED-mail would be happy
to publish suggestions for how such a situation is to be addressed. Â– Mod.EP]
