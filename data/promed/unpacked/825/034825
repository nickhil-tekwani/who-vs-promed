Facing a rabies outbreak in the North, Environmental Protection
Minister Gilad Erdan has reinstated the Agriculture Ministry
regulations permitting Parks Authority inspectors to shoot stray dogs
found on nature reserves.

Erdan had frozen the permit due to pressure by animal rights groups,
but according to a Haaretz report on Wednesday [31 Mar 2010], decided
to affirm it earlier this week.

In the past, the permit to shoot dogs was mostly used to cull the
stray dog population, which causes harm to the nature reserves'
ecosystems. However, in recent months, controlling the rabies outbreak
has become a top priority.

The number of animals found to be suffering from rabies has increased
dramatically over the last year, with most of the cases discovered
among domesticated dogs.

Since the beginning of 2010, the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary
services identified 17 cases of rabies, higher than the total number
of incidents discovered in all of 2008. In 2009, 58 cases of rabies
were identified.

[The animal protection group Let the Animals Live] said: "The dogs are
not to blame; the culprits are irresponsible humans who release their
dogs into the wild in order to get rid of them, or don't vaccinate
their dogs to begin with," she said. "We think that the practice of
shooting dogs is reprehensible, especially since they sometimes suffer
agony from the bullet wounds for days before dying. We think that a
much preferable solution is to trap and vaccinate the dogs, neuter
them, and then release them back to the wild."

According to a Parks Authority spokeswoman, however, the practice of
shooting stray dogs is a necessary measure, as trapping the animals is
inefficient. She explained that the Parks Authority practiced regular
oral vaccination of wild animals [foxes and jackals] by dropping
vaccines from the air, but that the method was ineffective on dogs
because they would swallow the bait containing the vaccine whole
without chewing it, reducing its effect.

"Our goal is to protect the wildlife. Stray dogs present a risk to
wild animals, both because of their unnatural presence in the wild,
where they diminish the prey available to other carnivores, and now
because of the risk of rabies they carry," said the spokeswoman. "In
any case, we do our utmost to make sure the animals don't suffer and
that when shot, they are killed on the spot."

[The positive diagnosis, on 17 Mar 2010, of the "wild species"
(apparently, a wolf) reported in the above follow-up report had
already been included in the immediate notification of 17 Mar 2010
(see post 20100317.0857). No laboratory confirmation is available for
any of the 10 dogs, 2 goats and a sheep claimed to be "cases." As
stated, the said wolf had attacked dogs, sheep and goats in Al-Jalame,
and it seems -- but needs confirmation -- that some if not all of them
died within several days following these attacks. Have any (how many?)
of them demonstrated clinical signs of rabies? Or did they rather die
of their wounds before developing clinical rabies? Additional data
concerning the 2nd mentioned wolf, particularly relating to its rabies
situation, will help as well. - Mod.AS]
