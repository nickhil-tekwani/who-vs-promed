Sierra Leone: Lassa Fever Kills 25 in Kenema
--------------------------------------------
More than 25 people in Kenema have reportedly died of Lassa fever
infection at Malleh in the Lower Bambara chiefdom, Kenema district.
Reports from Kenema Government Hospital indicate that many people
have died of the disease, after the international non-governmental
organization MERLIN -- which was running the Hospital's Lassa fever
ward -- closed its operations in the district. Head of the District
Health Management Team, Dr. Samuel Stevens says the Hospital's Lassa
fever unit lacks the facilities that would empower it to combat the
disease in the township.
Lassa fever specialist Dr. Aniru Conteh, who was heading the Kenema
Hospital Lassa fever unit, died of lassa fever infection in April
2004.
