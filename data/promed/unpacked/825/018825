The bacterial disease tularemia has surfaced again in Champaign county [Illinois], this time in a dead rabbit found in Urbana, authorities said.

The rabbit in Urbana was diagnosed with clinical signs of tularemia at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine this month [July 2018], according to the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District.

"Additionally, there are reports of other rabbits found dead in the neighborhood," the district said in an alert. "This indicates presence of this disease in the area."

There haven't been any known new human cases of tularemia in the local community, according to Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde.

Also called rabbit fever, tularemia is a disease of both animals and humans that is transmitted by an infection of a highly-infectious bacteria.

The bacterium isn't spread from person-to-person, but it can enter the body through the eyes, mouth, lungs, and skin through bites of infected ticks, handling of infected animals, or breathing it in.

Among the known cases of tularemia in Champaign county in recent years there have been a human death in 2014, as well as infections of cats in years that include 2011, 2012, and 2013.

Pryde said it isn't unusual for rabbits to have tularemia. It becomes more concerning if the disease strikes more rabbits than usual, or if there is a large die-off of rabbits or signs that it's turning up in cats, she said.

Among the other animals that have also been known to become ill with tularemia are muskrats, prairie dogs, and other rodents, according to the health district. Domestic cats are very susceptible and can transmit the bacteria to people.

Untreated, tularemia can be fatal, but the disease is treatable with antibiotics, and most people recover.

Symptoms in people can include sudden fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and a skin ulcer at a bite site. Both pets and people who develop symptoms should get immediate medical attention.

To be on the safe side, Pryde advised, avoid direct contact with dead animals. "In general, if you find a dead rabbit, do not touch it," she said.

Urbana Animal Control Officer Amy Anderson said the safest way to dispose of a dead animal such as a rabbit is to wear gloves, pick it up with a shovel, double-bag the animal, and place it in the trash. Then disinfect the shovel, she said.

Experts also advise avoiding running over dead animals with tractors and lawn mowers if possible. Risk of contact with the bacteria can further be reduced by wearing masks and protective clothing when doing yard work and using insect repellent when outdoors.

[Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
