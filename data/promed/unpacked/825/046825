Horses confirmed positive for horse flu at Rosehill NSW Dept of Primary
Industries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New South Wales deputy chief veterinary officer Steve Dunn on Saturday [6
Oct 2007] confirmed that 5 horses near Rosehill racecourse have contracted
equine influenza (EI). Tests came back positive late last night after a
number of horses stabled in the north east corner away from the main
racecourse showed signs of the disease.
Mr Dunn said the sick horses were stabled with a group of 40 horses, but
said every effort would be made to prevent the virus spreading to another
240 horses stabled at the main complex. "This confirmation is another
disappointment for the racing industry, and indeed for everyone working
round the clock to prevent spread of this disease," he said.
"We will be investigating how the disease moved to the Rosehill area. Again
we must stress the importance of people adhering to the movement
restrictions and taking all necessary biosecurity precautions when moving
between horses. We can only successfully manage this outbreak if everybody
does the right thing and follows the movement and biosecurity directions."
Mr Dunn said because the Rosehill racecourse complex and surrounding
stables was located in the red zone, strict quarantine measures were
already in place. All horses in the Rosehill racecourse complex were
vaccinated a week ago [1 Oct 2007], however, as the vaccine takes about 2
weeks to be effective, strict movement controls will be in place to help
give the vaccine the best chance of having an impact. "However, we will now
be adding extra quarantine measures as of first thing this morning to
prevent any further spread of the virus to nearby racehorses, or to any
other area."
Horses at the NSW Department of Primary Industries Elizabeth Macarthur
Agricultural Institute (EMAI)'s Belgenny Farm near Camden have contracted
equine influenza (EI). The historic property had been free of the disease
but recently some horses have returned positive EI tests despite the strict
quarantine measures maintained by staff. Belgenny Farm has 11 horses, all
of which have been moved into a higher level quarantine area away from
public access. The boundaries of this area have been marked by red/white
DPI Quarantine signs.
Belgenny Farm, which is situated on the EMAI property, is a popular
function centre for weddings and other events and as a school education
centre. These functions will not be affected by the EMAI quarantine --
visitor restrictions apply to the farm area only.
EI will not infect other animals or human beings, but the virus may be
carried by people who come into close proximity to an infected horse
thereby spreading the disease to uninfected horses. The public and visitors
are not to approach any horses located within the bounds of EMAI.

A rally will be held today [6 Oct 2007] to protest against the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries' handling of the equine influenza
outbreak. It's been organised by Penny Toft who had to have a prized mare
put down this week after it suffered complications from the flu. The mare,
valued between 50 000 and 75 000 AUD [44 960 and 67 435 USD], was just a
week away from delivering a foal, which also died. Ms Toft says the DPI
failed to warn horse owners how severe the virus could be and hasn't done
enough to help. The rally will be held at Ipswich, west of Brisbane.
Meanwhile, racing in Sydney has been dealt another blow from equine
influenza (EI) with confirmation overnight the virus has spread to stables
at Rosehill. The Randwick and Warwick Farm training centres have both been
shut down in recent weeks but it had been hoped Rosehill had escaped the
disease.
More than 300 horses at the track were vaccinated 8 days ago and are due to
receive booster shots next Friday [12 Oct 2007]. The 2nd shipment of 130
000 doses of vaccine arrived in Sydney yesterday [5 Oct 2007] but the
distribution has not been finalised by the departments of Primary
Industries in NSW, Queensland and Victoria.
Racing in metropolitan Brisbane has also been halted while Victoria remains
EI free with around 4000 horses receiving their first shots last week [1-5
Oct 2007].
The 1st case of EI in Australia was confirmed in a stallion at Sydney's
Eastern Creek quarantine station on 23 Aug 2007 after it had travelled from
the northern hemisphere. The 1st session of an inquiry into how the disease
infiltrated the general horse population was held last week and public
hearings will resume early next month [November 2007].

Horses with equine flu top 30 000
---------------------------------
More than 32 000 horses in New South Wales have been infected with equine
flu, according to authorities. Figures released yesterday reveal there are
more than 3700 properties in the state with infected horses. More than 700
other properties are considered either "dangerous contact" or "suspect".
In Queensland, no precise figure for infected horses has been given, but
state authorities confirm there are 781 infected properties. The news comes
as both states continue their rollout of vaccine in buffer zones to bolster
containment efforts.
NSW Primary Industries deputy chief veterinary officer Steve Dunn said the
cooperation and community support for the vaccination program has been
outstanding. "Individual horse owners have gone out of their way to work
with us, co-operate and help," he said. "As we roll out the vaccination
campaign we are being welcomed by horse owners who are happy to have their
horses vaccinated."
Mr Dunn said staff are investigating how the disease spread to a property
at Barmedman, in the previously disease-free green zone, where 2 horses
have tested positive. The property is between West Wyalong and Temora,
about 40 km [24.8 miles] from the boundary of the amber zone. "The horse
owners in this case took early action by reporting their sick animals
immediately, which hopefully will give us a better chance of preventing
further spread," Mr Dunn said. "A red zone is being declared around the
property and the amber zone will be extended further west and south. This
will unfortunately restrict the movement of some horses which were recently
given greater freedom to move when the zones were declared."
He said it was important to keep as much of NSW free of the disease as
possible. "This setback reinforces the need for strict biosecurity when
people come in contact with horses," he said. "The horse flu virus is very
contagious because it can live on your body and your clothes for up to 48
hours and can be transmitted from humans to horses."
In Queensland, a potential problem with a batch of 4800 vials of vaccine
resulted in the state requesting a fresh supply. The 2nd shipment arrived
at the weekend [6-7 Oct 2007] and has been distributed.
Biosecurity Queensland chief veterinary officer Ron Glanville said the
problem was discovered with a shipment that arrived from Sydney by private
contractor on Saturday morning [6 Oct 2007].
One of 2 temperature sensors indicated the shipment had been below 2 deg C
[35.6 deg F]. As a live vaccine, they must be maintained at between 2 and 6
deg C [35.6 - 42.8 deg F]. The drop in temperature could reduce or even
nullify the effectiveness of the vaccine. It was feared the vaccine may
even have been frozen.
Dr Glanville said it was possible the sensor had malfunctioned. While this
was being investigated, Biosecurity Queensland was not prepared to
distribute a vaccine in which they did not have complete confidence. He
confirmed the number of infected properties at 781. "From a disease-control
perspective, the actual area bounded by known infected properties is a
better indicator of progress than the number of infected properties.
"This area is still expanding, which highlights again the need for everyone
to play their part in controlling this highly contagious disease." People
must report sick horses, he said. "We rely on people doing the right thing
not only for their own horses, but for all the horses in their community."
Several officials from Queensland's Department of Primary Industries,
including director general Jim Varghese, attended a rally at Ipswich at the
weekend, where up to 3000 people gathered to protest the handling of the
outbreak.
In other news:
* NSW authorities confirm a buffer zone is being established at Wellington,
described as a "pre-emptive move intended to stop gradual spread from
property to property and beyond".
* A total of 5 horses at a property across the road from Rosehill
Racecourse have been confirmed with the disease, in another blow to
Australian racing. Trainers based at the track are little more than 200 m
[218 yards] away. The 350 horses at the track were inoculated 9 days ago,
hopefully giving the horses some immunity.
* A further 130 000 vials of vaccine arrived in Sydney at the weekend [6-7
Oct 2007]. The strategy for its distribution has yet to be announced.

[Although the government is trying to get enough vaccine in, there are
owners in various regions who are not getting vaccine and if they are close
to the affected area this is understandably a concern. Likewise, horse
owners should take precautions by not violating stop movement orders.
People should be careful visiting friends and associates as they may be the
primary mode of transportation of bringing the virus to their own horses.
It is likely that more vaccine, substantially more vaccine is needed. It is
unfortunate that the vaccine was outside of its temperature zone. Most
vaccines remain safe out side of the temperature zone, but there is a
question as to efficacy of the vaccine. Until the determination is made as
whether the vaccine was or was not in correct temperature zone, then they
are better to hold the vaccine.
Government and veterinarians both have a role in educating horse owners on
the signs and consequences of this disease. - Mod.TG]
