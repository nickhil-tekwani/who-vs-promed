Aspirin doesn't improve chances of survival for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, according to a large study. The 120-year-old drug, which is widely used to thin the blood of heart-disease patients, made no difference in mortality after about a month in a clinical trial that involved almost 15 000 volunteers. Survivors did spend one less day in the hospital compared with those who didn't get a daily dose of aspirin, the researchers found.

Doctors were hopeful that aspirin could help combat the blood clots COVID-19 can cause in the lungs and elsewhere, but the trial results suggest the medicine will instead join the long list of treatments that can't be repurposed to combat the coronavirus. Other letdowns include the malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine and the HIV medications ritonavir and lopinavir.

"Aspirin is inexpensive and widely used in other diseases to reduce the risk of blood clots, so it is disappointing that it did not have a major impact," said Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford and one of the study's lead authors.

The trial is part of a wider program called Recovery meant to test a range of existing drugs for effectiveness against COVID. The findings have yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a medical journal. Recovery helped show that at least one other treatment, Roche Holding AG's arthritis drug Actemra, could boost patients' survival.

[Thanks to Jason Gale. Regarding the Roche Holding AG's arthritis drug:

"A drug used to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis appears to reduce the risk of death in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, especially when it was combined with the steroid dexamethasone, researchers at the University of Oxford said [11 Feb 2021].

"Oxford researchers found that the drug, tocilizumab, an intravenous medication manufactured by a division of Swiss drugmaker Roche, also shortened patients' length of stay at hospitals and reduced the need for a ventilator. The study was part of the Recovery trial, which has been testing a range of potential treatments for COVID-19 since March [2020].

"'Previous trials of tocilizumab had shown mixed results, and it was unclear which patients might benefit from the treatment,' Peter Horby, a professor at the University of Oxford and joint chief investigator for the Recovery trial, said in a statement. 'We now know that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to all COVID patients with low oxygen levels and significant inflammation.'

"A total of 2022 patients were randomly selected to receive tocilizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Actemra, by intravenous infusion and were compared with 2094 patients randomly selected to receive standard care alone. The researchers said 82% of the patients were also taking a steroid such as dexamethasone, another drug that has been found to reduce deaths in the sickest COVID-19 patients.

"Researchers said 596 patients in the tocilizumab group died within 28 days compared with 694 patients in the standard care group. That means for every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, 'one additional life would be saved,' Oxford researchers said.

"The drug increased the probability of discharge within 28 days from 47% to 54%, according to the researchers. The benefits were seen in all patients, including those requiring mechanical ventilators in an intensive care unit, they added. Among patients not on a ventilator before entering the trial, tocilizumab reduced the chance of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death from 38% to 33%, the researchers said.

"The researchers said using tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone appears to reduce mortality by about 1/3 for patients requiring oxygen and nearly 1/2 for those needing a ventilator" (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/rheumatoid-arthritis-drug-reduces-death-in-hospitalized-patients-with-severe-covid-oxford-researchers-say.html). - Mod.LK]

[2] Worldwide cases

With the introduction of 3 effective COVID-19 vaccines, daily COVID-19 case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to rapidly decline across the [USA], and new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that vaccines have been particularly beneficial for older Americans.

During a White House briefing today [8 Jun 2021], the last briefing run by COVID-19 pandemic response coordinator Andy Slavitt, who announced he was stepping down from his position today [8 Jun 2021], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH said for the 2nd week in a row, daily case averages dropped by 30%, with a 7-day average of 13 277 cases.

Most important, Walensky said, cases are down 94% from their pandemic peak in January [2021]. This was the 1st time the 7-day average was less than 15 000 since 27 Mar 2020.

Both Walensky and Anthony Fauci, MD, the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden, thanked Slavitt for his service. Slavitt was serving a special 130-day appointment with the Biden administration, and his departure was expected. Slavitt said he left with great pride in the Biden administration's handling of the pandemic and that America was now in "a situation where, if we continue to do what's in front of us, now the worst is behind us."

The United States reported 15 496 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [7 Jun 2021] and 324 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, the country has confirmed 33 385 561 COVID-19 cases, including 598 276 deaths.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 371 520 735 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 302 851 917 have been administered, with 139 748 661 Americans fully vaccinated.

As of 1 May 2021, 69% of American adults over age 65 were fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and in turn have seen a large decrease in infections, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths, according to the CDC.

Compared with case incidence at the beginning of December [2020], cases dropped by 79% by the end of April [2021] for adults over age 65. Compared with hospital admissions during the pre-vaccination period of 29 Nov-12 Dec 2020, adult COVID-19 hospital admissions rates were 63% lower among all adults, with the biggest change (78%) among adults aged older than 65 years, during the last 2 weeks of April [2021], the CDC said.

Though older Americans still represent the highest proportion of COVID-19-related deaths, deaths among those 65 and older decreased from 84.2% of all deaths during the pre-vaccination period of November and December 2020 to 68.0% during the end of April [2021].

The results should encourage all eligible Americans to get vaccinated, the authors said. "Despite sufficient vaccine supply and expanding eligibility, administration of COVID-19 vaccines has steadily declined in adults since mid-April 2021. These results suggest that tailored efforts by state and local jurisdictions to rapidly increase vaccine coverage among all eligible age groups could contribute to further reductions in COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes," the authors wrote.

While America's outbreak is on the decline, Africa's COVID-19 cases have now risen for the 4th week in a row, up 19% from the previous week, according to a weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report from the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa regional office (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/341673/OEW23-310506062021.pdf). Most cases, however, are concentrated in a few countries experiencing sharp or steady rises, including South Africa, Uganda, Eritrea, Namibia, and Zambia.

The report said Africa has only enough COVID-19 vaccine for 1% of its population, and WHO officials have warned that the region is falling behind the rest of the world in receiving vaccine supplies.

In a related development, the Mastercard Foundation today [8 Jun 2021] announced that it will donate USD 1.3 billion over the next 3 years to a partnership with the Africa Centers for Disease Control to help the region respond to and recover from the pandemic. Part of the initiative will acquire vaccines for at least 50 million people, building on the efforts of COVAX, the program designed to ensure equitable access to COVID vaccine for low- and middle-income countries.

In other global headlines:

- British officials are considering delaying the country's full reopening, originally slated for 21 Jun 2021, by up to 2 weeks to allow more people over age 50 to be fully vaccinated, as the country grapples with further spread of the more transmissible Delta (B1617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant, according to the London Times (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/june-21-lockdown-lifting-set-to-be-delayed-by-fortnight-bfvnthssj).

- Australia's Victoria state reported 2 more local COVID-19 cases in the Melbourne area yesterday [7 Jun 2021], down from 11 the day before, and officials have signaled that the 2-week circuit-breaker lockdown will likely ease on 10 Jun 2021 as planned, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-victoria-posts-fewer-locally-acquired-covid-19-cases-2021-06-07/).

- Another high-profile Japanese virologist has raised concerns about risk of further COVID-19 spread posed by the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. Hitoshi Oshitani, MD, PhD, MPH, a government advisor with Tohoku University, told the London Times that the event could spread the virus to countries that have little spread and few variant cases. In a related development, as the event draws closer and cases decline in Japan, the country's public is becoming more optimistic about the games, with a new poll suggesting that 50% think the event should proceed, up from 39% a month ago, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/08/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/#link-3WIRA7WCQNFXPJCEYRQE65PQII).

The latest global total is 173 757 407, with 3 740 257 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard.

Citation: Sanyang B, Kanteh A, Usuf E, et al. COVID-19 reinfections in The Gambia by phylogenetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants -- first two confirmed events in west Africa. Lancet Global Health. Epub 3 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00213-8

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in early 2020, the scientific community hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 transmission would eventually be hindered by herd immunity, conferred by natural infection, vaccination, or both (1 [for complete references, see source URL above]). However, essential questions about whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 confers protection against reinfection and the length of time the protection lasts after either infection or vaccination remain open. These answers are crucial for the development of appropriate health control measures worldwide and become more important as new viral variants spread.

By 15 Mar 2021, fewer than 100 reinfections had been reported worldwide, mainly in countries with a high mortality burden. In most cases, reinfections were less severe than the initial infection (2,3). However, recent reports from Brazil, a country that in parts surpassed the threshold of herd immunity after the 1st wave but had a similarly strong 2nd wave (4), are worrisome. Such resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the 2nd wave can be explained by rapid waning immunity, the expansion of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants that might evade immunity generated in response to previous infections (i.e., B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1), higher transmissibility of new lineages that require a larger herd immunity, or a combination of all these factors (4).

Reinfections in west Africa, a region with a lower toll of infections and deaths (5) than Europe, North America, or South America, are yet to be described. We aimed to ascertain whether any reinfections had occurred in The Gambia. The Gambia is the smallest country in west Africa, with 4712 cases and 150 deaths reported by 1 Mar 2021, although the number of cases is probably underestimated (5).

At that time, 460 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from confirmed cases had been sequenced in the country, with 430 (93.5%) genomes already submitted on the GISAID database (6). Among these samples, only 2 main lineages of the virus, lineages A and B, have been detected. Lineage B constitutes almost 98% of the total genomes sequenced, with the sub-lineage B.1 being the most prevalent, found in 20% of the sequences.

Naso-oropharyngeal samples are collected as part of the national surveillance and by the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia (MRCG) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine through clinical, occupational health, and research activities, including the PaTS trial (NCT04703608), from symptomatic individuals or contacts of known COVID-19 cases.

We have phylogenetically confirmed 2 reinfections among healthy Gambian individuals aged 31 years and 36 years, with a time lag of 5 months and 6 months, respectively. Both individuals had mild symptoms during the 2nd infection that lasted less than one week. For the initial infection, one individual had mild symptoms, whereas the other was asymptomatic (tested as a contact of a positive case). Epidemiological, clinical, and molecular details of both infections are shown in the table [see source URL].

In summary, our data conclude that at least 2 reinfections have occurred in The Gambia. These events have occurred in healthy young individuals infected with similar viral variants in the 1st and 2nd episodes. If reinfections with similar strains are possible, herd immunity in west Africa could take longer than expected, as a large majority of cases are asymptomatic or with mild disease, and these probably develop weaker immune responses (16). In the absence of widespread vaccination, reinfections could become more common when the new variants become predominant in the region. Community-based immunological studies are urgently needed.

[4] Haiti

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/haiti-is-the-only-country-in-western-hemisphere-without-vaccines


Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, has earned another grim distinction: it's the only one that hasn't vaccinated a single resident against COVID-19.

One of a handful of nations worldwide still awaiting vaccines, Haiti was among the 92 poor and middle-income countries offered doses under the COVAX Facility. But the government initially declined AstraZeneca PLC shots, citing side effects and widespread fears in the population.

"Haiti did not reject the offer of vaccines from COVAX," Haiti Ministry of Health General Director Laure Adrien said in a telephone interview. "All we asked was that they change the vaccine they were providing us."
By last month [May 2021] the equation had shifted. Fears about AstraZeneca were subsiding just as Haiti was seeing a surge in cases. When the country finally agreed to receive the doses, production issues in India and a spike in global demand made them unavailable.

The United Nations' Vaccine Market Dashboard -- which processes information provided by COVAX -- has no scheduled delivery date for Haiti. And Adrien said it is unclear when the vaccines will arrive.

While Haiti has reported 15 435 coronavirus cases and 325 deaths due to COVID-19, the true scope of the problem is obscured by the lack of widespread testing, she said. "We are seeing a high mortality rate, and facilities are overloaded," she said.

The dearth of vaccines is all the more striking because neighboring Dominican Republic, with which it shares the island of Hispaniola, has vaccinated almost 20% of its population. Those vaccines are only available to Dominican citizens and documented residents, leaving most of the estimated 750 000 Haitians living there ineligible.

Father Tomas Garcia, with the Fundacion La Merced, a Dominican aid agency, said vaccinating the vulnerable, regardless of their nationality, should be a priority. "This is not about saving yourself; this is about saving all of us," he said. "We're all in the same boat."

Adrien, with the Health Ministry, said it's unclear which vaccines Haiti might receive first, the COVAX doses or ones offered to the region last week by US President Joe Biden. He also argued that there's a silver lining to the late arrival of the doses. Many Haitians would have declined a shot before now due to widespread hesitancy, and the country is better prepared for the cold storage and distribution requirements, he said.

"I don't think this late onset of the vaccination program will have any impact on the recovery," Adrien said. "If we started earlier and had a failure in our vaccine program, it would be the same as if we started now and had our program succeed."

["Haiti has one of the lowest death rates from COVID-19 in the world. As of the end of April [2021], only 254 deaths were attributed to COVID-19 in Haiti over the course of the entire pandemic. The Caribbean nation, which often struggles with infectious diseases, has a COVID-19 death rate of just 22 per million. In the US, the COVID-19 death rate is 1800 per million, and in parts of Europe, the fatality rate is approaching 3000 deaths per million.

"Haiti's success is not due to some innovative intervention against the virus. Most people have given up wearing masks in public. Buses and markets are crowded. And Haiti hasn't yet administered a single COVID-19 vaccine.

"Dr. Jean 'Bill' Pape says a combination of factors have kept the death rate so low. Pape played a role similar to Dr. Anthony Fauci's in the US. The 74-year-old Haitian doctor served as the co-chair of a national commission in Haiti to deal with COVID-19, leading the country's effort to deal with the crisis. But the commission was dissolved earlier this year [2021].

"'The reason mainly is because we have very, very few cases of COVID,' Pape says. The local health agency Pape heads, known as GHESKIO, actually shuttered its COVID-19 units last fall due to a lack of patients.

"Last June [2020], the country of 11 million was hit with a significant wave of infections. Hospital wards filled with COVID-19 patients. At the time, the country only had 2 places that could test for the virus, so the actual number of infections is unknown. Now, testing is far more available, but Pape says very few cases are detected each day."

"The pandemic may have had less of an impact in Haiti, [Dr. Jacqueline Gautier, director of St. Damien Pediatric Hospital and on the national technical advisory group on COVID-19 vaccination] says, because it's a young country. The average age is 23. COVID-19 infections tend to be less severe in younger people. It's also possible, she says, that a significant number of people were infected by the virus last summer, showed no symptoms, and built up immunity. Also, houses tend to be open with plenty of ventilation: air flow can knock the pathogen out of the picture" (from https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/05/04/992544022/one-of-the-worlds-poorest-countries-has-one-of-the-worlds-lowest-covid-death-rat) - Mod.LK]
