A senior Chinese agricultural official said Monday the whole situation of the
country's battle against the bird flu epidemic remains grim. Yin Chengjie,
vice-minister of agriculture, said more cases have been caused by migratory
and wild birds. "The number of dead migratory and wild birds has reached a
record high," he told a press conference.
Citing analysis by experts, he said the source of the epidemics in
China this year is closely connected to the aforementioned birds. Yin
said the virus found in those birds [is of a higher virulence].
The virus can not only kill chickens, but also affects water birds
such as ducks and geese, which was rare in the past, he said. He
predicted that as the temperature gets colder, there will be greater
risk of bird flu outbreaks.
Yin said the epidemic also poses a growing threat to human beings, as
the 1st human case of bird flu has been reported on the Chinese
mainland.
The large number of household-raised poultry and backward methods of
chicken farming have made the prevention and control of the epidemic
more difficult, he said.
China has a long way to go to improve its avian flu prevention and
control mechanisms at the grassroots level, he said. He called for
greater efforts to prevent and control the bird flu epidemic and
resolute measures to prevent human infection.
China has now confirmed 21 bird flu outbreaks in 9 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, he told the press. The bird
flu outbreaks killed 144 624 poultry, while a further 21 184 200 were
culled, Yin said, warning that the H5N1 situation in the country was
"severe".
All poultry within a 3km radius of the affected spots have been
ordered to be culled, a measure taken by the Chinese government to
curb further outbreaks.
Jia Youlin, chief vet of the ministry, said 60 percent of chickens
have been vaccinated. He said the vaccines developed by China, if
used properly, are capable of containing the virus and preventing it
from spreading, including viruses of high pathogenicity.

A bird flu early warning system which will track migration routes of
potentially infected birds and alert countries where they are heading
was announced yesterday [20 Nov 2005]. The system will gather data
currently scattered across the world's universities, conservation
bodies and wildlife groups into one central computer.
The data base, which is expected to take 2 years to become
operational, will be constantly monitored and updated by global
experts studying migratory species. Special maps will be drawn up to
show potential bird flu hot spots, both in countries where birds have
been nesting and those to which they are migrating.
While many species vary the times of their migration, most head to
the same lakes, marshes or wetlands each year. These locations will be
identified by the new alert system, which could give otherwise
ill-prepared countries in the developing world a crucial warning that
danger is on its way.
While measures in place in developed countries may effectively
contain any outbreak, there are grave concerns that poorer countries
in Africa, Asia and Latin America may not be properly prepared.
"We will know in advance, in detail, the migratory paths of bird
species," said Marco Barbieri, scientific officer of the Convention
on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMF), which will run the
system. "This will allow specialised and more effective risk
assessment in case of any outbreaks.
"There are important gaps in our scientific knowledge about
'fly-ways' and migratory routes for some species," said Klaus
Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations Environment
Programme, which funds CMS. "We need urgently to bridge that gap. In
doing so I believe this initiative can make a valuable contribution
to the worldwide effort to deal with this threatened pandemic."

[CMF, which is to run the above-described system, has recently
published a statement pertaining to avian influenza and wild birds.
Warning against "panic responses based on the assumption that wild
birds are the only cause of avian flu", they called for
- regulation of animal markets;
- global surveillance of avian influenza in wild birds;
- precautionary suspension or restriction of the global wild bird trade;
- improved standards in poultry farms, farming and marketing
practices and enhanced quality;
- control of animal vaccines;
- identification of the precise migratory routes of waterbirds and
the highest-risk locations along different flyways.
See further article [3].
CMF, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild
Animals, issued a statement in October 2005 which included the list
of species endangered by avian influenza shown below. - Mod.AS]

African migrant species, which might be affected if avian influenza
reaches that continent. Nor does it include true seabirds, birds of
prey or passerines associated with wetland habitats, all of which may
be at some risk.

The autumn migration is essentially over.
Those who forecast wild birds would spread H5N1 (Genotype Z) to western Europe
and Africa might now ask:
How could this really be expected to happen, when wild birds can't even spread
H5N1(Z) around Asia?
(Where there have been no outbreaks in wild waterbirds, except in Russia, this
autumn; and even Russia reported just 4 individual wild birds with H5N1 of
undetermined pathogenicity).

[The newswire from China in item 1 is a reminder of the lack of clarity in the
avian influenza situation, in particular in relation to wild birds. Reporting
is rather deficient and at times ambiguous, with contradictory information
derived from different sources. While there seem to be accumulating
indications that migratory birds do play a role in the spread of H5N1, to the
best of this moderator's knowledge no smoking gun (an HPAI H5N1-Z carrier
reaching an unaffected area) has been demonstrated so far.
ProMED-mail has dedicated several postings to the issue since the
beginning of the current panzootic in December 2003. The following
birds have been named as infected (clinically or non-clinically) in
several countries:
China (People's Republic): Bar-headed geese (_Anser indicus_), Great black-
headed gulls (_Larus ichthyaetus_), Brown-headed gulls (_Larus
brunnicephalus_), Ruddy shelducks (_Tadorna ferruginea_),Great cormorants
(_Phalacrocorax carbo_).
China (Hong Kong SAR): Peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_), Grey
heron (_Ardea cinerea_), Chinese pond heron (_Ardeola bacchus_),
black-headed gull, Little Egret, Greater Flamingo, Pigeon, Tree
Sparrow, "various waterfowl".
Cambodia (zoo collection): Grey-headed fish eagle, Serpent eagle,
Hawk eagle, Spotted wood owls, Brown fish owl, Spot-bellied eagle
owl, Buffy fish owl, psittacines.
Italy: Mallard (low-pathogenic H5N1).
Japan: Crows
Korea: Magpies
Thailand: Pigeons, Open-Bill Storks, Little Cormorant, Redcollar
Dove, Scaly Breasted Munia, Black Drongo.
Mongolia: Whooper swan (_Cygnus cygnus_), Bar-headed goose (_Anser indicus_).
Croatia: swan.
Romania: heron, goose, swan.
Vietnam: Cormorants.
Russia (Omsk region, Siberia): Wild duck, Coot, Rook, Northern
shoveler, Crow, Pigeon, Sandpiper, Oyster-catcher, Little grebe,
Black-winged stilt, Phalarope, Little tern, Pied wagtail, Green
sandpiper, White headed plover, Laughing gull, Starling, Mallard,
Teal, Pochard, Garganey, Turtle dove, Buzzard, Sparrow-hawk.
The bird names are reproduced as received (A call for accurate scientific
names has been posted in 20050821.2463). The Russian data are derived from a
list provided to an OIE mission by the central all-Russian laboratory ARRIAH
in Vladimir; the listed birds, some found sick or dead, others shot, tested
PCR-positive (see 20051015.3004 and the original at
