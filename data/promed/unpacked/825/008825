Cranes found to have avian malaria
----------------------------------
A moratorium has been placed on the release of captive crowned cranes into
the wild following the discovery in KwaZulu-Natal that many of the birds
have avian malaria. It is the first time that malaria has ever been found
in the crane species, according to the South African Crane Working Group
(SACWG). Crowned cranes are listed as endangered in the Eskom Red Data index.
Although the captive birds show no symptoms, the discovery has called into
question captive bred release programs that run the risk of allowing avian
malaria a transport vector from infected captive cranes to wild cranes,
which show no signs of carrying the disease, according to Pietermaritzburg
vet Dr Oliver Tatham.
The decision to quarantine the captive cranes follows a protocol set up by
the American-based International Crane Foundation to protect wild crane
species.
Tatham first detected the plasmodium parasites [the cause of malaria] after
taking blood smears during a routine health check on captive cranes in the
Swartberg Wildlife rehabilitation centre. It is believed that, just like in
humans, the parasites are transported by mosquitoes.
Avian malaria is caused by a number of different parasites such as the
protozoans haemoproteus and plasmodium, all of which cause similar symptoms
in birds to malaria in humans. However, the significance of discovering the
disease in captive populations needs more research, Tatham added.
Centre owner Jackie Wells said that only 8 crowned cranes tested positive
for malaria, despite being caged with a blue crane.
Tatham said more knowledge is needed about wild cranes before release
programs can resume. In addition, he said that it is proving difficult to
test wild birds to see whether they carry malaria parasites. "We do not
know the situation in the wild. There is more pressure on wild cranes, as
they have to hunt and compete with other birds and deal with environmental
stress and simple flying."
Often, cranes from different parts of the country end up in the same
rehabilitation and release centre. "The danger with captive birds is that
they have different parasites from different sources. We could be releasing
Eastern Cape cranes into a Natal population, and so it is better to err on
the side of caution."
The Swartberg region is also home to the critically endangered wattled
crane species. Only 234 are thought to exist in the wild in South Africa
and there are fears that this small population could be at risk if captive
and infected crowned cranes are released and allowed to intermingle.
The South African Crane Working Group's projects manager Kerryn Morrison
said the organisation is very concerned by the presence of malaria in
captive cranes. She said that in the past captive cranes have been released
into the wild without any precautionary principles. "I am looking [towards]
completing a full disease risk assessment by the end of this year to find
out whether there is any risk in releasing rehabilitated or captive cranes
into the wild."

[According to information kindly obtained from Dr Anders Permin, from the
Danish Centre for Experimental Parasitology, Royal Veterinary and
Agricultural University, Frederiksberg, Denmark, one would always expect to
find plasmodia in wild birds, including cranes, but it would be very
unusual to see significant mortality in the infected birds.
Dr Oliver Tatham's statement that more knowledge is needed about wild
cranes before release programmes can resume is a reflection of the
currently prevailing precautionary principle. His caution and the steps
taken will be justified if indeed they are followed by the contemplated
disease risk assessment; ProMED-mail would be grateful if the results of
such could be made available.
The use of the term malaria should not mislead: as stated in the posting,
"avian malaria causes in birds symptoms which resemble malaria in humans"
-- but the parasites involved are not common to animal and man. This is not
a zoonotic disease. - Mods.EP & AS]
