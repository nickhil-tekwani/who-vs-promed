A third test has shown rabies is not the likely cause of death of a bear
cub that came into contact with as many as 400 tourists this summer,
health officials say. Some of the tourist were from as far away as Australia.
Initial tests at Iowa State University had shown the 5-month-old bear died
of rabies on 27 Aug 1999, prompting health officials to urge vaccinations
for those who could have come into contact with the potentially fatal
disease.
Days later, however, tests at 2 other laboratories were unable to reproduce
the positive rabies test. A third test -- considered more definitive -- has
also led veterinarians to believe there was no rabies danger from the bear.
"The weight of the evidence (indicates) there's a pretty low probability it
was rabies," said Gary Osweiler, director of the Veterinary Diagnostics
Laboratory in Ames.
"Granted, it was a false positive," said Nolan Hartwig, chairman of the
Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine. "But it
is so much better than if we had a false negative, given the number of
people that were reportedly exposed to that animal."
If the bear's saliva had penetrated the skin through scratches or had come
into contact with their mouth and nose, those children could have been
infected. Doctors warned that no chances should be taken and dozens of
people chose to have the shots. In some cases the shots are expensive (as
much as $4000) and some health insurance companies have elected not to
cover post-exposure prophylaxis. Once symptoms develop, rabies is always
fatal.
"Why was this mistake made?" said Robin Martin who was exposed to the cub
along with her 9-year-old daughter at the Wild Midwest Petting Zoo in
Clermont and went through a series of rabies vaccinations.
Osweiler said he couldn't explain the initial positive test. "The bottom
line is that science is never clear," he said.
