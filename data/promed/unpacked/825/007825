On Thursday, 24 June 1999, the Louisiana state Office of Public
Health reported that a 47 year old man in Bayou L'Ourse, Morgan
City, Assumption Parish (near to the St. Mary Parish border) had
been diagnosed with EEE (Eastern Equine Encephalitis) and was
hospitalised with severe symptoms. This is the first human case in
Louisiana in 3 years.
Affected horses had been reported in the parishes of Lafourche,
Terrebonne, St. John the Baptist, Assumption, and St. Charles;
affected emus are reported in Kaplan, Vermilion parish to the
immediate west, and an unverified report has some 300/500 now
dead, which is probably an exageration until a scheduled farm visit
has confirmed the situation.

more commonly seen in infants & young children. Perhaps the
patient was immunodepressed for some reason - Mod.JW]
