Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever suspect tested negative
--------------------------------------------------------
A resident of Bhiwandi has tested negative for Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection, much to the relief of his
doctors and his family. The patient has been treated at BMC's
[Bhiwandi-Nijampur Municipal Corporation] Kasturba Infectious Disease
Hospital since Friday [21 Jan 2011], after the fever scare was
strongly suspected. But when his urine and blood samples were sent to
the National Institute of Virology (NIV), they tested negative for
CCHF virus infection. With the earlier reports of CCHF claiming the
lives of 3 in Ahmedabad, this [negative test result] came as a
pleasant surprise for the clinicians.

Dr Om Shrivastava said: "[The patient's] condition is critical and he
is still on a ventilator. Even if he has tested negative for the CCHF,
it is a case of viral haemorrhagic fever and we will have to treat him
accordingly."

[In view of the CCHF risk] the Health Departments have issued
guidelines to send the samples from suspected cases of CCHF to the NIV
for thorough [laboratory] examination. CCHF is a widely-spread viral
disease, and is carried by wild as well as domestic animals. It has a
whopping 30 percent mortality rate in infected humans. This disease is
commonly characterized by nosebleeds, bloody urine, vomiting and black
stools.

[Bhiwandi is a city in the district of Thane, in the Indian state of
Maharashtra, located 20 km to the north-east of Mumbai and 15 km to
the north-east of Thane city. Thus the patient who is now being
treated in Kasturba Infectious Disease Hospital comes from the same
district of Maharashtra as the 1st suspected case of CCHF. Fortunately
clinical samples from both patients have tested negative for CCHF virus.

The illness of the 1st case is thought now not to have had an
infectious cause. The 2nd case, described above, is still considered
to be suffering from a so far unidentified viral haemorrhagic fever.
Further information on the cause of this patient's illness is awaited.
