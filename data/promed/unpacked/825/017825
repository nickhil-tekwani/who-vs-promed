The signs of Senecavirus A_ (SVA), a disease that mimics foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), is gaining a foothold in the US swine industry. That's why producers need to be more vigilant than ever when they see signs of blisters or lesions on the skin of pigs, says Dr Jack Shere, DVM, with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

In a phone interview on Wed 6 Dec 2017, he told Farm Journal's PORK he has seen an alarming increase in the number of cases of SVA investigations this year [2017]. In fact, in 2015 there were a total of 200 cases in the country, but this year, there were 300 cases in Wisconsin alone.

He says most of the cases have been in Midwestern states, where there is more movement of pigs, but he has also seen cases from other states, including Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and even California.

"A case of FMD in the US would be devastating to livestock producers," Shere says. "That's why it's so important for producers to work with their veterinarian to make sure animals with these symptoms are tested."

What it looks like
------------------
Pipestone System [sow management company] reports common clinical signs associated with vesicular diseases like SVA include:
- open or closed blisters located on the snout and/or at the junction where the skin and the hoof wall meet (coronary band);
- sudden lameness with redness and swelling at or around the coronary band. Some cases have reported up to 50 percent of the population being affected at one time.
- Pigs that are suddenly off feed, lethargic, and/or have a fever up to 105 deg F [40.6 deg C].

"If you see any of these clinical signs or are concerned, please contact your veterinarian immediately and stop any movement of animals from your facility," says Dr Scott VanderPoel with Pipestone. "Your veterinarian will then contact the necessary authorities and samples will need to be collected for a diagnostic investigation."

VanderPoel adds that it is very important to identify animals with these clinical signs before they are moved.

"If these animals were to be transported to a harvest facility, the facility would then have to be temporarily shut down due to a concern of a foreign animal disease," he says. "Again, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the disease of concern and it is important to you and the animal industry this disease is not missed."

What it is
----------
Senecavirus A is a small, non-enveloped picornavirus, unknown until 2002 when it was discovered incidentally as a cell culture contaminant, reports the Swine Health Information Center. Only a single species is classified in the genus _Senecavirus_. The family Picornaviridae also contains foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMD) and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV).

When pigs have SVA, their signs can mimic those of FMD, which creates a big problem. Shere wants to make sure producers don't become complacent in recognizing and testing for the virus. While all tests have proven to be SVA and not FMD, the industry must make sure it stays that way.

"As pigs break with the virus, we test for both senecavirus A and foot-and-mouth disease," Shere says. All samples go to Plum Island [in Suffolk county, New York], where a battery of foreign animal disease tests are run. Once negative for FMD, the animals can be released for movement.

There is no vaccine for SVA but a PCR test can be run in a matter of hours. State labs are able to run the test, and USDA works closely with state veterinarians to monitor farms that have the virus. If SVA is suspected, a foreign animal disease diagnostician is dispatched to test the animals.

Don't take chances
------------------
The trade implications surrounding this issue are significant, because just one case of FMD would be devastating to the pork and beef industries in the US.

"Every day is important -- every move is important," Shere says. "We don't want to get complacent. Be vigilant, call authorities if you see blisters, lesions, or other clinical signs consistent with FMD or SVA, and make sure proper testing is done to ensure is animals are moved, they are moved under the right circumstances."

[Senecavirus A is also known as Seneca Valley virus.

The resemblance of the 2 diseases is disturbing and requires extreme valiance. Failure to notice these lesions could result in unnecessary quarantines and stoppage of trade. A costly mistake and one that would cause much worry to producers, as well as agricultural officials and trading partners.

The following has been extracted from the Journal of Veterinary Science and Technology. The full text, including photos and references. is available at http://www.omicsonline.org/seneca-valley-virus-and-vesicular-lesions-in-a-pig-with-idiopathic-vesicular-disease-2157-7579.1000123.pdf.

"Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae. It is closely related to the genus _Cardiovirus_, and has been recently proposed to be classified in the genus _Senecavirus_, along with other closely related porcine picornaviruses [1]. Seneca Valley virus is a newly discovered virus that was originally isolated as a contaminant in cell culture medium; its complete genome sequence and structure have been recently published [1,2]. Furthermore, SVV has been reported to be associated with cases of idiopathic vesicular disease in pigs originating from several different locations in Manitoba [Canada] [3]. Several cases of non-debilitating erosions and vesicles on the snout, oral cavity, skin, and coronary bands have been infrequently described in pigs over many years without an identifiable cause and thus, were grouped under 'swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD) syndrome' [4].

Outbreaks of SIVD are primarily observed between the spring and fall months [3]. SIVD grossly and histologically resembles vesicular foreign animal diseases, which are clinically and economically important. Cases of SIVD have been reported in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Florida, Iowa and most recently Indiana [3,5-8]. In the most recent cases, vesicular foreign animal diseases were ruled out, and testing for other infectious diseases and microscopic evaluation of the lesions did not reveal a causative agent [3,5]. Similar vesicular lesions in pigs have been associated with the feeding of murine products in Australia and feeding of _Sclerotinia sclarotiorum_-infected celery, parsnips and carrots from New Zealand [7,8]. Other potential causes for vesicular lesions in pigs include porcine parvovirus, porcine enterovirus group III, calicivirus (San Miguel sea lion virus), mycotoxins and contact dermatitis [9-13]. The purpose of this report is to provide more descriptive pathology obtained from an isolated and sporadic case of idiopathic vesicular disease in a pig. In this pig, SVV was identified from the vesicular lesions by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."
