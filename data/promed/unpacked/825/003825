The following statement was released by officials of Wright County
Egg regarding the FDA's on-farm records review and egg testing for salmonellae.

Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa is voluntarily recalling specific
Julian dates of shell eggs produced by their farms because they have
the potential to be contaminated with salmonellae.

Eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers,
distribution centers and foodservice companies in California,
Illinois, Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and
Iowa. These companies distribute nationwide.

Eggs are packaged under the following brand names: Lucerne,
Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Sunshine, Hillandale,
Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms, and Kemps.
Eggs are packed in varying sizes of cartons (6-egg cartons, dozen egg
cartons, 18-egg cartons) with Julian dates [a 3-digit code that
represents the consecutive day of the year starting with 1 Jan as 001
and ending with 31 Dec as 365] ranging from 136 to 225 and plant
numbers 1026, 1413, and 1946. Dates and codes can be found stamped on
the end of the egg carton. The plant number begins with the letter P
and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for
example: P-1946 223.

There have been confirmed _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis illnesses relating to the shell eggs and traceback
investigations are ongoing.

Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDA's investigation by
undertaking this voluntary recall. Our primary concern is keeping
_Salmonella_ out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a
precautionary measure, Wright County Egg also has decided to divert
its existing inventory of shell eggs to a breaker, where they will be
pasteurized to kill any bacteria present.
