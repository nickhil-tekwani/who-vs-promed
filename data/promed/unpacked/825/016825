2001/082 Surveys on _Ralstonia solanacearum_ in Slovenia
-------------------------------
Since 1996, systematic surveys for _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs,
EPPO A2 quarantine pest) have been carried out in Slovenia on both
imported and domestic potatoes (seed and ware potatoes). From 1996
to 1999, 858 samples were tested and Rs was detected only in 4
consignments of imported early ware potatoes.
In 2000, 647 samples were tested (277 [imported... and 190 [domestic
seed and ware potatoes). ... one sample of domestic ware potatoes was
confirmed as being latently infected by Rs (tested tubers showed no
symptoms). This sample had been collected in the northern part of
Slovenia from stored ware potatoes originating from imported basic
seed potatoes. ... [Of several growers ... only one producer ... had
planted the potatoes ... for seed potato production, [yielding ... 6 tons
of certified seed potatoes in 2000. ... [Results of additional tests ... to
determine ... disease [extent were negative.
... According to ... EU Directive 98/57/EC, ... [all ... seed potatoes ...
multiplied from the imported lot ... and 106 tons of other cultivars ...
stored in the same storehouse as ware potatoes were destroyed.
Storehouses, machinery and packaging material were disinfected. In
fields where the imported seed lot was planted, production of potato,
tomato, Brassica and other host plants of Rs was prohibited for the next
4 years, and elimination of volunteer plants and weed hosts was
ordered. In 4 years time, ... only ware production will be permitted
using certified seed potatoes. [Surveys will continue in 2001 ... with
special emphasis on fields which had been planted with the imported
lot ... and their surroundings.

[According to scientists at the International Potato Center in Peru,
bacterial wilt or brown rot limits potato production worldwide in Asia,
Africa, and Central and South America, where it causes severe crop
losses in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions. The disease
may also occur in cooler climates such as relatively high elevations in
the tropics or higher latitudes. The bacterium affects more than 30 plant
families, including crops and wild species.
There is no effective chemical control for bacterial wilt. Disease
management involves planting of healthy seed in clean soil and
planting of tolerant varieties, in rotation with non-susceptible crops, as
well as the application of various sanitation and cultivation practices.
Such an integrated disease management approach can lead to
significant reduction, or even eradication of bacterial wilt.
