The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 30 Oct 2018:
- A total of 279 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 244 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 244 confirmed, 144 died and 81 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 51 suspected cases under investigation.
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni and 1 in Vuhovi. Vuhovi is a new health zone located between Beni and Butembo. He [the Vuhovi case] is the husband of a confirmed case who died at Butembo ETC on 26 Oct 2018. He refused to follow up and transfer to ETC. He died at the Vuhovi health center where the sample was taken.
- 4 new confirmed deaths, including 2 in Beni, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Vuhovi.
- 7 new healed cases, including 6 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.
- 5679 contacts followed to date.

News of the response
Active search of cases in health facilities
-------------------------------------------
- Investigations in recent weeks in Beni revealed that many traditional medicine centers are late referring suspected cases to the ETC. In order to overcome this problem, the surveillance has set up a new active case search strategy in the city's 254 public and private health facilities. Thus, every day, surveillance officers visit the various health facilities in Beni to examine hospitalized patients and determine whether the clinical picture corresponds to the Ebola virus disease. During their visit to the health facilities, they also review the patient's register being passed out to identify potential suspected cases. This active search strategy of cases explains the significant increase of the isolated suspect cases and taken in recent days in Beni. On average, surveillance teams visit 140 health facilities a day.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 August 2018, 24 863 people have been vaccinated, including 13 015 in Beni [North Kivu], 4391 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2002 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1355 in Butembo [North Kivu], 690 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 227 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], 110 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], and 100 in Mutwanga [North Kivu].

External situation report 13 -- data as reported by 28 Oct 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored by the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners. Of concern is the increased incidence of confirmed cases reported in the past four weeks, most notably in the city of Beni and communities around Butembo. Security remains the biggest challenge faced by the response teams in Beni and Butembo, undermining the response activities. Continued security incidents severely impact both civilians and frontline workers, forcing suspension of EVD response activities and increasing the risk that the virus will continue to spread. Moreover, with heightened transmission of the virus in outbreak affected areas, the risk of exportation of cases to neighbouring provinces and countries is increased. Neighbouring countries need to be ready in case the outbreak spreads beyond the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Since WHO's last situation report issued on 23 Oct 2018 (external situation report 12), an additional 36 new confirmed EVD cases and 19 new deaths have been reported. As of 28 Oct 2018, a total of 274 confirmed and probable EVD cases, including 174 deaths, have been reported --a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 63.5%. Among the 274 cases, 239 are confirmed and 35 are probable cases. Of the 174 deaths reported since the beginning of the outbreak, 139 were among confirmed cases and 35 among probable cases. The proportion of deaths among confirmed cases is 58.2% (139/239). On 28 October, 32 new suspected cases were under investigation in Beni (22), Mabalako (3), Butembo (3), Mandima (2), Masereka (1), and Kalunguta (1).

As of 28 Oct 2018, 73 cases have recovered, been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), and reintegrated into their communities. On 28 October, 32 new patients were admitted to ETCs, bringing the total of hospitalized patients to 77 (45 suspected cases and 32 confirmed cases). On that day, the ETCs in Beni and Butembo recorded a bed occupancy rate of 85% (51/60) and 70% (13/30), respectively.

Among the 271 cases with known age and sex, 56% (n=153) are female, and adults aged 15-44 account for 57% (n=155) (Figure 2). Four new confirmed cases have been reported among healthcare providers (one doctor and 3 nurses) working at various community health centres around Beni, bringing the total health workers affected to 25, including 24 confirmed and three deaths.

The confirmed cases were reported from 6 health zones in North Kivu province: Beni (124), Mabalako (71), Butembo (24), Masereka (4), Kalunguta (2), and Oicha (2); and 3 health zones in Ituri province: Mandima (9), Tchomia (2), and Komanda (1). Beni has surpassed Mabalako in terms of cumulative number of confirmed cases.

The MoH, WHO, and partners are monitoring and investigating all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in the Gambia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

[As always, the weekly WHO/AFRO external situation report is worth reviewing, not least for its excellent multicolor tables, graphs, and maps. Figure 1, the number of Ebola cases by week, shows the dramatic increase in October 2018 that followed armed insurgent attacks in the Beni area. This does not include the upsurge in cases over this past weekend (27-28 Oct 2018), which is continuing as shown in the latest DRC MOH daily updates above. Week-by-week data on the percentage of new cases that are known contacts of prior Ebola cases would also be useful, as there has been an alarming decline in this metric over the last month. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Vaccines: Merck vaccine effectiveness in DR Congo
Date: Tue 30 Oct 2018
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/astmh/76018


Experience so far with Merck & Co.'s officially investigational Ebola vaccine, rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP, suggests it's been effective in quelling the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) stubbornly ongoing outbreak. Or not.

Merck's Jakub Simon, MD, MS, addressing a session at the American Society of Tropical Medicine's (ASTMH) annual meeting here [in New Orleans], showed 2 charts tracking Ebola during this past spring's [2018] outbreak in the DRC's Equateur province and the subsequent one now raging in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces [1]. In both, health workers on the ground have been using the Merck vaccine in a so-called ring vaccination strategy to contain the epidemic. Although not yet formally approved for marketing, the vaccine has been cleared for emergency use.

In Equateur, immediately after vaccination began with the Merck product, the outbreak petered out.

But the experience in North Kivu and Ituri has been quite different. Although new cases dropped significantly after vaccination began in early August [2018], they never approached zero, and 2 months later they rocketed back to the level seen before vaccinations began. (They have since dropped again.)

Simon suggested that the widely reported difficulties faced by health workers in North Kivu and Ituri have made the ring vaccination less effective. Armed rebels have been active in the 2 provinces, killing dozens of villagers and preventing aid teams from reaching some areas.

He said World Health Organization (WHO) officials have told him they think the vaccine is effective. But the reality is that no one can yet be sure to what extent the vaccination campaign, versus other public health efforts, helped end the Equateur outbreak, or how much it might be helping in North Kivu and Ituri given the roller-coaster numbers.

At the same time, another presentation at ASTMH following Simon's gave the vaccine some limited support.

Katie Ewer, PhD, of the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute in England, reported findings from her lab on rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP and 2 vaccine combinations that use different products [2]. Her data confirmed that Merck's vaccine does induce strong immune responses in clinical trial settings -- but not as durably as the other approaches, which combine 2 different vaccine types, both of which differ from Merck's.

The Merck product uses a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) engineered to express Ebola virus antigens. The 2 combinations on which Ewer reported include vaccine candidates based on engineered adenoviruses followed by boosters using a modified vaccinia virus -- all engineered, like the Merck product, to display Ebola virus antigens.

Ewer's bottom line: the 2-punch vaccine combinations provoked anti-Ebola immune responses that were at least as strong as that from the Merck product, and were longer-lasting when study participants were re-examined 24-36 months later. Notably, however, these were data from healthy volunteers in phase I trials.

Study details
-------------
Most of Simon's presentation at ASTMH centered on lab data regarding the rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine. The most recent involved immune responses with different production batches of the vaccine, intended to show that Merck's manufacturing process is consistent and reliable. That appears to have been achieved, as chart after chart showed virtually identical results with each of four lots tested.

The more interesting part came at the end, when he showed timelines of Ebola cases during the DRC's 2018 outbreaks (daily in Equateur, weekly for North Kivu and Ituri).

In Equateur, over about 3 weeks prior to initiation of ring vaccination, there were from one to 5 new cases almost every day. The day after vaccination began on [21 May 2018], there were none. Nor the next day, nor the day after. In fact only 2 more cases were seen in the province after [21 May 2018].

The North Kivu/Ituri outbreak has proved far worse. It began just as the Equateur outbreak was subsiding, with a case here or there until mid-July [2018], when the weekly new-case count began hitting double digits. It topped out at nearly 40 the week ending [6 Aug 2018], when vaccination began. At that point it dropped to the 5-10 range for several weeks, before soaring again to more than 30 the week ending [1 Oct 2018]. More recently, according to the WHO (who provided all these data), it has returned to the 5-10 range per week.

Simon told the ASTMH audience that Merck never expected the vaccine to have 100% efficacy. "Few vaccines do," he said. "We expect a few breakthrough cases."

With regard to future steps leading to formal approvals, he said Merck was pulling together the data from all the trials (12 in total). He didn't give a timeline for the company's regulatory applications, but said the company now has all the clinical data it intends to submit.

Ewer's talk centered on single-dose rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP; an adenovirus-based candidate called ChAd3 EBO Z followed by the engineered vaccinia product MVA BN-Filo; and AdHu26.ZEBOV, also using an adenovirus carrier, followed by MVA BN-Filo.

Mean antibody titers evaluated 2-3 years after dosing were similar among the 3 regimens, and the percentage of patients found to be seropositive for Ebola antibodies appeared to favor the Merck product (75% versus 54%/57% for the combinations).

But Ewer said the more clinically significant ELISPOT assay for cell-based responsiveness clearly favored the 2-dose adenovirus-vaccinia combination approach:
- AdHu26.ZEBOV/MVA BN-Filo: 92%
- ChAd3 EBO Z/MVA BN-Filo: 100%
- rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP: 63%

"Booster doses substantially expand the effector CD8+ T cell response," she concluded.

For clinical application, Ewer said durable vaccine effectiveness is probably most important for healthcare workers in at-risk areas, who may expect repeated Ebola exposures, although it will matter too for ordinary residents of those areas.

[Available evidence from the field certainly indicates that the Merck vaccine is effective in protecting against Ebola, but for all the confounding reasons given above and more, it may prove impossible to determine its precise efficacy in the current North Kivu-Ituri DRC outbreak. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that Merck has enough clinical data from 12 trials to submit an application for formal regulatory approval. - Mod.LXL]

[4] Experimental treatments: more than half of treated patients in DR Congo survived
Date: Tue 31 Oct 2018
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/health/ebola-congo-treatments.html


Experimental new treatments for Ebola appear to be working effectively in the most recent outbreak in Central Africa, an expert reported at a medical conference [in New Orleans] on [Wed 31 Oct 2018].

The death rate was 43 percent among patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo who received one or more of 4 experimental treatments, said Dr William A Fischer II, an emergency care specialist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

If the count excluded Ebola patients who were within hours of death when they arrived at the hospital, the fatality rate would be 32 percent, he added.

By contrast, about 68 percent of Ebola patients in hospitals before the new treatments were approved had died.

Effective treatments, combined with a new vaccine, may revolutionize efforts to turn back Ebola, one of the world's deadliest plagues. The vaccine itself protects health care workers tending to patients, as well as family members and others who have been in contact with them and may be infected.

"I do think the tide is changing," said Dr Fischer, as he presented preliminary data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. "I do think we're in a new world."

Dr Fischer has treated Ebola patients in [DR Congo]'s current outbreak and in previous ones, including the epidemic in West Africa that began 2013 and ultimately killed about 11 000 people.

Of the 276 known victims in [DR Congo]'s outbreak, only 113 patients who reached hospitals after [12 Aug 2018] have received any of the new treatments. The results were very preliminary, Dr Fisher acknowledged, and it is too early to draw firm conclusions about how well each of the 4 treatments works.

In early animal trials, all 4 treatments worked 90 percent to 100 percent of the time in rhesus monkeys who received them up to 5 days after infection with Ebola.

The 4 treatments are: remdesivir, an antiviral drug; mAb114, a human antibody cloned from a survivor of an outbreak years ago in Zaire; REGN-EB3, a cocktail of cloned human antibodies; and ZMapp, a cocktail of antibodies made from a blend of human and mouse proteins.

Remdesivir can be injected quickly, but must be given once daily for 10 days. ZMapp must be given for 3 days in infusions lasting up to 5 hours. The 2 others, mAb114 and REGN-EB3, are given in single infusions.

Remdesivir works against all strains of Ebola. The others, as far as is known, work only against the Zaire strain of the virus.

Depending on conditions, different treatments and combinations are used in different patients at the 3 treatment centers in [DR Congo], Dr Fischer said.

Serious side effects appear to be few. Some patients receiving treatment have experienced headaches, fever, and rapid heartbeats.

Some of the experimental treatments need refrigeration, and not all are available at all sites. Moreover, there are not always enough medical workers on hand to oversee infusions, which must be given very slowly to avoid the risk of anaphylactic shock -- an overwhelming immune reaction to foreign proteins.

The North Kivu outbreak seems to have begun in April or May [2018]. On [31 Jul 2018], human samples tested positive for Ebola, and the outbreak was officially declared. Health officials in [DR Congo] approved all 4 treatments in August [2018].

All the approvals were "investigational," meaning that the treatments are experimental but there is evidence they work in animals and are likely to be safe and effective in humans.

An unusual number of children have been infected with Ebola in [DR Congo], Dr Fischer said. Local health workers suspect that many visited traditional healers for treatment of malaria and were infected with Ebola by other patients there.

As word spreads that effective new treatments are available, he added, Congolese health officials hope that patients will turn first to medical clinics instead.

[These data showing a substantially lower mortality rate in treated patients, though admittedly very preliminary, are highly encouraging. However, there are numerous potential confounding factors that may inhibit statistical analysis of efficacy. "Different treatments and combinations used in different patients" is anything but a randomized clinical trial, and what criteria are being used to select specific treatments in each individual case is as yet a mystery. Moreover, one of the outstanding features of the current DRC outbreak is its high mortality rate (114/225 = 64% as of the 31 Oct 2018 MOH update), which is substantially higher than the approximately 40% overall mortality rate in the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic. The death rate in the Congolese patients who have received experimental treatments thus far also appears to be about 40%. These patients have been treated only at sites with adequate refrigeration and enough medical workers to oversee experimental infusion therapies, so they may be receiving closer and better care in general, thus improving their survival chances independent of potential benefits from receiving the test drugs. - Mod.LXL
