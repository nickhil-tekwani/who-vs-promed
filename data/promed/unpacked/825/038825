Grape disease prompts call for US import ban
--------------------------------------------
A[n outbreak of [Pierce's disease of grapes [caused by _Xylella
fastidiosa_ in California has prompted [the Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service, AQIS to call for [a ban on the importation of table
grapes from the United States. [AQIS last year approved the importation of
grapes [from California after a 10-year application process. However, it
was now reassessing its decision [in light of the California outbreak of the
bacterial disease which kills grape vines.
New South Wales Country Labor MLC Tony Kelly said the disease had caused
millions of dollars in damage to the US grape industry and could similarly
devastate the NSW industry. [He also said that almost 4000 jobs rely
directly on NSW grapes, [and that it is simply too big a risk to take.
[According to Kelly, NSW accounted for almost a quarter of Australia's $736
million grape industry.

[AQIS completed a comprehensive import risk analysis in early January 2000
that laid down strict guidelines for importation of table grapes from
California. Of major concern is the glassy-winged sharpshooter
(_Homalodisca coagulata_) the vector of _Xylella fastidiosa_, the bacterium
that causes Pierce's disease of grape and other crops. Two options for pest
control were proposed by AQIS. Option A incorporates year-round,
pre-shipment methyl bromide fumigation (MBr), and Option B incorporates MBr
fumigation of consignments of table grapes arriving from June to September
through Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. This period coincides with
low pest activity and dormancy of the grape crop in these ports of entry,
according to AQIS Executive Director Paul Hickey. Because the Australian
grape season does not coincide with the California grape season, there will
be no competition with the California exports.
