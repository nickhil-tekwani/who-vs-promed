The carcass of a wild elephant found inside Joypur reserve forest in Assam's Dibrugarh district last week has tested positive for anthrax, the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said Wednesday [9 Dec 2020]. Though the highly infectious disease caused by the bacteria called _[Bacillus] anthracis_ had earlier been detected in cattle in the state, this is likely to be the 1st confirmed case of anthrax in wild elephants in Assam.

Forest officials had found the carcass of a sub-adult female aged nearly 10 years in the Soraipung range of the forest on 3 Dec 2020. Two days later [5 Dec 2020], the carcass of another female elephant aged around 18-20 years was found few hundred metres away from the spot where the 1st carcass was found. Both elephants are believed to be from the same herd.

Usually, carcasses of wild elephants are buried, but since forest officials suspected the deaths to be due to anthrax, the 2 elephants were cremated using safety measures. "We had conducted [necropsies] on both the elephants along with veterinarians from the state forest department. The lab result of the autopsy of the 1st elephant has tested positive for anthrax," said Khanin Changmai, a veterinarian with the WTI. "We are still waiting for result of the [necropsy] of the 2nd elephant. Though there have been cases of anthrax infection in livestock, this could be the 1st case of the disease in wild elephants in Assam," he added.

Senior forest officials did not respond to calls on what measures have been taken following detection of anthrax.

[The "calf" reported in the previous report of 8 Dec 2020 (20201208.8003277) was clearly misidentified. A 10-year-old elephant is not a calf, rather a juvenile or sub-adult, and would be subject to the same risks as a full adult elephant. These may be the 1st confirmed anthrax deaths of elephants in Assam, but there have been cases among other wildlife species, albeit at a low frequency. If the WTI veterinarian says there have been earlier bovine deaths from anthrax, it raises the suspicion that these 2 elephants might be secondary cases.
