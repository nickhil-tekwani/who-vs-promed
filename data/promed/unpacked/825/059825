During the past week [24 Feb-2 Mar 2014], 601 suspected measles cases were reported, primarily from 23 woredas [districts] in North and South Gonder, East and West Gojam, and North Wello in Amhara (446 cases). The remaining cases were reported from SNNP [Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Regions] (67) Oromia (56) and Tigray (6) regions, and Addis Ababa (16) and Harar (6). In light of the continuing increase of measles cases in Amhara and newly reported measles cases among the refugee and host populations in Gambella, partners are reviewing the national response plan to widen the target population for measles vaccinations. In Gambella, a mass measles vaccination campaign started on 27 Feb 2014. WHO continues to mobilize funds for the measles vaccination campaign targeting 6.8 million children under-15 in Oromia, SNNP, and Somali regions. The campaign was initially planned for 11 Jan 2014.

[This event warrants an epidemiological investigation, but in the meantime adequate and appropriate treatment and care should be accorded to all the cases to prevent further deaths. Skilled clinical and nursing care along with the recommended medicines for providing supportive care are therefore a priority in the immediate term.

Ottawa Public Health is notifying the public after they confirmed that an unimmunized child returning from a trip to the Philippines had contracted measles.

The public health agency is advising all people who may have come in contact with the child to tell their doctor and, if they develop symptoms of measles, to seek medical attention. Ottawa Public Health said the child attends St Stephen Catholic School in Stittsville. The public healthy agency said they are working with the school and school board to notify exposed students.

The child was also in the following medical locations last week:
- 25 Feb 2014, 8:45 am to noon: Med-Team Clinic, 103-99 Kakulu Road.
- 27 Feb 2014, 9:30 am to 1 pm: Active Care Clinic, 1108 Klondike Road.
- 28 Feb 2014, noon to 2:20 pm: CHEO [Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario] emergency department.

Measles can lead to ear infections, pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and even death, and is more severe in adults and infants.

There are no other reported cases at the present time, Ottawa Public Health said. The last case of measles reported in Ottawa was in February 2011 and was travel-related.

People who believe they have measles should isolate themselves and call before visiting a doctor so they can take precautions to protect other patients, Ottawa Public Health said.

Ottawa Public Health is investigating a 2nd case of measles in the city, after a classmate of the 1st child to contract the virus became ill and showed similar symptoms.

Last week [week of 3 Mar 2014] the public health agency said a primary student from the Stittsville school had been diagnosed with measles after returning from the Philippines. The child had not been immunized against measles.

A dozen unimmunized students from the school were also told to stay home from class until [18 Mar 2014]. Because of the 2nd case, that period has been extended until 26 Mar 2014.

Parents can choose to not immunize their children for philosophical, religious or medical reasons.

Ottawa Public Health said secondary cases of measles are not uncommon as it is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease. "We strongly encourage all residents to consider vaccination as a way to protect themselves and their families against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases," the public health agency wrote in a statement Monday [10 Mar 2014].

Measles can lead to ear infections, pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and even death. It is more severe in adults and infants.

The Fraser Health Authority is warning that a measles outbreak is spreading outside the original school and religious groups. Chief Medical Health Officer Dr Paul Van Buynder says one child from the Fraser Valley [in southwestern British Columbia] has been admitted to hospital so far. "We're worried that this now going to spread into the younger age groups. We've had one hospitalization of a young 9-year-old child to date, but if this continues, we expect that we'll see more severe disease in younger children."

He says the best protection against the disease is 2 doses of vaccine. Arrangements are being made to have more vaccine distributed to doctors and pharmacies from Abbotsford to Hope, and vaccination clinics are being set up.

The authority says children under 5 years old are the most at risk of serious disease and need to get a vaccinated.

Word of the outbreak came last weekend [8-9 Mar 2014] when the authority reported that 2 students at one independent school in Chilliwack [seat of the Fraser Valley Regional District ] had measles.

State health officials announced Friday [14 Mar 2014] that the number of measles cases in California was far higher compared to the same time last year.

The California Department of Public Health confirmed 32 such cases so far this year [2014], compared to 3 measles cases reported over the same period in 2013. The uptick in cases comes amid a record-setting flu season. And the threat of transmission increases among foreign travelers who come from areas experiencing outbreaks, such as the Philippines. "We can expect to see more imported cases of this vaccine-preventable disease," said Dr Ron Chapman, state health officer and director of the Public Health Department.

At least 10 cases were reported in Los Angeles County, 7 cases were reported in Orange County, and 5 in San Mateo County, officials say. Alameda and Santa Clara counties each reported one case and Contra Costa County reported four such cases, officials said.

At least 7 cases included people who traveled to the Philippines, where a large outbreak is occurring. 2 others had traveled to India and another to Viet Nam, where measles is endemic. Officials say immunization is the best defense against measles. In fact, they say the high immunization rates in California have kept preventable childhood diseases, such as measles, at record lows during the last 20 years.

A small outbreak of measles has grown, with a man potentially exposing others at 4 locations, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced Wednesday [12 Mar 2014]. The unidentified man is the 3rd person to catch measles from someone who contracted the illness while visiting the Philippines, according to the HHSA [Health and Human Services Agency].

The agency said the new victim might have exposed others on
- 3-7 Mar 2014 and 10 Mar 2014 at the Veterans' Affairs Clinic on Third Avenue in Chula Vista;
- 3 Mar and 9 Mar 2014, between 6:30 pm and 10:30 pm at the 24 Hour Fitness at 870 Amena Court in Chula Vista;
- 5 Mar 2014 between 6:30 pm and 9:30 pm and 9 Mar 2014, between 5 pm and 8 pm at Mater Dei Catholic Church at 1571 Magdalena Ave. in Chula Vista;
- 9 Mar 2014 from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm at the Navy Exchange main store at Navy Base San Diego.

"Anyone who was at any of the specific locations should watch for symptoms and contact their health care provider by phone if they show any signs of the disease," said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer. "We ask people with symptoms to phone their doctor's office in advance, rather than visit an office directly, so that infection control measures may be implemented to prevent exposure to others."

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 2 doses of the vaccine: the 1st at 12 months of age, and the 2nd between ages 4 to 6 years.

Complications from measles are more common in children younger than 5 years old and adults 20 years and older, and include diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Death can occur from severe complications and the risk is higher among younger children and adults, according to the HHSA.

There is no treatment for measles, with bed rest, fluids, and fever control measures recommended for patients. People with complications may need treatment for their specific problem.

Information about measles and vaccinations is available by calling the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visiting the website at http://www.sdiz.org. People without a health provider can contact the HHSA Epidemiology Branch at (619) 692-8499.

Two more people in Orange County got measles in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in the county to 7 since December [2013].

The county's Health Care Agency reported Friday [14 Mar 2014] that the 2 most recent cases visited numerous public places around the county during the time they were infectious.

Following exposure, symptoms normally appear within 7 to 10 days. The rash sets in 2 to 4 days later, usually starting around the ears and hairline, then moving to the face, torso, and limbs. Measles is contagious between about 4 days before the rash appears until about 4 days afterward, so other people might have been exposed at the places where patients have visited.

Here's a list of the known sites the 2 latest cases went, with dates and times:
- 3 Mar 2014, 9:30 to 11 am and 7 Mar 2014 1:30 to 3 pm: St. Joseph Heritage Healthcare Medical Office, 4300 Rose Drive, Suite D, Yorba Linda;
- 4 Mar 2014, 1-3 pm: Panda Express, 27602 Antonio Pkwy., Suite G3, Ladera Ranch;
- 5 Mar 2014, 9:30 to 11:30 am: Friends Christian Elementary School, 5151 Lakeview Ave., Yorba Linda;
- 6 Mar 2014, 6:30 to 9 pm: Robinson Ranch School, 21400 Lindsay Drive, Trabuco Canyon;
- 8 Mar 2014, 11:30 am to 1 pm: Placentia-Linda Hospital Emergency Department, 1301 N. Rose Drive, Yorba Linda;
- 9 Mar 2014, 1 to 2:30 pm: Kids Doc, 27800 Medical Center Road, Mission Viejo;
- 9 Mar 2014, 9:50 am to 3:45 pm and 10 Mar 2014, 11:25 am to 12:30 pm: Mission Hospital, Mission Viejo, Emergency Department, 27700 Medical Center Road., Mission Viejo;
- 10 Mar 2014, 11:25 am to 11 Mar 2014, 4:30 pm: Mission Hospital, Mission Viejo, CHOC Pediatric Medical Surgical Department, 27700 Medical Center Road, Mission Viejo.

Measles is rare in the United States, but cases are up sharply this season, including around California. In a normal year, Orange County will have no more than one case.

"We expect to see additional measles cases in Orange County, increasing the likelihood that you and your family may be exposed to the disease," Dr Eric Handler, the county's Public Health Officer, said in a statement. "These new measles cases underscore the importance of making sure that you and your families are up to date with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination."

Health officials are investigating 2 cases of measles in Fairfield County, and now schools are warning parents about the disease.

An adult, whose age was not provided, and an infant came down with the measles, according to officials with the Connecticut Department of Public Health [DPH].

One doctor with Hartford Hospital said measles was easy to prevent but highly contagious. "I haven't seen a case of measles since the 1990s and that was the only case I've seen as a practicing physician," said Dr Jack Ross. Ross said Connecticut had been in the clear for years, though a handful of cases were reported in neighboring states.

"I would be concerned if I had kids," he said. "Measles will start out as a cold but what's a little bit different over those next 2 to 4 days is you will have bright red eyes, you will have a runny nose, you'll have a cough."

According to state health officials, in the 1st case, the patient had a "rash onset" [2 Feb 2014]. The 2nd case was reported [13 Feb 2014].

The 2 cases are "not linked epidemiologically to each other," officials with the Connecticut Department of Public Health said. "DPH is working with local health departments and healthcare providers to identify and inform identified contacts of the cases. We may see secondary cases of measles among contacts, especially among those who have never been vaccinated for measles," Connecticut Department of Public Health officials said.

"I think for Connecticut," said Ross, "we are very fortunate our providers in this state have done an incredible job at vaccinating." Anyone born after 1957 is advised to get a measles-containing vaccine and should get at least 2 doses of the vaccine, health officials said.

The average incubation period of measles is 14 days, Connecticut Department of Public Health officials said. "Cases are considered infectious from 4 days before rash onset through 4 days after," Connecticut Department of Public Health officials said. Ross said for anyone exposed to the measles, it's important to get immunization in the 1st 72 hours of exposure. After that, doctors give a more intense immunization. [This may refer to passive immunization with immunoglobulin, which is effective as prophylaxis later after exposure than active immunization. - Mod.LM]

Bayonne, New Jersey, is the latest American community to experience a measles scare. NJ.com is reporting today, 13 Mar 2014, that an elementary school teacher in the Bayonne school system is being tested for the highly contagious respiratory illness. He teaches at the Midtown Community Elementary School which has more than 1000 students in grades K-8.

New York City has another 3 measles cases in its current outbreak, WPIX reported. The station also reports that 2 of the 19 cases in the outbreak were exposed while in a doctor's waiting room. On [11 Mar 2014], WNBC 4 reported that measles cases had spread to Brooklyn from the original locales in upper Manhattan and the Bronx. The city's Health Department had announced the outbreak on [7 Mar 2014], when there were 16 cases.

On [11 Mar 2014], the Connecticut Department of Public Health announced 2 cases of measles in Fairfield County. One case is in a never-immunized adult and the other in a 7-month-old infant, too young to be immunized. WFSB reported on that same day that the cases are unrelated. The station quoted health officials as expecting further measles cases among the contacts of the 2 original patients.

Measles has also spread in San Diego [California] where a traveler to the Philippines returned with the illness last month [February 2014]. The San Diego Health and Human Services Agency reported [12 Mar 2014] that a 4th patient had been diagnosed with measles. The 3 locally acquired cases are all connected to exposure to the original case in the traveler. The latest patient is known to have visited many public locations between [3 and 9 Mar 2014]. Measles is contagious up to 4 days before any rash appears.

Through [1 Mar 2014], the Centers for Disease Control had received reports of 51 measles cases in the United States. The reporting of illnesses can lag as much as 2 weeks and the CDC always suggests that the reporting at the state and local level is the most current.

Measles is a preventable illness. The MMR vaccine, given in 2 doses before the age of 5, is effective in preventing the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Concerns about the safety of the vaccine are unfounded and without any scientific basis.

During epidemiologic weeks 1-8, 2014 [30 Dec 2013-23 Feb 2014], 119 cases of measles were diagnosed (see latest epidemiologic curve of measles at http://www0.nih.go.jp/niid/idsc/idwr/diseases/measles/measles2014/meas14-08.pdf), indicating a greater than 3-fold increase relative to the same period in [2013]. As of [28 Feb 2014], 83 cases have been genotyped for measles virus (for more information, see isolation/detection of measles virus in Japan at http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasr-measles-e.html).

During epidemiologic week 48, 2013 to epidemiologic week 8, 2014 [25 Nov 2013 to 23 Feb 2014), as of 4 Mar 2014, 139 cases of measles were diagnosed, nearly a 3-fold increase relative to the 48 cases diagnosed during the same period in the previous year. 73 of the cases were male, with a mean age of 15.2 years (median 11 years, range 4 months to 51 years). During epidemiologic week 8, 2014, a case of encephalitis associated with measles infection was reported. Among the 75 cases with complete notification information that have been genotyped, 72 were B3, 2 were D8, and one was D9.

The number of cases reported by prefecture during this period was as follows: Kyoto (n=25), Chiba (n=17), Tokyo (n=16), Saitama (n=14), Kanagawa (n=12), Aichi (n=11), Hiroshima (n=9), Hyogo (n=8), Osaka (n=6), Okayama (n=4), Ibaraki (n=3), Miyazaki (n=3); 2 cases were reported from each of the following: Shizuoka, Yamaguchi, and Fukuoka; and 1 case was reported from each of the following: Niigata, Nagano, Mie, Shiga, and Okinawa. Transmission occurred domestically in 90 cases (65 percent), domestic/overseas in 1 case (1 percent), unknown in 1 case (1 percent), and the remaining 47 (34 percent) having report of transmission overseas, with the largest proportion from the Philippines (Philippines (n=38), Indonesia (n=2), Sri Lanka (n=2), and 1 each from Australia, Guam (United States), India, United States and Vietnam/Malaysia) (Figure). Among the 139 cases, 114 (82 percent) had either no or unknown history of measles vaccination.

Since week 48, the number of reported measles cases has been increasing. While there was a high proportion of imported cases until week 48, the proportion of domestic cases has since increased. The proportion of those believed to have been infected overseas was 8 percent (16/210) during weeks 1-47, 2013, 41 percent (28/68) during week 48, 2013 to week 4, 2014, and 27 percent (19/71) during weeks 5-8, 2014. In effect, while recent measles activity started from imported cases, transmission domestically in some areas led to further circulation of the virus within the country. The current situation warrant attention, and indeed, at least 7 reported cases were believed to have been infected in a healthcare setting.

Regardless of age, measles is a potentially fatal disease and warrant vigilant attention. In addition, while there is no specific treatment, prevention is possible through immunization. Japan has achieved substantial progress toward measles elimination. Working toward elimination by 2012, there has been an estimated 97 percent decline in incidence since 2007-2008 when measles predominated among adolescents; the next target is achieving certification of measles elimination in 2015. It is imperative that imported cases continue to be monitored, and at the same time, to be alert against secondary transmission from imported cases. Thus, there is a need to respond to each case rapidly with epidemiologic investigation; additionally, measles vaccination (ideally MR [measles-rubella] vaccine) should be systematically implemented among those susceptible, particularly those who are targeted for routine immunization (age one year, one year period prior to elementary school attendance). Furthermore, immunization is also recommended for those in healthcare, education, or welfare who have not received two doses of MR vaccine. While voluntary, such vaccination is beneficial for both public health and personal protection. Travellers overseas should confirm their vaccination status and ensure that they are up to date with the necessary vaccines (immunization through MR vaccine can also provide protection against rubella), preventing importation.

Healthcare workers should continue to carefully investigate symptomatic persons regarding their travel, contact and immunization histories. In addition, particularly in areas where measles has been confirmed, it is imperative that healthcare facilities implement infection control. For ill persons who suspect they may have become infected with measles after coming in contact with persons with fever and/or rash, notification should be made prior to visiting a health facility to prevent secondary transmission. While measles is transmissible via air and serious, it is preventable by vaccination -- the increasing re-occurrence of measles calls for strict vigilance.

Health authorities in [General Santos City, South Cotabato province, Mindanao] are bracing for a possible measles outbreak as suspected cases of the highly contagious viral disease in the area have continued to increase in the last several weeks.

Dr Edgardo Sandig, city health officer, said Thursday [13 Mar 2014] they are closely monitoring at least 3 barangays [barrio, smallest administrative division] in the city due to the rising incidence of suspected measles, which already reached a total of 43 cases since January [2014].

He said such figure is higher by 38 cases or nearly 760 percent when compared to last year [2013] but no fatalities have been so far recorded.

Most of the suspected measles cases, which mainly affected infants and children aged 6 months to 12 years old, were reported from communities in portions of Barangays Tambler, Lagao, and Labangal.

The official said they have submitted to the Department of Health (DOH) in Manila some blood samples taken from patients who exhibited the disease's symptoms for confirmatory testing.

Sandig noted that a single confirmed or positive case of measles is already considered by the DOH and the World Health Organization as an outbreak.

"We should have eliminated this disease a long time ago so whenever a confirmed case comes out, we consider it as an outbreak," he said in an interview over TV Patrol Socsksargen.

In 2013, the city health office recorded just 5 cases of measles, 2 of which later turned out positive for rubella or German measles.

The DOH Region 12's regional epidemiology and surveillance unit reported that a total of 121 suspected measles cases were recorded in the entire region last year [2013]. Region 12, which is also known as the Soccsksargen Region, comprises the provinces of South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and North Cotabato and the cities of General Santos, Koronadal, Tacurong, Kidapawan, and Cotabato.

Dr Baby Allah Vingno, DOH-12's regional epidemiologist, said the suspected measles cases affected residents aged 4 months to 70 years old, 56 percent involving females. She said no fatalities were reported but 50 percent of the cases involved patients with history of past measles immunization.

Vingno said 52 or 43 percent of the cases were eventually classified as non-measles, 45 were considered as measles compatible, 10 confirmed as rubella, and 10 others were still pending classification.

Meantime, as part of their efforts to contain the disease, Sandig said they launched anew a massive measles vaccination drive in the city's 26 barangays. He said the measles vaccination involves infant and children aged 6 months to 12 years old. The official said they advised parents of children aged 5 years old and below who have exhibited symptoms of the disease to immediately seek treatment in local health centers. He said the measles symptoms include high-grade fever, heavy cough, colds, emergence of skin rashes, and redness in the eyes.

[The outbreak appears to be well under way, not just "possible". The Philippines appears also to be the source of measles cases in several other countries thus far in 2014.

[14] Mediterranean (cruise ship, ECDC)

ECDC assesses measles outbreak aboard Mediterranean cruise ship
---------------------------------------------------------------
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] recently performed a rapid risk assessment of a measles outbreak aboard the Costa Pacifica cruise ship and gave health recommendations for gaining control of the outbreak.

The outbreak began on [27 Feb 2014] when approximately 40 crew members of the ship showed symptoms congruent with measles infection. The ship left Palma de Mallorca, Spain, and docked in Civitavecchia, Italy. There were no new reported infections and no reported infections involving passengers as of Wednesday [5 Mar 2014].

To maintain control over the outbreak, the ECDC recommended all persons with an onset of measles symptoms, including cough, runny nose, red eyes, fever and rash, seek medical attention immediately. Persons who are currently asymptomatic may not be by next week, as measles has a long incubation period. To address this, the CDC recommended all persons aboard the ship get vaccinated against measles if they have not yet done so. The ECDC also recommended that incoming passengers and crew members receive a warning that there is a possibility of measles exposure aboard the ship.

Measles is a highly contagious disease. The most effective preventative measures against measles infection is the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [MMR], given in 2 doses.

Passengers on 2 domestic flights and another from Singapore to Auckland may have caught measles after 2 people infected with the illness travelled earlier this month [March 2014].

A person, who was not a confirmed case at the time, flew from Auckland to Christchurch on [2 Mar 2014] and made a return trip 2 days later. Both were Air New Zealand flights -- NZ501 and NZ548.
Another infectious passenger travelled from Singapore to Auckland on Singapore Airlines flight SQ285 on [4 Mar 2014].

Auckland Regional Public Health Service's medical officer of health Dr Richard Hoskins says it can take 10-14 days for someone who has caught measles to start showing any symptoms.
He says anyone on these flights who may have caught measles should be starting to feel unwell, if they're not already, up to [18 Mar 2014].

Passengers who sat nearest the infected passengers will be contacted by their local public health service as they have the highest risk, Dr Hoskins says. Anyone who was feeling unwell should call their GP.

There have been 69 confirmed cases in Auckland this year [2014] with 46 of the cases linked to Westland Boys' High School.
