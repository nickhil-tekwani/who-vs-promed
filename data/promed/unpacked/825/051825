[Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell)
DRC has agreed to let pregnant (after the 1st trimester) & lactating women who are contacts of #Ebola cases be vaccinated with the experimental Merck vaccine. Some outside experts called for this last summer [2018] in @statnews, and @WHO's vaccine experts recommended it in February 2019.

If you're interested in the arguments for why pregnant and lactating women should [be] offered the option to be vaccinated against #Ebola, they're laid out in this piece: https://www.statnews.com/2018/08/27/ebola-vaccine-pregnant-lactating-women/.

"...An experimental vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV has been shown to be highly effective against this strain [Zaire] of Ebola virus.....
There's no question that evidence about the safety of the Ebola vaccine in pregnancy is limited. But what we don't know is dwarfed by what we do know. We know that in previous outbreaks, up to 90 percent of pregnant women infected with Ebola died from it. We know that nearly 100 percent of the pregnancies of Ebola-infected women end in miscarriage or neonatal death. And we also know that pregnant and lactating women are more likely than many others in the population to be caring for sick relatives, and thus are among those most likely to be infected. Indeed, the most recent WHO situation report on Ebola in the DRC shows that a large proportion of the cases are among women of childbearing potential.

The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is currently the only Ebola vaccine that has successfully completed efficacy trials and is being used in response efforts. This vaccine would not likely be viewed as appropriate for use in pregnant women outside the context of an Ebola outbreak. But during a high-incidence Ebola outbreak, the catastrophic maternal and fetal mortality rates change the calculus, with the potential benefits of offering the vaccine to pregnant contacts clearly outweighing the potential harms.

This favorable benefit-risk assessment is bolstered by the fact that in a previous trial, at least 20 women unintentionally received the Ebola vaccine while pregnant, with no evidence of harm.

rVSV-ZEBOV is a live vaccine, and live vaccines are not routinely given during pregnancy. Yet WHO recommendations regarding the use of a live yellow fever vaccine provide an important example of what could and should be done now with a live vaccine for Ebola. In its consideration of the benefits and risks of administering yellow fever vaccine to pregnant and lactating women at high risk of infection, WHO guidance states: 'In [yellow fever] endemic areas, or during outbreaks, the benefits of [yellow fever] vaccination are likely to far outweigh the risk of potential transmission of vaccine virus to the fetus or infant.'"]

Social Symposium against Ebola
---

-The religious leaders of Butembo launched on Thu 30 May 2019 the Social Symposium Against Ebola. This meeting, initiated by the religious leaders, will last 2 days and will bring together all the resistant layers of the population. The aim of the symposium is to give the people of Butembo the opportunity to work together to find a lasting solution to get out of the crisis and recreate a bond of trust between the population, local authorities and the agents of the response.

Ebola Hackathon
---
-After a successful 1st edition in Kinshasa last March [2019], the Ebola hackathon returns for a 2nd edition in Goma. From Thu 30 May-Fri 31 May 2019, 60 young students will work to develop new solutions using new technologies to help fight Ebola while also promoting the right to health. This 2nd hackathon is organized in collaboration with Internews, Kinshasa Digital, Path, the DRC Information Media Association and the French Institute of Goma.

-As a reminder, the 1st edition of the Ebola hackathon took place from 2-3 Mar 2019 in Kinshasa. The winning team of this 1st edition is called Lokole, a name inspired by the traditional drum. Their project was to develop a mobile application that allows community relays and people to share information in real time with the coordination of the Ebola response. Thanks to financial support from the World Bank and technical support from the Ministry of Health, the Lokole team is following an incubation program at Ingenious City where they will develop a prototype of the project which will then be tested on the ground.

[2] Preparedness and response

-Sat 1 Jun 2019. Uganda: Over USD 18 Million Spent to Prepare for Ebola Virus Disease [CGTN, abridged, edited]
https://newsaf.cgtn.com/news/3d3d774e776b7a6333566d54/index.html

The government of Uganda and partners have so far invested over USD 18 million in Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness and readiness. This was revealed at the just concluded Accountability Forum organized by the Ministry of Health at which partners shared information on their contribution in the EVD preparedness efforts in the country.

The funds have been utilized to implement various activities under the various pillars of the preparedness response, and significant progress has been made. For instance, under case management, 526 health workers in 14 districts have been trained on the appropriate handling of suspected EVD patients while taking sufficient protection measures for themselves. These health workers are now available for rapid deployment to any part of the country where EVD may occur.

Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) have been constructed. 9806 health workers in 562 health units located in 11 high-risk districts of the Rwenzori sub-region have been trained and mentored on EVD Infection Prevention and Control (IPC).

In efforts to ensure further health workers' safety against EVD, 4419 frontline health workers in 13 districts have been vaccinated. EVD preparatory efforts have also been augmented with the training of 404 health workers in 13 districts on psychosocial support, and, in addition, 17 districts now have trained and fully equipped teams ready to conduct safe and dignified burials. For community education and awareness, over 2 million people have been reached through interpersonal communication and house to house visits using trained Village Health Teams (VHTs), civic leaders, religious and cultural leaders and volunteers. In the high-risk districts, over 12 000 people in these categories have been trained and deployed for this purpose.

Sat 1 Jun 2019. Community Mobilization [Mercy Corps, abridged, edited]
https://www.mercycorps.org.uk/research/community-mobilization-essential-stopping-spread-ebola

The Ebola crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is worsening, and it poses a serious threat to the ongoing humanitarian response upon which nearly 13 million people depend for lifesaving aid. Despite the rapid spread of new infections, substantial community resistance to the response remains a serious obstacle, as indicated by persistent reports of individuals refusing the vaccine and recurring attacks on treatment centers.

Mercy Corps has published a new analysis, which demonstrates how community mobilization should be a central element to help stop the spread of Ebola in DRC and neighboring countries, taking lessons from Mercy Corps Ebola response in Liberia in 2014-2015 that reached over half of the population in that country. Over a 5-month period, Mercy Corps' community mobilization programmes led to substantial and rapid changes in behaviours and a deeper level of understanding about how to prevent the spread of Ebola.

-31 May 2019. Butembo: Traditional chiefs ask for public support to eradicate Ebola outbreak in 30 days
[Crofs blog, abridged, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/05/butembo-traditional-chiefs-ask-for-public-support-to-eradicate-ebola-outbreak-in-30-days.html

The traditional chiefs are determined to support the Ebola response teams with rites and sacrifices and to finish in the next 30 days. Nevertheless, eradication of the epidemic will be possible in the region [only] when the community is willing to collaborate with response teams in the fight against Ebola virus disease.

-Sat 2 Jun 2019. Butembo: Nurses threaten to go on strike to claim risk premiums and safety [Actualite; online trans. abridged, edited]
https://actualite.cd/2019/06/02/butembo-les-infirmiers-menacent-dentrer-en-greve-pour-reclamer-leurs-primes-de-risque-et; from Crof's Blog https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/06/butembo-nurses-threaten-to-go-on-strike-to-demand-their-risk-premiums-and-safety.html

During a General Assembly held this Sun 2 Jun 2019, they lambasted the marginalization of which they consider themselves victims.

"We condemn the marginalization of health professionals other than doctors and dentists in Butembo. There, we are talking about nurses, laboratory technicians and midwives who are abandoned. Our secretaries-general have just launched (in Kinshasa) the supervisory authorities with a 7-day ultimatum so that the question of our risk premiums can be settled. Otherwise we will start a movement of dry strike; we will observe days "hospitals without nurses;" warned Mr. Kambale Vake Okelo, president of the Intersyndicale of the nurses, Pool of Butembo, revealing to the press the resolutions of the GA.

Preventive activities remain suspended
---------------
In addition to not paying their risk premiums, the nurses have also lashed out at attacks and violence that they continue to suffer as a result of their involvement in the response to the Ebola virus disease that has already resulted in hundreds of deaths. Thus, they decided to continue the suspension of prevention activities, including prenatal consultation (CPN), preschool consultation (CPS) and routine vaccinations, as it has been for nearly 3 months now in the city of Butembo.

"The Mayor [of Butembo] has requested that a minimum service of CPN, CPS, and routine vaccinations be organized. But we are not going to start them, especially since the inhabitants who claim them are the same ones who continue to keep the malicious people who threaten us. Today, some nursing staff no longer sleep at home, they no longer arrive at their health centers, fearing for their safety.

Some refrigerators (which allow the conservation of vaccines) have been damaged, and health centers burned: where will we hold the CPN sessions, CPS, or vaccination? Where will we find the inputs we use during the vaccination? We are, therefore, maintaining the suspension of prevention activities while waiting for the urban authority to convene an exchange framework to establish responsibilities," says Kambale Vake Okelo.

Note that following this measure of nurses to suspend prevention activities, nearly 2500 children born since March 2019 have not yet been vaccinated against measles, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and many other diseases in the city. of Butembo.

-30 May 2019. Need for major scale-up of response [The New Humanitarian [abridged, edited]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/05/30/aid-community-raises-highest-alert-ebola-congo

UN and leading aid groups on Wed [29 May 2019] took the step of formally declaring that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo needs a major scale-up from the humanitarian community.

A spokesperson for the UN's emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, confirmed the decision of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which it chairs. The move can unlock stronger leadership and more funding, but "it's not a panacea," according to a top Red Cross official.

The IASC includes the major UN agencies and international NGOs, and it agreed on Wednesday [29 May 2019] to activate a range of special measures to respond to the Ebola epidemic in Congo, a move analogous to the former "L3" designation the IASC gave to only the most critical crises [now referred to as "Scale-Up Activation].

The OCHA spokesperson said the "scale-up" activation will "help optimise coordination and response capacity in affected and at-risk areas, strengthen engagement with communities, and bolster preparedness actions." A World Health Organization spokesperson also confirmed the decision, saying it was "good news."

Measures that may be taken under the short-term:
"Humanitarian System-wide Scale-Up Activation" package include new plans and priorities, funding appeals, and coordination arrangements for an initial 3-month period. Under the guidelines, new funding could also be released quickly from the UN-managed Central Emergency Response Fund.

-Thu 30 May 2019. Vaccination strategy
[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of Public Health, abridged, edited]
https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/outbreakthursday-1/5/30/2019/drc-ebola-update-vaccination-strategy

Until now, the WHO Ebola vaccination effort in the DRC has exclusively used the Merck vaccine, but the new revisions to the WHO vaccine strategy indicate that the J&J vaccine, MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN), will soon join the fight. The J&J vaccine has also shown promise in early clinical trials, and its use in the DRC would also be under a compassionate use protocol.

The 2 vaccines share a number of similarities, but there are a number of key differences that may impact the logistics of their use in the outbreak. Both aim to protect from the Zaire strain of Ebola, target individuals over the age of 18, and require cold chain for transportation and storage. The main difference in their indication. The Merck vaccine requires only a single dose and is indicated as a reactive vaccine. On the other hand, the J&J vaccine requires 2 doses, administered almost 60 days apart, and it is indicated only for those who have not yet been exposed. These key differences could create a number of logistical and communication challenges for health workers in the DRC, which could further complicate response operations.

Using the J&J vaccine as a preventative vaccine in lower-risk groups makes sense, considering that the vaccine requires a booster dose 60 days after the original shot. Additionally, this would allow available supply of the Merck vaccine to be reserved for higher-risk individuals who may have already been exposed to the virus. This combined approach allows responders to continue ring vaccination efforts, while bolstering the immunity of the broader community. In principle, this would be a more robust response to the disease outbreak; however, the instability in the region could inhibit the follow-up process necessary to administer booster. From a communication perspective, the use of 2 separate vaccines increases the importance of clear messaging and provides additional opportunity for confusion or uncertainty amongst community members, a critical challenge among communities with deep-seated trust issues with the government. There is primary evidence that widespread misinformation has already led to increased institutional distrust amongst community members, and there is concern that the introduction of a new vaccine that requires different messaging may further alienate at-risk communities.

A 2-dose vaccine designed to confer long-term immunity in advance of an outbreak may not be ideal for outbreak response operations, but the use of this vaccine in lower-risk individuals during the DRC outbreak could serve 2 purposes: (1) expand the pool of protected individuals around known cases, and (2) provide critical data for use in evaluating the J&J vaccine's safety and efficacy. Vaccination with the single-dose Merck vaccine will continue be the primary component of the vaccination efforts, and the introduction of the J&J vaccine enables the WHO to expand the vaccination efforts without impacting the primary ring vaccination strategy.
