The Health Authority in the region confirmed thus far they have registered 11 cases of intoxication, 5 in Aysen and 6 in Los Lagos.

"So far we have been notified of 5 cases in our region and in Los Lagos 6 cases, 3 of them are not on mechanical ventilation and all cases are not in a life endangering situation, and those of Aysen are all in their homes, "said the seremi [regional ministries] of the branch.

Ana Maria Navarrete stressed the last resolution was issued on [Thu 11 Jan 2018], however, the monitoring by IFOP, Red Tide Laboratory and seafood control, is still ongoing.

"The whole sector of the northern littoral is seeing a greater amount of phytoplankton and also marine toxins, part of the southern zone, therefore the appearance of toxins is quite disintegrated".

Ana Maria Navarrete pointed out this increase in toxins affects all bivalve shellfish "It should be mentioned the resource Loco [type of mollusk] which can also be contaminated with Red Tide, because this resource is carnivororous and can eat seafood with toxins," said the Seremi de Health.

Finally, the Health Authority recalled dry cholga [type of mussel] which does not have sanitary authorization and it concentrates toxin with greater intensity.

It should be noted that only fish and shellfish from authorized areas should be consumed. They should be purchased from premises with sanitary authorization, and those of unknown origin or street vendors, dry, cooked, raw or processed should be rejected.

[A "red tide" can often have a devastating effect on fisheries in some coastal areas. Red tides are caused by several species of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. These species produce strong chemical poisons called toxins. As the bloom increases the density of red tide organisms increase to several million cells in each liter of seawater. The result is a deadly mass of toxin-containing water leaving a wake of dead and dying fish. These toxins cause extensive fish kills, contaminate shellfish and create respiratory irritation for people who live along the shore.

Dinoflagellates produce a number of toxins. How the disease is designated or named tends to reflect the organism responsible. Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish for consumption to be toxic. Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because, under certain circumstances, these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally, these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals -- such as clams, oysters, mussels -- in which the toxins bioaccumulate.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals that swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms.

Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this genus are capable of causing "red tide" that may be visible for long distances along a coastline. One interesting note is that both people and dogs can be sensitive to the spray effects associated with a red tide bloom. Dogs react in much the same fashion as people, with eye irritation, nose, and respiration irritation, and some dogs will have inflamed ears, and irritated skin.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals. _Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentrations can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. _K. brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis, and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.

Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new name -- _Karenia brevis_ -- was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida.
