A deadly outbreak of streptococcal infections that's killed 10 people
in northern Ontario is likely to spread but doesn't pose a widespread
threat because it appears to be clustered around distinct groups of
people, the province's chief medical officer of health said Thursday
[Oct 9, 2008].

"It doesn't seem to be showing and spreading throughout the community
there, but spreading within a very specific subgroup of the
community," Dr. David Williams said a day after Thunder Bay's public
health unit announced the deaths. "It seems to be a very limited part
of the community... Some related with homeless, some with an
intravenous drug user group, some related with some urban populations
we're trying to follow up on. For the province at wide, I would say
no, it's not a big concern."

The city's health officials also said they've treated another 75
people with invasive Group A streptococcal infections over the past
year. "We are obviously interested -- I am, as the chief medical
officer of health -- of how well they're doing up there on this one,
and with the uniqueness of the situation, with the unique community
issues," Williams said. "I'll be interested to hear how they'll
approach it as a community action."

Cases of Group A strep began surfacing in the Thunder Bay area in
late summer 2007, which wasn't particularly unusual for an infectious
disease that's known as the cause of strep throat. But cases
continued to rise, growing beyond the normal 6 cases and one death per year.

When the local health unit recognized an influx of more severe cases
in February [2008], officials began their probe and found about half
of the cases belonged to a strain never seen before in the province,
said health unit epidemiologist Lee Sieswerda. Called emm-59, the
strain was already known in the western provinces.

Starting in 2006, a smattering of victims across the West became
infected with the bug that's now linked to more than 300 cases in the
region, said Greg Tyrrell, director of Edmonton's National Centre for
Streptococcus. "This is a type we really haven't seen much in Canada
in the past. We don't know why," Tyrrell said, adding the centre is
conducting studies to learn more.

At its worse, the Group A streptococci bacterium causes
life-threatening illnesses such as necrotizing fasciitis -- commonly
known as flesh-eating disease -- and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

In Thunder Bay, the infected group ranges in age from the mid-20s to
the mid-50s and is comprised of about 60 percent men. About 38
percent are classified as intravenous drug users and another 15
percent are "underhoused," Sieswerda said. Although he didn't know
the breakdown of the dead, he said they ranged in age from 39 to 77.

"The risk to the general public is very low," Sieswerda said, adding
he stands by the health unit's decision to not notify the public
until this week. Health officials have worked to contain the outbreak
by providing intensive followups, tracing the closest contacts of the
infected people and increasing street outreach, he said.

But Sieswerda, Williams and a prominent microbiologist all agree
there's a strong possibility the infection will continue to spread.
"We've seen it in Western Canada, we're seeing it move east," said
Dr. Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai
Hospital. Low said he wouldn't be surprised if the infection migrated
by the end of October or November [2008]. "There's a lot of movement
of individuals from city to city, so there may well be an opportunity
for this thing to hitchhike along with somebody and be introduced
into a new community of individuals that are susceptible," he said.

Health Ministry officials were made aware of the outbreak in May
[2008]. NDP Leader Howard Hampton called the provincial government
"negligent" for not informing the public of the outbreak.

[The incidence in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in the past year of invasive
disease caused by Group A streptococci (GAS) (also called
_Streptococcus pyogenes_) is apparently 85 per 100 000 population,
with a case-fatality rate of 12 percent. According to the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web site
<http://www.cdc.gov>, the expected incidence of invasive group A
streptococcal disease in the United States is about 3-5/100 000
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm>).
Toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis each comprise an
average of about 6 - 7 percent of the invasive cases and these forms
of invasive GAS infection probably accounts for most of the 1000 -
1800 deaths annually from invasive GAS infections in the USA. The
cause of the deaths in the Thunder Bay outbreak was not specified in
the above news release.

Although healthy people can get invasive GAS disease, people with
chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and chronic heart or lung
disease, and those who use medications such as steroids have a higher
risk. Persons with skin lesions (such as cuts, chicken pox, surgical
wounds), the elderly, and adults with a history of alcohol abuse or
injection drug use also have a higher risk for disease. The news
release does not state whether the cases had any underlying medical
conditions, but 38 percent were reported to be injection drug users,
and 15 percent were homeless.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene and
crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate
its spread from person to person.

M protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which have
been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the
M protein molecule. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of
sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm>).
Genotyping is reported to have identified the genotype emm-59 in half
of the cases in Thunder Bay and also identified this genotype in an
outbreak of GAS that started in Western Canada more than one year ago.

Thunder Bay, located on the shore of Lake Superior, has a population
of about 100 000. It is the most populous municipality in
northwestern Ontario and its port forms an important link in the
shipping of grain and other products from western Canada through the
Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to the east coast
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay,_Ontario>).
