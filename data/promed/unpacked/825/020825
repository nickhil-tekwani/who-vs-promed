Here is the latest press release on Dengue in Fiji: Disease Outbreak
Warning #10, Update on Dengue Fever Epidemic, Ministry of Health, Fiji
To date there have been at least 15,916 cases of suspected dengue fever,
with 805 admissions presenting at Ministry of Health Facilities. It appears
that weekly suspected case levels are declining, particularly in Viti Levu,
but this is not an indication that the epidemic is over.
There is still no room for complacency - this epidemic has taught us the
need for long-term vigilance. The Dengue fever problem will not go away
unless the public takes the disease seriously, and makes a concerted effort
to keep their living environments free of mosquito breeding sites.
Declines have occurred in case loads at CWM Hospital over the last two
weeks, with less dramatic declines observed in the Western Division. The
most recent death occurred on 14 February at CWM Hospital, bringing the
current death toll to 10, with all victims coming from the greater Suva area.
At least 2% of FijiÂ’s population has been affected to date (not counting
those who may have sought treatment from private doctors). However, in
Suva, the attack rate since the beginning of the epidemic in mid-December
is nearly 7%, with an overall rate of 4.5% in the Central Division - the
most heavily affected area. Attack rates are less than 1% >in the Western
Division (0.64%), the Eastern Division (0.67%) and the Northern Division
(0.3%). If current rates persist, and if the epidemic has in fact peaked in
the most heavily affected and populated areas, then it is doubtful that
overall prevalence rates will exceed 5% nationally, and 10% in the Central
Division.
The case fatality rate stands at 0.6 deaths per 1000 cases, compared to a
case fatality rate of 8.1 per 1000 during the 1989-1990 epidemic. This is
believed largely to be due to the hard work of hospital staff to identify
and manage serious cases, and with technical assistance provided by the
World Health Organization. Four of the 10 deaths have been autopsied.
Autopsy reports indicate that two deaths were highly compatible with a
diagnosis of dengue (one tested sero-positive), while two were inconclusive.
The Northern Division has recorded the fewest cases to date. However, it
appears that dengue is still spreading in the North, and that there is
still the possibility of a more widely spread epidemic. Savusavu hospital
has noticed a rise in viral illness cases in the outpatient department in
the past three weeks, and there have been 11 admissions for viral illness
in the past week. 8 serum samples were collected yesterday, but the results
from Labasa Hospital laboratory are still pending. Four serologically
positive cases were confirmed in the second week of January.
In Taveuni, no confirmed cases have been seen to date - 4 admitted viral
cases were screened, but found to be negative. The outpatient department
has noticed a rise in viral cases and collected serum samples, but all were
negative. Last month the hospital collected 20 serum samples, but none were
found to be Dengue positive. Nabouwalu hospital noticed a rise in viral
cases since last week of January, but reported that it appears to be in
decline. There have been no admissions, and no serum samples have been
collected.

[The Central Division includes the eastern (windward) half of Fiji's main
island Viti Levu, including Fiji's most populous capital city - Suva. 70%
of reported cases to date have come from (primarily peri-urban) Suva, and
84.7% overall from the Central Division. This area has fewer tourists than
the western half of the island. Overall attack rate is 4.5% with 7% in
Suva. An undetermined proportion of the cases reported in Suva may have
actually come from surrounding districts, bypassing their own primary care
facilities as Suva contains Fiji's largest referral hospital.
The Western Division includes the western (leeward) half of Viti Levu and
the Yasawa island chain. There are a number of smaller towns including
Lautoka (one of three ports of entry), and Nadi (including Fiji's main
international airport). 13% of reported cases have come from the Western
Division. Overall attack rate is 0.64%.
The Northern Division includes all of Vanua Levu and Taveuni, Fiji's second
and third largest islands, and the town of Labasa with ~50,000 residents.
Altogether, the North has a population of ~130,000. So far it has accounted
for 0.3% of cases. Overall attack rate is < 0.03%.
The Eastern Division includes the remainder of Fiji's outer islands, with a
combined population of roughly 50,000. The islands so far account for a
little more than 2% of the total cases reported to date, and an overall
attack rate of < 1%.

[The message we received indicated there was an attached table but I did
not find one. That table purportedly contained information regarding
latest reported figures, showing total outpatients, admissions, population,
attack rates per 1,000 persons, and selected results from recent mosquito
larval surveys including Breteau indices above 20. Another part of the
message included David Saunders' kind and detailed efforts to explain the
significance of portions of the table. I apologize for not being able to
include all this. Instead, I have abstracted slightly David's comments. -
