An outbreak of African swine fever is reported in Uasin Gishu district. The
area's provincial director of veterinary services, Dr Eliakim Otenyo, is
urging pig farmers not to let their animals roam around to curb the spread
of the disease.
Dr Otenyo has also banned the importation of livestock from Uganda and
other provinces. He urged wananchi [a Kiswahili word for citizens] to
notify veterinary officers of any strange disease, and also asked farmers
in the province to revive crush pens for easy vaccination of livestock.

[African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of domestic and wild
pigs that affects animals of all breeds and ages, caused by a virus that
produces a range of syndromes. The ASF virus is the only member of the
_Asfarviridae_ family.
Acute disease is characterized by high fever, hemorrhages in the
reticuloendothelial system, and a high mortality rate. Infectious virus can
survive for several months in fresh and salted dried-meat products. The
disease is not zoonotic.
Uasin Gishu District is a political region in the Rift Valley, western
Kenya, bordering the Trans-Nzoia District. Its capital is Eldoret; see map
at

According to data from the Office International des Epizooties (World
Organisation for Animal Health), the last occurrence of ASF in Kenya was
recorded in August 2001. Outbreaks were recorded in neighbouring Uganda in
January 2006; the disease is regarded as endemic there. - Mod.AS]
