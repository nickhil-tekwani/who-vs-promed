Russia: suspected tickborne encephalitis outbreak in the Kemerovo region
-------------------------------------------------
15 people have been admitted to hospital in Kuzbass [Kemerovo Region] with
suspected tickborne encephalitis, the Kemerovo Regional Administration's
press service told RIA on Mon 17 May 2004, referring to the latest figures
supplied by the State Health Inspectorate's Regional Centre. Over 3000
local people have already sought medical help for tick bites. Out of that
3000, over 2000 have done so during the past week [mid May 2004].

The regional administration's press service stressed that the region has
sufficient stocks of immunoglobulin: a total of 50 000 doses. About RUR 3
million [USD 103 500] has been allocated from the regional and local
budgets, as well as from the territorial compulsory medical insurance fund,
to purchase immunoglobulin.

[Vaccination is an alternative to the administration of immunoglobulin in
the control of tickborne encephalitis. The current vaccines, derived from 2
different European strains of tickborne encephalitis virus, have been shown
both to be cross-protective against the Russian and Far Eastern
subtypes/strains of the virus: see the discussion and information in
ProMED-mail posts, Tick-borne encephalitis - Russia (Krasnoyarsk) (02) and
(03). - Mod.CP]
