Rabies on the rise in Sebastian County
--------------------------------------
The recent discovery of several rabid skunks has led the mayor to
quarantine Sebastian County. There have been (at least) 6 cases of
rabies in skunks confirmed. The cases have been in the Greenwood area.
A veterinarian tells Channel Seven, skunks are typically nocturnal and
you should be cautious and let authorities know if you spot one during
the day.

Police report a child has been bitten by a dog that may have the
disease. The 2 year old girl in Lavaca is now facing a painful and
expensive round of rabies treatment shots.

These incidents are driving more pet owners to get their pets
vaccinated. Arkansas administers 3-year shots and also requires pet
owners to make sure they're up to date.

[3] Raccoon, bat, skunk, human exposure - Texas

Wilco [Williamson County] officials warn of rabies cases
--------------------------------------------------------
This year [2011], Williamson County already has had 11 bats, 15
skunks, and one raccoon test positive for rabies. A man working
underneath a vehicle in northern Williamson County was recently bitten
by a rabid skunk.

Fortunately, the bite victim reported this encounter, sought medical
attention quickly, and started post exposure rabies vaccinations
before the lab test verified the animal was rabid. Williamson County
and Cities Health District (WCCHD) officials urge residents to take
steps protect themselves and their pets from the deadly virus.

Each year many cases of rabies develop throughout Texas in both wild
and domestic animals. According to the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the signs of rabies in animals include:
- changes in an animal's behavior
- general sickness
- problems swallowing
- an increase in drool or saliva
- wild animals that appear abnormally tame, sick, disoriented,
fearless, or aggressive
- animals that may bite at everything if excited
- difficulty moving or paralysis

"If you see an animal exhibiting the signs above, do not touch or
handle the animal. Call your local animal control agency immediately.
There are steps to be taken if dogs, cats, or other livestock with or
without current rabies vaccinations come into contact with a possibly
rabid animal so the important thing is that folks recognize this
abnormal behavior and report it to our animal control agencies," said
Dr Chip Riggins.

Rabies is a virus disease of the central nervous system that can
affect all warm-blooded animals, including humans. It is most often
transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal or through the saliva of
that animal into a fresh scratch or skin break. A series of
post-exposure shots, if given in time, can prevent rabies from
developing. Once symptoms develop, rabies is almost always fatal.

Officials state the best ways to protect your pets and family from
the disease is to control the cases of rabies in the area by:
- Immunizing your family pets. Contact your veterinarian for
information on rabies vaccination for your pet. Even animals kept in
yards need to be vaccinated. Owners should not let their pets roam
free. Visit your veterinarian or community-sponsored vaccination
clinic to receive the rabies vaccination.
- Register and license your pets in a reputable program often run by
local governments or non-profit agencies.

Cheryl Schneider, who is the director of the Williamson County
Regional Animal Shelter, encourages animal owners to make sure their
animals' rabies vaccinations are up to date.

"City ordinances and [Texas} state law requires anyone keeping or
owning a dog or cat 16 weeks of age or older to have that animal
vaccinated against rabies," she said. "Vaccinating your pets may
prevent the animal from being euthanized if it comes in contact with a
rabid animal."

"Many vaccines for pets and livestock will protect the animals from
illnesses such as parvo[virus] in dogs or sleeping sickness in horses,
but the rabies vaccine is a key step in guarding public health,"
Schneider said. "It protects the animals as well as their human
family. In Texas, a puppy should be vaccinated when it is old enough
and then again a year later; after that, the 3-year vaccine can be
used. The rabies vaccines are incredibly effective ... they serve to
save dogs and cats and in doing so, protect the humans that come in
contact with them."

Schneider also urged animal owners not to leave pet food outside.
Presence of pet food could draw high-risk animals including skunks,
raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and bats. "This can increase a pet's chance
of being exposed to rabies," Schneider said. "A lot of people don't
realize there are skunks that live in all of our housing areas right
in the middle of town. It's not safe to assume you won't see them
because you live inside the city limits. They're definitely here,
too."

Be sure to talk to your children about rabies and staying away from
wild animals or cats and dogs unfamiliar to you. Children must know to
report finding a bat immediately and to never, under any
circumstances, handle or play with a bat. If you see a skunk, bat,
raccoon, or other nocturnal animal that is active during the day or
seems to be sick, fearless, or aggressive, you should contact animal
control right away. Animal services asks residents not to capture or
shoot the animal. An animal cannot be tested for rabies if it has been
shot in the head.

"Education is important because the illness can be so serious,"
Riggins said. "Early post-exposure treatment can help keep the disease
from progressing, but once symptoms begin, there is really nothing
that will help," he said. "Testing has proven that rabies is currently
present in a large percentage of skunks, bats, and even raccoons in
our community, which makes vaccination of our pets and reporting of
abnormal behavior and possible exposures to abnormally-behaving wild
animals all the more important."

[4] Canine, human exposure - Georgia
Date: Thu 14 Apr 2011

Rabid dog bites 4 people
------------------------
[A man] and his stepson were bitten by their dog who was infected
with rabies. Princess, one of their other dogs, is not allowed to be
in contact with people or animals because she may also have been
exposed to rabies. Tiger was not a dog that lived up to his name until
he bit the family that was caring for him.

The boxer (Tiger), found on the side of the road by the current
owner, coexisted peacefully with the family and the dog's "mate," the
other boxer named Princess, the owner said.

But health officials said Tiger had been infected with rabies, which
led the dog to bite 4 people on Saturday night [9 Apr 2011] before
retreating to the woods and dying. It's the 1st case of a rabid family
pet in Floyd County [Georgia] since at least 2007, according to
statistics from the Northwest Georgia Public Health District.

Tiger's strange behavior began after the family returned to home
Saturday evening after spending the day at the park. The boxer
attempted to bite [the 12 year old boy] and later bit the owner and 2
other family members. "He wasn't growling or barking," he said. "He
was just snapping and biting."

The dog ran into the woods and was found dead the next day. He was
taken to the University of Georgia, where his brain was tested and
rabies was confirmed Tuesday [12 Apr 2011].

The owner, the stepson, his 2 uncles, and an animal control officer
are undergoing rabies treatment, which involves a series of shots
during the next 3 weeks, said Logan Boss, spokesman for the Northwest
Georgia Public Health District. The animal control officer received
treatment because he was exposed to the dog when he retrieved it.

While rabies vaccinations are required by Floyd County, Tiger had not
had his rabies shot, but Princess was vaccinated. The family could
only afford to vaccinate one dog at a time due to financial issues.
Princess is quarantined because she may have been exposed to the
virus, Boss said. She will be required to be kept in a pen away from
dogs and humans.

Since rabies has a 6 month incubation period, it is possible that
Tiger had the rabies for a while, Broome said. The owner said he found
Tiger and Princess on the side of the road after someone dropped them
off about 6 months ago. Boss said the health department and Animal
Control will be following up on Princess.

"This underlines the importance of pet owners getting their pets
vaccinated," Broome said. Broome said once a month, low cost rabies
clinics are scheduled and sponsored by Tractor Supply where pet owners
can get the shots for about USD 10. Pets have to be vaccinated for
rabies every year.

[Taking in animals is a kind and wonderful thing to do. However, it
is important to verify if they are already owned. Hopefully there is a
tag or a microchip. Most veterinarians or shelters can scan for a
microchip. If the pet is adoptable without an owner and the owner
cannot be found, it is always appropriate to have the animal checked
and treated by a veterinarian. The rabies shots mentioned in the
article are very inexpensive. This case illustrates the need for
rabies vaccination of pets to protect humans. I wonder if we will hear
of the outcome of Princess. - Mod.TG]

[5] Dangers of rabies: a CDC highlighted story
Date: Thu 14 Apr 2011

Rabies risk from bats
---------------------
A recent report by the CDC of a Michigan man dying from rabies is a
good reminder about the danger of human rabies.

That case involved an adult who woke up with a bat on his arm, but
didn't think to seek medical attention.

It wasn't until 9 months later that he began to have any symptoms,
which began as pain and numbness in his hand and arm, lower neck pain,
and upper back pain. Although treatment by a chiropractor improved his
back pain, the numbness and tingling in his arm was worse, and by the
time he went to an emergency room, he could not make a grip with his
hand.

He continued to get worse in the hospital, as the working diagnosis
was changed from a neurological condition, such as a cerebral vascular
accident or Guillain-Barre syndrome, to an infectious disease,
including West Nile, St Louis encephalitis, and adenovirus, etc.

Testing for rabies was eventually done, once they discovered the
history of the bat exposure, but it was already too late, as the
patient was taken off life-support by the family just after that time
and before the results came back positive.

Although people often think about the risk of rabies after getting
bit by a dog, this case highlights the importance of getting medical
attention after other potential exposures to rabies.

According to the CDC, 'the public should be aware of the risk for
rabies associated with bats and should take appropriate actions after
exposure, including contacting local authorities for guidance on how
to safely capture and submit a bat for rabies diagnosis and consulting
a physician or state or local health department for advice regarding
rabies post exposure prophylaxis.'

Also remember, it is possible to get rabies from bats (any direct
contact), raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes, unvaccinated dogs,
unvaccinated cats, unvaccinated ferrets.

In addition to vaccinating your pets, you can help prevent rabies by
teaching your kids to stay away from stray dogs and cats and to not
touch any wild animals, whether they are dead or alive.
