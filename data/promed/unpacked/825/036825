The recall of Robin Hood brand flour linked to an E. coli outbreak has been expanded to the entire country. The original recall issued last month [March 2017] by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on 10 kg [approx 22 lb] bags of flour was limited to BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The recall was triggered during an investigation into an outbreak of _E. coli_ O121 that found 25 cases with a matching genetic fingerprint in 4 provinces -- 12 in BC, 4 in Alberta, 4 in Saskatchewan and 5 in Newfoundland and Labrador. Several of those who fell ill reported having contact with Robin Hood flour. The illness onset dates ranged from November 2016 to late February 2017. A total of 6 people were hospitalized but are recovering.

Food inspection agency officials say any 10 kg bags of Robin Hood brand all-purpose flour with a best-before date of [17 Apr 2018] and the production code 6 291 548 should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. The recalled product's UPC is 0 59000 01652 8.
