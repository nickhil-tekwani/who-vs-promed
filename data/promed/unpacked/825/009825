With reference to the moderator's comment "I have no information on dengue
in the DR in 2004" in the 1st reference below, you can find "2004: Number
of Reported Cases of Dengue & Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Region of the
Americas (by country and subregion)" -- including the Dominican Republic --
at the following website:

[ProMED-mail thanks Giovanni for the tip. The most recent figures at the
given website are as of 2 Aug 2004 and give provisional figures to the
latest week noted by each country. The data for the DR is 189 cases of
dengue type 2 through week 6, in other words, mid-Feb 2004. Costa Rica and
Panama were the only countries to have figures for Jul 2004; the rest were
earlier, with Bolivia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and Uruguay not reporting at
all. - Mod.JW]

A woman aged 51 was found to have contracted dengue fever this month [Nov
2004], which was the 2nd such case confirmed this year [2004] in Macau. The
1st dengue fever case was found in September [2004]. The health authorities
have ordered mosquito abatement measures in an area of 200 square metres
[around] the hospitalized woman's home. The Health Services predicted in
April 2004 that dengue fever would probably re-emerge this year, as it has
a pattern of breaking out every 3 to 4 years.
The Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) government launched an
anti-dengue fever campaign from April to mid-June [2004], waging a
publicity drive to help citizens better understand self-prevention measures
against the disease, while disinfecting empty houses, dirty corners, and trash.
[The dengue vector, _Aedes aegypti_, has a flight range considerably
greater than 200 linear metres. - Mod.JW]

summarized & edited by Mod.JW]
<http://cubanet.org/CNews/y04/nov04/12a2.htm>

More than 35 [breeding] foci of the [dengue vector] mosquito, _Aedes
aegypti_, have been found on 35th street, as well as near Monserrat
catholic church and in the districts of Tulipan, Reina, and Ciudad
Electronuclear.
A sprayman who did not wish to be identified said that he knows of at least
3 cases of dengue in the township of Aguada de Pasajeros that have not been
officially reported.

[The source of this report is a dissident news service, so readers should
draw their own conclusions as to its veracity. The last report on
ProMED-mail of dengue in Cuba was from this same source in 2003 -- see 2003
reference below -- and has not been officially denied. - Mod.JW]
