Last week [week of 9 May 2022], the minister of health, Luis Francisco Sucre, reported that there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis in the country, according to an El Siglo report. He detailed that to date more than 240 cases have been reported, a higher number than in previous years. The Metropolitan Health Region is the one that has registered the most cases to date, with 31 people affected.

The minister reported that leishmaniasis is transmitted by a vector and occurs in some areas where they are in greater contact with nature; for example, the regional areas in Nägbe Buglé, Cerro Azul, 24 de Diciembre, and even in Guna Yala.He gave assurance that a strategy is being devised to reinforce the team to make more diagnoses and be able to attend to these people.

People with cutaneous leishmaniasis who develop clinical evidence of infection have one or more sores on their skin. The sores can change in size and appearance over time. The sores may start as papules (bumps) or nodules (lumps) and may end up as ulcers (like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater); skin ulcers may be covered by scab or crust. The sores usually are painless but can be painful.

There is no vaccine available to prevent leishmaniasis. The best way is to avoid sandfly bites.

[Since 1977, the number of cases has been increasing. cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) occurs throughout the year, with a peak in May, at the beginning of the rainy season, when there is increased agricultural activity, and a 2nd peak in October and November, during the harvest, which is also a rainy period (Christensen HA, et al. Short report: Epidemiologic studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis in eastern Panama. Am J Trop Med Hyg 1999; 60(1): 54-7; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1999.60.54).

_Leishmania panamensis_ is responsible for the great majority of CL cases, mostly in forested areas from west to east, including Bocas del Toro, Coclé, Colón, Veraguas, Panama, San Blas, and Darien provinces (Alvar J, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e3567; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671 Annex 71, Panama; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.s071). - Mod.EP
