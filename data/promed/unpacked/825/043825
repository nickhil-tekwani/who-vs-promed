The bird flu virus has also been found in bean geese wintering in North Jeolla Province, following an avian flu outbreak among Baikal teals.

Tests of 3 dead bean geese at a reservoir in Gochang showed [presence of] the H5N8 virus, the same flu strain found in dead Baikal teals there, the agriculture ministry said Wednesday [22 Jan 2014].

Bean geese are migratory birds that breed in Europe and Russia and typically winter in Korea. Unlike Baikal teals that rest in flocks at 3 to 4 wintering sites, bean geese stay in small family groups in about 70 locations across the country.

Meanwhile, the ministry discovered 3 more dead Baikal teals at a lake between Gunsan and Seocheon and started tests to find out if they are infected with the flu virus.

The ministry aims to cull 410 000 chickens and ducks at 30 farms by Friday [24 Jan 2014], with more than half already destroyed.

[The bean goose [_Anser fabalis_] breeds in northern Europe and Asia. It is migratory and winters further south in Europe and Asia. For a picture of a bean goose, go to http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Bean.goose.600pix.jpg/579px-Bean.goose.600pix.jpg.

Bean geese were found to be infected by avian influenza viruses for the 1st time in 2007, but at a very low prevalence (0.6 percent).

Because of their migratory behavior, they may be of epidemiological importance, but it should be taken into account that highly pathogenic viruses such as this one cause severe disease in most wild bird species. Therefore, only the very few species that suffer long subclinical viremia would be able to migrate and carry it to novel regions. Here, the fact that the virus was found in dead geese is evidence that this species may be susceptible.
