Family dog positive for rabies: First case in pet in decade
*****************
Rutherford County Animal Control officials' worst fears were realized this
week with the first confirmed case of rabies found in a family pet in close
to a decade. Animal Control Director David Boone said Friday that tests
results confirmed that a dog taken to a local veterinarian by a family in
the Milton area tested positive for rabies virus.
"This is the first rabid dog I've encountered in Rutherford County in the
nine years that I've been here," Boone said. "This animal was human handled
and the parties involved thought its behavior was not normal. They took it
to the vet, who called us because he also didn't like how the animal
behaved. I don't really know what that behavior was, but we sent it out for
testing and it came back positive."
The case alarms Boone, he said, because of the already high number of rabid
wild animals found in Rutherford County each year. For several years,
Rutherford County has lead the state in the number of cases reported.
"Since January of this year, there have been 39 cases of rabies reported
across the state -- Rutherford County has had 16 of those," he said, adding
that all the cases up to now have been skunks. "In the past, we've had
goats, horses, things like that, but never a dog or a cat which is why this
case concerns me greatly. If you consider the average family of four owns
two pets, based on our statistics, less than half of them have been
vaccinated this year."
Boone said the case may prompt an emergency rabies clinic, where area
veterinarians donate their time at several locations around the county and
give rabies vaccinations for a reduced fee. "This should get the attention
of every animal owner in the county that it is imperative they have their
pets vaccinated," Boone said. "The possibility for this virus to be passed
on like this alarms me."
The case is so alarming to Boone that animal control officials will begin a
door-to-door public awareness campaign next week in the Milton area and in
other parts of the county that have shown a high number of skunk cases this
year, urging people to have their pets vaccinated.
Boone said without having that vaccination, any animal even suspected of
having rabies, by law, will have to be tested. To test for the rabies
virus, doctors must look at an animal's brain tissue. To do that the animal
must be euthanized and decapitated. "That's the law. They have to be put
down and sent off. Even if they don't have the disease, they have to be
tested if it is suspected," he said in a previous interview. "The reason
for this is really to protect the public."

[This brings home the need for maintaining annual rabies vaccination in
dogs & cats. Over the years I have met a number of public health folk whose
suspicion of rabies in domestic animals can be triggered by not always
persuasive signs and circumstances and who are rigid in the need for
immediate (lethal) testing as apposed to quarantine & observation. This can
be preempted if the animals have been vaccinated, before any exposure, and
have their certificates to prove it. - MHJ]
