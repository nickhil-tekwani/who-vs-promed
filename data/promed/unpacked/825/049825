African swine fever (ASF), lethal to pigs though harmless to humans,
has reached central Russia and may spread to all European parts of the
country, the country's chief veterinarian said on Tuesday [28 Jun
2011].

"We are on the verge of a new wave of proliferation of the virus,"
Nikolai Vlasov, who is also deputy head of the animal and plant health
watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, told reporters.

He said that outbreaks of ASF, which has no cure, have been
registered this year [2011] at 5 small farms in the central Russian
region of Tver, bordering the Moscow region.

Medium and large Russian pig breeding farms are well protected
against ASF and other diseases. It is mainly small farms that are
affected by the contagious virus, which is spread partly by wild
boars.

ASF, which was confirmed for the 1st time in Russia in 2007, has so
far been found mainly in the south of the country. It continues
spreading due to delays in the adoption of efficient measures to
prevent its proliferation.

3 years ago, the disease was discovered outside the Southern Federal
District only twice. In the 1st 6 months of this year [2011], the
virus was found in 5 regions outside the district, in northwestern and
central Russia, Vlasov said. "We give instructions, which are
ignored," he said.

The watchdog earlier this year [2011] proposed a program to eradicate
the pig killer within 7 years, costing around USD 400 million. The
government has so far failed to approve it.

If things continue to go as they do now in the Tver region, where
wild boars are plentiful, the northwest of the country may soon start
resembling the south," Vlasov said.

"Wide proliferation of any infectious disease in Russia is a global
problem due to its colossal territory and the huge number of countries
it has borders with," he added.

[Subscribers are referred to FAO's recent appraisal of the
deteriorating ASF situation in Russia and its threat to other
territories (20110615.1821), in particular, the long-distance "jumps"
of the virus, such as its sudden appearance in spring 2011 in the port
of Murmansk, more than 3000 km [1864 mi] from southern Russia, close
to the border with Finland. In 2009, it leapt 2000 km [1242 mi] to St
Petersburg, where, however, it appears to have been contained after a
relapse at the end of 2010 and again in March 2011.

ASF long-distance jumps are food-borne, with virus surviving in pig
meat products taken by travellers, army units, etc. At the
destination, food scraps may be fed to pigs, setting off a new
outbreak. Prohibition or regulation of swill production and use are
essential measures for the control of ASF.

An interactive map showing the 136 ASF outbreaks reported in Russia
since September 2009, and the relevant 61 follow-up reports, are
