The Jordanian Ministry of Health has reported a case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection in a non-Jordanian man in his 70s, according to the state run media outlet, Petra on Thursday [25 Dec 2014] (computer translated). [Other media reports have mentioned the individual was a Saudi national.]

According to numbers from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of 18 Dec 2014, Jordan has seen 18 MERS cases and 5 deaths in the Middle Eastern country since the virus was 1st seen in 2012.

The MERS virus was 1st seen in Saudi Arabia in April 2012. The Saudi Kingdom has been by far hit harder than any other country, reporting at least 821 cases and 355 deaths, according to ECDC data.

MERS is viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called MERS-CoV. Most people who have been confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. They had fever, cough, and shortness of breath. About 30 percent of people confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection have died.

[According to the most recent ECDC epidemiologic assessment on MERS-CoV, as of 4 Nov 2014, 18 cases and 5 deaths have been reported by the Jordanian Health authorities since April 2012 (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1102). This includes the 10 retrospectively identified cases from the 1st outbreak of MERS-CoV in Jordan in April 2012 (see ProMED-mail posts Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (04): RFI, Jordan, April 2012 20120925.1308001, Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean: WHO, Jordan, conf., RFI 20121130.1432498 for details on that outbreak in Jordan). Since then, there have been an additional 8 cases reported, with the most recent case reported to WHO on 1 Jun 2014 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (76): Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE, ECDC assessment, WHO 20140604.2515846).

More information from knowledgeable sources on this newly reported case (age, nationality, possible risk exposures during the 14 days preceding onset of symptoms) would be greatly appreciated.

[During the period 17-28 Dec 2014, there have been an additional 3 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the Saudi MOH and 4 newly reported recoveries. This brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia to 824 including 355 deaths (case fatality rate 43.1 percent). The 3 newly confirmed cases involve individuals from Riyadh, Quriat and Alkharj. One of the 3 had a history of animal exposure, a 2nd case's history of animal exposure is under investigation, and the 3rd had no identifiable risk exposures to either animals or suspected/known cases of MERS-CoV infection in either the healthcare environment or in the community. None of these cases were healthcare workers.

Of the 4 newly reported recoveries, the one from Najran (reported on 17 Dec 2014) was most likely reported as MERS-CoV infected on 2 Dec 2014, and at which time was noted to be in critical condition and had a history of exposure to animals. The 2nd newly reported recovery was the 29-year-old Expat female healthcare worker from Taif who most likely was the individual confirmed on 16 Dec 2014, at which time she was noted to be in stable condition and had a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual in the healthcare environment (see the information provided in the WHO update in part [3] below). The 3rd newly reported recovery, the 53-year-old Saudi male from Alkharj, was most likely the individual confirmed on 19 Dec 2014, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition and had a history of animal exposure. The 4th newly reported recovery, the 70-year-old Saudi female from Taif, was most likely the individual confirmed on 5 Dec 2014, at which time she was noted to be in critical condition and had no history of exposure to known or confirmed cases in the community, but possible exposure to animals or known or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment were under investigation.
