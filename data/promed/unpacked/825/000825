In a major scare, a deer on the IIT-Madras [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras] campus died of anthrax, and 3 more are suspected to have succumbed to the highly infectious zoonotic disease in the last 2 days.

The institute said samples from the animals were sent to Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University for testing. Samples from one deer showed the presence of anthrax, while tests on samples from the others were inconclusive.

Multiple sources told TNIE that all 4 animals exhibited typical signs of anthrax, oozing fluids and blood from all natural openings. The carcasses were found by IIT-Madras security personnel, who informed Guindy National Park officials. TNIE was reliably informed that the areas around the carcasses were cordoned off, and instructions were given to IIT-Madras authorities and students to keep away.

The veterinarian who went to check on the deer suspected they had died of anthrax and collected samples. The carcasses have been buried as per the standard operating procedures, IIT-Madras said. "It is absolutely shocking that anthrax is reported from a place like Chennai [Madras] and in an institute like IIT-Madras."

"We don't know the source," a forest official said. "Veterinarians say it might have spread from dogs, which are good carriers. Instructions have also been given to IIT-Madras authorities not to go near and touch stray dogs on campus."

The institute, too, said dogs may have been the carriers, adding the disease has never before been detected on campus.

A high alert has been sounded in Guindy Children's Park, where zookeepers have been instructed not to touch the food or animals unnecessarily without protective gear. Meanwhile, a male elephant has reportedly died of anthrax in Thadagam, Coimbatore division. The carcass was found on Thursday [17 Mar 2022], and blood smear samples were collected for testing. Oozing of fluid was observed from natural openings. A post-mortem examination will be conducted on Friday [18 Mar 2022].

[Checking Indian reports of anthrax in deer shows that there is preponderance of this cervid infection in zoo animals; see below. It is not reported from wild deer, something we see very commonly elsewhere. Wild deer die of many conditions, and carcasses are probably ignored, while they cannot be ignored in zoos or on campuses, and therefore samples are very likely to find their way to the local veterinary diagnostic laboratory.

In my experience, dogs are not a source for anthrax, but they are excellent indicators of anthrax carcasses, which they would have scavenged. In Texas I have seen buzzards feeding off a deer carcass within 20 minutes of the animal collapsing and dying. When sampling possible anthrax carcasses, the bloody soil next to the campus will be positive as well as bloody swabs off the carcass. A quick and easy efficient sample is the nasal turbinates, which will remain positive for a number of years when sampling skulls. With a recent death, a swab of the turbinates is sufficient.

How these campus deer were infected is a question. A possible source can be the mineral mix put out for them when it contains bone meal. Check the feeding station. Otherwise, it can be tabanid flies with contaminated mouthparts from feeding on moribund and dead animals in the vicinity. It would be worth asking around. - Mod.MHJ
