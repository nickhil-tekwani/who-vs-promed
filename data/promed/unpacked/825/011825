RABIES, POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (6)
=====================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis (5)
At the risk of unnecessarily prolonging the discussion, I would like
to respond to Deborah Briggs comment on my comment on HDCV & HRIG.
She is of course correct to point out that, if one or more doses of
VACCINE are given before RIG is given, there is no value in giving
RIG more than 7 days after the first dose of vaccine. I was assuming
that the delay in treatment was a delay in both vaccine and rabies
immune globulin when I suggested that RIG should be given regardless
of the delay. I should have been more specific.
I disagree with part of her comments on intradermal administration of
vaccine, although she is correct in pointing out the importance of
ensuring that the vaccine is indeed given intradermally (and NOT
subcutaneously). If one is experienced at intradermal injection and if
a tuberculin syringe is used, there is NOT a problem with response to
vaccine. We have over 20 years experience in using this method with
very good results as documented by follow-up serology.
