Follow-up tests conducted by the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OIE
Reference Laboratory) and the Onderstepoort Equine Research Centre gave
negative results for African horse sickness (AHS) for both the horse that
died and the two in-contact horses (see Disease Information, 13 [7, 23,
dated 25 Feb 2000).
Repeated antigen capture ELISA performed on the affected horse, as well as
on the two in-contact horses, were negative for AHS. No AHS virus could be
isolated either after inoculation and two passages through mice or in BHK
[baby hamster kidney - Mod.PC monolayer tissue cultures. Both
non-vaccinated, in-contact horses have been asymptomatic for AHS and have
shown no rise in antibody titres after numerous follow-up serum samples
tested with complement fixation tests.
Insofar as all the above-mentioned tests were negative for AHS virus and
antibodies, and as there have been no clinical cases of AHS within the
surrounding horse population, one can consider that this was not an
outbreak of AHS. The initial diagnosis of AHS is considered to have been
due to a non-specific ELISA test.

[I am sending this follow-up message to document that the sometimes
ossified international disease reporting system does indeed have a certain
amount of flexibility. I had held back on the initial report because the
cases were located in the AHS surveillance zone and not the disease free
zone of Western Cape Province in South Africa.
I do think the following message highlights the fact that all epidemiologic
and laboratory information must fit together in order to arrive at a
tenable diagnosis. In this case, over time, the collective information
didn't hold up. Hence the retraction. This is the way things should work.
Kudos to OIE, Ondersterport Veterinary Institute and the South African
Veterinary Authorities. I have included the relevant section of the OIE
text. - Mod.PC
