In a follow-up on a report last week [4 Aug 2022; http://outbreaknewstoday.com/swine-flu-case-detected-in-west-virginia-85274/], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 2 additional human infections with a novel influenza A virus in West Virginia.

The patients were infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. Both patients are <18 years of age, were not hospitalized, and have recovered from their illness.

An investigation by health officials showed that both patients attended an agricultural fair and that swine at this fair tested positive for swine influenza A(H3N2). No person-to-person spread of this virus has been confirmed to date.

They are the 2nd and 3rd patients infected with an H3N2v virus reported from West Virginia in the past 2 weeks; all 3 attended the same agricultural fair prior to illness onset.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus." Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following close proximity to swine, but human-to-human transmission has occurred previously. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.

["H3N2v is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans. Viruses that normally circulate in pigs are "swine influenza viruses." When these viruses infect humans, they are termed "variant" viruses."
(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant/h3n2v-basics.htm)

Influenza A H3N2 variant viruses (also known as "H3N2v" viruses) (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were first detected in people in July 2011. The viruses were first identified in US pigs in 2010. In 2011, 12 human infections with H3N2v were detected. During 2012, there were multiple outbreaks of H3N2v resulting in 309 reported cases. Sporadic infections with H3N2v have continued to be detected since that time (https://healthjade.net/swine-flu/).

Infections with H3N2v have mostly been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Symptoms of H3N2v infection are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Currently, the severity of human illness associated with H3N2v resembles that of seasonal flu.

Most H3N2v infections have occurred in children with exposure to swine; many have occurred at agricultural fairs, as is the case in the report above. Based on the data available on the CDC Flu view page (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html), to date 437 cases of H3N2v have been reported in the United States with 4 new cases reported in 2021-22.

Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has also been detected in the past but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified. Sporadic infections and even localized outbreaks among people with this virus may continue to occur. It's not necessary to avoid agricultural fairs where swine are present. However, people should protect themselves against H3N2v when attending agricultural fairs, particularly where swine are present. - Mod.UBA]
