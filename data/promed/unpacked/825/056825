A New York City pharmacist arrested on drug-related charges admitted in federal court that he had been trying to make weapons-grade ricin and other lethal toxins and had acquired weapons, body armor and manuals on violent confrontation, federal authorities said Thursday (28 May 2014).

Jordan Gonzalez pleaded guilty Thursday [28 May 2014] morning in a federal courtroom in Trenton, New Jersey to knowingly attempting to develop, produce and possess toxins and to possessing equipment for producing illegal narcotics. U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Paul Fishman, said the 34-year-old Gonzalez admitted he had been assembling equipment and materials to produce ricin, abrin and other toxins at his apartments in Jersey City and Manhattan. Gonzalez also obtained weapons, ammunition, body armor and survivalist-themed manuals.

"We all have seen the devastation possible when these behaviors go unchecked," Fishman said. "With today's [28 May 2014] guilty plea, Jordan Gonzalez will face justice and will not be a threat to society."

Gonzalez admitted in court Thursday [28 May 2014] that he had acquired the materials in anticipation of "using them in confrontations with other people in the future," according to the U.S. attorney's office.

The pharmacist was initially charged by federal authorities in New Jersey with trying to manufacture a controlled substance after authorities found he had made a series of purchases through an online auction of materials associated with the hallucinogen known as MDA.

He was arrested on 14 Nov 2013 in Jersey City, and federal agents searched 3 locations he was using: a Jersey City storage unit and Gonzalez's apartments in Jersey City and New York City. Court papers show the searches turned up thousands of seeds containing ricin and abrin, materials to extract and administer those toxins, and explosive precursor chemicals, including materials for making RDX, an explosive compound used in military and commercial demolition applications.

Authorities also found manuals on extracting ricin from seeds, guides for synthesizing explosives and making destructive devices, and numerous books and documents related to the collapse of social order and techniques for surviving in a lawless environment, according to court papers. Federal agents also found approximately 1000 rounds of ammunition, handguns, components for assault rifles and submachine guns, high capacity magazines, a bulletproof vest and a crossbow pistol. Gonzalez also had materials and training manuals for synthesizing controlled substances.

Fishman credited the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration and the cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies for detecting and disrupting Gonzalez's activities.

Gonzalez could face up to life in prison at his 17 Sep 2014 sentencing.

[Finding castor beans alone would have been a weak case. Ricin is naturally contained within the castor bean. Abrin is another plant, the rosary pea or jequirity pea (_Abrus precatorius_), which has a different toxalbumin in it.

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Castor oil does not contain ricin.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C [176 F].

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. A chronic low level could make it difficult to get an accurate diagnosis.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received.

In suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning. No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
