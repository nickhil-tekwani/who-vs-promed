[1] Pakistan: Quetta, Karachi, Peshawar, poliovirus reservoirs - media report
Date: Thu 10 Mar 2016

http://pakobserver.net/2016/03/10/karachi-quetta-polio-virus-reservoirs/


Minister of State for National Health Services Saira made a startling revelation in the Senate on Wednesday [9 Mar 2016] while responding to the queries of the members when she said that Karachi [Sindh province], Quetta [Balochistan province] and Peshawar [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] are the main reservoirs of the crippling polio virus.

The disclosure stunned the lawmakers but the Minister was adamant that she has the requisite statistics and data to prove her point. "Technical Advisory Group established to review situation of poliomyelitis has also stated that the 3 cities including Karachi are reservoirs of polio virus," she said adding the primary reasons of the spread of the virus is the movement of population in these cities. Saira Afzal Tarar regretted that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries where the crippling virus still exists.

The 1st case of polio for the current year was reported in Karachi while 2 of the total 5 cases registered so far in the country hail from Peshawar. The Minister, however, said the federal and provincial governments are giving the eradication of polio as the foremost priority and the same is visible from marked reduction in the cases of polio.

The Minister said though the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was running one day polio campaign which was not sufficient to cover all the children under the age of 5 years but now more practical approach has been adopted by the provincial government to rid the area under its jurisdiction of the crippling virus.

Another polio case reported in Jacobabad
----------------------------------------
Another polio case in a child surfaced in Jacobabad on Thursday [10 Mar 2016], taking the number of polio virus [paralytic polio cases] in Sindh to 2 during the current year [2016].

According to health department sources, a minor was brought to a hospital where he was diagnosed with polio virus positive after testing his blood sample. On the other hand, an anti-polio campaign is underway in different parts of Sindh to vaccinate polio drops to the children.

It may be added that the virus was tested positive in a 34-month-old baby in Karachi. Meanwhile, Karachi Commissioner Asif Hyder Shah on Thursday [10 Mar 2016] claimed that polio vaccine refusal cases had declined by 70 per cent in Karachi and efforts were underway to further improve vaccination coverage in the city by coordination with religious scholars.

The commissioner had stated this during media briefing on polio at Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Sindh Office. Emergency Coordinator Dr Muhammad Usman Chachar, Begum Shahnaz Wazir Ali and others officials were also present on this occasion. Asif Hyder Shah informed that polio refusals cases had been significantly declined from 40 000 to 14 000 in Karachi and further efforts were underway to achieve the target with the help of religious scholars.

He said Pakistan was near to eradicating polio from the country and 3 upcoming polio drives would play a major role in eradication of this crippling disease from the country.

He said eradication of polio virus from Pakistan was not possible without Karachi. He said the overall security situation had been improved in the city in the last 2 years. The security too had been beefed up for the protection of polio workers, he added.

He further informed that 6 polio cases had been reported throughout the country in 2016 out of which 2 were reported from Sindh province. He said a 3-day polio drive would start from [14 Mar 2016] in the city where about 2.2 million would be administrated polio drops.

[It is unclear from the above media report if full laboratory testing results were available to confirm this case as a wild poliovirus (WPV) associated case of paralysis. Given the high volumes of polio cases seen in the country over the past years combined with the massive efforts made towards polio eradication, one presumes that clinicians are able to diagnose cases of suspected polio. What cannot be diagnosed on pure clinical grounds is whether AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases are due to infection with a WPV, a cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus), or not due to poliovirus infection.

The media report lauds the reduction in vaccine refusals during vaccination campaigns, with a 70% reduction -- from 40 000 to 14 000 -- an admirable reduction. An accomplishment, as well as the increased security for vaccination workers. All evidence of the major political commitment to polio eradication. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights of the week
- [8 Mar 2016] marked International Women's Day -- a great opportunity to thank the many thousands of women who have been instrumental in the progress of polio eradication around the world.

- A new short film shown at the Ministerial Conference on Immunization in Africa demonstrates the value of the polio infrastructure in serving broader health goals. Watch the video here [https://vimeo.com/156371519].

- There are 6 weeks to go until the globally synchronized switch from the trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine.

Afghanistan
- The 1st case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in 2016 was reported in the past week, in the district Shigal Wa Sheltan in Kunar province, with onset of paralysis on [1 Feb 2016].
- No new WPV1 environmental positive samples were reported in the past week. The most recent environmental positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] -- one in Jalalabad in Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [15 to 18 Mar 2016], prior to the switch [prior to the switch to bivalent OPV (oral polio vaccine) - Mod.MPP].

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the last week. The most recent case was reported in Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with onset of paralysis on [12 Feb 2016]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 5, compared to 17 reported for 2015 at this point last year [2015]. [See the media report in section [2] above -- it appears as though there may be another case in Sindh province although laboratory studies are pending. - Mod.MPP]
- No new WPV1 environmental positive samples were reported in the past week. The last environmental positive was detected in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; with collection dates between [3 and 10 Feb 2016].
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in March [2016] using tOPV [trivalent oral polio vaccine].

Lao People's Democratic Republic
- Two new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week, in the districts of Phonhong and Muen of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on [18 Oct 2015] and [3 Jan 2016] respectively. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2015 is now 8 and in 2016 is now 3.
- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage. Learn more about VDPVs.
- An emergency outbreak response is continuing in the country, with particular focus on 3 high-risk provinces.
- Efforts continue to further strengthen surveillance activities in all provinces of the country, to assure that no cVPDV1 transmission is missed anywhere.
- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned for March [2016] using tOPV. Both campaigns are targeting an expanded age group of children up to the age of 15 years.

Madagascar
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2016] from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10.
- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.
- The emergency outbreak response continues to be intensified. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [14 to 18 Mar 2016] and [11 to 15 Apr 2016] using tOPV

Myanmar
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the past week. The most recent case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Maungdaw, Rakhine, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 remains 2.
- The case is genetically linked to a VDPV isolated in the same township in April [2015], which has now been reclassified as a cVDPV type 2. The genetic changes in the isolate suggest the cVDPV2 has been circulating for more than a year.
- Significant immunization gaps remain in Myanmar, with an estimated 24% of children un- or under-immunized (source: WHO-UNICEF best estimates, [8 Jan 2016]). Vaccination coverage remains particularly low among special at-risk populations. AFP surveillance quality indicators are acceptable at the national level, but subnational gaps persist.
- While WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Myanmar to be low, surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Nigeria
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. No cases were reported in 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Kwali Local Government Area (LGA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, with onset of paralysis on 16 May 2015; this is the only cVDPV2 case reported in Nigeria in 2015.
- Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that all children are reached with polio vaccines and that surveillance systems remains alert to polioviruses.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [19 to 22 Mar 2016] using trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV).

Ukraine
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2015] in the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2015 remains 2.
- Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to very low vaccination coverage.
- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) using tOPV will be carried out in March [2016].

West Africa
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported from Guinea in the past week. The most recent was reported from Kankan district, with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 remains 7. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) will be carried out in Niger from [10 to 13 Mar 2016] and [1 to 4 Apr 2016], in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania and Sierra Leone from [25 to 28 Mar 2016], and in Benin from [4 to 7 Apr 2016].

[The above global update contains good news and bad news. The good news is that the number of reported cases of WPV associated polio since 1 Jan 2016 is 35% of what the number of cases were this same period last year (2015), and environmental sampling from Afghanistan has not been positive since the end of 2015. The bad news is that there was a new case of WPV associated polio confirmed in Afghanistan with a date of onset 1 Feb 2016, and cVDPV1 continues to circulate in Laos, with the most recent date of onset of a cVDPV paralytic case as 11 Jan 2016.

It is curious that while there is a major countdown towards the global switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) with the planned elimination of the OPV type 2 virus now scheduled for 6 weeks from now in April 2016, if one reads the above update, it appears as though most countries and regions that have been affected by reduced vaccination coverages including cVDPV cases (Laos, Madagascar, Nigeria, Ukraine and West Africa), and WPV cases (Afghanistan and Pakistan) will be conducting vaccination campaigns before the switchover, thereby using tOPV. The original plan for the switchover was to wait until all countries had introduced at least one dose of the IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine), a trivalent vaccine, before the switchover date. One suspects that the increased use of the tOPV immediately preceding the switchover is to increase the likelihood of protection against the cVDPV2 in those countries that will not as yet have implemented the use of IPV as part of the vaccination plans (for more detailed discussion, see http://polioeradication.org/mediaroom/newsstories/Stopping-vaccine-derived-polioviruses/tabid/526/news/1330/Default.aspx and prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis update (03): Pakistan, Laos (cVDPV1), global, WHO, RFI 20160129.3976923).
