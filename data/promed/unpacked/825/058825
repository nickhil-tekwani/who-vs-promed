A plant quarantine disease has been detected in the Kaliningrad region
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rosselkhoznadzor [Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance] has identified a bacterial plant
quarantine disease -- fireblight of fruit trees (_Erwinia amylovora_
(Burill.) Winslow et al) in the Nemanskiy municipal area.

The administration has established a plant quarantine zone in the
area and ordered phytosanitary treatments for plantations of fruit
and ornamental trees, as well as for wild plants of the sub-family
_Pomoideae_ of the family _Rosaceae_, and also for roses and
raspberries. The plant quarantine zone includes the centre of
infection and a buffer zone around several settlements and plantings
in the area.

Measures have been taken to contain the spread of the infection.
Infected plants and potential host plants within a 20 meter [66 ft]
radius [of the infected plants] have been pulled out and burned on
site, and samples for testing have been collected [and surveys
conducted to monitor infections in the area]. Two other centres of
this disease have been identified previously in the Kaliningrad
region, in the Guryevskiy and Zelenogradskiy municipal areas.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family
_Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and
bramble varieties, and the known host range covers more than 140
species from 40 genera.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects, wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds. Since they overwinter almost exclusively in cankers
on limbs infected during the previous season, the amount of inoculum
and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with
high fireblight levels.

Disease management may include monitoring, cultural measures (such as
removal of pathogen reservoirs), and copper sprays. Currently the
most effective control is by application of streptomycin during
flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly
subject to strict regulations. Furthermore, streptomycin resistant
pathogen strains are emerging. Certain cultivar/rootstock
combinations may provide some protection. _E. amylovora_ has been
placed on the quarantine alert list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO).
