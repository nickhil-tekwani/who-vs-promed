A Comment on Arbovirus Hosts
---------------------------
During a widespread outbreak of an arbovirus such as West Nile virus
that infects a wide variety of mosquito species with varying
host-selection patterns, it is not surprising that a variety of
mammals may be infected incidentally and produce antibodies. It does
remain to be shown whether these infections produce disease and
whether these hosts become sufficiently viremic to infect additional
mosquitoes.

[Dr. Reisen makes an important point. The evidence that mammals other
than humans and equines suffer significant diseases a result of
exposure to West Nile virus is not strong. As pointed out previously
during 2001, no West Nile virus-positive tests were reported for any
animal other than birds, equines, and humans. As far as I am aware,
it is generally held that transmission of West Nile virus depends on
amplification of the virus in birds and that neither horses nor
humans develop sufficient viremia to pass the virus directly to
feeding mosquitoes. In experimental infection of horses, which are
the mammals most severely affected by West Nile virus infection,
plasma titers never exceeded 2.5 log units per ml. It seems likely
that although other mammals may become infected, they are not
significant factors in the transmission cycle of West Nile virus. -
