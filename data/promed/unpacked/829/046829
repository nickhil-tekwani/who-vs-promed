In response to and in support of Dr. Luce's comments concerning EHV
testing, as related in the following press statement, the isolate of EHV in
Michigan is identified as Type 1. Additionally, vaccination history is as
yet unconfirmed.
Statement of Michigan Department of Agriculture, Michigan Office of Racing
Commissioner on Equine Herpes Virus at Northville Downs, 21 Dec 2004:
On 8 Dec 2004, animal health surveillance detected a horse exhibiting
symptoms of illness at the Northville Downs racetrack in Northville,
Michigan. On 14 Dec 2004, further testing at the state's Diagnostic Center
for Population and Animal Health on the Michigan State University (MSU)
campus showed the horse had equine herpes virus 1 (EHV-1), a variant of the
virus that can cause respiratory infection, abortion or neurological
disease in equines. On 20 Dec 2004, further lab testing determined that
another racehorse in the quarantined barn tested positive for the disease.
While this disease is NOT transmissible to humans or other animals, it is
very contagious among horses and can cause them severe illness and death.
It can be spread by close contact aerosol, or, in rarer cases, by organic
materials on clothes or equipment. Contaminated feed or water may also
spread the virus. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose or neurological
signs, and typically appear within 21 days of potential exposure.
Michigan animal health, racing commission, and racetrack officials have
taken immediate steps and safeguards to contain and prevent the spread of
the disease. Specifically:
- Enacted a quarantine on the barn housing the affected horses. This
provision prohibits any horses from leaving or entering the facility until
animal health and track officials determine that horses leaving the barn
will not spread the disease.
- Tracing of all horse and/or facilities that the affected horses may
have had contact with. To date, only 3 horses were found to have left the
barn prior to disease detection and subsequent quarantine. These animals
have been located and will be monitored for any signs of illness over the
next 3 weeks.
- Monitoring exposed horses for signs of illness to ensure immediate
detection, if present.
- Requiring frequent disinfecting of quarantined area and potential
disease transmission pathways, including equipment of authorized
individuals entering the barn to care for the horses.
- Requiring separate feed and water sources for horses in the quarantined
barn.
- Prohibiting equipment, including tacks, brushes, hoses, buckets, etc.
from leaving the quarantined barn.
Northville Downs remains open for the conduct of live and simulcast horse
racing. Horse owners with questions should contact the Michigan Department
of Agriculture's State Veterinarian Office at 517-373-1077 or the Michigan
Office of Racing Commissioner at 734-462-2400.
