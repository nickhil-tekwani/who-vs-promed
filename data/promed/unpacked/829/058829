AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS - SENEGAL: SEROTYPE 2, SEQUENCE

Samples of equine blood, spleen, lungs, brain, and liver from a horse that
had died on 30 May 2007 in Senegal, with typical clinical signs of African
horse sickness, were received by the OIE Reference Laboratory for African
horse sickness (AHS), Department of Arbovirology at IAH Pirbright, UK, on 4
Jun 2007. The samples had been sent by the Ministere de l'Elevage,
Republique du Senegal. All of the horses (about 50) on the farm had been
vaccinated with a live AHS-9 vaccine on 22 Mar 2007 and were revaccinated
with the same vaccine on 21 May 2007. The last vaccination was [carried
out] within 10 days of death. Unfortunately, the ice in which the samples
had been packed had melted during transit, and although attempts to isolate
the virus are ongoing, they have been hampered by heavy bacterial
contamination.
RNA was extracted from the samples and tested in RT-PCR assays using
primers specific for genome segment 7 of AHSV (ref 1). In each case, a
strong +ve band of the expected size (1179kb) was detected, confirming the
presence of AHSV RNA. The samples were also tested in an AHSV type-specific
RT-PCR assay using primers designed to target genome segment 2 of each AHSV
serotype.
Two pairs of primers, both of which are specific for AHSV-2 gave strong +ve
bands of the expected sizes (1098bp and 1339bp), indicating that the
samples contained AHSV serotype 2 but none of the other AHSV serotypes
(including the type 9 vaccine strain).
Sequence analysis of the cDNA products amplified from Seg-2 confirmed the
identification of AHSV type 2.
RNA extracted from a sample of the AHSV-9 vaccine from Senegal was also
tested using the group specific and serotype specific RT-PCR assays,
confirming its identity as AHSV-9. This also confirms that the AHSV-9
vaccine was not present in the equine samples from Senegal. The AHSV
segment 2 specific primers were designed for these studies using sequence
data from
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/accession_numbers_for_ahsv_rna_sequences.htm>
and ref 2). These results were communicated to the Senegal authorities and
to OIE on 21 Jun 2007.

[We are grateful to Professor Mertens and his colleagues at Pirbright for
this firsthand, authoritative information.
There are 9 serotypes of AHSV. Serotype 9 is widespread in endemic regions,
while serotypes 1 to 8 are found only in limited geographic areas;
according to available literature, AHSV-9 was the only serotype identified
in Senegal (and Nigeria) in the past; see reference below and Dr Gerdes'
commentary in posting 20070308.0815. The use of the AHSV-9 live attenuated
vaccine in Senegal was, subsequently, quite extensive (25 000 vaccinations
in 2004).
The positive identification of AHSV-2 (by 2 OIE reference laboratories, in
Onderstepoort and Pirbright) highlights the recent spread of a new serotype
into west Africa, though previous occurrence of undetected infections
cannot be ruled out (as reflected by its initial misdiagnosis in Nigeria as
equine herpesvirus).
There is clearly a need for enhanced alertness of horse breeders and the
veterinary authorities in west Africa and elsewhere on the continent and
for strengthened contacts with reference laboratories.
