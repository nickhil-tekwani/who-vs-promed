What you describe is all quite correct, but you should also include the fact that "typhoid fever" is grossly over-diagnosed in many, if not most, poor countries with poor hygiene and a low level of medical care. In Africa, any fever is 1st diagnosed as "typhoid" on the basis of the unreliable Widal test or just habit. This is also true in Southeast Asia and Nepal.

Also, it is important to state that Paratyphi A and B will occur in subjects who have been vaccinated using the current subunit vaccines that protect against _Salmonella_ Typhi only. We have seen patients evacuated to Bangkok who are very upset when told it is Paratyphi A and they had been vaccinated. We need a new enteric fever vaccine soon, as Paratyphi A is now dominant in much of Southeast Asia, particularly India, China and Indonesia.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Wilde for his comments. He is correct on both accounts.

The definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever depends on the isolation of _Salmonella_ Typhi from blood, stools, urine or other bodily fluids. In some developing countries, where the isolation of the organism from cultures is often not feasible, the diagnosis then relies on the Widal test or clinical findings alone.

The Widal test is a slide or tube dilution test that measures the ability of the patient's serum to clump (agglutinate) the H (flagellar), O (somatic) and Vi antigens in a suspension of killed _Salmonella_ Typhi_ or Paratyphi A and B. The presence of agglutination is assessed visually. In the tube dilution test, the smallest quantity of serum that exhibits agglutination is considered the end-point of serum activity or titer.

However, the results of the Widal test are often nonspecific and not sufficiently sensitive (http://pmj.bmj.com/content/76/892/80.long). The antigens used are not standardized; cross-reactivity can occur with other infectious agents (malaria, dengue, miliary tuberculosis, endocarditis, chronic liver disease, brucellosis, etc.), and previous typhoid fever immunization or treatment with antibiotics may influence results. False-positive results will lead to an over-diagnosis of typhoid fever.

Typhoid fever caused by Paratyphi A is on the rise in Asia among the indigenous population and among travelers returning from countries of endemicity (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/241.long). Currently, 2 licensed vaccines against typhoid fever caused by Typhi (parenteral Vi polysaccharide and oral attenuated live Typhi strain Ty21a vaccines) are available. Because _Salmonella_ Typhi, but not Paratyphi A and Paratyphi B, express the Vi antigen, the Vi vaccine will not protect against these pathogens. Results from randomized controlled field trials indicate that the Ty21a vaccine confers some cross-protection against Paratyphi B, but not Paratyphi A disease. - Mod.ML
