4 persons with fever, a rash over the body, and muscle pain that refused to respond to routine antibiotics, were treated at 3 hospitals in Pune [Maharashtra] in January 2012. One of the patients had a black scar, like a cigarette burn, on his thigh. A blood test diagnosed them with scrub typhus fever, a type of mite-borne rickettsial infectious disease. Doctors said that 1 or 2 cases of rickettsial infections crop up in the city every month.

Also known as 'tsutsugamushi fever' (derived from 2 Japanese words: 'tsutsuga', meaning something small and dangerous, and 'mushi', meaning creature), scrub typhus is curable only if a particular type of antimicrobial agent (tetracycline) is used, but it can get out of hand when diagnosis is delayed or a more routine antimicrobial [such as a penicillin - Mod.LL] is used.

It spreads when chiggers, which are mites found in forests, and now in urban shrubs, bite the person and inject a microorganism called _Rickettsia [now renamed _Orientia - Mod.LL] tsutsugamushi_ into the person. A blood test can confirm the infection.

"Farmers, shepherds, and mountaineers are usually at high risk of catching this infection which is transmitted from animals to humans. The disease epidemiology has been changing with increasing urbanization. The vectors of this disease, ticks and mites have now found their residence in urban bushes with increasing transport, influx of people, and city limits extending into nearby rural areas. Hence, we see scrub typhus cases," infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said. He has treated 4 patients with the infection recently.

More cases are being diagnosed than before because of increasing awareness among physicians and easier availability of the diagnostic test, Purandare said. Physicians who have been trained in internal medicine usually do not have difficulty in identifying this infection. The level of awareness among other, particularly primary-care physicians is improving, Purandare said. The gold standard test for diagnosis of rickettsial infections (including scrub typhus) is specific antibody testing. "This test is not available widely. Christian Medical College, Vellore has been doing this test. The other test, which is widely available in Pune, is the Weil-Felix test," Purandare said. Weil-Felix test can diagnose the infection with good sensitivity, but sometimes may be falsely positive due to urinary tract infection.

At Golwilkar Metropolis laboratory, one of the few accredited labs in Pune, the Weil-Felix test was carried out on 267 samples between January 2011 and January 2012. "Of them, 86 samples tested positive. More samples, almost 10 to 12 per month, tested positive for the infection between August and December [2011], while there were sporadic cases during March and April," pathologist Aditi Golwilkar-Mehendale said. Western countries use the rickettsial polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test. "We don't have access to this test except in some rare research setting," Purandare said.

Solapur district and large areas of interior Marathwada are the endemic areas in Maharashtra state. The disease has been endemic also in large areas of south India, particularly Tamil Nadu. Northern areas of India are less affected.

"If closely examined, many patients do have a black necrotic mark or eschar (classically described as cigarette burn mark) on mainly lower limbs due to the tick or mite's bite, which marks the entry point of the infecting organisms," Purandare said. Sometimes the eschar may be present on genitals and may be missed. Many patients do not remember any insect bite and lack of such a history or eschar mark does not rule out possibility of rickettsial infection, he added. "Late diagnosis of this infection is common particularly if patients do not have the typical rash and delay may be fatal in some cases. Routine antibiotics do not work in this infection. The disease can rarely be self-resolving," Purandare said.

A case of scrub typhus, the most common of the rickettsial diseases in India, has high grade fever, a measles-like rash all over the body particularly on palms and soles, eschar at mite bite site, regional lymph node enlargement, increased white cell count, decreased platelet count, and [abnormal] liver and kidney function tests.

"Routine antibiotics do not help. Patients can die of brain involvement (encephalitis), heart involvement (myocarditis), liver or kidney failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or lung failure," said intensivist Prasad Rajhans.

At Ruby Hall Clinic, there were 3 clinically diagnosed cases of scrub typhus in the last 4 months. "Scrub typhus is a one of the forms of rickettsial infection and such Weil-Felix positive cases could be about 12 to 15 per year," said intensivist Prachee Sathe, director, ICU at Ruby Hall Clinic.

"There are some other tropical illnesses manifesting in similar manner involving the same organs (malaria, dengue, viral fevers, leptospirosis). So it becomes difficult to diagnose immediately. Besides, we do not have specific tests. Serological tests take some time. So it is not unusual to miss the diagnosis in the early stages," said Sathe.

Only the tetracycline group of antibiotics or chloramphenicol work in these cases. If diagnosed early, 7 days of oral treatment is sufficient. Very rapid response with resolution of fever in 48 hours of starting therapy is characteristic. Treatment of complicated disease and treatment of pregnant patients is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

[Weil and Felix described the classical assay for rickettsial antibody detection in 1916. The methodology took advantage of heterophilic (cross-reacting) antigens of members of the genus _Rickettsia_ and several species of the Gram negative bacillus _Proteus_. In the Weil-Felix test, bacteria of _Proteus vulgaris_ OX-19 agglutinate with sera of those infected with typhus group organisms as well as from the Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_. Cells of _P. vulgaris_ OX-2, on the other hand, agglutinate with sera from individuals with spotted fever infection, except RMSF. The OX-19 agglutination is seen in epidemic typhus, but usually not in Brill-Zinsser recrudescent disease. _P. mirabilis_ OX-K can be similarly used in the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including [one for] complement fixation antibodies. - Mod.LL]
