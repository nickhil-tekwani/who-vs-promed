Interim guidelines for smallpox response and management published in the
United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------
On 2 Dec 2002, the Department of Health in England published guidelines for
responding to a deliberate release of smallpox (1,2). The guidelines, which
are for discussion over the next month, describe vaccination strategies
prior to and in the event of an outbreak, procedures for diagnosis and
management of the initial cases, and other essential outbreak preparedness
and control measures.
The level of threat of a deliberate release is unknown but is likely to be
extremely low. While smallpox remains eradicated, the risks from adverse
effects of vaccination outweigh the risks from disease. Experience in the
United States in the late 1960s found that among people aged over 20 years
who were being vaccinated for the first time severe adverse vaccine related
events occurred at a rate of around 1500 per million people vaccinated,
with about one death per million people vaccinated (3).
The number of people to be vaccinated will therefore be limited to a few
hundred specialist health care workers who would be required to assess and
manage any initial cases. In the event of a heightened threat, for example
if smallpox re-emerges elsewhere in the world, a greater number of health
care, emergency, and other essential personnel will be offered vaccination
in case they are required to respond to a smallpox emergency in the United
Kingdom (UK).
Rapid diagnosis and response to the first cases is essential to limit the
size of any outbreak. To help familiarise clinicians with the symptoms and
signs of smallpox, a diagnostic algorithm is to be distributed:
<http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/cbrpdf/smallpoxfig10.pdf>.
A network of teams of vaccinated workers including infectious disease (ID)
physicians will be available to visit and assess cases of suspicious
illness. If smallpox is suspected, these emergency diagnosis and response
teams will be called out to initiate laboratory investigation and further
management of the patient. Regional directors of public health in England
have been given responsibility for establishing networks of ID physicians
and emergency teams. Members will be identified and then vaccinated, and it
is hoped that this can be completed by the end of January 2003.
In the event of an outbreak, a search and containment strategy will be
deployed, with rapid isolation of cases and tracing, vaccination, and
monitoring of contacts. To prepare for this all regions have been asked to
identify smallpox care centres and smallpox vaccination centres that could
be opened within 24 hours to provide isolation for cases and vaccination
for contacts. Search and containment measures will focus on close contacts
of smallpox patients, since they are most at risk from infection.

[The UK is currently undergoing a process similar to those ongoing in the
USA, Canada, and Israel -- the development of a smallpox vaccination
strategy in the event of an intentional release of smallpox virus.
ProMED-mail has covered the USA smallpox vaccination strategy development
in great detail (see references below). One can argue that the use of the
old vaccinia preparations (NYBOH [New York Board of Health]and Lister
strains) in current times would classify as a "re-emerging" infectious
disease -- we really do not know whether the reported side effect rates
from the 60s and 70s still apply, given the higher numbers of
immune-compromised individuals in the general population, and we don't know
much about long term immunity and supposed safety of revaccination.
The interim plan for the UK smallpox strategy can be found at
<http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm>. Page 39 of this
interim smallpox plan specifically mentions: "Smallpox vaccination carries
a risk of complications, which occurred at a higher frequency than that now
acceptable for a modern vaccine. These complications occurred more
frequently in people who were immunosuppressed, people with eczema, and
pregnant women. Because of this, mass vaccination of the population is not
a first-line option either prior to or in the event of an outbreak."
The interim response plan is well thought out. Several of the newswire
reports that surrounded the public release of this interim smallpox plan
focused on the possibility of increased public demand for the vaccine that
might lead to greater availability of the vaccine in the general
population. One hopes that sound public health recommendations will not be
compromised by popular demand. - Mod.MPP]
