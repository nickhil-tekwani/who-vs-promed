A study revealing wide-spread abnormalities in frogs in Maine, Vermont and
Minnesota has alarmed scientists since amphibians are barometers of
potentially serious environmental problems.
In the most extensive study undertaken, the National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wisconsin examined 180 damaged northern leopard frogs collected
at 16 sites and performed sophisticated X-rays on their bone structure to
determine the cause of the abnormalities.
Among the possible clues to what went amiss in the frogs' development are
chemicals in the environment, the sun's ultra violet rays and possibly
infection from a parasitic worm.
The lead researcher, veterinarian pathologist Carol Meteyer, said the
frogs' deformities are tied to both where the animals live and the stage in
their development when the damage occurred.
Monday's Portland Press Herald reported that in Maine, a number of the
deformed frogs came from a 9000-acre refuge in Sunkhaze Meadows National
Wildlife Refuge in Milford, north of Bangor. The frogs found there had an
extra third leg, 12 toes, additional bones in their feet and increased
sheaths of skin.
These frogs are doomed to an early death, said Meteyer. "They can't stretch
their legs," she said. "It's like a tight band of skin holding the ankle up
to the hip, and so they can't really jump very well. It causes rotation of
the leg, which causes them to jump in the wrong direction. They think they
are going straight, and they're actually going off at an angle."
In Vermont, the deformed frogs were missing bones, and in some cases there
was no evidence of hip development. n Minnesota, scientists found a
parasitic worm, also discovered at Sunkhaze. The immature worm penetrates
the skin of tadpoles, arresting their normal development.
In a study last year of wildlife refuges, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service discovered abnormalities in green frogs, pickerel frogs, bullfrogs,
northern leopard frogs and American toads at Rachel Carson National
Wildlife Refuge in Wells, Maine, and at Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge
in Newington, New Hampshire.At the Carson refuge, the frogs lacked eyes and
hind legs and had 2 feet, 1 growing on top of another.
The results of a 2-year U.N. study on the world's environmental health will
be presented to the U.N. General Assembly in September. Reflecting on the
findings of 197 scientists, the report is expected to shed light on the
current health of the world's ecosystems and the creatures, such as the
amphibians, that are in danger.
