Dr Clement Malau provides an excellent review of Enteritis Necroticans
(Pigbel) in his message of 11 June 1998. I helped Dr Greg Lawrence test
the vaccine against this disease (Lancet 1979;1:227-230) and I developed
the treatment protocols (PNG Med J 1979;22:30-34). I have a couple of
comments to make.
Although chloramphenicol is a sensible treatment for this disease,
penicillin plus gentamicin plus metronidazole is preferable if these drugs
are available. Parenteral metronidazole is expensive, but rectal
suppositories are inexpensive and effective. Although chloramphenicol is
very active against _C. perfringens_, it is degraded in the gut - so the
organism is cleared much slower by chloramphenicol than by metronidazole.
For a variety of reasons, the best common name for Enteritis Necroticans is
"Pigbel" (see Shann F. Pikbel, pigbel, pig-bel or pig bel? PNG Med J
1979;22:98-99).
