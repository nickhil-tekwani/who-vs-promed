Recently, a 52-year-old female reported 2 weeks of myalgia,
arthralgia, headache, joint pain, "swollen feet and toes" and
inability to wear her usual shoes due to swelling. Otherwise, she was
healthy. An initial CBC done at a local private hospital revealed WBC
of 2500, neutophils 78 percent, lymphocytes 18 percent and platelets
160 000. Unfortunately, she was not tested for dengue or chikungunya
virus or antibody. She presented here 2 weeks later with the above
complaints, and the CBC was repeated along with tests for
chickungunya, dengue and parvovirus antibody. Chikungunya IgM was
positive. Dengue IgM and IgG were negative, and human parvovirus IgG
was positive. The patient clinically improved but with residual joint
pain, albeit much improved compared to initial presentation.

In Malaysia, it makes sense to screen for both chikungunya and dengue
virus infections in patients with presenting complaints compatible
with either virus infection to better track the occurrence of these
diseases epidemiologically. Another 23-year-old female with similar
complaints tested positive for dengue (IgM positive) and negative for
chikungunya virus antibody. Platelets were 72 000. Anecdotally, it
seems that chikungunya virus infection does not cause the degree of
thrombocytopenia that dengue virus infection does. As a general rule,
based on nothing other than my opinion, when we start to see these
illnesses in our Embassy-based population, it typically means these
diseases are quite endemic locally.

[Since the 52-year-old patient had IgM antibody to chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) and IgG to human parvovirus, it is more likely that she had
been infected by CHIKV than had the Fifth disease (parvovirus). This
report provides additional evidence that chikungunya virus is still
being transmitted in Kuala Lampur. ProMED thanks Mari Sullivan for
sending in this firsthand report of a chikungunya case, and her
comments underscore the need to do laboratory confirmation to
differentiate between chikungunya and dengue virus infections when
they are occurring in the same general locality.

[While Fifth disease (parvovirus) is most commonly a childhood
disease, it has been reported in adults. The clinical presentation
in adults is very similar to chikungunya - fever, rash and joint
involvement with a predilection for hand, wrist and knee involvement,
although generally milder. As the majority of cases of fifth
disease occur during childhood years, the presence of IgG antibodies
against parvovirus B19 in an adult is not surprising and is most
likely an indication of prior infection. In the above case report,
the presence of headache and myalgias in addition to significant
joint swelling, and the presence of IgM antibodies against
chikungunya virus strongly point to a resolving chikungunya
infection. Oftentimes the expatriate community living in an area are
good sentinels for endemic diseases -- in the absence of pre-existing
antibodies, exposure to these viral agents leads to a higher attack
rate among this group than in the general population in an area where
there are high levels of pre-existing antibodies from earlier
infections. - Mod.MPP]
