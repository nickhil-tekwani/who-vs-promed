Polluted stormwater and a cold weather snap are believed responsible for a bacteria outbreak in the Benowa Flood Channel that has killed 140 ducks in the past week [20-26 May 2013].

Gold Coast City Council community and cultural development chairman Bob La Castra said veterinary investigations found the suspected cause of death was avian botulism -- a disease caused by naturally occurring bacteria.

About 140 birds, mainly ducks, have been removed from the site following reports to council.

"This flood channel receives stormwater runoff that is known to have high nutrients due to pollution," said Cr [council representative] La Castra. "This, combined with the recent cold weather, is likely to have triggered the bacteria. Water birds are most susceptible to the bacteria because they dive down to feed close to the sediment in the waterways. The Benowa Flood Channel is not a recreational waterway. The bird deaths have been reported to Queensland Health and Environment and Heritage Protection."

Cr La Castra warned botulism was potentially harmful to humans and animals. "The main messages are to avoid contact with this waterway and to keep pets away", he said. "If you do happen to come into contact with any sick animal always wash your hands thoroughly."

Signs of avian botulism in birds include droopy necks, trouble swimming or flying, and lethargy.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Spores of these bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

We await tests results to confirm the diagnosis.
