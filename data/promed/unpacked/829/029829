2003/099 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
----------------------------------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on the
EPPO Alert List.
New geographical records:
Serbia & Montenegro
-------------------
Specimens of _Globodera rostochiensis_ [Gr] (EPPO A2 list) were found in
potato roots at Jadognja (Krupanj) and Ponikve (Uzice), in soil samples at
Aljinovici (Prijepolje), and in storehouse potato debris at Kusici. This is
considered as the first record of Gr in Serbia and Montenegro (Krnjaic et
al, 2002). Present, first reported in 2002 in the west part of the country.
India
-----
In India, _Heterodera glycines_ [Hg] (EPPO A2 list, also on the EPPO Alert
List) was identified on soil samples collected from soybean fields in
Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. This is the first report of Hg in India (Kaushal et
al, 2002). Present, first reported in 2002 in Madhya Pradesh.
South Africa
------------
_Meloidogyne fallax_ [Mf] (EPPO A2 list) is reported for the first time in
South Africa (Fourie et al, 2001). This confirms earlier reports. Present,
no details.
Burkina Faso
------------
_Radopholus similis_ [Rs] occurs on banana in Burkina Faso (Sawadogo et
al., 2001). Present, no details.
Indonesia
---------
In 2003, a breeding company submitted samples of tomato originating from
Indonesia for diagnosis. Diseased samples collected from field and
protected crops, showed severe chlorosis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of tomato infectious
chlorosis [closterovirus] [TICV] (EPPO Alert List). This is the first
report of TICV in Indonesia (Verhoeven et al., 2003). Present, no details.
Detailed records:
Argentina
---------
In Argentina, _Nacobbus aberrans_ [Na] (EPPO A1 list) was found in Rio
Negro and Santa Fe provinces for the first time (Chaves & Torres, 2001).
Spain
------
Studies were done in 2001 on the incidence of tomato yellow leaf curl
begomovirus (TYLCV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia begomovirus
(TYLCV-Sar -­ both on the EPPO A2 list) in tomato crops in Comunidad
Valenciana, Spain. TYLCV was found in all tomato-growing areas, whereas
TYLCV-Sar was only detected in 2 plants near Elche, in the south of
Comunidad Valenciana (Rubio et al, 2002).

[Gr (golden nematode or potato cyst nematode) is found worldwide and is
common on potato and other crops. Losses due to nematode feeding can be
extensive (20 to 70 per cent). Hg was introduced into the EPPO region in
2000 in Lombardia, Italy. It is also found in several Asian countries,
Egypt, and North and South America. Soybean is its major host. Hg interacts
with the brown stem rot pathogen _Phialophora gregata_ and _Fusarium
solani_, causing sudden death syndrome of soybean. Rs is a serious pathogen
of banana and citrus, causing crop losses ranging from 5 to 100 per cent.
Crop losses have been reported for Mf (False Columbia root-knot nematode)
in potato (up to 65 per cent) and bean (35 per cent). The nematode is a
problem in potato production in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.
General management strategies for nematode-induced diseases include
planting resistant cultivars where available, crop rotation, incorporating
soil amendments (chicken manure, compost), solarization (heating of soil
under clear plastic tarps), and nematocides.
I apologize for the lack of diacritic marks on the proper names and names
of towns in this piece. I have provided them without the marks as some
email programs fail to recognize them. - Mod.DH]
