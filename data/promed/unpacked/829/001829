Two children under the age of 5 [years of age] have had meningococcal disease [in New Plymouth, New Zealand].

In an emailed statement, Te Whatu Ora national public health service medical officer of health for Taranaki Dr Neil de Wet said both cases were under 5 years old and, thankfully, were identified early. "This means they received fast, effective treatment and made rapid recoveries. Household contacts of each of the cases were also offered advice and preventative treatment."

No direct links have been found between these 2 cases, which are the only cases reported in the region this year [2022].

However, they were an important reminder to be aware of this disease, which can be very serious, and its symptoms, de Wet said. "Symptoms and signs do vary, but in children and adults can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, muscle and joint pain, vomiting, a dislike of bright light, drowsiness, and convulsions. There may also be a rash consisting of reddish-purple pin-prick spots or bruises. Symptoms in babies can be more subtle and, in addition to the above, may include floppiness, refusing feeds, pale skin, and high-pitched crying."

De Wet said if anyone suspected they or someone they knew had meningococcal disease, it was very important to get urgent medical attention: call 111, call your doctor, or go to a hospital. You can also call Healthline free on 0800 611 116, 24 hours a day. If you have been seen by a doctor and gone home but are still concerned, don't hesitate to call your doctor again or seek further medical advice, de Wet said. With meningococcal disease, prompt treatment with antibiotics could prevent permanent disability and death.

Meningococcal disease can affect anyone, however it's more common in children under the age of 5, teenagers, and young adults. Meningococcal cases were lower than usual in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic but have increased again in 2022, although not yet to the same level as the years before the pandemic.

[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, X, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. "In New Zealand from 2015 to 2017, [sero]groups B and C were the most frequent causes of meningococcal disease. However, this has changed since 2018 with an increase in disease caused by groups W or Y. Over 2018-2019, just under half of cases were caused by meningococcal group B, and just under half by groups C, W, or Y. Meningococcal group A rarely causes disease in New Zealand."

There are 2 funded meningococcal vaccines available in New Zealand: a vaccine that covers only serogroup B meningococci (Bexsero) and a tetravalent conjugated vaccine that covers serogroups A, C, W, and Y, but not B.

The meningococcal ACWY vaccine (Menactra) is fully funded in New Zealand for
- children, teenagers, and adults with weakened immune systems who are at risk of meningococcal disease or who are a close contact of someone with meningococcal disease; and
- individuals aged 13 to 25 years in a close-living situation who are within the next 3 months or are in their 1st year of living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks, or prisons (https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/medicines/m/meningococcal-vaccine/).

The meningococcal B vaccine is also fully funded in New Zealand for:
- children, teenagers and adults with weakened immune systems who are at risk of meningococcal disease, having had meningococcal disease of any serogroup, or are a close contact of someone with meningococcal disease, but not for those in a close-living situation (https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/medicines/m/meningococcal-vaccine/).

The news report above does not tell us about the serogroup(s) of the meningococcus causing the infections or the meningococcal immunization status of the 2 children.

New Plymouth (pop. 58 500 residents, about 46% of the total population of the Taranaki Region) is the major city of the Taranaki region on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Plymouth).
