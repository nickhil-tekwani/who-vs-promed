Nebraska: Dead Blue Jay Is First Case of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------------
In what appears to be the first case of its kind in the state, a dead blue
jay found in northeast Lincoln has tested positive for West Nile virus. A
second test to confirm the result is pending at the National Wildlife
Health Center in Madison, Wis. State medical entomologist Wayne Kramer said
he expects a positive result, making Nebraska the 30th state to find the
virus within its borders. "Most likely once it's here, it's going to be
here," Kramer said. The virus's arrival is hardly unexpected. Since its
discovery in New York in 1999, the virus has spread steadily west, reaching
eastern Iowa during the summer of 2001. Texas and North Dakota have also
confirmed cases this year.
In response to the local discovery, the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health
Department announced it would step up mosquito trapping and testing in
northeast Lincoln, starting Tuesday night. "It's definitely not something
to panic about," said Joyce Jensen of the Health Department. "There's a low
chance of a human being infected. We're just trying to determine the amount
of the virus present in the community." Humans can only be infected if
bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus. Mosquitoes pick it up by feeding
on infected birds. Most people bitten do not get sick (150 cases have been
reported nationwide); even then, symptoms are usually mild. They include
fever, headaches, body aches, sore throat, fatigue, or swollen glands. In a
few cases, more serious symptoms can occur: rapid onset of a high fever,
confusion, tremors, stiff neck, paralysis, and swelling of the brain. Death
is very rare. Nationally, 18 people have died from the disease, most of
them elderly. Almost all lived in the Southeast. This year there have been
3 [now 7 - Mod.CP] confirmed human infections, all in Louisiana.
Of the 80 species of birds known to carry the disease, blue jays and crows
most often die from it, Kramer said. That means related species such as
magpies and pinon jays will likely be at particular risk as the virus moves
west to western Nebraska.
One type of mosquito, _Culex spp_, carries the virus most often. Generally,
_Culex spp_ make up about 5 percent of mosquitoes in Lancaster County, but
dry weather means the hardier _Culex spp_ will make up a greater percentage
of local mosquitoes, Kramer said.

[Nebraska is on the same longitudinal line as North Dakota, Manitoba, and
Texas, so it's just further confirmation of the westward extension to date.
