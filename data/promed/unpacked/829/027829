Abstract
--------
Background
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by _Leishmania_ parasites, infects mammals transmitted by _Phlebotomine_ sand-flies and mostly affects the poorest. VL distributed worldwide and prevalent in Ethiopia. Knowing the occurrence of disease and risk factors is a remedy for controlling. The aim of the study was to identify factors associated with VL.

Methods
Case control study was carried out during October-November 2019 in Borena. A 1:2 Cases and controls were identified by case definition and 33 cases were included in the study. Participants >18 years interviewed and caregivers of <18 were questioned for legal issue. Epi-info and SPSS were used for data entry and analysis. Primarily predictors were identified using chi-square at a significant level P<0.05 with 95% CI, then candidate predictors were analysed using bivariate and multivariate analysis to identify associated factors.

Result
Among 153 suspected cases, 9 suspected deaths reported; 33 (22%) cases and 3 deaths were verified for VL. Among 33 verified cases 15 (45.5%) were in July 2019, in comparison of 4 years data, there is surge cases in July-August 2019, 26 (79%) cases were from Dire, attack rate (AR) = 15/100 000, CFR=9.1%. Among all, 15-64 years were highly affected with AR=19.3. A case control engaged 99 (100%) respondents and among all 93 (93.9%) were male, 68 (68.8%) were 15-64 years. Adult education adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 30.438 (2.378, 389.602), bed-net AOR=9.024 (1.763, 46.205) and walling AOR=0.052 (0.004, 0.739) were associated factors with VL at 95% CI with p-value<0.05.

Conclusion
Male 15-64 years were highly susceptible. Level of education, ITNs, and walling were associated factors with VL. Formulating policies and guidelines for males 15-64 years, related vector control and awareness creation regarding feeding habit of sand fly, prevention, and control were recommended. Awareness of community on prevention methods, using repellents, ITNs utilization, and safe sleeping mechanisms are mandatory. Further investigation on the issue is the best remedy to overcome future VL outbreak occurrences.

[The area is endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The key result of this study is that insecticide treated nets (usually used to prevent malaria transmission) significantly reduced the risk of developing visceral leishmaniasis. Conditional odds ratio of (95%CI) 6.421 (2.03,20.32); adjusted odds ratio of (95% C.I. 9.024 (1.76,46.21); with a p=008. - Mod.EP
