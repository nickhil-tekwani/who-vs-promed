Multistate outbreak of listeriosis associated with Jensen Farms
cantaloupe - United States, August-September 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Listeriosis is caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive
bacillus common in the environment and acquired by humans primarily
through consumption of contaminated food. Infection causes a spectrum
of illness, ranging from febrile gastroenteritis to invasive disease,
including sepsis and meningoencephalitis. Invasive listeriosis occurs
predominantly in older adults and persons with impaired immune
systems. Listeriosis in pregnant women is typically a mild "flu-like"
illness, but can result in fetal loss, premature labor, or neonatal
infection. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. On 2 Sep 2011, the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) notified
CDC of 7 cases of listeriosis reported since 28 Aug 2011. On average,
Colorado reports 2 cases of listeriosis annually in August. By 6 Sep
2011, all 7 Colorado patients interviewed with the Listeria Initiative
questionnaire reported eating cantaloupe in the month before illness
began, and 3 reported eating cantaloupe marketed as "Rocky Ford."

A case was defined as illness with one of the outbreak strains
isolated on or after 1 Aug 2011. Outbreak strains initially were
defined as: 1) clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ with
specimen collection dates in August 2011; 2) with a 2-enzyme,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern combination that
occurred in 2 or more persons; and 3) that matched any of the 2
pattern combinations found among Colorado residents in August 2011.
Analysis of Listeria Initiative data comparing the 1st 19
outbreak-associated cases in 2011 with 85 cases among persons aged 65
years or greater with sporadic listeriosis identified during August of
the years 2004-2010 indicated that cantaloupe consumption was strongly
associated with illness caused by the outbreak strains: 19 of 19 (100
percent) versus 54 of 85 (64 percent); (odds ratio = 14.9; 95 percent
CI = 2.4-infinity). Initial tracebacks of cantaloupe purchased by
patients converged on Jensen Farms in Colorado.

After cantaloupe was implicated, PulseNet, the national molecular
subtyping network for foodborne bacterial disease surveillance,
detected a multistate cluster with a 4th PFGE pattern combination; a
sample of cantaloupe collected from the implicated farm yielded _L.
monocytogenes_ with this pattern, and interviews with patients
revealed that most had consumed cantaloupe. Isolates with this pattern
were then also considered to be among the outbreak strains. By 29 Sep
2011, 84 cases with one of the 4 outbreak PFGE pattern combinations
had been reported from 19 states, including 83 with information on the
date of illness onset. Among the patients, 88 percent were aged 60
years or greater (range: 35-96 years); 55 percent were female, and 2
were pregnant. 15 deaths were reported. 92 percent (57 of 62 with
information on food consumption) reported eating cantaloupe in the
month before illness began. All 4 outbreak strains of _L.
monocytogenes_ were isolated from whole and cut cantaloupe samples
from patients' homes or from samples of Jensen Farms cantaloupe
collected from grocery stores and the farm. On 14 Sep 2011, the farm
issued a voluntary recall of its cantaloupe.

This outbreak has several unusual features. First, this is the 1st
listeriosis outbreak associated with melon. Second, 4 widely differing
PFGE pattern combinations and 2 serotypes (1/2a and 1/2b) have been
associated with the outbreak. Third, this outbreak is unusually large;
only 2 US listeriosis outbreaks, one associated with frankfurters (108
cases) and one with Mexican-style cheese (142), have had more cases
[1,2]. Additional cases likely will be reported because of the long
incubation period (usually 1-3 weeks, range: 3-70 days) and the time
needed for diagnosis and confirmation. Fourth, this outbreak has the
highest number of deaths of any US foodborne outbreak since a
listeriosis outbreak in 1998 [1].

CDC recommends that persons do not eat cantaloupes from Jensen Farms.
This recommendation is especially important for persons at greater
risk for listeriosis, including older adults, persons with weakened
immune systems, and pregnant women. Not all of the recalled
cantaloupes are individually labeled with stickers to indicate
production by Jensen Farms. Consumers should consult the retailer or
discard any cantaloupe of uncertain origin. Recommendations for
preventing listeriosis from other foods are available at

Multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to whole cantaloupes from
Jensen Farms, Colorado. Today's highlights, 4 Oct 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 11 am EDT on 3 Oct 2011, a total of 100 persons infected with
any of the 4 outbreak-associated strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_
have been reported to CDC from 20 states. All illnesses started on or
after 31 Jul 2011. The number of infected persons identified in each
state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1) California (1),
Colorado (30), Idaho (1), Illinois (1), Indiana (2), Kansas (7),
Maryland (1), Missouri (3), Montana (1), Nebraska (6), New Mexico
(13), North Dakota (1), Oklahoma (11), Texas (14), Virginia (1), West
Virginia (1), Wisconsin (2), and Wyoming (2).

18 deaths have been reported: 5 in Colorado, 2 in Kansas, 1 in
Maryland, 1 in Missouri, 1 in Nebraska, 5 in New Mexico, 1 in
Oklahoma, and 2 in Texas.

On 14 Sep 2011, FDA issued a press release to announce that Jensen
Farms issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes
after being linked to a multistate outbreak of listeriosis. Although
Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall of Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes
on 14 Sep 2011 and the recalled cantaloupe should be off store
shelves, more ill persons may be reported because of the time lag
between diagnosis and laboratory confirmation and also because up to 2
months can elapse between eating contaminated food and developing
listeriosis. CDC recommends that consumers not eat Rocky Ford-brand
cantaloupe from Jensen Farms. This is especially important for older
adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women. Even
if some of the cantaloupe has been eaten without becoming ill, dispose
of the rest of the cantaloupe immediately.

_Listeria_ bacteria can grow in the cantaloupe at room and
refrigerator temperatures.

Cantaloupes that are known to NOT have come from Jensen Farms are safe
to eat. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe
for purchase, they should ask the grocery store. A cantaloupe
purchased from an unknown source should be discarded: "when in doubt,
throw it out."

An elderly woman from East Baton Rouge Parish died over the weekend
[1-2 Oct 2011] after being diagnosed with listeriosis, Louisiana's
state epidemiologist, Dr Raoult Ratard, said Monday [3 Oct 2011]. The
woman had eaten cantaloupe 2 or 3 weeks earlier, but her family didn't
know which store or state it came from, he said.

Investigators will try to learn whether the _Listeria_ is the same
strain found in Colorado cantaloupe recalled because of the bacterium,
but it will take at least a week to grow and test the bacteria and the
tests may be inconclusive, Ratard said.

Cantaloupe from Jensen Farms in Colorado has been linked to 84
illnesses and as many as 17 deaths in 19 states.

State officials said Friday [30 Sep 2011] that Jensen Farms had added
Louisiana to its recall list for cantaloupes shipped between 29 Jul
and 10 Sep 2011.

The fatal infection is the only listeriosis case reported since July
2011 in Louisiana, Ratard said. "By now any (recalled) cantaloupe left
would be rotten. So it looks like the danger from cantaloupe is very
low now," Ratard said. "But you never know. Something else may come
up."

_Listeria_ is common in soil and water, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC's website says it can be found
in uncooked meats and vegetables, unpasteurized milk and cheese made
from unpasteurized milk, and processed meats, smoked seafood, and soft
cheeses that become contaminated after cooking and processing. And
since it can take a month or more for symptoms to show up, people who
ate contaminated cantaloupe before the recall could still get sick.

Symptoms can vary widely. The CDC says older adults and people with
immune system disorders are most likely to develop blood poisoning and
meningitis, which can cause headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of
balance, and convulsions. Pregnant women may have a mild, flu-like
illness followed by a miscarriage or a life-threatening illness in the
newborn. People whose immune systems are in good shape may not feel
sick or might get high fever and muscle aches, with diarrhea, nausea,
or vomiting sometimes coming first.

[As of 3 Oct 2011, a total of 100 persons infected with any of the 4
outbreak-associated strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been
reported to CDC from 20 states. 18 deaths were reported from 8 states.
Listeriosis is known to be more severe in the elderly and almost 90
percent were 60 years of age or greater in the current outbreak. 2
were pregnant. Although, most pregnant women may experience mild
illness, maternal bacteremia can result in intrauterine infection that
may be followed by fetal loss or neonatal infection. No mention is
made of associated miscarriages, stillbirths, or neonatal infection in
this current outbreak. More cases likely will be reported because of
the long incubation period (up to one month or more) and the time
needed for diagnosis of this disease.

For comparison, in a prior large, national listeriosis outbreak that
was associated with contaminated frankfurters, 108 cases were reported
with 14 associated deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths (Mead, PS,
Dunne EF, Graves L, et al: Nationwide outbreak of listeriosis due to
contaminated meat. Epidemiol Infect 2006; 134(4): 744-51; available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870438) and in a prior
large outbreak that was associated with Mexican-style cheese, 142
cases were reported with 48 deaths: 20 fetuses, 10 neonates, and 18
non pregnant adults (Linnan, MJ, Mascola L, Lou XD, et al: Epidemic
listeriosis associated with Mexican-style cheese. N Engl J Med 1988;
319(13): 823-8; abstract available at
