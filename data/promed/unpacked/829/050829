The death toll from the outbreak of an unknown disease that appeared in Tanjakot Rural Municipality of Humla about 3 weeks ago has reached 10, with one more fatality reported today [30 Apr 2019], as health authorities scramble to identity and contain the outbreak.

Today [30 Apr 2019], 62-year-old PB of Bhadaura in Tajakot succumbed to the disease. In the wake of the outbreak, 2 separate teams of health workers including experts from Mugu and Surkhet had reached Tajakot yesterday [29 Apr 2019].

While the provincial government, in coordination with the federal government, sent a team led by Dr KN Poudel with necessary medicines to the outbreak-hit village via a Nepal Army chopper, another team of health workers led by Dr Manoj Timalsina from Ratamata Primary Health Centre of Mugu reached the village yesterday [29 Apr 2019] on foot.

While the Dr Poudel-led team has been examining patients after setting up a camp at Bhaisamajh Community Health Unit, the Dr Timilsina-led team is treating patients from Maila Health Post. The teams are said to have examined more than 200 patients since yesterday [29 Apr 2019] in the village.

Though the doctors, on the basis of the symptoms, suspect the outbreak to be seasonal common cold and cough, they said they couldn't say anything for sure until the test report.

"We can say for sure what the cause of deaths is only after we return to Surkhet with samples of patients' spittle [respiratory samples?] and test it in the laboratory," said leader of the team, Dr KN Poudel, adding that the spittle samples would be sent to Surkhet on Tuesday [30 Apr 2019], and it may take 3-4 days for the results to arrive.

[The above report mentions that over 200 persons have been examined in context of the undiagnosed illness. The few symptoms mentioned in the report are suggestive of a possible respiratory illness outbreak. Any further information on the clinical profile of the cases, especially the fatal cases, associated co-morbid conditions, history or otherwise of animal exposure, or animal die-offs in the area, and laboratory results as they become available would be highly appreciated.

Humla is considered one of the most remote and isolated regions in Nepal, reachable only by foot or small aircraft, which irregularly land in the district headquarters, Simikot. It is high in the Himalaya, in the Karnali Zone, northwestern Nepal, bordering the Tibetan Autonomous Region; http://headnepal.org/abouthumla.php. - Mod.UBA
