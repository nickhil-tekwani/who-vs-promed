A total of 2 cases of dengue fever have been reported on Grand
Cayman, leading to fears of an outbreak in the Cayman Islands.

Commenting on the situation, Leader of Opposition Hon. McKeeva Bush
said, "I am concerned and dismayed that there are 2 confirmed cases
of dengue fever present on Grand Cayman and that there has been no
announcement from the Government to alert the public of the situation."

According to Mr. Bush, Government made a statement several weeks ago
asking people to be careful when they visit countries that have the
presence of dengue fever. At the same time, the Government suggested
that there were no active cases in the Cayman Islands, Mr. Bush alleged.

"This is most ingenuous of the Government since there are 2 confirmed
cases, one in George Town and one in West Bay," he said.

The Mosquito Research Control Unit (MRCU) is responsible for aerial
spraying of chemicals that kill adult and larval mosquitoes. However,
it is understood that one of its pilots has resigned, reducing the
emphasis that can be put on aerial prevention of the disease.

"They say that it is imported and isolated, as these 2 individuals
had travelled to 2 different countries before coming here," he said.

The Cayman Islands receives large numbers of immigrants and tourists,
many of whom tour the region before arriving here.

[It is not clear if these 2 cases are imported, which seems likely,
and not dengue virus infections acquired locally. If imported, they
are indeed isolated, and may not be a source of further virus
transmission. The article makes no mention about the status of _Aedes
ageypti_ mosquitoes on the islands.

The Ministry of Health and Environment yesterday reported that there
were 282 confirmed cases of dengue fever and 1770 suspected cases,
noting that this was a significant increase over the past week [week
of 14 Oct 2007].

The ministry also noted that there were 11 suspected cases of the
deadly dengue haemorrhagic fever.

Meanwhile, Dr. Sheila Campbell-Forrester, chief medical officer of
health said she was concerned that householders are not taking
prevention methods seriously.

"The most effective way to stop dengue is through the action of
householders ridding their surroundings of mosquito breeding sites,"
said Dr. Campbell-Forrester.

She noted that unless people clean up around the home and yard, there
will be a difficulty in reducing the cases of dengue fever.

Dr. Campbell-Forrester said persistent rains have also interrupted
control measures and produced more breeding sites for mosquitoes.

There were 255 cases of dengue fever recorded in Barbados up to the
end of September [2007] but no related deaths, says Chief Medical
Officer Dr. Joy St. John.

And she is urging continued vigilance, as there are 592 suspected
cases of the viral illness. However, she also said there were no
reported cases of the potentially deadly dengue haemorrhagic fever.

Speaking to the media yesterday morning [17 Oct 2007] after the
official opening ceremony of the National Blood Bank at Jemmotts
Lane, St. Michael, St. John urged householders and businesses to
ensure their surroundings were free from "mosquito breeding sources."

The health professional explained that the Ministry of Health and
private sector partners were doing their utmost to decrease the
mosquito population.

St. John said the updates on clinical management had been circulated
to doctors and the medics were cooperating with the Ministry of
Health by following the guidelines and informing of suspected cases.

She also said that while people did not like the fogging, it was
"very effective" in stopping "the transmission of the dengue virus
from an infected person to someone who does not have it."

[Fogging provides short-term reduction of transmission by killing
adult mosquitoes. Long-term vector reduction requires elimination of
larval breeding sites, so that new adult mosquitoes are not produced.

Dengue fever has left 6 people dead in Mexico so far this year, with
some 22 943 Mexicans infected with the disease, local media reported
on Saturday [20 Oct 2007].

Among the patients, some 5000 were infected with the fatal
hemorrhagic variant, Secretary of Health Jose Angel Cordoba
Villalobos was quoted as saying. With a booming tourism, the epidemic
has spread to more places in Mexico, he said.

In 2000, only one case of hemorrhagic variant was found in every 50
dengue cases, but this year [2007] the ratio has jumped to nearly one
in 5, he noted. In Mexico the existing 4 dengue virus [infections]
may develop into the hemorrhagic variant, but luckily the mortality
caused by the virus is still low, he added.

Dengue fever, a viral infection spread by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, is a serious health problem in many Central American and
Caribbean countries. Its symptoms include high fever, nausea, rash,
backache and headache. Most mainstream dengue cases are not fatal,
but the hemorrhagic variant, which causes severe internal bleeding as
blood vessels collapse, kills one in 20 of the infected.

The World Health Organization said the only way to fight dengue is to
stamp out [vector] mosquitoes.

The number of deaths in Honduras caused by DHF so far in 2007
increased to 13, the Secretary of Public Health announced
today [10 Oct 2007].

The official report did not provide specific details about the 13th
fatal DHF victim. At least 1230 cases of the DHF type [of dengue
infection] have been registered up to now. Health authorities have
registered 24 207 cases of classic dengue [fever].

The report added that the region of the Central District, which
includes Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, has had the greatest
incidence of fatal [dengue], followed by the departments [state or
province equivalents. - Mod.TY] of Cortez, in the north along the
Guatemalan border, El Paraiso y Olancho, both in the eastern part of
the country, along the Nicaraguan border.

In 2006, the number of DHF deaths was 6.

Dengue epidemic hits 127 Sao Paulo [state] cities
---------------------------------------------
One in every 5 municipalities in Sao Paulo [state] is facing a dengue
epidemic a little more than 2 months after the beginning of summer, a
season when this disease usually become worse. There have been 16
deaths this year [2007] in the state. Of the 645 Sao Paulo cities,
127 have registered in this year [2007] at least 300 cases per 100
000 inhabitants, a level used by the Ministry of Health as the
criterion for characterization as an epidemic. The calculations were
based on the dengue disease registers of the Sao Paulo Center for
Epidemiologic Surveillance and population data of IBGE.

In the entire state, the situation has not been characterized as
epidemic. With 65 860 cases among 41 million inhabitants, the index
is 161 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

During the start of the national campaign against dengue on Wednesday
[16 Oct 2007], the Minister of Health Jose Gomes Temporao affirmed
that the country "is living [through] a dengue epidemic," despite the
fact that the index [of cases per 100 000] is less than the criterion
[number] for it. In Brazil, there have been 481 316 people infected
[with dengue virus] in a population of 190 million inhabitants, or
253 [dengue] victims per 100 000 inhabitants.

He recalled that the number of cases of the disease increased 49.77
percent from January to September [2007], in relation to the same
period in 2006. In Sao Paulo the current number now is 24 percent
above that of all last year [2006] and 12 times more than in 2005,
when there were 5400 [dengue] cases.

Small cities are in a worse situation in Sao Paulo state. Sales is
the leader [in numbers of dengue cases] where 1 in 20 people had
dengue this year [2007].

The city of Sao Paulo, with 2339 [dengue] cases, is still considered
under control, but other medium-sized cities such as Sao Jose do Rio
Preto, Campinas, Ribeirao Preto and Bauru are facing epidemics.

During the cold season, when the mosquito vector has difficulty in
reproducing and the numbers of [dengue] cases normally diminish, the
numbers of cases registered by CVE did not stop. There were 400 in
July, 79 in August and 25 in September [2007].

None the less, Affonso Viviani Junior, director of SUCEN
(Superintendency of Endemic Control) of the Secretariat of Health of
the state, stated that the number of 127 cities with a [dengue]
epidemic index does not reflect the reality of the disease at this
moment. "This number appears [high] because the case index is
cumulative. Cases from the first epidemiological week are in this
[case] total. The behavior of the virus in recent weeks is outside of
any epidemic situation," he said.

According to Viviani, the circulation of the virus continues in a
maximum of 20 municipalities. "Up until mid-year [2007] we had
registered almost 65 000 cases. The other weeks since then until now
do not exceed 1000."

The Governor [of Sao Paulo state], Jose Serra, and the Secretary of
Health, Luiz Roberto Barradas Barata, yesterday [18 Oct 2007] said
that the state was having a [dengue] epidemic. Barradas repeated that
the percent increase of dengue in the state in relation to last year
[2006] is less than the peak of the national index.

Despite that the situation is not considered alarming, the costs to
the state for dengue in 2007 is R 40 million [22 309 000 USD. -
Mod.TY], double that of last year [2006]. The state also contracted
120 field agents for mosquito control.

Some 55,467 cases of dengue have been registered in Brazil's Rio de
Janeiro state since January [2007], more than in the 4 years prior
put together, according to statistics reported on Thursday [18 Oct
2007] by Brazil's Health Ministry.

The most affected municipality is Rio de Janeiro with 20 378 cases.
"We clearly face an epidemic in the state. There has been a 50
percent growth in the number of cases in 2006, just like the rest of
the country," epidemiologist Edmilson Migowsky said.

The situation could get worse, Migowsky said, because only 1/3 of the
people affected presented defined symptoms and normally only 10
percent of the cases are officially reported.

So far, 18 people have already died [of dengue virus infection] in
Rio de Janeiro state.

Dengue increases and the Minister admits that there is an epidemic in
the country
---------------------------------------------------
Brazil is experiencing a dengue epidemic. The number of [dengue]
cases reached 481 300 between January and September [2007],
practically 50 percent more than in the same period in 2006.

The Minister of Health, Jose Gomez Temporao, issued an alert
yesterday [16 Oct 2007], classifying the situation as "unjustifiable"
and "unacceptable" during the initiation of a national mobilization
campaign against the disease. Temporao also referred to the 121
deaths registered in the first 9 months of this year [2007], which is
less than the 150 deaths confirmed in 2002, the worst year for this
disease in the country.

According to Temporao, this high [death] index represents a
deficiency in [medical] attention for DHF [cases]. According to
Health Ministry data, there were 481 300 cases registered for the
country. During the same period last year [2006] there were 321 300 cases.

The Minister indicated that of this total this year [2007], 1067
persons contracted DHF, principally in the state of Mato Grosso do
Sul, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Parana and Maranhao. In comparison
with the number of registered cases in 2006, the southern region had
the greatest increase in the [case] curve (828 [additional cases], 16
percent [increase]), followed by the east-central [region] (99, 95
percent increase), northern [region] (31 cases, 34 percent),
northeaster [region] (30 cases, 43 percent) and southeastern [region]
(19 cases, 81 percent).

In the recent [situation], the increase in [dengue] cases was boosted
by Rio (75 cases, 64 percent) and by Sao Paulo (20 cases, 75
percent), for a total of 64 310 [cases] notified up to September,
versus 53 259 [notified cases] in the same period last year [2006].
Minas and Espirito Santo presented negative results [compared to
2006], -5 [fewer cases], 22 percent [decline] and -27,92 percent, respectively.

"This is an epidemic. And this epidemic is worrisome," said Temporao,
citing the difficulty of combating _Aedes aegypti_, vector of the
disease [virus], and the variety of virus serotypes which "put
obstacles" in the way of vaccine development.

"Unhappily, this vaccine is not on the nearby horizon," indicated the Minister.
