Suspicion of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Botswana
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 15 Aug 2005 from Dr. Musa Fanikiso, Director of
Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:
Report date: 15 Aug 2005.
FMD is suspected in the Pandamatenga crush in Kasane district in the
northwest region of Botswana. Departmental teams conducting routine annual
FMD vaccination and surveillance in the area detected the disease. Only
cattle, especially adult cattle, are showing clinical signs. Currently,
there are 29 cases in 7 kraals (holdings), and the population at risk is
1300 cattle (800 in communal and 500 in fenced farm areas). The suspected
outbreak is in an FMD-controlled area; therefore, the occurrence of an
outbreak in this area should not affect the FMD status and beef trade of
Botswana.
Samples have been sent to Botswana Vaccine Institute for confirmation.
Control measures:
- Animals showing clinical signs are separated from the rest of the herd
and put into a quarantine facility.
- Bio-security measures have been put into place in strategic areas.
- Departmental staff reinforced by members of the Botswana Police and
Defense Force have blockaded the area.
Laboratory confirmation and virus characterization are awaited to further
guide the control strategy.
... Further details will be published in the next issue of weekly Disease
Information, available on line as of Fri 19 Aug 2005 afternoon (GMT).
