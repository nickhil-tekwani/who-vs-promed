[The detection of FMDV serotype A in Jordan is a cause for concern.
While FMDV serotype O is regarded to be endemic in the region, Jordan
has not experienced an FMDV-A outbreak since 1978. Israel, Jordan's
immediate neighbour, experienced its last FMDV-A outbreak in 1981.
Though, in some countries in the region, bovines are vaccinated with
trivalent vaccines (O, A, Asia1), small ruminants, in case included
in the vaccination scheme (eg in Israel), are vaccinated with a
monovalent, FMDV-O vaccine only.
The source of infection, as indicated in the official notification,
is "Legal movement of animals". Any details will be helpful: movement
from where? etc.
A major FMD serotype A outbreak has been reported from Egypt in
February 2006, spreading to 9 of Egypt's governorates (Alexandria,
Behera, Cairo, Dakahlia, Dumyat, Fayum, Ismailia, Kalubia and
Menofia; map at <http://www.asiatravel.com/egypt/gifs/map.gif>.
Samples were tested by the FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright; the isolates, strains and
, were found to belong to serotype A.
Pirbright lab's quarterly report, April-June 2006, included the
following commentary: "FMDV type A that was reported for the first
time in Egypt in February 2006 has affected a large number of cattle
before locally produced homologous vaccine could be produced. Based
on serological vaccine matching tests, none of the existing vaccines
stored as antigens in the EU and UK vaccine bank look suitable to
protect against this strain, but the Merial vaccine A Eritrea 98
appears to be suitable".
The massive, rapid spread of the disease, seen in Egypt, may be
explained by the susceptibility of the exposed local ruminants, which
had been vaccinated only against FMD serotype O.
The genotyping of the Jordanian FMD A virus, and its relationship to
the mentioned Egyptian strain as well as to the new-lineage serotype
A strain identified since 2005 in Iran, Saudia and Turkey and to
available vaccine strains, is urgently required.
Last but not least: has the outbreak in Amman, which reportedly
started on 15 Oct 2006 and confirmed 19 Dec 2006, remained solitary?
Has there been any spread? - Mods.AS/PC]
