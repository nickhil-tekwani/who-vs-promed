The number of cases of Lyme disease in pets has increased by 560 percent since 2009, new data suggests, with warmer winters thought to be to blame for a surge in the tick-borne infection.

The figures, from vets charity PDSA [The People's Dispensary for Sick Animals], suggest the disease is becoming increasingly common in animals as well as in humans. The charity said it had seen 99 cases of suspected or confirmed Lyme disease last year at its 51 hospitals alone -- almost 7 times the number seen in 2009, when it recorded just 15 cases.

The vast majority of the cases were in dogs, though the disease can also affect cats. The PDSA said the figures were likely to be just the "tip of the iceberg" with thousands more cases likely to be treated by other veterinarians, or going undiagnosed. The figures mirror the surge seen in human cases, with NHS [National Health Service] data showing a quadrupling in the number of diagnosed cases in the 12 years to 2013. The NHS has said the rise in cases of Lyme disease is thought to be "driven by climate change, leading to warmer winters".

Vicki Larkham-Jones, a PDSA vet, said the increase in cases it had seen was "incredibly worrying". "Lyme disease can be a very serious, debilitating condition that can cause long-term problems if left untreated," she said. "Caught early, the disease can usually be effectively treated with long-term antibiotics. However, owners may not even be aware that their animal has been bitten by a tick, so they need to be vigilant."

Lyme disease is caused by ticks, tiny parasites found in long grass or woodland that feed on blood. It is thought that their numbers may be increasing as climate change brings warmer winters.

The PDSA said symptoms in pets could be similar to those in humans and included "fever, pain and swelling in the joints, crippling arthritis, nerve damage and even meningitis". Symptoms typically take at least 2 months to materialise, it added, but can be successfully treated with antibiotics. However, the majority of tick bites do not cause the disease, the charity added. "We treated 2545 pets for tick related issues, including bites or removal in 2015 and only around 100 of these cases were suspected or confirmed cases of Lyme disease," Ms Larkham-Jones said. "Now is the time for vigilance, as the UK's tick population peaks between late spring and autumn."

Although there is no evidence of Lyme disease being transmitted directly from person to person or from pets to humans, an infected tick could potentially move from a pet to a human and infect them, the PDSA said. It is estimated that there are about 2000 to 3000 new cases of Lyme disease in humans each year in the UK.

The disease can often be treated effectively if detected early, but if left untreated can cause severe chronic symptoms. A number of celebrities who suffer from the disease, including Phones4U founder, John Caudwell, have gone public with their illness in recent years, raising awareness of its potentially debilitating effects.

As well as climate change and warmer winters, other factors thought to increase the prevalence of Lyme disease include growing numbers of housing developments in rural areas.

Q&A: Lyme disease in pets
-------------------------

Q. What is Lyme disease?

A. A bacterial infection, [also called] Lyme borreliosis, which is spread to humans and animals by infected ticks.

Q. How can I protect my pets?

A. The PDSA advises avoiding letting dogs wander in long grasses in areas where Lyme disease is known to be a problem, and checking them for ticks when they come back from walks. Ticks are most commonly found on pets' heads, ears, legs and underside. Ticks should be removed properly as soon as possible as the risk of Lyme disease increases the longer the tick remains.

Q. How do I remove a tick?

A. Special tick tweezers are advised as otherwise the mouth of the tick can remain in the skin, causing an infection. Do not crush or squeeze the tick's body.

Q. What are the symptoms [in humans]?

A. Lyme disease can cause a rash, a raised temperature, lack of energy, lameness, due to joint inflammation, and swollen lymph nodes.

Q. Can I catch it from my pet?

A. Not directly. Lyme disease is spread by infected ticks, not from pet to person. However, an infected tick could potentially crawl from an animal to a person in contact with them.

[Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is spread by ticks. It affects a variety of species, including dogs, cats, and people. Up to 95 percent of dogs infected with _B. burgdorferi_ do not develop clinical signs (people are much more likely to become ill with Lyme disease). The disease/pathogen are not listed by the OIE.

[The following has been mostly extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - UK: Borrelia positive ticks 20120128.1024838:

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. The major genospecies causing disease in humans are _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu stricto, _Borrelia garnii_ and _Borrelia afzelii_. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.

The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the predominant pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is much less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the two major European pathogenic genospecies. All these genospecies are present in the United Kingdom (U.K.), but _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of the U.K. (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565).

The different pathogenic genospecies can cause variations in manifestations of Lyme disease. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is particularly associated with arthritic and neurological complications, _B. garinii_ with neurological presentations and _B. afzelii_ with the uncommon late skin manifestation, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and an associated peripheral neuropathy.

In Europe, _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries, the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; For the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/).

Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition, 2) improved reporting, as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to: more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with enlarging populations of deer (which, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal); enlarging populations of the reservoirs for Lyme disease; increasing frequency of spirochete-infected nymphal _Ixodes_; and climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick, reservoir hosts, and deer populations.

Lyme disease is endemic in many parts of the U.K., particularly in woodland and heath-land areas, and occasional cases are acquired in peri-urban parks and recreational areas with suitable habitat. In the U.K., the mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases have risen from 0.06 per 100,000 total population for the period 1986 to 1992, to 0.64 cases per 100 000 total population in 2002, to 1.1 cases per 100 000 total population in 2005 (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565). - Mod.ML
