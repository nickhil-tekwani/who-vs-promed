Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On [9 Apr 2014], the Ministries of Health of Jordan notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is a 52 year old man with underlying medical conditions. He visited Saudi Arabia from 20 to 29 Mar [2014]. He became ill on 25 Mar [2014] and visited a hospital in Jeddah. He returned to Jordan on 29 Mar [2014] and visited a hospital in Amman on the same day and on 2 Apr [2014]. He is currently in a stable condition.

The concerned authorities in Jordan are in contact with the concerned authorities in Saudi Arabia to follow up on all close contacts of the case.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 212 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 88 deaths.

[Information on the clinical illness precipitating the visit to a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on 25 Mar 2014 would be helpful in deciding whether that (the Jeddah hospital visit) might have been the locale of MERS-CoV transmission to the case newly reported by Jordan or if the clinical presentation of the case on 25 Mar 2014 was consistent with MERS-CoV infection, and the transmission could have occurred in Jordan. It is easy to presume that individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities seek medical assistance for their pre-existing conditions, and then once in the healthcare environment are exposed to individuals who are MERS-CoV infected where transmission may occur.

[2] UAE, Al Ain, 6 new cases, 1 death - media report

One expatriate health worker has died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and 5 others have been infected with the disease in the United Arab Emirates, state news agency WAM reported on Friday [11 Apr 2014]. The cases follow Saudi Arabian reports this week [week ending 11 Apr 2014] that 2 deaths and 9 other cases of infection had been reported there, including among hospital staff. WAM said the 6 were all 1st aid service personnel from the Philippines working with the UAE Interior Ministry in the city of al-Ain [in the emirate of Abu Dhabi].

The ministry said in a statement that the cases were discovered during periodic medical examinations. "All necessary health and preventive measures have been taken, putting them in health isolation, and the ministry has been in contact with all the people who had been treated (by the health workers) recently to check on them as a precautionary measure," WAM quoted a ministry statement as saying.

Gulf Arab states rely heavily on expatriates who work in almost every sector in the oil-rich countries.

Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia reported that 2 people had died in the Red Sea city of Jeddah after contracting the disease. State news agency SPA quoted the Jeddah health authority as saying that 6 others have recovered while 3 more are undergoing treatment.

At one point the emergency department of King Fahd hospital in Jeddah was closed for disinfection after one health worker there tested positive for the virus and subsequent tests on other staff members showed further infections. That led to fears of an epidemic, but Saudi health minister Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz al-Rabeeah said the number of cases in Jeddah was in line with cases that had appeared in other parts of the kingdom. "The rate of incidence is still low, and doesn't represent an epidemic," Rabeeah said in a statement on the ministry's website on Thursday [10 Apr 2014], citing the criteria of the World Health Organization and other bodies.

The MERS virus emerged in the Middle East in 2012 and is from the same family as the SARS virus. It can cause coughing, fever and pneumonia. Although the worldwide number of MERS infections is fairly small, the death rate of more than 40 per cent among confirmed cases and the spread of the virus beyond the Middle East is keeping scientists and public health officials on alert. Cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Tunisia as well as in several countries in Europe, and scientists are increasingly focused on a link between human infections and camels as a possible "animal reservoir" of the virus.

[According to an Emirates media report, there is mention that the 6 health care workers were paramedics working for the Al Ain Rescue and Ambulance Section (http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-health-worker-who-contracted-mers-virus-dies-5-infected-2014-04-11-1.545211), raising the question whether this individual (or these individuals) had transported a known (or undiagnosed) case of MERS-CoV to a hospital in Al Ain.

Al Ain is located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi near the border with Oman. For a map of the UAE showing the location of Al Ain, see http://www.mapsofworld.com/united-arab-emirates/maps/uae-map.gif.

Registration of 3 new cases of MERS-CoV in Jeddah
-------------------------------------------------
In the context of the work of epidemiological investigation and ongoing follow-up carried out by the Ministry of Health for the MERS-CoV, the Ministry announces the registration of 3 new cases of MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah:

- the 1st resident, a 45 year old male, has passed away;

- the 2nd resident, a 28 year old health care worker, has no symptoms;

- the 3rd citizen, a 25 year old health care worker, had no symptoms.

[The 3 newly reported cases in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia appear to involve 2 expatriates and 1 Saudi citizen. (Prior reports have used the term "resident" for an expatriate living and working in Saudi Arabia, and "citizen" to refer to Saudi citizens.)

As stated in the WHO update from today (11 Apr 2014), the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by WHO is 212 cases including 88 deaths. As this tally does not include the 6 cases in the UAE (including one death) mentioned in the media report in [2] above, the 3 newly reported cases from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia reported by the Saudi MOH on their website in [3] above, nor does it include all of the other cases referred to on the Saudi MOH website in recent days (see prior ProMED-mail posts for reports), these numbers will definitely be increasing in the coming days. - Mod.MPP]
