A case of rabies has been confirmed in Hickory Township.

Dr. Erin Moore, a veterinarian with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture in Greensbsurg, said 2 humans and a dog were exposed last month [February 2016] to a raccoon that tested positive for rabies. The raccoon's diagnosis was confirmed by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Veterinary Laboratory in Harrisburg.

The humans, she said, will receive preventative rabies treatment. The dog, overdue for a rabies vaccine, received a booster and will be quarantined for 180 days at the owners' Harlansburg Road home.

Moore said the dog was let out by its owners the night of 12 Jan 2016. While outside, the owners heard a commotion and saw the dog fighting with a raccoon.

"I want people to be aware that a rabid raccoon has been identified in the area," she said. "I don't want to frighten people, but they should be aware a case of rabies has been confirmed. They should not approach wild animals, and should ensure their pets' rabies vaccines are current. This is important if their pets go outside and might encounter wild animals."

Under Pennsylvania law, all dogs and non-feral cats aged 3 months and older are to be vaccinated against rabies. Booster vaccinations should be administered periodically to maintain lifelong immunity. Failure to comply with this law may result in a fine of up to USD 300.

For the 2nd time since September 2015, an individual has been bitten by a feral cat that later tested positive for rabies in the Quicks Bend area of Wilmot Township along Dietz Road.

The PA Department of Agriculture (PDA) issued a press release today, 25 Feb 2016, stating that an individual was petting a feral cat at that location and was bitten. According to PDA Communications Specialist Will Nichols, the incident occurred on 19 Fri Feb 2016.

The cat was later submitted to the PA Veterinary Laboratory in Harrisburg where it tested positive for rabies. The person, unidentified by the PDA, received post exposure rabies prophylaxis.

Nichols said it is unknown whether other feral cats or wild animals in the area were exposed to the infected animal. Residents are urged to avoid contact with all wild animals, especially cats.

"Folks need to be vigilant of feral cats and wild animals that are acting strangely," said Nichols. "The goal of these alerts is to let people know rabies cases have been found in their area and that others in the feral cat population could be infected."

On 9 Sep 2015, a Wilmot Township woman and her daughter were also bitten by a rabid feral cat along Dietz Road [This seems like an old incident to bring up, but I supposed it goes to location. - Mod.TG].

The feral cat ran under a pickup truck parked nearby, and when the woman attempted to shoo it away, it attacked her. The cat then attacked the woman's daughter, who had come to the mother's aid, and bit her [the daughter] as well, but the daughter managed to punch the cat and knock it unconscious. A few minutes later the woman's husband came home and killed the cat. It was later taken to a lab for testing, where it was discovered the cat was rabid.

"People bitten by an animal should seek immediate medical attention and try to have that animal checked for rabies," said Nichols. "Rabies is actually transmitted through the saliva, so it doesn't necessarily have to be a bite."

Nichols said the investigating field team did not establish a connection between the 2 incidents.

State law requires all dogs and non-feral cats 3 months of age and older to be vaccinated against rabies. Booster vaccinations must be administered periodically to maintain lifelong immunity. Failure to comply with the law may result in a fine of up to USD 300.

If you live in Citrus Park and your cat is missing, you might want to check with the county. Hillsborough County's Pet Resources recently trapped and euthanized 5 strays in the area after a rabid cat attacked and killed 2 other cats, then attacked a man in Citrus Park on Saturday [13 Feb 2016?].

The county euthanized the stray cats in order to find out whether rabies had spread to other animals.

Rabies notifications went out earlier this week to schools, businesses and homes near the intersection of Ehrlich and Del Valle roads in Citrus Park after the stray cat that attacked tested positive for rabies.

"When animals have ferocious rabies, they pretty well attack anything that moves," said Brian Miller, an Environmental Administrator with Florida's Department of Health in Hillsborough County. [Generally rabies is divided into 2 categories: furious and dumb. Ferocious rabies is not a rabies category, however descriptive it may be. Generally, furious rabies is where the animal is furious or ferocious, attacking frequently, and the manner of the animal may be quite unlike the normal personality of the animal. - Mod.TG]

As for the euthanized cats, the state and county are waiting for results to see whether rabies has spread.

According to the county, this is the same area where, a couple of years ago, they had problems with rabid raccoons.

On Wednesday [2 Feb 2016] morning, a woman was running at Riverbend Park when she was bitten by a fox. She is undergoing preventative treatment for rabies. The park has temporarily closed the trail. On Thursday morning, a woman was checking on her chickens at a home near Riverbend Park when she was confronted and bitten by a fox.

They were 2 of the 3 potential rabies cases in the last 48 hours, according to Fairfax County Animal Control. A Clinton man is being treated after he was bitten by a raccoon.

It's unknown whether the fox or foxes are rabid. But, aggressive tendencies are one of the signs of rabies, animal control notes.

Residents should keep their dogs on a leash when walking in public areas.

If bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention right away. In Fairfax County, residents should also immediately report animal bites, as well as sick or injured animals, to Animal Control Services at 703-691-2131.

More information on the rabies virus, exposure prevention tips, and what to do if an animal bites, is available at <fairfaxcounty.gov/hd/rabies.

A fox that Charlottesville police caught after it bit someone last week was found to be infected with rabies, police said Tuesday [22 Mar 2016]. Police said they have informed the victim of the test result.

This was the 3rd aggressive fox sighting in Charlottesville during March 2016.

On 7 Mar 2016, police said a "suspicious fox" was seen in the downtown area, where it reportedly bit 2 different people. That fox has not yet been caught.

Then, on 14 Mar 2016, a 2nd fox was caught and put down by police after it acted aggressively toward officers. That fox also was sent to the health department, but it tested negative for rabies.

A sick fox that attacked 2 Leicester residents last week had rabies.

Police in the central Massachusetts town are now urging residents to get their pets vaccinated and have even scheduled a rabies clinic on 2 Apr 2016.

They also warned that the rabid fox could have infected other animals.

Police say the fox attacked 2 people in the same neighborhood within about a 20-minute period on 10 Mar 2016. The next day, what was believed to be the same fox was killed by police when it was spotted near a school.

It was sent to the state lab for testing, and police on Thursday [17 Mar 2016] confirmed the positive rabies test.

http://www.northjersey.com/news/four-saddle-river-residents-advised-to-get-treatment-after-stray-cat-found-to-have-rabies-1.1532985


Four Saddle River residents were advised to begin treatment for rabies after a stray cat that they had been exposed to was found to have the potentially deadly disease, authorities said Thursday [24 Mar 2016]. [Rabies is a deadly disease for humans without treatment. Rabies is deadly to animals. The word potentially is misleading. - Mod.TG]

Saddle River Police Capt. Jason Cosgriff said in a statement that the New Jersey Department of Health confirmed Wednesday [23 Mar 2016] the cat had tested positive for rabies, and 4 people had been identified as having had contact with the animal before its death. The cat did not have a current rabies vaccination, Cosgriff said.

Police said further information was not immediately available about the nature of the contacts the 4 people had with the cat or the manner in which the cat died, nor was any information provided concerning when and where in Saddle River the contacts had occurred.

Cosgriff cautioned residents to be certain that all pets are vaccinated for rabies annually but noted that animals are not considered immunized until 28 days after receiving the vaccine for the 1st time. Newly vaccinated animals and animals that can't be vaccinated because they are less than 3 months old should not be allowed outdoors alone, he said.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the initial symptoms of rabies in human beings can include fever, headache and general weakness or discomfort.

But as the disease progresses, signs in animals [sic; he means humans] may include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, increased salivation, difficulty swallowing and fear of water. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of these symptoms, according to the CDC.

[Very few of these articles mention the need to have your pets vaccinated as a protective layer between yourself and rabies infected animals. Protection of your pet also saves the heartache of having your own pet euthanized when exposed to a rabid animal.

There are 2 forms of rabies: furious and paralytic (sometimes referred to as dumb). The signs described herein are characteristic of the different forms, but an individual rabid animal would not necessarily show all the clinical signs.

Furious rabies
- The animal displays signs of extreme restlessness and aggression.
- It attacks objects, other animals, and even its own limbs.
- Fits of furious rabies generally alternate with periods of withdrawal.

Paralytic (dumb) rabies
- The animal may become withdrawn and seek seclusion.
- It may no longer be afraid of humans.
- A generally nocturnal animal may become active during the day.
- Signs of paralysis: Head and neck paralysis may result in an abnormal facial expression, excessive salivation, slackness of the head and jaw, and making strange sounds. Body paralysis normally begins with the hind legs and spreads to the rest of the body.

Species-specific signs
The signs described above are common to all species. Nevertheless, more specific signs can be observed in certain species of domestic animals infected with the rabies virus.

Cattle rarely develop furious rabies but, when they do, they may attack humans. A characteristic sign of rabies in cattle is abnormal bellowing, which may be continuous or intermittent, and lasts until the animal dies. In dairy cows infected with rabies, milk production will drop off suddenly. The bellowing is very distinctive -- for lack of a better descriptive term -- something from a horror movie.

Horses may show signs of distress and agitation. These signs, accompanied by rolling, give the appearance of colic. Rabid horses can be prone to aggression and self-mutilation. Rabid horses have attacked people.

Rabid pigs display rapid chewing, lack of coordination, and repetitive headshaking.

Sheep infected with the rabies virus have a hoarse bleat, tend to lick objects, and become aggressive.

There are no treatments for wild or domestic animals exposed to the rabies virus. Death generally occurs within 10 days of the onset of clinical signs.
