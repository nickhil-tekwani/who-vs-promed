Indonesia has recorded its 42nd human bird flu death, bringing the country
level with Vietnam as the worst affected by the disease. Tests by the World
Health Organization showed that a 44-year-old man who died last week had the
H5N1 virus, Health Ministry officials said.
Indonesia has registered more bird flu deaths so far in 2006 than any other
nation. In contrast, the outbreak in Vietnam now seems to be under control,
due to a large culling and [poultry] vaccination drive. No Vietnamese deaths
have been recorded in 2006. [See Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of
Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_07_20/
en/index.html>
Indonesia has been criticised for its reluctance to cull fowl in infected
areas -- a measure that experts say is the best way to stem the spread of the
disease. But the government says it does not have enough money to compensate
farmers, and has asked for USD 900 million (GBP 495 million) over the next 3
years to tackle the virus.
Indonesia's problems were highlighted in May [2006] when the country recorded
a cluster of [7] deaths which the WHO believes were the result of human-to-
human transmission. Experts say this particular incident did not signal a
major change in the spread of the disease. But there is a fear that the bird
flu virus could mutate to a form which could be easily passed from human to
human, triggering a pandemic and potentially putting millions of lives at risk.
Globally, more than 130 [currently 133] people have died of bird flu since
late 2003. Most of the deaths have been in East Asia, but the virus has also
spread to Europe, Africa and South and Central Asia.

[Indonesia has drawn level now with Viet Nam in terms of number of human
deaths attributable to H5N1 avian influenza virus infection since the
commencement of the outbreak in East Asia in 2003. And with the containment of
poultry disease in Viet Nam, it is likely that soon the absolute number of
human deaths in Indonesia will exceed those recorded in Viet Nam. However, in
relation to population size, human deaths in Viet Nam have been approximately
3 times more frequent than observed so far in Indonesia. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 23
---------------------------------------------
As of Thu 20 Jul 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the
country's 54th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 44-year-old man from East Jakarta,
Jakarta Province. He developed symptoms on 24 Jun 2006, was hospitalized on 10
Jul 2006, and died on 12 Jul 2006.
The case may have acquired the infection from poultry around his home and
animal health authorities have taken samples for testing. Another potential
source of infection was a local wet market, which he regularly visited during
the course of his work as the owner of a food stall.
Of the 54 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 42 have been fatal.
[This is a crude case fatality rate (CFR) of 78 percent, compared to
93 cases with 42 deaths in Viet Nam, a crude CFR of 45
percent. However, we do not know the true denominators, which should
include unreported mild and even asymptomatic
cases, which would lower those crude CFRs. - Mod.JW]
