Health authorities in Burkina Faso have launched a mass vaccination
campaign in the capital, Ouagadougou, to combat a rapidly spreading
meningitis epidemic that has claimed more than 800 lives.
"Ouagadougou has been hit to an extent that we did not expect," said
Jean Gabriel Wango, secretary general of the country's health ministry.
Authorities are dispatching 2 health agents to each of the city's 620
vaccination sites. The vaccinations, which are free of charge, were
to begin on Mon 19 Mar 2007, but officials said a shortage of health
workers prompted a delay by a day. Authorities sought additional
health workers from the medical school in Ouagadougou.
Health Minister Alain Yoda said it was necessary to take "robust and
rapid measures" in the capital to help stem the spread of meningitis
throughout the city and the rest of the country.
Since January 2007 at least 801 people have died of meningitis in
Burkina Faso among 10 796 who have been infected, according to the
Health Ministry. Of the nation's 55 health districts, 26 are
experiencing an epidemic and 11 others are on alert.
The Burkinabe health ministry said last week it had taken measures to
prevent possible theft of the meningitis vaccines. Every dose is
tagged with a number and the ministry has asked all health districts
to return the empty tubes to track their use.
Health authorities said they are investigating why in 2006, 6
districts with epidemics that benefited from a vaccination campaign
have had a resurgence of the disease in 2007.

[All confirmed cases here have been of serogroup A. From the posting
of the epidemic in Burkina Faso, dated 16 Mar 2007, there were 4958
cases and 432 deaths. The next posting, only 3 days later, reports
7333 cases and 583 deaths. Now, 2 days later, the numbers have risen
to 10 791 cases and 801 deaths.

In Cote d'Ivoire health authorities began a vaccination campaign on
Tuesday [20 Mar 2007] in Boundiali, 800 km. (497 miles) north of the
main city, Abidjan. Since mid-February [2007], 36 cases have been
reported in that region including 6 deaths, according to the United Nations.

Fresno County health officials said Wed 21 Mar 2007, that 3 El
Capitan Middle School students have been hospitalized with
meningococcal meningitis, a rare and contagious bacterial disease.
Health officials said they will provide preventive antibiotics to
students, teachers, and staff at the Central Unified school on West
Weldon Avenue from one to 6 pm today, 22 Mar 2007.
The middle school has about 830 7th and 8th graders, as well as 65
staff, including teachers. Students also will be offered a
meningococcal vaccine that protects against most strains of bacterial
meningitis.
Of the 3 students, one has developed meningococcemia, a potentially
life-threatening infection of the bloodstream, said Dr. Edward
Moreno, health officer for Fresno County. Close contacts of the
infected students received antibiotics earlier this week to prevent
them from becoming infected.
Fresno County has an average of 8 cases of meningococcal meningitis in a year.
Health officials learned of the outbreak after the children developed
symptoms of the disease between 17 and 20 Mar 2007 and were taken to
emergency rooms, where they were hospitalized, Moreno said. "We
visited the school [Tue 20 Mar] when we received reports of the first
2 cases," Moreno said.
On Wed afternoon, 21 Mar 2007, a 3rd child was hospitalized. A 3rd
case of the disease at a single site meets the public health criteria
for an outbreak, he said. Outbreaks of the disease are extremely
rare, Moreno said. "In the 4 years I've been here, we have not had an
outbreak in a school," he said.

[The capsular serogroup of meningococcus in the current cluster is
not stated but is most likely to be B, C, or Y.
The following was extracted from CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention): Prevention and Control of Meningococcal
Disease -- Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP). Morbid Mortal Week Rep 2005;54(RR-7):1-21. [The
citation numbers have been edited to be consecutive]. [available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>]
In the USA, greater than 98 percent of cases of meningococcal disease
are sporadic; however, since 1991, the frequency of localized
outbreaks has increased (1,2). The proportion of meningococcal cases
caused by serogroup Y increased from 2 percent during 1989-1991 (3)
to 37 percent during 1997-2002 (CDC, unpublished data, 2004).
Serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of meningococcal disease
in the USA, each being responsible for approximately one third of the
cases. The proportion of cases caused by each serogroup varies by age
group. Among infants aged less than one year, greater than 50 percent
of cases are caused by serogroup B, for which no vaccine is licensed
or available in the USA (4,5). Of all cases of meningococcal disease
among persons aged greater than 11 years, 75 percent are caused by
serogroups (C, Y, or W-135), which are included in vaccines available
in the USA (CDC, unpublished data, 2004).
Since the early 1990s, outbreaks of meningococcal disease have
occurred with increasing frequency in the USA. During July 1994-June
2002, a total of 76 outbreaks were identified (annual median: 10;
range: 4-16) (2), including 48 (63 percent) outbreaks caused by
serogroup C, 19 (25 percent) by serogroup B, and 9 (12 percent) by
serogroup Y. These outbreaks occurred in 32 states and involved 247
patients (accounting for less than 2 percent of total cases of
meningococcal disease in the USA during this period). Of the 76
outbreaks, 26 (34 percent) were community-based and accounted for 53
percent of all outbreak-related cases. Of the 50 (65 percent)
outbreaks that were organization-based, 13 (26 percent) occurred in
colleges; 19 (38 percent) in primary and secondary schools; and 9 (18
percent) in nursing homes.
The attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have
sporadic meningococcal disease was estimated to be 4 cases/1000
persons exposed, which is 500-800 times greater than the rate for the
total population (6).
Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest
immediately after onset of disease in the index patient,
antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as
possible (ideally less than 24 hours after identification of the
index patient). Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered greater
than 14 days after onset of illness in the index patient is probably
of limited or no value. Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cultures are
not helpful in determining the need for chemoprophylaxis and might
unnecessarily delay institution of this preventive measure.
Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are 90-95 percent effective
in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and are all
acceptable antimicrobial agents for chemoprophylaxis (7-10). Systemic
antimicrobial therapy of meningococcal disease with agents other than
ceftriaxone or other 3rd-generation cephalosporins might not reliably
eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_. If other
agents have been used for treatment, the index patient should receive
chemoprophylactic antibiotics for eradication of nasopharyngeal
carriage before being discharged from the hospital (11).
One recent study has reported that a single 500-mg. oral dose of
azithromycin was effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of
_N. meningitidis_ (12). Azithromycin, in addition to being safe and
easy to administer, is also available in a suspension form and is
approved for use among children. Further evaluation is warranted of
both the effectiveness of azithromycin in eradicating carriage of _N.
meningitidis_ and potential for development of microbial resistance
to this drug if it is widely used for chemoprophylaxis.
