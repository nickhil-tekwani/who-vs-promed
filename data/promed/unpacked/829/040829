World Malaria Report 2019
-------------------------
Overview
The World malaria report 2019 provides a comprehensive update on global and regional malaria data and trends. The report tracks investments in malaria programmes and research as well as progress across all intervention areas: prevention, diagnosis, treatment, elimination, and surveillance. It also includes dedicated chapters on the consequences of malaria on maternal, infant and child health, the "High Burden to High Impact" approach as well as biological threats to the fight against malaria.

The 2019 report is based on information received from more than 80 countries and areas with ongoing malaria transmission. This information is supplemented by data from national household surveys and databases held by other organizations.

Malaria cases are falling worldwide
-----------------------------------
The trend is driven by progress tackling the disease in southeast Asia, but elsewhere infections remain 'unacceptably high.

The number of malaria infections recorded globally has fallen for the 1st time in several years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which published its annual World Malaria Report on 4 Dec 2019.

Rising numbers of cases in 2016 and 2017 sparked fears that progress had stalled in the global fight against the mosquito-borne disease. But the WHO estimates that there were 228 million reported cases in 2018, a decrease of around 3 million from the previous year [2017].

This drop can be attributed in large part to fewer cases in southeast Asia (see 'Malaria in southeast Asia' [at the source URL above]). The WHO found that, in the past decade, the most marked decline has been in 6 countries across the Mekong River basin -- Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

From 2010 to 2018, malaria cases dropped by 76% in these countries, and malaria-related deaths fell by 95%. In 2018, Cambodia reported zero malaria-related deaths for the 1st time in the country's history. India also reported a huge reduction in infections, with 2.6 million fewer cases in 2018 than in 2017.

Researchers warn that data on malaria can be inaccurate in countries with poor surveillance systems. Even if the number of officially reported deaths is zero, this doesn't mean that there are no malaria-related casualties, says Arjen Dondorp, deputy director of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok. However, "malaria cases are definitely going down" in countries such as Cambodia, he adds.

Countries in the Mekong area have made "tremendous progress" in tackling the disease by funding malaria-control programmes and deploying health workers in remote regions to hand out treatments and report new cases, says Abdourahmane Diallo, chief executive of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, an organization in Geneva, Switzerland, that supports efforts to control and eliminate the disease. He adds that progress in driving down infections is also the result of successful strategies to contain drug-resistant strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_, the deadliest malaria-causing parasite, which had been spreading across the region.

In other parts of the world, malaria is on the rise. Countries in Africa, for example, reported an increase of 1 million cases from 2017 to 2018, and the continent accounted for almost 94% of global cases and deaths from the disease in 2018. Fragile health-care systems and a lack of funding and infrastructure threaten to undermine the fight against malaria in many areas, says Diallo.

Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme in Geneva, says that, despite the global drop in 2018, malaria cases have stabilized at "unacceptably high numbers" over the past few years. "But this is not a helpless situation," he says, noting that improved efforts to prevent, detect and treat the disease are allowing several countries to successfully eliminate malaria. The report says that Algeria and Argentina were both certified malaria-free in 2019.

Progress in malaria prevention questioned by health experts. Call for inquiry into pace of improvement amid statistical inconsistencies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leading malaria experts have questioned official data showing progress in tackling the disease and called for independent scrutiny of the slow-moving efforts by governments and international organisations to respond.

The latest World Malaria Report, published this week by the World Health Organization, found that estimated infections had fallen from 286 million in 2000 to 228 million last year [2018], suggesting good progress in reducing the parasite's heavy burden on human health and economic development.

It concluded that malaria deaths were down 31% between 2010 and 2018 and called for an increase in the current figure of [USD 4 billion] a year that goes towards eradication.

But Nicholas White, professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford and a global expert on malaria, criticised the WHO methodology. He noted how the figures for infections in previous years had been significantly increased from those given in previous editions of the report. In 2011, for instance, the 2000 estimate for infections was 223 million, he pointed out.

"The number of cases reported for 2000 has gone up in every single World Malaria Report," Sir Nicholas told the Financial Times, pointing out that the frequent data adjustments had the effect of increasing the apparent success in lowering infections. "You can't trust the figures [and] something serious is going wrong."

Sir Nicholas, who is also a professor at Mahidol University in Thailand, called for "a no-holds-barred inquiry" into efforts to tackle malaria, which he said could give greater value for money for the governments and institutions who provide funding. "If this was a company, you would sack the board and the chief executive," he said.

His concern was shared by Richard Price, professor at the Menzies School of Health Research in Australia. "What is frustrating is that every year, all previous years' numbers have changed. It is impossible to interpret trends when the methodology and systems change," he said.

Prof Price added that "sometimes people who have a vested interest in the way we are going will not highlight major problems. People who are receiving funds do not want to rock the boat. We should put down milestones and hold people accountable."

However, Abdisalan Noor of the WHO's global malaria programme, defended the organisation's data collection methodology, stressing that efforts had been stepped up to develop more reliable statistics. He pointed out more than 90% of malaria infections occurred in countries in Africa without strong disease-surveillance systems, making the quick collection of reliable data very difficult.

"These are the best possible estimates available at the moment but we are fully aware of the uncertainties, which are fully reported in our reports. The only way out is not to point fingers but to seriously invest in country surveillance systems. The more perfect the data is, the less this controversy arises," Prof Noor said. He added: "A lot of people spend a lot of time criticising when the solution should be in coming together collectively to have reliable data."

Karen Barnes, a clinical pharmacology professor at the University of Cape Town, said the row over data added to concerns that efforts to tackle malaria were stagnating.

"A lot of countries have made promises, missed targets, and set new ones. One of the challenges is how to balance the optimism of what is possible while communicating how incredibly hard it is," she said.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[ProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for alerting us to the article in the Financial Times. As pointed out in the interviews in the Financial Times with Professor Nicholas White and Richard Price, it is important that an authoritative report like the World Malaria Report from the WHO is credible. If the numbers change from year to year a thorough analysis of the implications is needed as well as methods to provide transparency.

The report clearly shows that there is little progress from 2010 (if the numbers are correct).

The total number of estimated cases in 2010 was 251 million, compared to 228 million in 2018, but the confidence intervals of these numbers are grossly overlapping showing there is no statistically significant difference between 2010 and 2018 (CI 2010 231-278 million; CI 2018 206-258 million) (World Malaria Report 2019 table 2.1).

One of the main concerns in malaria is the emergence of resistance to the artemisinins in SE Asia. In the World Malaria Report 2019 areas of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar still have annual incidence rates of more than 50 cases per 100 000 population (Figure 5.4) even though the overall numbers are decreasing, showing where the focus for future re-emergence of malaria will start due to artemisinin resistance. Perhaps the ambitions for SE Asia urgently need to be aiming at eradication. - Mod.EP]
