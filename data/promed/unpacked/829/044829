Urgent diagnostic analysis is being conducted by independent authorities in England to determine the exact health status of about 10 000 Australian sheep now being held under tight supervision in a Pakistani feedlot.

The fate of the Australian sheep will remain in limbo until 17 Oct 2012 while the blood testing and detailed analysis take place in a bid to clear any allegations of disease or health concerns.

Controversy has enveloped the sheep consignment over the past month due to conjecture over the animals' health status and allegations of brutal mistreatment during a hasty culling program.

The original shipment of 21 000 sheep on the Wellard-owned The Ocean Drover was redirected to Pakistan about one month ago, after being anchored off a Bahrain port for at least a fortnight. Bahrain quarantine officials rejected the sheep on quarantine grounds, reportedly due to the presence of scabby mouth disease. But testing on arrival in Pakistan cleared the sheep of any ill-health concerns.

Since arriving in Pakistan, however, the shipment has stirred even greater controversy with reports surfacing that about 7600 sheep were culled due to further disease concerns.

Wellard and the Federal Agriculture Department have released regular updates on the status of the remaining sheep over the past month, confirming they are currently in good condition, have access to feed and fresh water, and display no signs of disease.

The department said the culling was formally suspended on Sat 22 Sep 2012 after the importer successfully applied for a court order to prevent it from continuing.

"Representatives from the exporter, Wellard Rural Exports, continue to conduct regular inspections of the sheep currently being held in Pakistan that have been exported under the new Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS)," the Department said.

Wellard said the sheep would remain in their care, and the importer PK Livestock, while the additional blood testing and international analysis is conducted to confirm their disease-free status.

"The High Court of Sindh in Pakistan has delayed its decision on an application by PK Livestock to overturn a cull order from the Sindh Livestock Department to allow for the further testing and diagnostic analysis," Wellard said. "The case has been adjourned until 17 Oct 2012, though maybe heard sooner depending on timing of receipt of the test results. In the interim, the High Court has ordered that PK Livestock, the owner of the sheep, assisted by Wellard should retain unhindered access to PK Livestock's facilities to care for the sheep."

Pakistani media reports inflamed the issue, saying untrained workers were used to stab and club the sheep to death during the cull, with some also buried alive, while referring to video footage of the cull as evidence. But in other reports, Pakistani officials dismissed the allegations and reports of brutal mistreatment as being untrue.

[2] Court ruling, international lab involvement, update, Pakistani source
Date: Sat 29 Sep 2012

The Sindh High Court on Friday [28 Sep 2012] ordered testing of the imported Australian sheep from an internationally acclaimed laboratory after receiving contradictory reports by the federal and provincial government testing facilities regarding the health of the herd.

A division bench headed by Justice Maqbool Baqar was seized with the petition of the importer, Tariq Mehmood Butt, who had sought a restraining order against the culling of 21 000 sheep by the city municipal administration.

The bench observed that contradictory reports regarding the infection and disease among the sheep were filed by the federal and provincial governments' laboratories. Therefore, the court ruled that fresh testing and evaluation of the sheep be done by some foreign laboratory to resolve the controversy. A former director-general of the livestock department, Ghulam Sarwar Sheikh, informed the court that an internationally acclaimed laboratory, World Reference Laboratory, the UK, would be appropriate to conduct testing, as the Pakistani government had arrangements with the lab for detailed findings of the imported sheep. He said that there was an agreed upon protocol between the government and the laboratory, which could conduct the testing swiftly and smoothly within agreed upon parameters.

The court ordered the already constituted team of veterinary experts, including Prof Rafiq Khanani and Dr Ghulam Sarwar Sheikh, to chalk out modalities so that required samples from drawing blood, oral and nasal swabs and all other permissible means may be obtained instantly, keeping in view the Pakistan Animal Quarantine Rules.

The bench ordered for screening out all possible diseases carried or suffered by the sheep.

The court observed that the foreign laboratory shall, if possible, also express its opinion regarding the probable reasons and causes for the disease or the infection as may be found and again, if possible, the probable time as to when the sheep had no such infection.

The court observed that the laboratory shall also give its findings as to whether the meat of the sheep is safe for human consumption or not. The court observed that representatives of the petitioners may also join the above exercise of decision making, collecting and transportation of samples. The bench rejected the request of the provincial government's counsel, Advocate Anwar Mansoor Khan, for sending the samples earlier drawn for testing.

The court observed that it would not be safe, as said samples were with 2 Sindh government's laboratories and may have been tampered with or replaced. The court also rejected the request of the petitioner for slaughtering healthy sheep and export of meat.

However, the court continued its interim order against culling of sheep, observing that the petitioner shall have full and unhindered access to the sheep but shall be under the supervision of the representatives of the Sindh government as may be designated by the livestock secretary. However, such supervision shall not provide a pretext to the officer to hamper the supply of essentials to the sheep, that is fodder, water and medicines, etc, the court ordered.

The court further ordered that the sheep farm shall be secured from the outside by the local police effectively, so that no sheep may enter the farm or the enclosures or be removed or shifted [to avoid observation, and] that the petitioner may install as many CCTV cameras in the farms [as desired].

The court observed that the cost of the exercise of testing shall initially be borne by the petitioner; however, the question of reimbursement shall be decided after hearing from the parties on such question.

Meanwhile, the court directed the provincial government counsel and other respondents to file their respective counter affidavits separately. The court also directed all other functionaries who appeared in court from time to time to file their separate affidavits on the next date of hearing, which would be later fixed by the court's office.

The petitioner purchased the consignment after it had been refused by an importer in Bahrain. He sought an injunction against the disposal of the sheep, contending that the animals were not infected with any disease. He also prayed to the court to restrain the government functionaries from harassing or arresting him.

The provincial livestock and fisheries department had ordered the culling of the sheep after tests found them infected and unfit for human consumption.

[3] Expert's clinical report, Bahrain, Pakistan
Date: Wed 3 Oct 2012
From: Ulrich Wernery <wernery@cvrl.ae> [edited]


I have personally inspected the 22 000 sheep twice in Bahrain on the ship and in Karachi, Pakistan in a quarantine facility [see item 4]. On both occasions, I did not observe any disease. There was no case of FMD, anthrax or ORF. All sheep were healthy and in good condition.

It is very disturbing that healthy Australian sheep are culled for no obvious reasons in a country where people have often not enough to eat. If there would have been any sheep in an incubation period in Bahrain, I would have definitely recognized any diseased animal in Karachi, but this was not the case.

Why Bahrain refused to accept the shipment is not known to me, but I can clearly state that it was not done due to health reasons of the sheep on the ship.

A Dubai-based veterinarian asked to assess the health status of a large consignment of Australian sheep that Pakistan authorities have ordered to be culled due to disease concerns has given the sheep a clean bill of health, according to a statement released by the exporter Wellard Rural Exports this afternoon [20 Sep 2012].

[A link to the expert's report, which follows, was included in Wellard's media release of 20 Sep 2012; available at http://www.beefcentral.com/u/lib/cms/120920-oie-vet-assessment-final-1.pdf.

Inspection of sheep at PK Livestock & Meat Co. on 19 Sep 2012 at 01:00 P.M.
------------------------------------------
As an independent veterinarian specializing in exotic animal diseases, I was asked by Wellard Rural Exports to inspect sheep from Australia for infectious diseases which arrived in Karachi after being rejected by the Bahrain government.

During the inspection, I personally went into 2 pens which harbored hundreds of sheep, and I also had a look at many animals which had been Halal slaughtered. I especially checked eventual lesions around the lips, nose and eyes, and also between the feet.

My conclusion of the inspection is:
a) The animals were in good shape and exhibited no fever.
b) None of the animals were lame, which would indicate some blisters at the coronary band often seen in FMD.
c) When inspecting dead sheep, no lesions were detected between the toes.

My investigation clearly finds that these sheep do not suffer from any infectious diseases whatsoever and should be professionally slaughtered for meat production without any delay to avoid any suffering, and also to avoid welfare concerns.

It is of paramount importance to stop now the needless and unnecessary culling of healthy animals.

[The precise timetable of the consignment's voyage from Australia to Pakistan is, unfortunately, not available from official sources.

The following unconfirmed information is compiled from press sources and media releases of VALE and Wellard:
- 4 Aug 2012: Departure of MV Ocean Drover from Fremantle with 22 000 sheep exported by Wellard.
- 21 Aug 2012: rejected in Bahrain on the grounds that the sheep had scabby mouth (http://tinyurl.com/8vzlf8x).
- 29 Aug 2012: MV Ocean Drover returns to Bahrain after visiting Kuwait, "where it appears no animals were unloaded"(http://tinyurl.com/8vzlf8x).
- 5 Sep 2012: "unloading of 22 000 sheep from the MV Ocean Drover has commenced," (port of unloading unnamed, most likely Karachi. http://tinyurl.com/8vbmfyd).
(Thanks to Sabine Zentis for the internet search).

Bahrain is one of the world's leading importers of sheep for slaughter; its off-peak consumption is 40 000 to 45 000 sheep per month, doubled during the Ramadan season. It also serves as a main transit country for imported sheep, which continue their way to other countries in the Middle East. In the past, exotic strains of FMD were introduced to Bahrain with consignments imported from Africa, occasionally spreading further. For some data on Bahrain's animal health situation, please refer to the commentary in 20070811.2614.

On 19 Sep 2012, the Australian government issued a media statement "seeking to set the record straight on the health status of a consignment of Australian sheep reported to be on the verge of being culled by Pakistan authorities due to health reasons." The statement, available at http://www.beefcentral.com/news/news-archive/article/2186, included, among others, the following:

"There have been suggestions that some have scabby mouth. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) regards this as a common and minor disease in all sheep across the world, and they do not regard it as needing notification. There is no risk to human health from eating animals with scabby mouth.

In relation to other reported concerns, bacteria such as actinomyces, salmonella and _E. coli_ are part of normal gut flora and are present in livestock throughout the world. They also pose no threat for human consumption.

Some outlets have stated the sheep have foot and mouth disease (FMD). We know that Australia is FMD-free, and the last outbreak of the disease in Australia occurred well over a century ago, in 1872. The Australian government is confident the sheep delivered to Pakistan were healthy on departure from Australia. The welfare and animal health of the sheep was closely monitored by a DAFF-accredited veterinarian on board the vessel, and no major disease issues were reported." (Thanks to Sabine Zentis for forwarding this communication).

The Australian government statement did not mention the consignment's repeated intermissions/stays in Bahrain prior to its rerouting to Pakistan; no information on this matter could be obtained from the Australian government media center.

On top of the 5 pathogens mentioned in the Australian government statement, Pakistani media mentioned also allegations of suspected anthrax in dead sheep of the consignments. According to media, these have not been confirmed.

According to the Dawn report (item 2 of this posting), the court's directed lab investigations of samples from the consignments are carried out by "an internationally acclaimed laboratory, World Reference Laboratory, the UK." This, likely, relates to the WRLFMD, Pirbright. FMD is the only OIE-listed pathogen among the 6 named, which potentially precludes international movement and release of the animals. Hopefully, the lab investigations will be accomplished early and with negative results, allowing the termination of the concerning episode and the release of the remaining part of the consignment for slaughter before Eid al Adha, the Muslim feast of sacrifice, expected on 26 Oct 2012. - Mod.AS
