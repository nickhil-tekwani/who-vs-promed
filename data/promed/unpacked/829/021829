AVIAN INFLUENZA (118): CZECH-GERMAN VIRUS SEQUENCE

Further to the reoccurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
subtype H5N1 in wild birds, Germany sequence data of the hemagglutinin
genes of 2 isolates obtained from infected mute swans found at Nuremberg,
Bavaria, and Frohburg, Saxonia have now been generated at the
Friedrich-Loeffler Institut, Isle of Riems.
Preliminary comparisons and database searches demonstrated that these 2
sequences are closely related (at least 99.5 per cent identity) but
distinguishable from each other. Other closely related sequences which are
publicly available originate from H5N1 isolates made in 2006 from grebes
(_Podiceps spec._) in southern Siberia and from a whooper swan (_Cygnus
cygnus_) and a common goldeneye (_Bucephala clangula_) in Mongolia. In a
phylogenetic analysis, these viruses form a separate cluster with H5N1
viruses isolated from chickens in Afghanistan. In addition, viruses from
the Russian Krasnodar region and a virus detected in 2006 in a mute swan in
Italy are associated with this cluster.
In a joint analysis performed with the Community Reference Laboratory at
VLA, Weybridge, the H5N1 virus from the outbreak in a turkey holding in the
Czech Republic appears to be equidistant yet closely related (99.2 per cent
identity) to those from Nuremberg and Frohburg.
Intensified monitoring among wild birds and molecular analysis of further
virus isolates should shed more light on the possible routes of
introduction and spread of these viruses in Central Europe.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to the investigators of the 2 laboratories in
Riems (Germany) and in Weybridge (UK) for the above authoritative firsthand
contribution.
A previous media-derived report referred to an analysis of the viral DNA
showing a 99.2 per cent match between the Czech outbreak in turkeys and the
virus in dead swans in the German city of Nuremberg; both samples were,
reportedly, also very similar to viral DNA collected in Kuwait and
sequenced in Weybridge, Britain (See item 1 in posting 20070629.2090).
It would be helpful to obtain official confirmation of the said data and to
get data on the relation of the Kuwaiti strain to the 2006 isolates from
Mongolia, south Siberia and Afghanistan.
The Czech Republic has notified the OIE today (29 Jun 2007) that a mute
swan from Breclav (Lednice, south Moravia) was found positive for HPAI H5N1
by gene sequencing performed at the State Veterinary Institute (SVI),
Prague; see report and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4659>.
Data on the phylogenetic profile of this isolate and its relation to the
other viruses in the above cluster would be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
