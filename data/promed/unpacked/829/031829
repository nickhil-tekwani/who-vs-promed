On 11 Nov 2019, Beijing Center for Disease Control (Beijing CDC) identified 2 cases of _Yersinia pestis_ (_Y. _pestis_)-induced pneumonic plague in a husband and wife from the Sunitezuo Qi (County) of the Xilinguole League (Prefecture) in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Three days later on 14 Nov 2019, another case of _Y. pestis_ was identified in a patient from Huade County of Ulanchabu City in Inner Mongolia, 130 km from the 1st 2 cases. China CDC established no epidemiological relationship between the 2 events.

A total of 447 persons with direct contact in Beijing and 46 in Inner Mongolia were quarantined for medical observation. As of 21 Nov 2019, all persons with direct contact were discharged from medical observation.

Investigation and Results
----------------------
Patient A. The index case (Patient A) was a 43-year-old male herdsman. On 25 Oct 2019, the day after working the soil on his farm, he had sudden onset of fever (40 C [104 F]), with chills, vomiting, chest pain, breathlessness, and cough with blood-tinged sputum. He reported no swollen lymph nodes. He sought treatment in a local county hospital, where he was admitted and stayed for 2 days. On 27 Oct 2019, his condition deteriorated, and he was transferred to League Central Hospital (LCH) by ambulance and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he stayed for 7 days.

Patient B. On 31 Oct 2019, while Patient A was in the ICU, his wife (Patient B, 46 years old), who had accompanied and cared for him, had onset of cough with a low-grade fever (38 C [100 F]). She was hospitalized in LCH. Over the next 24 hours, her condition worsened with increasing cough, blood-tinged sputum production, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Computerized tomography revealed pneumonia. Husband and wife were treated with antibiotics in the local hospital from 25 Oct to 2 Nov 2019 but did not show significant improvement. They were transferred by ambulance to a general hospital in Beijing on 3 Nov 2019 and were given moxifloxacin and cefoperazone sodium along with supportive treatment. There was no clinical improvement.

On 12 Nov 2019, blood and sputum specimens were tested by Beijing CDC and were found to be positive by RT-PCR and colloidal gold-immunochromatography assay targeting the F1 antigen and by reverse indirect hemagglutination assay (RIHA). Although _Y. pestis_ was not able to be isolated by culture, NGS sequencing was weakly positive for _Y. pestis_ genetic material. Beijing CDC and Inner Mongolia CDC immediately initiated a coordinated investigation, including evaluation of potential exposures to the patient and an environmental assessment to determine risk of further transmission. The Inner Mongolia Plateau is home to _Meriones unguiculatus_ (_M. unguiculatus_), a primary mammalian host of _Y. pestis_, with cases of intense wild rodent epizootic disease in 2019.

Patient C. On 11 Nov 2019, Patient C (55-year-old male) sought treatment in a local hospital in Huade County for swollen lymph nodes and fever. Patient C had eaten a dead hare he found in the field. A clinician noted this exposure and suspected _Y. pestis_ infection. The Inner Mongolia CDC laboratory identified _Y. pestis_ by culture with the phage lysis test and with RT-PCR from lymph nodes aspirates. Blood cultures were negative for _Y. pestis_. On 13 Nov 2019, the patient was reported to Huade County CDC as having bubonic plague. An epidemiological investigation indicated no relation between Patients A/B and Patient C. However, Patient C lives in a county that is known to be a natural focus of _Y. pestis_.

Public Health Response
-----------------------
When epizootic plague is detected, local health-care providers and the public should be alerted to potential risks of plague. Educational efforts should promote personal protection measures, including: 1) educating the public to avoid direct contact with sick or dead animals (e.g., rodents and rabbits in Inner Mongolia); 2) wearing long pants and applying insect repellent on the skin, to clothing, and to outer bedding of anyone who engages in outdoor activities in an area that is an endemic focus for plague; 3) abstaining from handling or skinning wild or domestic animals that died of unknown reasons and using gloves when handling animals killed by trapping or hunting; 4) taking prophylactic antibiotics if risk of exposure is high; and 5) keeping pet dogs and cats in natural plague foci free from fleas and not allowing them to wander freely (1).

In response to the events reported above, key preventive measures have been implemented in Inner Mongolia. These include: 1) enhanced surveillance for plague in rodents and rodent predators in enzootic areas; 2) use of insecticides and rodenticides to eliminate wild rodent fleas and reservoirs; 3) strengthening of professional training and alerting doctors to the forms of plague; 4) strengthening of professional training for local CDC and clinical laboratory staff; 5) monitoring rodent die-offs and educating the public to report sightings of dead animals and reductions in animal colony size; and 6) considering plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs and cats, in the natural plague foci areas.

Discussion
--------
Plague is an acute, often fulminating, infectious disease caused by _Y. pestis_. There are 3 main forms of plague, with the specific form depending upon route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague (1). Most human plague cases are of the bubonic form, which results from bites by infected fleas. However, plague can also be transmitted to humans by handling infected animals or by inhaling infectious aerosols from persons with pneumonic plague and from diseased or dead animals. The family of patients A and B lived in an independent house in a grassland, and investigators determined that the index patient most likely became infected while working the soil on his farm, an area where _M. unguiculatus_ serves as a primary plague host. 500 meters from the house of Patients A and B, a live _M. unguiculatus_ was trapped and found to be culture-positive for _Y. pestis_. A large rodent die-off was also observed in the area, raising the possibility that the decayed bodies in the dirt or in rat holes could have produced infectious aerosols. The wife (Patient B) most likely was infected from contact with her husband.

Plague is primarily a rodent-hosted, transmitting disease. Animal to animal transmission is mediated by the bites of fleas that became infected by biting infected animals. Humans can be infected by the bites of bacterium-bearing fleas or by direct contact with wild or domestic animals that died from plague or are diseased with plague (marmots, foxes, lynxes and badgers, dogs (2), Tibetan sheep (3), and cats). Person-to-person transmission occurs only with pneumonic plague. Plague is categorized as a Class A infectious disease, the most serious category under China's Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (4).

Plague in Inner Mongolia
----------------------
Human plague has been well controlled since 1959 in Inner Mongolia. During 1960-2018, only 9 human plague cases with 2 deaths occurred in Inner Mongolia (5). The most recent human plague cases were reported from this focus in 2004, and as with Patient C, were due to skinning a dead hare (6).

There are 4 plague foci in Inner Mongolia (7). These are an _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in the Inner Mongolian Plateau, a _Microtus brandti_ plague focus in the Xilin Gol Grassland, a _Spermophilus dauricus_ plague focus in the Song-Liao Plain and a _Marmota sibirica_ plague focus in the Hulun Buir Plateau (a silent plague focus). The _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia can be divided into 2 parts: the Ordos plateaus and the desert steppe of the Ulanqab plateaus. The _S. dauricus_ focus includes the Song-Liao plain hills and the dry steppe of Qahar area (5).

Combining previous plague epizootic data (5) and recent surveillance data, the Inner Mongolia animal plague epidemic can be divided into 4 phases, as illustrated in Table 1. The Inner Mongolia plateau focus of _M. unguiculatus_ was 1st identified in 1954. The total area of this focus is 134 803 square km and encompasses 22 counties (Qi) in the middle and western parts of Inner Mongolia (5). In the last 5 years, the Inner Mongolia natural foci of animal plague has been active. In 2019, virulent animal plague epidemics occurred in this focus, which has a high density of rats.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this is the 1st instance in which pneumonic plague was imported into a major city in China. Although clearly a transported case, awareness and appropriate measures should always be implemented. These 3 cases can provide important lessons for public health practitioners.

[The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
