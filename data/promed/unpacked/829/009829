A fungus dangerous to bats has been confirmed at Soudan Underground Mine State Park and Forestville/Mystery Cave State Park, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

The fungus is known to cause white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that is harmful and mostly fatal to hibernating bats and has decimated bat populations in the eastern portions of the United States and Canada.

The DNR [(Minnesota) Department of Natural Resources] will step up its efforts to slow the spread of the fungus. While the disease is transmitted primarily from bat to bat, fungal spores may be inadvertently carried to caves by humans on clothing and caving gear. The syndrome is not known to pose a threat to humans, pets, livestock or other wildlife.

While only a few bats have tested positive for the fungus, the discovery has serious implications. If Minnesota follows trends of other states, the disease is likely to be present in Minnesota bats within 2 to 3 years.

"This is bad news for an important mammal in our ecosystem," said Steve Hirsch, director of the DNR's Ecological and Water Resources Division, which oversees the agency's nongame wildlife program. "We're prepared with special protocols to help keep the fungus from spreading."

Public tours of Soudan Underground Mine and Mystery Cave will continue, but visitors will begin each tour with a brief lesson on how they can prevent the spread of the fungus.

After tours, visitors will be required to walk across special mats designed to remove spores from footwear. They will be advised not to visit other caves or mines with any clothing, footwear or gear they have used in areas where WNS or the associated fungus is present because washing alone cannot sufficiently disinfect clothing.

Ed Quinn, natural resource coordinator for the DNR's Parks and Trails Division, said: "Education is one of the most effective tools we have to slow the spread of the disease."

A fungus that spreads a disease that's nearly always fatal to bats has been found in 2 of Minnesota's largest bat caves -- the Soudan Underground Mine near Lake Vermilion and a cave at Forestville/Mystery Cave State Park in southern Minnesota.

The 2 Minnesota sites are considered among the state's largest bat hibernacula -- or wintering sites -- and thousands of bats live in both.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has scheduled a media briefing this afternoon [9 Aug 2013] to announce that the fungus has been found. The fungus had never before been found in Minnesota but has been called the "worst wildlife health crisis in memory" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

So far, the DNR reports that they have found no bats that have died from so-called white nose syndrome. Vermont's Aeolus Cave housed an estimated 400 000 little brown myotis bats before the disease struck. Two years later, researchers found only 36 bats alive.

"This is one of the most devastating diseases affecting wildlife in eastern North America," Wendi Weber of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a June 2013 statement. "Best estimates indicate that it has killed more than 5.7 million bats."

White nose syndrome (WNS) was 1st observed in 2006 in a cave in Upstate New York. Since then, it has spread rapidly west to 22 states in the United States and 5 Canadian provinces. The disease has reduced bat populations as much as 71 percent in states where it has struck and, in some cases, has killed nearly 100 percent of the bats in caves where the fungus has appeared.

It is not clear how the disease spread so fast, but it is believed that humans carry the fungus from one cave to another and that bats may spread the disease themselves.

The Soudan mine is home to the largest known wintering concentration, or hibernaculum, of bats in Minnesota. An estimated 10 000 to 15 000 bats hang along 52 miles of horizontal tunnels and vertical shafts, most of them little brown myotis.

White nose syndrome is not known to pose a threat to humans, pets, livestock or other wildlife.

Report bats flying during the day, clinging to trees or building exteriors in winter when snow is still on the ground, or showing white fungus on muzzles or wings. Do not handle bats. Call the DNR toll-free Animal Report Line at (888) 345-1730 or go to http://www.mndnr.gov/reportbats.

[White nose syndrome is caused by a fungus _Geomyces destructans_. The syndrome was discovered in 2006, but the fungus was not identified and named until 2009. However, there may be a name change in store for the fungus. In ProMED-mail post 20130730.1853096, the following paragraph may be found:

In 2009, researchers identified the culprit behind WNS as a member of the genus _Geomyces_, resulting in its name _Geomyces destructans_, or _G. destructans_. Minnis and Lindner generated DNA sequence data and found evidence supporting a shift in the genus to which the fungus belongs, resulting in a new name: _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_, or _P. destructans_. "This research represents more than just a name change," according to Bayless. "Understanding the evolutionary relationships between this fungus and its cousins in Europe and North America should help us narrow our search for solutions to WNS." http://esciencenews.com/articles/2013/07/25/scientists.identify.key.fungal.species.help.explain.mysteries.white.nose.syndrome.

At this point, the name _G. destructans_ seems to be the prevalent causative name. However, we may begin to see _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ or _P. destructans_ as the official name.
