Thai health chiefs have again denied cholera is present in their country,
saying the El Tor strain contracted by Hong Kong tourists was not
classified as cholera there.
The Thai Ministry of Public Health issued a statement to "clarify that
severe diarrhoea and not classical cholera currently exists in the kingdom".
They stressed potential visitors should understand they are not at risk
from cholera.
Thirty people who returned from holidays in Thailand were diagnosed by Hong
Kong's Department of health as having contracted cholera there.
They all had the El Tor variety of the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium.
But Thai health chiefs said: "In Thailand this El Tor strain is not
classified as cholera because it is much less serious...and its potential
spread is limited."
The ministry said it was still trying to track down the source of the
outbreak.
The Department of Health in Hong Kong said El Tor was classified as cholera
by the World Health Organization.
It welcomed efforts to trace the source.
"We have been in touch with the Thai authorities and had meetings with them
earlier in the week, " a spokesman said.
"We gave them information on people coming back from Thailand. Tests show
they were infected with cholera; we provided all the information.
"We are pleased to note they are taking action to tackle the issue."

Provincial health authorities have been asked to control the spread of
acute diarrhoea and to destroy all suspected source of infection by the end
of the month.
In an move to clarify the country's image, which has been damaged by
reports of Hong Kong tourists contracting cholera after returning from
Thailand Permanent Secretary of Health Prakrom Vutiphongse recently told
provincial health chiefs to strengthen precautionary measures in all
provinces.
Dr Prakrom told the officials to pay special attention to improving food
and environmental sanitation, particularly in the municipality and tourist
attraction areas.
In the first two months of this year, 1,459 cases of acute diarrhoea were
reported in 51 provinces, out of which 10 died.

control as to whether the Thai position the _Vibrio cholera_ infections of
the El Tor strain are not to be considered cholera is reasonable. - Mod.ES
