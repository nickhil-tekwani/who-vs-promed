The Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) confirmed the presence of phytoplasmas associated with purple top disease (PTD) in potato crops in the department of Narino. 40% of the crops monitored in the 1ST semester of 2021 had PTD symptoms.

Surveillance and control of vector insects were established. Use of phytosanitary measures has been recommended to growers, such as monitoring of crops for PTD symptoms and removal of infected plants; use of healthy seed tubers; adequately disposing of harvest residues; carrying out crop rotations.

[A number of potato diseases such as purple top, big bud, and purple top wilt are caused by a range of phytoplasmas. Phytoplasmas of the stolbur (16SrXII), aster yellows (16SrI), clover proliferation (16SrVI), peanut witches broom (16SrII), Mexican potato purple top (16SrXIII), and the new 16SrXVIII taxonomic groups have been reported to be associated with these diseases.

Different phytoplasmas within these groups have been found in different regions to cause similar symptoms. Other phytoplasma diseases of potato include witches' broom, marginal flavescence, purple toproll, and phyllody. Further work is needed on taxonomy and relatedness of some of the potato phytoplasmas. Many of the potato phytoplasmas can also affect other solanaceous crops, for example, tomato.

Phytoplasmas can be spread with infected plant material (tissue cultures, grafting), and planthopper or psyllid vectors. Transmission with potato tubers has also been shown, at least in some crop varieties. Disease outbreaks seem to occur in cycles, being favoured by hot dry summers, which stimulate vector migration into crops. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include vector control, removal of pathogen and/or vector reservoirs (volunteer crop plants, weeds), use of clean planting material and resistant varieties.

In the report above, the potato psyllid _Bactericera cockerelli_ (Bc) is being claimed to be the vector of PTD. However, while Bc is a known vector of psyllid yellows (PY) of potato (also called 'zebra chip'; caused by _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum; 1st report in South America ProMED post 20200628.7511323), it does not seem to have been proven to transmit phytoplasmas of any kind so far. Leafhopper species of genus _Aceratagallia_ were shown to transmit 16SrII phytoplasmas associated with PTD in Ecuador (see link below), while PY liberibacters there are transmitted by Bc. Both diseases are present in the same area and symptoms may be similar which has likely led to misdiagnosis of the disease transmitted by Bc.
