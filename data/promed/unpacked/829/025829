An outbreak of hepatitis A struck the city of São Paulo, Brazil in 2017 and the number of cases reported through November 2017 is an astounding 11 times the number of cases in 2016, according to an r7.com report (http://www.r7.com/retrospectiva-2017/sp-casos-de-hepatite-a-crescem-11-vezes-mas-surto-deve-se-estabilizar-22122017; computer translated). Officials in São Paulo have seen 656 hepatitis A cases, including 2 deaths in the 1st 11 months of 2017; this compares with just 60 reported in 2016, for a nearly 1000 percent increase year-to-year.

The increase in hepatitis A in the state capital is mainly related to the homosexual population, according to the Municipal Health Secretary of São Paulo -- "Most cases are men who have sex with men who have not been vaccinated and who are susceptible to hepatitis. Probably within this community, people became infected and the disease spread."

45 percent of the cases were transmitted through unprotected sex, 11 percent were due to ingestion of contaminated water and/or food, and in the remaining 44 percent the source of transmission is unknown. However, the good news is it appears that cases are now decreasing. The Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases believes that the occurrences should not increase in 2018.

Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause a liver infection. Symptoms can last a few days to several months. The virus is rarely fatal and most people develop lifetime immunity following infection. Hepatitis A can be serious however, especially for older people and those with chronic liver disease. For these individuals, there is a greater risk of hospitalization and death. Most people who are infected recover completely. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not develop into chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and death from hepatitis A infection is rare.

[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.

In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22341552), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.

The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:
- men who have sex with men;
- people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;
- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;
- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;
- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and
- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.

The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LL
