White nose syndrome confirmed in hibernating bats from Washington
County Mines
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maryland Department of Natural Resources [DNR] biologists have
confirmed that white nose syndrome (WNS) has been found in an
abandoned mine complex in western Washington County. The mine complex
serves as an important bat hibernacula, or bat hibernation site. WNS
is a malady causing unprecedented bat mortality across the eastern
United States. Affected bats display a white fungal growth on their
muzzles or other exposed skin.

"This is the 2nd WNS site documented by the Department of Natural
Resources. The 1st was in March 2010 at a cave in Allegany County near
Cumberland," said DNR biologist Dan Feller. "Hibernacula surveys are
still underway with assistance from volunteer cavers, students and
other biologists. Fortunately the additional surveys have not yielded
any new WNS sites."

DNR biologists discovered a dead little brown bat during a recent
survey and submitted the animal for testing. The US Geological Survey
National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, confirmed WNS
in the sample. Positive cases of WNS have been found in 4 of the 5
Maryland mines surveyed. These mines harbor state and federally
endangered bat species.

WNS is a disease that has spread across mines and caves in 14 states
and 2 Canadian provinces, killing more than a million bats. It was
first observed at Howe Cave near Albany, New York, in 2006. WNS is
also thought to be associated with and likely caused by a newly
discovered cold-weather fungus, _Geomyces destructans_.

Under the direction of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a national
interagency team is mobilizing to slow the spread and find a cure to
white nose syndrome.

"WNS is only known to affect hibernating bats and is not known to be
harmful to humans" said Jonathan McKnight, associate director of DNR's
Wildlife and Heritage Service. "It appears the most common mechanism
for transmission of the disease is direct contact from bat to bat.
However, because the fungus associated with WNS can live in cave
soils, it may be possible for humans to spread WNS in cave dirt
through contact with their clothing and gear."

The US Fish and Wildlife Service requests that cavers refrain from
caving in all WNS affected states and adjoining states. And cavers
should refrain from caving anywhere during the hibernation period
(September-May) to minimize disturbance and mortality to bats.

DNR biologists, following strict protocols established by the
Northeastern WNS Working Group, will continue their monitoring efforts
to determine if any other hibernation sites are affected in the state.

Disease killing bats in eastern states has been found in Ohio
-------------------------------------------------------------
A disease that's killing bats in eastern states has been detected for
the first time in Ohio, according to federal forestry officials.

White nose syndrome, named for a fungus that spreads over bats' faces
while they hibernate, has been blamed for the deaths of nearly 1
million bats in other states.

Officials found it in bats hibernating in an abandoned mine shaft in
the Wayne National Forest in Lawrence County.

The US Forestry Service closed caves and mines on federal lands to
cavers last year [2010] in an attempt to stop the spread of the
disease. It was thought that humans might spread the fungal spores via
their shoes and equipment.

Gary Chancey, a Wayne National Forest spokesman, said the particular
mine shaft where the disease was discovered was closed off to visitors
in 2001 to create a refuge for bats, including the federally
endangered Indiana bat. According to the state, US and Ohio biologists
surveyed Ohio mines in February [2011] and this month [March 2011] to
assess bat populations and conduct surveillance for white nose
syndrome.

A state release said biologists documented found more than 1300 bats
hibernating at the Lawrence County mine. Of those, 69 percent were
little brown bats, 21 percent were Indiana bats, 10 percent were
tri-colored bats, and there were smaller numbers of big brown bats and
northern bats.

White nose syndrome spreads to New Brunswick bats
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A lethal and little-understood disease called white nose syndrome
(WNS) is devastating the little brown bat population of New
Brunswick.

And while bats may have a bad reputation in some circles, naturalists
are warning their loss in New Brunswick could lead to the rise of
destructive insect populations, especially in the agriculture and
forestry sectors.

Donald McAlpine and Karen Vanderwolf, researchers at the New
Brunswick Museum in Saint John, have discovered white nose syndrome in
the province's most important over-wintering cave for bats, located in
Albert County. "It's a mixture of little browns and long-eared bats,"
McAlpine said of the roughly 6000 bats that hibernate in the cave.

"There were over 1200 dead on the floor and there were large numbers
of bats that were visibly infected with white nose and many that were
also actually dead, hanging on the walls. The ones that are infected,
we don't expect them to survive."

McAlpine and Vanderwolf made the grisly discovery 2 weeks ago.
Samples of the fungus from the cave have been tested and identified as
the same strain that has been infecting bat populations in
northeastern North America since it first was detected in a bat cave
in Albany, New York, in 2006. The discovery of the fungus in the
Albert County cave is the 1st confirmation of the infection in New
Brunswick.

"We knew it was coming," said McAlpine, the museum's curator in
zoology. "But we were surprised by what we found in the cave. And we
didn't expect the disease to hit so hard when it first appeared."

Although recorded in Ontario and Quebec last year [2010], no major
die-offs of bats have been observed in those provinces. McAlpine said
it's a mystery as to why bats in New Brunswick should be hit so hard.

"Some of the modeling that has been done on declining populations as
a result of this fungus suggests the little brown bat could be
regionally extinct within 20 years," he said.

"They don't just eat bugs we don't want around, like mosquitoes --
they eat lots of insects that are agriculture pests and forestry
pests, including the spruce budworm."

The little brown bat is the most common bat in the province. McAlpine
said, at this point, there is no known way to stop the spread of the
fungus.

However, naturalists and the province's Natural Resources Department
are asking people to stay out of caves and old mines that harbor bats
in an effort to slow the spread of the spores and save the little
winged mammals. "The department will be working with the New Brunswick
Museum to monitor and understand this situation," Pascal Giasson, a
biologist with the province's Fish and Wildlife branch, said in a
statement.

"We ask for the cooperation of New Brunswickers in limiting
opportunities for cross-contamination to help reduce the impact of
this fungus."

Scientists do not know with any certainty how or why the fungus first
appeared in North America in 2006. There is speculation it may have
been inadvertently brought over from Europe, where bats have a natural
immunity to the infection.

What scientists do know with certainty is the calamitous effect the
new-to-America fungus has had on the hibernating bats of eastern North
America.

In less than 5 years, white nose syndrome has spread to 15 [US]
states, 3 Canadian provinces, and is believed to have killed more than
1 million bats. In one old graphite mine near Lake George, New York,
the number of bats plunged from 185 000 to 2000 in just 3 years. The
white fungus can be seen on the bodies of bats, especially around
their noses.

McAlpine said no one is sure how it actually kills the mammals
although it is believed it causes them to wake too frequently during
hibernation and therefore uses up the small animals' fat stores.

"The best hope now is that some portion of the population has a
natural resistance and will survive and, over time, the populations
will recover," McAlpine said.

But he said it would take many years to recover since bats normally
live a long time, over 20 years on average, and have only one
offspring per year.

[The sad thing about this disease is that it is spreading. It is
devastating to a variety of bat populations. The destruction of the
bats will likely begin to impact the insects these bats consume, which
as pointed out, may cause more crop damage. If bats that pollinate
plants are affected, then there will more effect on plants and food
sources.
