18 people were victims of food poisoning in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region between 21 Sep and 11 Oct 2012 after eating organic buckwheat flour or bread containing organic buckwheat.

An investigation was undertaken by the Regional Health Agency and the departmental offices for the protection of people, services of Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) to identify the products that caused the intoxication.

These investigations concluded that the organic buckwheat flour was potentially contaminated by organic datura (1), a wild and toxic plant.

Bakeries, stores or crepe places that used or sold buckwheat flour and food products made from buckwheat (bread, crepes, cakes) were informed of the contamination and stopped selling these products. Flyers informed consumers of the withdrawal and warnings about these products.

If you bought products made from organic buckwheat flour, please contact the place where you got it to determine whether the product is affected by this warning or not.

The symptoms described are those of atropine poisoning (dry mouth, dilated pupils, blurred vision, tachycardia, agitation, confusion, spatial and temporal disorientation, hallucinations, incoherent speech).

People who have consumed the products mentioned above and present these types of symptoms are advised to call 911 or consult their doctor ASAP and inform the physician of this fact and when and where they purchased the food products.

[Jimsonweed's Latin name is _Datura_ spp. There are a number of different species with a slightly different shape to the leaves or flowers. However, they all contain the same toxic agents, just in slightly different proportions. A photo may be seen at: http://www.wildflowersofontario.ca/jimsonweed1.jpg or http://www.1000wordsphotos.com/desertflowers/jimsonweed.html. The thorny fruit that contributes to its name may be viewed at: http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/D/W-SO-DSTR-FR.001.html.

The memory tool for jimsonweed intoxication is "red as a beet, dry as a bone" (flushed, hot, red skin), and "mad as a hatter" (from Alice in Wonderland, for its hallucinogenic properties). The seeds have been collected by addicts trying to get high because of the hallucinogenic properties. The article correctly states that it would appear that intoxicated individuals can appear as if they have been smoking marijuana. However, the cardiac affects have proven to be fatal in many cases.

The plant has an almost worldwide distribution and is very adaptable to many climates and habitats.

It is easy to understand how this plant in a field of buckwheat could be harvested at the same time as the grain thus contaminating the grain for processing. It would be unfortunate to think that someone intentionally added the seeds to the grain at the time of flour processing. However, it is not uncommon in some countries, especially Bangladesh, for datura powder to be used to spike food or drink, and then robbers may more easily take advantage of the victim.
