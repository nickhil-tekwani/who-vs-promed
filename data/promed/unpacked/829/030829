It rarely ever happens, but a 2-year-old rescued dog named Jhoomer survived canine distemper. The chances of a pooch surviving this virus is usually only 5 per cent, according to vets, and the doctors say that there has been an outbreak of the infection over the past couple of months.

If detected in the early stages, recovery is possible, says a city-based veterinarian Dr Lohith H D, adding: "But in my career of 15 years, I haven't seen this severe an outbreak of canine distemper. I get about 10 cases a day."

The early symptoms of canine distemper include fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Dr Karthik says, "It affects the puppies mostly, as the immunity levels in them are low. The viral infection further reduces the immunity. Hence, we just provide them with supportive therapy to prevent viral multiplication and secondary bacterial infection with antibiotics. We also prescribe nervous stimulants, if it has affected them neurologically."

Attending to such cases in a clinic or a hospital is also difficult, as the doctors fear it may spread to the other dogs. "All my boys have been trained to detect canine distemper in the patients that come in, so that before they enter, they are taken to an isolated room, and the contaminated area is cleaned. We need to take many precautions," says Dr Lohith.

Dr Nanjundappa says: "Though it is common among the Indian stray dogs and puppies as they are not been taken proper care of, I have also been getting cases of owner (pet) dogs for the past 3 days. They are affected, as they have not been vaccinated or due to some failure of vaccine."

Five to 10 per cent of such cases could be due to failure of vaccine, adds Dr Lothith. "They may not have been vaccinated regularly, or the vaccine would not have been good." Dr Karthik says, "It is a combined vaccine for distemper and hepatitis."

Once a dog survives, there is 99 per cent chance that it will not be infected with this virus again, says Dr Nanjundappa. "But they will have post-cure effects such as twitching, paralysis and continuous jaw movements (chewing gum fits). They need to be on supplements lifelong."
