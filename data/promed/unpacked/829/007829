The FDA is warning consumers against consuming shell eggs manufactured by Good Earth Egg Company after 8 people in 3 USA states have reported illness that officials have determined is caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg. As of Tue [4 Oct 2016] morning, the Bonne Terre, Missouri-based company had not issued a recall for the eggs, according to the FDA. According to the CDC, 2 of the people sickened in the outbreak have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Illnesses were reported in Illinois, Kansas and Missouri.

Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover in 4 to 7 days without treatment, but young, elderly or immunosuppressed individuals are at [higher] risk of suffering more serious illness. To reduce the risk of illness, the FDA is advising consumers not to eat eggs produced by Good Earth Egg Company, and to return them for a refund where they purchased them or dispose of them immediately. The eggs were sold under different brand names, according to the CDC. If consumers are unsure of where their eggs were distributed from, it advised asking the store where they bought them or the restaurant where they were eating them.

The FDA advised consumers also to clean any surfaces or utensils that may have touched the eggs if they stored them in their homes.
