Ganapathiraju PV, Gharpure R, Thomas D, et al. Notes from the Field: Botulism type E after consumption of salt-cured fish -- New Jersey, 2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Oct 2018, at 2:15 a.m., a woman aged 30 years and her mother, aged 55 years, both of Egyptian descent, arrived at an emergency department in New Jersey in hypotensive shock after 16 hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The daughter also reported blurry vision and double vision (diplopia), shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty speaking. She appeared lethargic and had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ptosis. Both women were admitted to the hospital. The mother improved after fluid resuscitation, but the daughter required vasopressor support in the intensive care unit. Although the mother did not have evidence of cranial nerve involvement on admission, during the next 24 hours, she developed dysphagia and autonomic dysfunction with syncope and orthostasis and was transferred to the intensive care unit as her symptoms progressively worsened similar to those of her daughter.

Two days before admission, both women had eaten fesikh, a traditional Egyptian fish dish of uneviscerated gray mullet that is fermented and salt-cured. Fesikh has been linked to foodborne botulism, including a large type E outbreak in Egypt in 1993 (1). The Egyptian Ministry of Health has since issued public health warnings regarding fesikh before Sham el-Nessim, the Egyptian holiday commemorating the beginning of spring, during which fesikh is commonly prepared and eaten. Foodborne botulism outbreaks associated with fesikh and similar uneviscerated salt-cured fish have also occurred in North America (2); 2 outbreaks occurred among persons of Egyptian descent in New Jersey in 1992 (3) and 2005 (4).

Botulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), was suspected because of the reported exposure to fesikh along with symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis, dysarthria, and autonomic dysfunction. Per New Jersey Reporting Regulations (NJAC 8:57), these suspected illnesses were immediately reported to the New Jersey Department of Health. After consultation with CDC, heptavalent botulism antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to both patients within approximately 24 hours of arrival at the hospital. The daughter's symptoms improved, and she was weaned off vasopressors. Both patients survived following intensive care for 2 days and total hospitalization of 7 days each.

CDC tested serum obtained before antitoxin administration. Serum from the daughter tested positive for BoNT type E by the BoNT Endopep-MS assay (5); the mother's serum tested negative. A leftover sample of the consumed fesikh also tested positive for BoNT type E and _Clostridium botulinum_ type E.

Interviews conducted by the Communicable Disease Service at the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that 2 fresh mullets purchased by the patients' neighbor at a local Asian market were used to prepare the fesikh. The mother salt-cured and fermented the mullet, leaving the fish uneviscerated and wrapped in plastic in the kitchen for 20 days at ambient temperature. The mother confirmed that she previously used the same method of preparation in Egypt with no deviation in techniques or steps.

These cases illustrate the importance of early recognition and treatment of botulism. Botulism can be fatal, typically from respiratory failure, and treatment delays can result in increased mortality and worsened overall outcomes (6). These cases also highlight the role of uneviscerated, salt-cured fish dishes as potential vehicles for foodborne botulism. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in marine environments, and traditional methods of home preparation for these dishes might support conditions that are favorable for toxin production (that is, anaerobic conditions) (2). Neither of these patients had previously heard of botulism. Risk communication via public awareness campaigns, as has been conducted by the Egyptian Ministry of Health to discourage fesikh consumption, might be indicated in the USA; engagement with Egyptian communities in the USA might provide insights into additional prevention strategies to decrease the risk for foodborne botulism from fesikh and other uneviscerated, salt-cured fish products.

Most cases of botulism associated with fish or sea mammal ingestion are type E, as in this case.

The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations Section 540.650: Uneviscerated fish products that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked (CPG 7108.17)
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cpg-sec-540650-uneviscerated-fish-products-are-salt-cured-dried-or-smoked-revised:

Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative
cell growth and toxin production.

Three outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as "rybetz", "ribeyza," or "rostov." Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air-dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.

In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" [fesikh] was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. An ethnic fish product called "moloha" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to "faseikh." The preparation steps
in the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the "moloha" could not be found.

Other salt-cured products, such as "bloaters," can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.

The problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer.

Control of growth and toxin production from _C. botulinum_ in fishery products is based on spore destruction (such as retorting canned foods) or inhibition of vegetative cell growth (such as control of water activity, pH, or use of approved chemical inhibitors). The control measures must be applied rapidly and uniformly throughout the product to protect consumers from this potentially life-threatening toxin.

Control of botulism can also be achieved in salted, dried, or smoked products prepared from small species of uneviscerated fish (generally 3 to 5 inches in length (8-13 cm)). Typically, these products are prepared from small anchovy and herring sprats. As uneviscerated fish under 5 inches in length are processed, their smaller size helps to ensure complete permeation of the flesh with inhibitory levels of salt or drying to a uniformly low water activity, resulting in the attainment of conditions that prevent the growth of _C. botulinum_.

The FDA considers uneviscerated fish that are salt-cured, dried, or smoked to represent a potentially life-threatening health hazard. In addition, fillets, parts, or other products derived from uneviscerated fish pose the same potential health hazard as the original product. Therefore, with the exception of small, uneviscerated fish as described above, the FDA considers uneviscerated fish that have been salt-cured, dried, or smoked, as well as products made from them, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in that the product has been prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.

These products are hazardous whether stored at ambient temperature, refrigerated, or frozen, or whether packaged in air, vacuum, or modified atmosphere. - Mod.LL]
