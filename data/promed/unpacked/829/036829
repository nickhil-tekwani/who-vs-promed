Virus diseases of stone-fruit trees in East Anatolia, Turkey
------------------------------------------------------------
[Production of stone-fruit in Turkey is about 1.3 million tons per year.
Twenty per cent is produced in East Anatolia, which also produces 57 per
cent of the apricot crop.
In 1998 and 1999, surveys were carried out in the main stone-fruit-growing
areas of East Anatolia (provinces of Malatya, Elazig and Igdir) to assess
the incidence of virus diseases. Varietal collections, mother blocks, and
commercial orchards of stone-fruit trees were inspected; samples were
collected and tested (ELISA, transmission to herbaceous and woody
indicators, molecular hybridisation tests). ... 1019 samples were tested
(859 apricot, 120 cherry, 21 almond, and 19 peach).
... Less than 0.3 percent virus infection level was found [in apricots,
but other stone-fruit crops were more heavily infected (cherry, almond,
peach showed 21, 33, and 16 per cent infection, respectively). [Tests for
11 viruses and 2 viroids resulted in identification of only 3 viruses --
apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus, prune dwarf ilarvirus, and prunus
necrotic ringspot nepovirus.
... Plum pox potyvirus ... occur[s in other regions of Turkey (...the
Marmara area in Central Anatolia region and in the Aegean region) [and
represents a serious threat to [apricot production in ... East Anatolia.
To prevent its spread, internal quarantine measures and certification
programmes are necessary.

[The authors' concerns about potential spread of plum pox disease to East
Anatolia are well grounded. Plum pox disease, (also known as Sharka) is one
of the most serious diseases of prunus (apricot, cherry (sweet and sour),
nectarine, peach, and plum). Excellent references are at the following URL:
