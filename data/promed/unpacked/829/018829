Mr. Patrick Anguzu, the Arua District health
officer said the re-emergence of meningoccocal
meningitis that has been on a low key since 10
Jul 2007, had killed 27 people out of 255 registered cases.

"The most affected areas are Arivu Subcounty in
Vurra County and parts of Upper Madi
(constituency)," Mr. Anguzu said on phone
yesterday [5 Dec 2007]. Dr. Sam Zaramba, the
director general of health services, had earlier
said medics in West Nile region had been put on
high alert over the meningitis epidemic, which
claimed at least 65 lives among over 2000
infected persons when the disease struck in December 2006 to March this year.

At the time, the government with support from the
World Health Organisation and MSF - France,
undertook partial mass vaccinations in Arua,
Koboko, Yumbe, Moyo and Nebbi districts, but this
time round, it is counties like Vurra in Arua,
which were not covered during the immunization
that are registering the renewed infections.

[Meningococcal meningitis occurs sporadically or
as epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, which is
known as the "Meningitis Belt," an area that
stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia
and Eritrea in the east and that includes northern Uganda
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>).
Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are
reported in this region of Africa each year
during the dry season, between December and June,
and every 6-12 years a large outbreak occurs
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>).

During the 1st 10 weeks of the 2006 meningitis
season, outbreaks in eastern Africa were mainly
caused by _Neisseria meningitides_ serogroup
W-135, whereas in West Africa the outbreak was
due to mainly serogroup A. In the Gulu district
of Uganda the predominant serogroup was W-135,
but serogroup A predominated in Uganda outside
this district. Gulu is located in the center of
the northern region, bordering Sudan and east of Arua
(<http://www.gulu.go.ug/>).

In the Gulu district, the disease was noted in
"Internally Displaced Persons" camps. Overcrowded
housing and large population displacements that
undoubtedly characterized these camps likely
favored the transmission of _N. meningitides_. At
that time, the International Coordinating Group
(ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic
Meningitis Control provided 360 000 doses of
trivalent vaccine (polysaccharide vaccine for
serotypes A, C, and W135) in an attempt to
control the outbreak (<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_03_21/en/index.html>).

In January 2007, a meningitis outbreak was again
reported in Uganda, according to the WHO
(<http://mediaglobal.org/index.php/2007/01/26/deadly-outbreak-in-africa%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%9cmeningitis-belt%e2%80%9d/>),
in an "area, which borders southern Sudan and
the Democratic Republic of Congoâ€¦..[among] both
refugees and nationals living in 'rural, densely
populated settlements." The most affected
district was said to be Arua. At the time, the
meningitis outbreak in South Sudan was reportedly
caused by serotype A, but the serotype causing
the meningitis outbreak in Uganda was not given.
The current outbreak is again occurring in the
Arua district, but "this time round, it is
counties like Vurra in Arua, which were not
covered during the [prior] immunization [program]."

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass
vaccination with the appropriate vaccine,
depending availability, in every involved
district in an attempt to induce herd immunity
(whereby transmission is blocked when a critical
percentage of the population have been vaccinated
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).
There are several different types of
meningococcal vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines,
which have been available for over 30 years,
exist against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in
various combinations (e.g., a bivalent AC,
trivalent ACW-135, and a tetravalent ACYW-135
polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent
conjugate vaccine against serogroup C and a
tetravalent against serogroups A, C, Y and W-135.
The conjugate vaccines are immunogenic for
children under 2 years of age whereas
polysaccharide vaccines are not. All these
vaccines have been proven to be safe and
effective with infrequent and mild side effects.
For both the meningococcal conjugate and the
polysaccharide vaccines, approximately 7-10 days
are required following vaccination for
development of protective levels of anti-meningococcal antibodies. - Mod.ML]
