Rapid communications: A multicountry outbreak of _Salmonella_ Agona,
February-August 2008
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of gastroenteritis affecting residents in the UK,
Ireland, and Finland is currently being investigated. As of Wed 13
Aug 2008, a total of 119 cases have been identified. An investigation
that includes interviews of persons with _Salmonella_ Agona
infections, comparison of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
profiles of _S._ Agona isolates from cases and also food samples from
an Irish food production company and retail outlet chain supplied by
the company, suggests that food products from that company may be
related to some of these cases. A number of food products including
beefsteak strips, chicken in various forms, bacon in various forms,
and pork have been withdrawn (see <http://www.fsai.ie/> for details).
The investigation is ongoing.

Background
----------
On 15 Jul 2008, the Irish National Salmonella Reference Laboratory
reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre 6 isolates of
_S._ Agona received over the previous 3 weeks. This was an unusual
finding as there were a total of 3 isolates in 2007, 5 in 2006, and
10 in 2005. The temporal association of 6 isolates of an uncommon
serotype suggested a possible link between cases. Early descriptive
data showed that the patients affected were mainly young adult males
between 20 and 45 years of age. No link between cases was immediately
apparent and a food-borne source was considered most likely. An
outbreak was declared on 16 Jul 2008. Colleagues in UK Surveillance
Centres were notified on that day. Colleagues in England, Scotland,
and Wales rported an increase in reports of _S._ Agona during
the end of June and early July 2008. Alerts were posted through the
Food- and Waterborne Diseases (former ENTER-net) network and the
European Union (EU) Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) on 23
Jul 2008. Subsequently, single cases were reported in Northern
Ireland and Finland.

To date, 119 cases have met the case definition [for case definition,
see source URL - Mod.LL]. Of these, 110 cases are confirmed, 7 (6 in
England, 1 in Wales) are probable and 2 (in Scotland) are possibles,
awaiting definitive analysis. The most recent date of onset reported
is 29 Jul 2008 (Figure 1) [for figures, see source URL. - Mod.LL].
Cases range in age from 3 months to 79 years with a median age of 27
years. The 3-month-old infant is a secondary case. Most cases (56
percent) are in males, the ratio is 67 male versus 52 female cases
(Figure 2). To date, 14 cases are known to have been or are currently
hospitalized. There has been one death associated with the outbreak;
an elderly female patient in the United Kingdom aged 77 years
contracted _S._ Agona and subsequently died. The cause of death is
reported as ischemic colitis secondary to salmonella infection.

Investigations to date
----------------------
The epidemiological descriptive study has demonstrated that at least
10 cases had eaten sandwiches containing one of the products from the
company in question. A case control study is underway to test the
hypotheses that cases are more likely to have eaten at outlets
supplied by the company in question, and foods supplied by it. The
study is complex due to the multitude of products and outlets
involved in this investigation. Microbiological investigations
demonstrate _S._ Agona isolates with the identical PFGE profile
SAGOXB.0066 in isolates from cases and food samples in the factory
and outlets supplied by the factory. As it may take several weeks
from onset of illness to the results of detailed molecular analysis,
it is expected that more cases fitting the case definition will be
diagnosed.

Control measures to date
------------------------
Working closely with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the
Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, the company has ceased
production from the implicated part of the plant that is a focus of
concern. In addition, the company has instituted a product withdrawal
of some product lines from an implicated production line/thermal zone
in the plant. The withdrawal has focused on products intended
primarily for consumption in the made-to-order sandwich trade.

The withdrawal also includes selected batches of cooked beef, cooked
chicken, and cooked bacon products processed on the same line for the
made-to-order sandwich trade. The company has an extensive product
distribution list with produce from the plant distributed through UK,
Republic of Ireland and many European countries. A confirmed case in
Finland has eaten beef strips in Finland from a branch of the retail
outlet chain implicated in Ireland and the UK.

Certain other cooked meat products from this production line/thermal
zone have not been withdrawn at this point on the basis that they are
intended for further cooking before consumption. This position
remains under review.

A Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) was released on 4 Aug
2008 and updated on 8 and 11 Aug 2008 by the Food Safety Authority of
Ireland (see <http://www.fsai.ie>).

[2] Wales: cases

<http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/14/rare-salmonella-outbreak-spreads-to-wales-91466-21530325/>


So far, 8 people in Wales have been diagnosed with a rare form of
food poisoning linked to a nationwide outbreak. The salmonella
outbreak, associated with cooked bacon from Ireland but sold in the
UK, has infected 119 people, killing one person in England. Several
types of ready-to-use sandwich fillings containing cooked bacon have
now been recalled.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), which is leading the
investigation into the outbreak, has also warned that bacon pieces
from a Dawn Farm Foods plant used as pizza toppings and ready meal
ingredients could also be affected.

The FSAI identified Dawn Farm Foods plant number 734, in County
Kildare, and some of its products as a possible source of the
_Salmonella_ Agona outbreak. 3 sandwich fillers, which may have been
contaminated with this rare strain of the bacterium are being
recalled. These are 170g tubs of Dunnes, Supervalu, and O'Brien's
chicken and bacon sandwich filler. All these products, which contain
bacon cooked by Dawn Farm Foods' County Kildare plant, have use-by
dates of 13 to 18 Aug 2008. O'Brien's sandwich shops are not affected.

The National Public Health Service for Wales last night [13 Aug 2008]
said that all products processed at Dawn Farm Foods' plant 734 on the
same production line as those which tested positive for the organism
should not be used. These will have been supplied to intermediary
distributors as frozen products and will subsequently be used by the
catering sector.
