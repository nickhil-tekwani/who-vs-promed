Mystery of kidney failures widens
----------------------------------
Doctors in Orlando (FL) diagnosed a 7th child with a potentially
fatal kidney ailment Wed, 23 Mar 2005, in a widening medical mystery
that has left health officials dumbfounded. The child, as well as
others admitted to hospitals in the past week, is in critical
condition with kidney failure after visiting a petting zoo in recent
weeks.
Investigators are checking to see if the children became sick from
bacteria that can be found in animal feces. Sources said other
[sources besides] petting-zoo animals are being explored, and doctors
say they won't be surprised if more sick children show up at area
hospitals.
"We are ready for any number of cases," said Dr. Mehul Dixit, a
pediatric nephrologist with Florida Hospital Orlando, where 4
children are being treated. "We will make all necessary arrangements
to make sure they get the care they need."
The children are suffering from an uncommon condition called HUS, or
hemolytic uremic syndrome, which causes the kidneys to malfunction.
Of the 4 children at Florida Hospital, 3 were listed in critical
condition, with 1 child on dialysis. The 4th child's condition
improved from critical to guarded.
2 more children in critical condition are receiving care at Arnold
Palmer Hospital for Children & Women, where the new case was
identified Wed night, 23 Mar 2005. A 7th child was treated at Arnold
Palmer several weeks ago, and it is not clear if that case is
connected to the others.
The children currently hospitalized all touched animals recently at
area fairs, including the Central Florida Fair in Orlando and the
Florida Strawberry Festival in Plant City. Both events were held 3-13
Mar 2005. Another possibility is that the children were exposed to
trouble-causing bacteria through contaminated food or beverages.
Health officials are interviewing family members to retrace meals in
recent days and glean other information to nail down a cause. "We
don't know yet what the common denominator is," said Joann Schulte, a
medical epidemiologist with the Florida Department of Health in
Tallahassee. "Certainly, the petting zoos are of interest, but we
don't know if they're the source" of the infections.
For now, doctors are helping the patients with treatments such as
intravenous liquids, blood transfusions and dialysis to ease the
strain on the kidneys. Many children with HUS recover without
lasting effects, but some die or suffer permanent kidney damage that
could require dialysis later in life.
The condition is most often caused by a specific form of the
_Escherichia coli_ bacteria that live in the intestinal tracts of
many animals. This form -- _E. coli_ O157:H7 -- has been linked to
outbreaks of kidney failure among children in other states, including
Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Washington. Health officials traced
those outbreaks to contact with farm animals.
In the Florida cases, however, not all children have tested positive
for _E. coli_. That could indicate a source other than farm animals
as the cause of their infections. Health officials are retesting the
children for _E. coli_ and are awaiting those results from a state
lab in Jacksonville and CDC.

Sickened Children All Went To A Fair
------------------------------------
Kidney failure in a half-dozen children has prompted health officials
to issue an alert to families who may have attended the Florida
Strawberry Festival and the Central Florida Fair in Orlando. All of
the children appear to be suffering from hemolytic uremic syndrome --
or HUS -- a rare condition generally caused by infection with a
virulent form of the _E. coli_ bacterium.
Investigators so far have found one link between the victims: All had
attended the festival or the fair earlier in Mar 2005. And all had
contact with livestock at the events. Health officials are taking a
close look at a Plant City petting zoo that supplied animals to both
attractions. "These kids with HUS are the tip of the iceberg. There
are other people who may have been infected but are not clinically
ill," said Joann Schulte, an epidemiologist with the Florida
Department of Health.
A public health alert in counties along the Interstate 75 and
Interstate 4 corridors is intended to advise parents and health care
providers to watch for signs of HUS.
"Normally what happens is the _E. coli_ infection would cause
diarrhea and cramps. Usually little or no fever is present and the
illness is resolved in 5 to 10 days,'' Schulte said. But in
vulnerable populations -- young children and the elderly -- a toxin
produced by the bacteria begins to destroy red blood cells and damage
the kidneys, she said.
"There is a period between when somebody has the diarrhea and then
several weeks later develops the HUS," Schulte said. "The toxin takes
some time to do its work."
3 of the children at that hospital are in critical condition. A 4th
is in guarded condition, according to hospital officials. All, ages 2
to 6, attended the Orlando fair. The 1st arrived Sun, 20 Mar 2005.
A 5th child with suspected HUS was admitted Wed afternoon, 23 Mar
2005, Dixit said.
"We have one child on a ventilator and dialysis that we're extremely
concerned about," Dixit said. About 90 percent of HUS victims
recover. 10 percent either die or have permanent kidney damage, he
said.
"It's not uncommon to recover from HUS and years later show signs of
kidney damage," said Dixit, who is medical director of Florida
Children's Kidney Center. "The long-term is the unknown and the
biggest worry."
Across town, a child who attended the Florida Strawberry Festival in
Plant City was fighting for life at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for
Children and Women in Orlando. Hospital officials there would not
release the child's age, gender or condition.
Orange County health officials say an unrelated adult at Arnold
Palmer Hospital, who also attended the strawberry festival, may be a
7th case of HUS. Meanwhile, a team of state and Orange and
Hillsborough county health officials urgently sought to identify and
contain the source of the infection.
"Both of these places had multiple points where people could be near
animals,"said Bill Toth of the Orange County Health Department. "We
have not yet ruled food out either."
Contaminated meat, unpasteurized milk, and human sewage are common
sources of the infection. The CDC estimates 73 000 cases of infection
resulting in 61 deaths each year can be attributed to the infection.
About 2 to 7 percent of the cases lead to HUS complications. Petting
zoos also have been linked to the bacterium, with a recent outbreak
in California and more than 100 children falling ill after attending
a county fair in North Carolina in late 2004.
A Plant City-based farm show called Ag-Venture, which brought more
than a dozen goats, sheep, cows and chickens to the Florida
Strawberry Festival and the Central Florida Fair, is one of the
common denominators in the Orlando outbreak.
Tom Umiker, who developed Ag-Venture in 1996 to educate city kids
about farm life, has offered his animals to the health department for
testing. He said they have told him that would be premature at this
stage of the investigation.
"We need to be mindful to research this thing thoroughly and find the
source as quickly as possible," Umiker said. "I hope I'm not the
source, but I've got to be one of the sources you look at, there's no
doubt about it."
Carina Blackmore, the state's public health veterinarian, said the
infectious organism can be shed by healthy animals and that testing
likely would involve a whole herd. However, health officials have not
ruled out food contamination. The investigators are trying to
determine whether someone who handled the animals also was involved
in food preparation.
There also is something of a mystery because none of the children
have tested positive for _E. coli_ or any other known cause of HUS.
But 3 have tested positive for _Staphylococcus aureus_, which has
never been linked to the syndrome.

The following link provides preliminary and lay information on an HUS
outbreak in children associated with visiting a petting zoo at a
Florida fair.
<http://www.local6.com/news/4309606/detail.html>
As a background, the lay article mentions association of HUS with _E.
coli_, and this is of course must be clarified to mean
enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) (or more specifically,
Shiga-toxigenic _E. coli_ (STEC)), of which _E coli_ O157 is the
archetypal member. Other serotypes (O26, O111, etc) are also EHECs.
The lay article states that _Staphylococcus aureus_ can lead to the
HUS condition. I am uncertain of the source of this info (PubMed
search string of keywords 'Staphylococcus' and 'HUS' retrieved 6
irrelevant hits). Certainly, HUS association with pneumococcus (_S.
pneumoniae_) and meningococcus (_Neisseria meningitidis_) has been
documented in peer-reviewed literature.
Significantly, diarrhea as a clinically antecedent event was absent
from this lay report. If not an oversight, this may indicate _E.
coli_ O157 is less likely to be involved.

Joe Shea <http://www.american-reporter.com> for submitting versions
of this story.
Most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are associated with _E. coli_
O157:H7 infections (1) that present with usually non-febrile diarrhea
and abdominal pain which progresses to bloody diarrhea. HUS can be a
complication of this infection related to the production of Shiga
toxin and is associated with anemia with evidence of red cell
destruction (hemolysis), a low platelet count, and abnormal kidney
function.
Endothelial cell injury appears to be the primary event in the
pathogenesis of the disorder. The endothelial damage triggers a
cascade of events culminating in microvascular lesions with
platelet-fibrin hyaline microthrombi, which occlude arterioles and
capillaries. The platelet aggregation results in a consumptive
thrombocytopenia.
Some cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome can also be caused by
non-O157:H7 toxin-producing strains of _E. coli_. Other cases can be
caused by diverse etiologies, infectious or not. These include
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ infection, AIDS, a variety of viruses
including varicella, chemotherapy (such as mitomycin C), and
immunosuppressive agents (such as cyclosporin), and certain
malignancies such as prostatic and gastric. Some cases of HUS are
familial. Recurrences of HUS have been reported.
As pointed out by Dr. Snider, diarrhea is not specifically mentioned
related to the HUS cases directly, and this might suggest a
nonenteric cause, but the strong link with the petting zoo (although
the major reservoir, cows are not mentioned), a clear risk factor for
O157:H7 suggests that, with further investigation, _E. coli_ O157:H7
will be shown to be the cause.
Part of the problem may be in the identification of O157:H7 _E. coli_
strains. This organism typically does not ferment sorbitol, and
lactose-fermenting colonies shown to be _E. coli_ that are selected
for being sorbitol-negative are tested for the somatic O157 antigen
by latex agglutination. Rarely, a O157:H7 strain is
sorbitol-fermenting and, more commonly, other strains that produce
Shiga toxin, such as _E. coli_ that contain an alternative somatic
antigen, will cause HUS. In Germany, non-O157 strains may cause more
HUS than O157 strains (2).
ProMED awaits more information regarding the etiology of the HUS.
