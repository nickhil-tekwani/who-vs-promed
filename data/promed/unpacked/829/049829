New, dangerous potato blight found in Estonia
---------------------------------------------
A new, more dangerous and aggressive form of potato blight has reached
Estonia, according to a doctoral dissertation at the University of Life
Sciences. Eve Runno-Paurson's examined the Estonian population of the
disease-causing agent and found that rather than a less dangerous form, the
organism was reproducing sexually.

The blight, which caused the Irish potato famine 150 years ago and is still
a costly problem, has been striking fields a month earlier and showing
fungicide resistance. It also underwent a change during this period to
having the capacity for sexual reproduction.

Genetic fingerprinting showed that the Estonian population was unique and
diverse, with most of the local genotypes not found elsewhere, but was
similar in some respects to Russian and Nordic populations, leading to the
conclusion that genetic [sexual] transfer is fairly strong. That is despite
the fact that Estonian producers grow most of their seed potatoes
themselves, with only 5 per cent imported from the Netherlands.

The dissertation pointed out the importance of crop cycles with a 4-year
fallow period.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen
can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. PLB is spread by
plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind, and water. Disease
management generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed tubers and
crops. Seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries
and are an important part of PLB management. Crop rotation with non-hosts
may reduce available inoculum. Considerable variation in aggressiveness
between different pathogen strains has been observed.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide because more
virulent strains continue to emerge. 2 mating types of the fungus exist, A1
and A2. Where both are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as
asexually, leading to even fitter strains with higher fungicide resistances
and increased yield losses. A1 was the first to spread worldwide. A2 began
to spread later and is currently present in northern and Central America,
parts of Asia, as well as in northern Europe where a dramatic increase in
the frequency of A2 strains is being recorded recently in some parts. The
finding of the A2 type in Estonia severely increases the risk posed by late
blight to national agriculture.
