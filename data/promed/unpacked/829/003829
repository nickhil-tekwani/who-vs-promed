aged 69 years subsequently had neuroinvasive illness, and 4 persons -- aged
22, 51, 52, and 57 years -- subsequently had West Nile fever. In New
Mexico, the 1st reported human WNV infection in 2004 was in a PVD; in
Arizona, 3 of the 1st 7 reported human WNV infections of 2004 were in PVDs.
Dead birds and equines

[The above report is supplemented by a figure showing the location of the 8
states reporting cases of human WNV infection in relation to the 23 states
reporting non-human cases of WNV infection only, and, the remaining states
still to report cases of WNV in 2004. During the past 7 days, although the
number of human cases has increased from 57 to 78, there has been no
increase in the number of states reporting human cases of WNV infection. -
