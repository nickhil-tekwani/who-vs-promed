[Some wild migratory waterbirds may contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses and may be playing a role in the HPAI epidemic of 2020-2021, which is the largest that has occurred in Europe. Dabbling ducks (_Anas_ spp.) are likely to tolerate some HPAI virus and thus may manage to migrate while infected. Many duck species migrate from the taiga and tundra zones of Russia to the European territory in autumn and return in spring. Others move between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. - Mod.PMB
