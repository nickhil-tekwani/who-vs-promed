FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT, WHEAT - CANADA: NEW STRAIN

The Canadian Wheat Board has announced it's offering a fusarium
program to help producers with fusarium-infected spring wheat. Senior
Manager of Quality Control Charray Dutka explains parts of Manitoba
and Alberta both experienced high fusarium levels.

She says tolerances in the program this year [2009] will be tighter
than in the past, reflecting grain customer preferences as the
disease is evolving. Customers are showing a heightened awareness of
food safety issues, and as a result, the Board had to adjust the
fusarium limits in the program.

Dutka notes a more virulent strain of fusarium is becoming more
prevalent. This strain is producing a much higher concentration of
the harmful toxin known as "DON."

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi include _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella
nivalis_ var. _nivalis_, and _Microdochium majus_. FHB can also
affect barley, oats, rye, maize and some grasses, but pathogens
affecting these hosts may be different phylogenetic species or
strains which are often limited to particular regions of the world.
FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent in small grain crops and
reduces the grade of harvested grain.

The disease is favoured by humid conditions during flowering and
early stages of kernel development. Symptoms are premature bleaching
of infected spikelets and the production of orange, spore-bearing
structures at the base of the glumes. During wet weather, there may
be whitish, occasionally pinkish, fluffy fungal growth on infected
heads in the field. Diseased spikelets can contain visibly affected
kernels. The fungi may also cause seedling blight.

Depending on the fungal species or strains involved, as well as on
environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, scab
infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins. The
produced mycotoxins include, for example, DON (also called
vomitoxin), which can affect stock and may lead to reduced feed
consumption or feed refusal. The total crop may be lost if grain is
rejected because of toxin levels. Disease management includes timely
fungicide applications and crop varieties with reduced
susceptibility. The emergence of the new strain in Canada can be
expected to pose an increased risk of FHB-associated losses for North
American grain producers.
