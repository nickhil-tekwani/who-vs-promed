Researchers have identified a new bacterial disease in Muskellunge (musky,
_Esox masquinongy_) caught in Lake St Clair, Michigan's most popular
fishing lake.
The disease is called piscirickettsia and it was first was identified in
1989 in farmed salmon in Chile. Its first sign usually is the appearance of
small white lesions on the skin, according to the Paris-based Office
International des Epizooties (OIE), which monitors animal diseases
worldwide. The disease can damage a fish's kidneys, liver, and spleen.
Until now, the illness has been little seen in US waters. But Mohamed
Faisal, professor of aquatic and animal medicine at Michigan State
University, now reports cases in muskellunge caught in Lake St Clair.
Muskies grow up to 40 pounds in the lake. The fish disease is not believed
to be harmful to humans, Faisal said. But he said more study is needed to
determine its effect on the fish."We also have to find out how widespread
it is," Faisal said. "It can be harmful to the fish. The lesions are also
on their reproductive organs. It depends on their resistance."
Mike Thomas, a state biologist assigned to Lake St Clair, first discovered
the lesions 2 years ago when he caught a musky in trap nets. But he was
unsure what the quarter-size (about 2cm diameter. - Mod.SH) sores were.
When he found more muskies last year with the sores, he asked Faisal to
diagnose the disease.
"It's an emerging disease," Faisal said. "We have it only in several
places, one in California and one here in Michigan. It's always like this
with a new disease. I guess it will show up in other states."
Faisal said some deaths of fish in hatcheries in southern California and
salmon in Canada have been linked to piscirickettsia. And in Chile,
millions of young salmon raised on farms died from the disease in 1989. But
the bacteria's effects on St Clair muskies are not yet known. Thomas said
some anglers might be unaware that they have caught a musky with
piscirickettsia.
"It's very likely a fisherman may look at these and think they are a
healing lamprey scar," Thomas said. "The lamprey scars have teeth marks
dragged across the skin, and it's flat. But the piscirickettsia sores are
raised, and some of the lesions have fungus associated with them. "We have
to look at this more and see how prevalent it is." Faisal said he doubts
that eating an infected muskie would hurt humans. "I don't want to alarm
the public over something they shouldn't be alarmed about," he said. Few
anglers eat muskies, anyway, said Greg Van Assche, a fishing guide who says
he has caught more than 3000 muskies in his lifetime.
"They're not good to eat," said the resident of Macomb County's Harrison
Township near Mount Clemens. "We throw them all back unless they're a trophy."
