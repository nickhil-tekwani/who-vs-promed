_Aedes albopictus_ in Africa
----------------------------
[A recent publication (Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 2003, 17,
343-346) reports that] during routine malaria surveys in November 2001
on Bioko island (formerly Fernando Poo), Equatorial Guinea, well
established populations were found of the Asian mosquito _Aedes
albopictus_ breeding in tires and various water containers.
This is the 4th time this very important dengue vector has been
reported from Africa. The first record was in 1989 when immature
stages were found in imported tires in South Africa, but it apparently
did not become established. Then in September 1991 during entomological
surveys in the Delta State of Nigeria following a yellow fever epidemic,
_Ae. albopictus_ larvae were found to be common in a variety of domestic
container habitats, this constituting the first known breeding of the
mosquito in Africa. It now seems to be widespread in Nigeria.
Although the breeding places and adult biting habits of _Aedes aegypti_
are very similar to those of _Ae. albopictus_, _Ae. aegypti_ surveys
from 1950-1995 in Cameroon detected no _Ae. albopictus_. However, in
October 1999, biting adults of _Ae. albopictus_ were encountered in
southern Cameroon, and surveys in October and November 2000 found
breeding populations in all 5 towns in the Douala and Yaounde districts
that were sampled. Most common breeding sites were tires.
The presence of _Ae. albopictus_ in Africa has serious implications for
the transmission of indigenous arboviruses. For example, laboratory and
field studies indicate that it might be a potential vector of the viruses
of chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, West Nile, and more importantly,
yellow fever.
In addition it is a very efficient dengue vector, especially as it can
transmit the virus transovarially (i.e. vertical transmission) and at a
higher rate than _Ae. aegypti_. Because _Ae. albopictus_ feeds on other
mammals and birds in addition to man, this might well make it a "viral
bridge" between human and non-human hosts for diseases such as West Nile
fever.
Of equal or greater importance is that, because _Ae. albopictus_ breeds
in both forest and urban situations, it might serve as a "bridge vector"
in the transmission of urban and forest cycles of yellow fever.
The lack of records from other African countries is not surprising
considering the vast size of Africa. Because of the absence of routine
inspection of imported cargoes (e.g. tires) for mosquitoes, and the
relatively few scientists who might detect the presence of this mosquito,
it seems very likely that _Ae. albopictus_ has already become established in
other sub-Saharan countries.
