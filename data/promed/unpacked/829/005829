Rapid reporting system for meningitis W135: 2a: P1.2, 5: update
---------------------------------------------
The enhanced surveillance system for meningococcal meningitis W135: 2a:
P1.2, 5 set up among several European countries after an epidemic of this
strain among travellers to the haj in 2000 (1-5) received reports of 20
cases of infection with this or compatible strains between 31 Mar and 27
Apr 2001. Cases were reported by France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
and the United Kingdom (UK). Independently, the World Health Organization
reported 4 laboratory confirmed cases in Norway (no deaths), 2 of whom
had a connection with haj pilgrims (6).
In France, meningococci of strain W135 were isolated from the blood of a 36
year old woman admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms and from the
blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a 3 week old baby girl. Both
patients survived. Multilocus DNA fingerprinting (MLDF) analysis showed
markers of electrophoretic type (ET)-37 complex in both isolates. The woman
had no known link to the haj, but the babyÂ’s grandfather had visited Mecca
for the 2001 haj (4-8 March). _Neisseria meningitidis_ of strain W135: 2a:
P1.2, 5 was isolated from the CSF of a 2 year old girl who was admitted to
hospital with meningitis but had no known link to the haj. MLDF typing
showed markers of ET-37 complex.
In Germany, meningococci of strain W135: 2a: P1.2 were isolated from a
woman aged 39 years with a haematological-oncological disease, who
presented with meningitis. The woman had no known link to the haj.
The reference laboratory in the Netherlands received one isolate of _N.
meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5. No further epidemiological details are
currently available, and any link of the patient to the haj has yet to be
confirmed. The laboratory also received an isolate of _N. meningitidis_ of
strain W135: NT: P1.6 from a woman aged 19 years with no known association
with the haj.
In Spain, meningococci of strain W135: 2a: P1.2,5 were isolated from the
blood of a 36 old woman with meningitis and sepsis. The clonal line of the
strain is to be determined by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A
link to the 2001 haj has yet to be established.
In the UK, 8 cases of _N. meningitidis_ strain W135: 2a: P1.2,5 were
reported in association with the haj. Two patients died. None of the
patients was a pilgrim; 4 were household contacts and 2 were non-household
contacts. Two further cases of the same strain were associated with travel
to the Middle East other than at the time of the
haj. Three further cases of _N. meningitidis_ strain W135: 2a: P1.2,5 were
reported, but the patients had no apparent link to the haj.
