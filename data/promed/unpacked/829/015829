[A media report relating to this incident said that West Nile virus had been detected in a snowy owl at Magdeburg Zoo. See: https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/sachsen-anhalt/magdeburg/magdeburg/west-nil-virus-infektion-schneeeule-zoo-100.html (in German).

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: "Since last week's update, and as of 13 Jul 2022, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries reported 2 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection and no deaths related to WNV infections.

Cases were reported by Greece (1) and Italy (1). EU-neighboring countries reported no human cases of WNV infection. There were no deaths related to WNV infections.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, no outbreaks among equids and 5 outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries.

Outbreaks among birds have been reported by Italy (4) and Germany (1)".

The presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Europe was first recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in Southern countries. In general, WNV circulates silently in resident and migratory birds present in Europe, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and some avian hosts over a long period (Gould et al. 2006 EID 12: 549-555; https://doi.org/10.3201%2Feid1204.051010). However, there are sporadic outbreaks or isolated cases in native bird species. - Mod.PMB
