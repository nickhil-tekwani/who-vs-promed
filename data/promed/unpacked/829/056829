- South Korea
South Korea has seen its biggest surge in new coronavirus cases in 49 days with a new cluster emerging at a retail logistics centre west of Seoul.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) says it confirmed 40 new cases up to midnight on Tuesday [26 May 2020].
At least 36 cases have been linked to the Coupang warehouse, which was closed for disinfection on Monday [25 May 2020]. All 3600 people who work there are being tested for the virus. Coupang enjoyed a surge of business as South Koreans stayed indoors although some of its workers complained about conditions.

- Brazil
A new study is warning that Brazil could be facing a death toll of 125,000 people by early August while the WHO has warned the Americas are the new epicentre.

- Switzerland
The Swiss government said public and private events of up to 300 people and spontaneous gatherings of up to 30 people would be allowed again from [6 Jun 2020], further easing restrictions as the COVID-19 pandemic shows signs of ebbing. The government will decide on [24 Jun 2020] whether to also lift a ban on events with up to 1000 people. Big events with more than 1000 participants will not be possible until the end of August [2020], the government said in a statement on Wednesday [27 May 2020]. The government said earlier on Wednesday it wants to restore free movement of people with other Schengen zone member countries by [6 Jul 2020].

Moscow is ready to resume non-food trade and allow dry-cleaners and repair shops to open from [1 Jun 2020], as it eases its coronavirus-related lockdown, the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has told President Vladimir Putin. Russia said on Wednesday [27 May 2020], 161 people with the coronavirus had died in the past 24 hours, bringing its nationwide death toll from the novel coronavirus to 3968 and its overall case tally had reached 370 680.

- Pandemic creating 'lockdown generation' as one in 6 youths stop work: UN
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused surging unemployment worldwide, but has hit young workers especially hard, forcing more than one in 6 people aged under 29 to stop working, the UN said.
"I don't think it is giving way to hyperbole to talk about the danger of a lockdown generation," International Labour Organization chief Guy Ryder told a virtual press conference, warning that the impact on young people's work opportunities could "last a decade or longer."

- Oman
Oman will on Friday [29 May 2020] end a lockdown of its Muscat governorate -- which includes the capital -- that has been in place since [10 Apr 2020] as the sultanate eases its coronavirus containment measures, the state news agency reported.
It said a state committee had also ordered government entities to ensure at least 50 percent of employees are working from their offices from [31 May 2020].

- EU
The European Commission proposed a 750 billion euro [about USD 826 billion] recovery fund to reboot the European economy that has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, a top official said.
Paolo Gentiloni, the EU Economic Affairs Commissioner, in a tweet, hailed the proposal as a "European breakthrough" that would "tackle an unprecedented crisis".

- France
The French government banned treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a controversial and potentially harmful drug.
The move came after 2 French advisory bodies and the World Health Organization warned this week that the drug -- a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus -- had been shown to be potentially dangerous in several studies.
Under the new French rules, the drug can be used only in clinical trials to test its efficacy against the virus.

- Indonesia
Indonesia reported 686 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of infections in the Southeast Asian country to 23 851, a health ministry official said.

- Philippines
The Philippines' health ministry reported 18 new coronavirus deaths and 380 additional infections, the highest single-day increase in cases in more than 7 weeks.

- Finland
Finland's number of unemployed job seekers nearly doubled in April [2020] to 433 100 from 229 700 a year earlier, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment said.
The number of jobseekers increased by 124 000 in April from the previous month, it said.
The ministry's numbers, based on registered jobseekers at Finland's employment offices, includes those who have been temporarily laid off due to the coronavirus outbreak.

- Singapore
Singapore's health ministry reported 533 new coronavirus cases, taking its total to 32 876.

- Bulgaria
Bulgaria will allow restaurants, bars, and cafes to reopen at full capacity on [1 Jun 2020] as the Balkan country further eased restrictions imposed in mid-March to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Health Minister Kiril Ananiev approved the decision, and also allowed the resumption of cultural and entertainment events, including theatres, concerts, and stage performances. Dance classes could also resume, using up to 30 percent of their indoor capacity and up to 50 percent of the outdoor capacity.
According to the order, however, discos, piano bars, and night bars must stay closed as the country remains under a declared epidemic situation until [14 Jun 2020].

- United Arab Emirates
Cinemas, gyms, educational institutes, and entertainment attractions have been allowed to reopen in Dubai, days after an extension on a nationwide curfew was imposed in the United Arab Emirates.
There will be no restrictions on movement or business operations between 6am and 11pm local time, Dubai's Media office said, adding that social distancing rules must be observed.

- Pakistan
Pakistan's government is mulling a renewed lockdown after its move to lift many coronavirus restrictions over the past 2 weeks led to a surge in new cases.
Health minister Zafar Mirza said there had been a "severe rush" to markets and people were behaving as if "the virus had been eradicated" since the curbs were relaxed.

- Major economies prepare massive new stimulus packages
The European Union and Japan are preparing massive new stimulus packages to get their economies moving after weeks of coronavirus lockdown.
Japan's measures are due to be finalised at a cabinet meeting later on Wednesday [27 May 2020].

- New Zealand
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is expecting a draft blueprint for resuming travel [with Australia] will be ready by early June [2020].
"We are working to move on this as quickly as we can," Ardern told reporters this morning [27 May 2020]. "We are both very keen on it ... across both sides of the ditch."
The idea is to create a travel bubble that would allow Australians and New Zealanders to travel to each other's countries without the need for a 14-day coronavirus quarantine.

- Singapore
Singapore has set up vending machines at community centres around the island to dispense free, reusable face masks.
The city-state made face masks compulsory on [14 Apr 2020] and gave out free masks to every household.

- Australia
A 30-year-old man with underlying health conditions has died in Queensland, becoming the youngest victim of the coronavirus in Australia.
The authorities are tracing a possible link between the man and the Ruby Princess cruise ship which triggered the biggest cluster of cases in the country after it docked in Sydney in March [2020]. His partner is also showing symptoms of the disease.
Some 103 people in Australia have now died from coronavirus.

- Americas
The WHO's regional Latin American health authority has warned that the new coronavirus is "still accelerating" in Brazil, Peru, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, with the Americas becoming the new epicentre of the global pandemic.

[4] WHO situation report 128 (as of 27 May 2020)
Date: Wed 27 May 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200527-covid-19-sitrep-128.pdf

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 27 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published a case-control protocol for the assessment of risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in health workers. The primary objective of this study is to characterize and assess the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers exposed to COVID-19 patients (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/assessment-of-risk-factors-for-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)-in-health-workers-protocol-for-a-case-control-study).

- A scientific brief has been published by WHO investigating any association between smoking and an increased risk for COVID-19. At the time of this review, the available evidence suggests that in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and death (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/smoking-and-covid-19).

- WHO has published a population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19 virus infection. This protocol was designed to investigate the extent of infection, as determined by positive blood tests in the general population, in any country in which COVID-19 virus infection has been reported (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/population-based-age-stratified-seroepidemiological-investigation-protocol-for-covid-19-virus-infection).

- Elements of the COVID-19 [Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan] (SPRP) have been updated and are reviewed on a regular basis by WHO in consultation of all six regional offices.

Subject in focus: Using social media listening to get ahead of the infodemic
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic is now a ubiquitous topic in global online conversations and "covid" ranks as the 2nd most used word in all public English-language social media posts published in the past 30 days. The term received 55 million public mentions and was only surpassed by the word "people", with 57 million mentions.

The task of reaching global audiences with trustworthy and timely information is challenging in this tsunami of information -- but more important than ever. The COVID-19 information ecosystem is sensitive to new "conversation inputs", such as news stories, influential statements, or new research findings. These inputs have a measurable impact on online conversations and can affect people's behaviour and emotions.

The WHO Infodemics management pillar has been monitoring global English-language conversations on COVID-19 to detect early signals of growing interest and public engagement with constantly emerging narratives around COVID-19. Regardless of whether these signals stem from trusted or unreliable sources they can be used to anticipate and intervene: what questions need answering or what myths need busting.

In early April [2020], the weekly monitoring detected a 98% rise in the number of global posts that engaged with the conversation on COVID-19 immunity.

The publication of research data on South Korean patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 following post-recovery tests generated an increase in the volume of mentions, questions, and speculation over a possible "reactivation" of the virus. The linguistic analysis that complements the weekly study unpacked the emotional response expressed by English-speaking users, revealing a 137% jump in social media posts using language that is representative of fear.

The analysis of 233 300 social media posts that mentioned immunity-related keywords in the context of COVID-19 between 23 March and 10 May 2020 suggested that the conversation had been rising by a daily average of 12% between 7 to 17 Apr 2020 (Figure1, highlighted in yellow -- available at the source URL above). On 18 Apr 2020, news media reported that WHO was "not sure whether the presence of antibodies in blood gives full protection against reinfection." On this day, 31% of the public social media conversation on immunity was driven by the World Health Organization's own communication.

Following this statement, public concern over the possibility of COVID-19 re-infection -- as inferred from the online conversation -- decreased by 16% on average for the following 6 days. A 2nd surge in conversation was then driven by WHO's follow up statement on the clear "lack of evidence" of earned immunity after infection on 25 Apr 2020. On this day this statement was issued, 74% of the social media conversation on immunity was driven by the WHO's communication.

The data suggest that the introduction of a new input into the COVID-19 information ecosystem, on the topic of 're-infection/immunity' has been influenced by proactive WHO infodemic intervention, filling the potential information gap. After an average weekly rise of 51% of social media mentions of immunity over the 2 weeks that preceded WHO's communication, the intervention helped to reverse the trend during the 2 weeks that followed (-30%). And even when immunity-related content did not specifically mention WHO, a decline in conversation could be detected: from +44% before the statement to -4% after the statement.

WHO's timely communication in response to a topic of growing concern has helped to de-escalate speculation around immunity and reinfection on social media -- even before the release of information that eventually claimed that the cases of re-infection detected in South Korea were false positives.

EPI-WIN has applied this social media listening methodology to public health and has detected invaluable insights, inspiring new ways of thinking and communicating risk during health emergencies. The general approach to analysis was presented in the recent COVID-19 Situation Report number 100 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200429-sitrep-100-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bbfbf3d1_6)
