A fatal cattle-wasting disease has been discovered in Western Australia 12
years after it was last seen in the state. Bovine Johne's Disease was
confirmed yesterday in a beef herd near Albany, about 400 km south of Perth.
It is the first case of its kind in Western Australia since 1994, but
Animal Health Australia said the disease was known to have infected about
1350 cattle herds in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
The disease is not known to affect humans. Meat and milk that have been
properly processed are safe for consumption.
WA Agriculture Department chief veterinary officer Peter Buckman said the
disease spread through bacteria shed in faeces, which further contaminated
the pasture. It eventually kills the cattle.
While WA will not immediately lose its BJD-free status -- it was named a
BJD-free zone in 1999 -- all at-risk properties will be tested and all
cattle removed from infected properties.
"It would also require wide-scale surveillance testing to prove the disease
was no longer present in the state," Dr Buckman said.
A plan would be put in place to determine whether eradication of the
disease was technically possible and cost effective.
"Tracing and testing to evaluate whether eradication is feasible and cost
effective will take months to complete," he said.

[Of course, it is never a good thing for a disease to show up after being
absent for 12 years. Johne's disease is a chronic disease resulting in
diarrhea, significant weight loss, and reduced herd productivity and caused
by _Mycobacterium paratuberculosis _. It is hard to eradicate from dairy
herds, which it most commonly affects, because of difficulties in testing,
screening, surveillance and economics -- as the last few comments in the
article allude to.
For many years now there has been a heated controversy over the
relationship among Johne's disease, _M. paratuberculosis_, and Crohn's
disease in humans. For more information, see the University of Wisconsin's
