Abstract
In September 2018, African swine fever [ASF] in wild boars was detected in Belgium. We used ASF-infected spleen samples to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the virus. The causative strain belongs to genotype II, and its closest relatives are viruses previously isolated in Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, and European Russia.

[The route of introduction of the ASF virus into the restricted area in region d'Etalle, south east Belgium, has not yet been established.

According to the updated information available on the web-site of Belgium's AFSCA (Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain): Since 13 Sep 2018 and as of Mon 12 Nov 2018, a total of 161 wild boar have been found ASF-infected in the d'Etalle region.

For updated and detailed description of the measures applied and of the delineation of the corresponding zones/regions, see post 20181105.6127887. The disease has been circulating within a limited region, among wild boar exclusively. - Mod.AS
