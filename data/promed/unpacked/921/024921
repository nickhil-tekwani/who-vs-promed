Rogue zucchini seeds are suspected to be behind several cases of illness in England.

Zucchinis, also called courgettes, contain a naturally occurring compound. When this is at a high enough level, it can lead to symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea.

Four families in Castle Acre, Norfolk reported feeling unwell after eating produce they had grown, according to the BBC.

The Sun newspaper reported a woman needed hospital treatment after being poisoned by courgettes she had grown. They came from Unwins seeds and parent company. Westland told The Sun that it had temporarily suspended shipments as a precaution while it investigated the issue.

Another firm, Mr Fothergill's, recalled a batch of Courgette Zucchini containing seeds producing bitter tasting fruits. The affected item has Batch code I on the back of the packet.

A statement from Mr Fothergill's said such a problem is extremely rare, but not unknown. It advised people not to eat the zucchini and discard the plants.

"It can come from issues with cross-pollination in the seed production cycle and is untraceable before growing out again for harvest. Please be assured we take every precaution to maintain the quality of our seed stock. In this instance, we have withdrawn the rogue batch from all sales outlets and in-house stocks," said the company.

"We recommend if you have grown this variety from a packet with the batch code I you do not ingest the fruits without taste testing for bitterness. A taste-test is a safe thing to do to detect whether you have an affected plant, which will be extremely bitter; slice the top off the fruit and simply touch your tongue on it."

All remaining stock in the warehouse, unpacked seeds, and seeds in retail outlets are being recovered and destroyed.

The bitter taste of some fruit is caused by an over-production of plant defense chemicals called cucurbitacins. This is mainly a problem in courgettes and summer squash and is caused primarily by a mutation within the plant. The problem is more likely when plants are grown from saved seeds, where inadvertent cross-pollination may have occurred, according to the Royal Horticultural Society.

High temperatures, dryness and other stresses when growing can also lead to an increase in cucurbitacins.

Mr Fothergill's has tracked the issue to one batch of seed, which came from a grower with "meticulous" growing and husbandry routines.

"Normally, cucurbitacins exist in very small amounts, but genetic issues in the production cycle very occasionally deliver larger amounts into the seed, which cause the bitter flavor. It's impossible to test for in the seed itself, and we have never had a batch of seed like this in our 40 plus year history."

[Any natural product can occasionally over or under produce certain enzymes, co-enzymes, toxicities, proteins etc under the various growing conditions which may occur, especially in a garden or field plot. It may be less likely to happen in a controlled growing house, but as plants are living, they may occasionally have rogue cells, just as humans and animals have rogue cells we may call cancer. In the plant's case, it might be called survival.

Our own protective mechanisms should kick in. If it is bitter, or sour, or some other off taste, then it should not be consumed, as this is the body's natural warning to not continue consuming the product, whatever it is.

Cucurbitacins have been reported as highly toxic compounds, and instances of severe poisoning and death in sheep and cattle consuming bitter fruits of Cucumis and Cucurbita are well documented. The range of toxicity of Cucurbitacins based on a few in-vivo toxicity reports, has been found to be between 2 -12.5 mg/kg. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4441156/

The Cucurbitaceae, also called cucurbits or the gourd family, are a plant family consisting of about 965 species in around 95 genera,[2] of which the most important to humans are:

_Cucurbita_ - squash, pumpkin, zucchini, some gourds
_Lagenaria_ - calabash, and others that are inedible
_Citrullus_ - watermelon (_C. lanatus_, _C. colocynthis_) and others
_Cucumis_ - cucumber (_C. sativus_), various melon
_Momordica_ - bitter melon
_Luffa_ - the common name is also luffa, sometimes spelled loofah (when fully ripened, 2 species of this fibrous fruit are the source of the loofah scrubbing sponge)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbitaceae [2] Christenhusz, M. J. M. & Byng, J. W. (2016). "The number of known plants species in the world and its annual increase." Phytotaxa. 261 (3): 201-217. doi:10.11646/phytotaxa.261.3.1.

Cucurbitacins are tetracyclic terpenes with steroidal structures isolated from plants of the family Cucurbitaceae such as pumpkins, gourds, and cucumbers. Ancient peoples used cucurbits medicinally, but they also recognized their toxic properties. Medicinal uses included emetics [such as what may have happened in the article - Mod.TG], narcotics, and anti-malarials.

20 cucurbitacins have been isolated from the approximately 965 known species (in approximately 95 genera) of Cucurbitaceae. By the 1950s, the research groups of P. R. Enslin (South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria) and David Lavie (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) had isolated 17 cucurbitacins and studied their properties. Lavie's group showed cucurbitacin E (also called alpha-elaterin) has antitumor properties.

The 2 most common cucurbitacins are B and E. Cucurbitacin B is extremely toxic when ingested; E is not as toxic but is still harmful if swallowed.

Cucurbitacins are also known as "bitter principles" of cucurbits. In a recent article, Logan Kistler at the University of Warwick (Coventry, UK), George H. Perry at Penn State (University Park), and colleagues at several other institutions reported, despite the fruits' bitter taste, prehistoric animals such as mastodons and mammoths ate wild cucurbits and distributed their seeds in their excrement. As the ancient beasts died out, the cucurbits also faded because their primary means of seed dispersal was gone.

Humans came to the rescue. They found that they could eat cucurbit seeds, probably by washing off the bitter constituents. Later, they domesticated squashes and gourds and, by selecting the less bitter seeds, were able to produce more palatable cucurbits. Thus, humans and cucurbits evolved together https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/cucurbitacins.html. - Mod.TG
