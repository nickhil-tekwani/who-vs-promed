Dengue in Dominican Republic
----------------------------
Dengue fever is an endemic disease, with occasional outbreaks in the
Dominican Republic, as is the case in almost any other country in the
Caribbean. According to the PAHO/WHO report; in 1999, 259 565 cases were
reported from Latin America and 1020 from the Dominican Republic; in 2000,
until circa week 32 these figures had increased to 236 186 and 663
respectively. The National Control Program, [operated by the National
Center for Tropical Diseases Control of the Dominican Republic, has
confirmed circulation during this year of dengue fever virus types I, II,
III and IV. Prevention is based on community participation for reducing
domestic breeding of _Aedes aegypti_. Insecticides are reserved for
epidemic situations.

particularly noteworthy. - Mod.CP
