The WHO says that a confirmed cholera case has been found inside one of the UN 'Protection of Civilians' site in Juba, as well as several other suspected cases. "On 1 Jun 2015, a cholera case was confirmed in UN House PoC after _Vibrio cholerae_ [serotype] inaba was isolated from 1 of 5 patient samples. Overall, 13 suspect cases have been investigated in UN House PoC while 2 suspect cases have been reported outside the PoC from Hai Referendum in Juba," reads a WHO early warning report. WHO says the national cholera taskforce has been "activated" to respond to the case and the possibility of an outbreak.

According to the health report, a cluster of 4 suspect cholera cases was initially reported on 26 May 2015 following investigations conducted jointly by the Ministry of Health with support from WHO and IMC in UN House PoC. "1 of the 4 suspect cases was eventually confirmed to have cholera after _Vibrio cholerae_ was isolated at the National Public Health Laboratory," WHO stated.

The global health organization also reported that testing is underway on samples from 9 other suspected cases.

[Juba is the capital and largest city of the Republic of South Sudan. It also serves as the capital of Central Equatoria, 1 of the 10 states of South Sudan and can be seen on a map at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Homa Bay county)

At least 10 people died of cholera and 134 others were hospitalized in Kenya's western county of Homa Bay on Tue, 9 Jun 2015, as the outbreak of the disease continues in the East African nation.

County Director of Medical Services, Gerald Akeche, said the victims, among whom are women and children, have been admitted to local health facilities. He cited poor latrine coverage and hawking cooked food in the region for the fresh upsurge of the disease.

"Majority of the residents in rural parts of Kenya have ignored basic health education like treatment of water before drinking and washing hands after visiting toilets," Akeche said.

In May 2015, cholera killed 72 people and hospitalized 3223 across the country, according to the health ministry. A total of 11 counties were affected by the outbreak including Nairobi, Nakuru, Migori, Homa Bay and Mombasa. Nakuru and Nairobi were the worst affected, with 16 deaths each.

[Homa Bay County is a county in the former Nyanza Province of Kenya. Its capital and largest town is Homa Bay and it can be found on a map of southwestern Kenya at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homa_Bay_County.

As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
