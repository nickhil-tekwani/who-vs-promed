["Lumpy skin disease (LSD) was first seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957, it entered Kenya, associated with an outbreak of sheep pox. In 1970, LSD spread north into the Sudan, and by 1974, it had spread west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and the Cameroon, with reported mortality rates in affected cattle of 20 [percent].

The occurrence of LSD north of the Sahara Desert and outside the African continent was confirmed for the 1st time in Egypt and Israel between 1988 and 1989 and was reported again in 2006. In the past decade, LSD occurrences have been reported in the Middle Eastern, European, and west Asian regions.

Lumpy skin disease outbreaks tend to be sporadic, depending upon animal movements, immune status, and wind and rainfall patterns affecting vector populations. The principal method of transmission is thought to be mechanical by arthropod vector.

LSDV is not transmissible to humans. However, all laboratory manipulations must be performed at an appropriate containment level determined by biorisk analysis." (Source: https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf.)

Xinjiang, officially the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region in Northwestern China. Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang. A map of Xianjiang Autonomous region can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang#/media/File:Xinjiang_map.png.

LSD has been reported in Russia and Kazakhstan, and recently there has been suspicion that it is circulating in India.
