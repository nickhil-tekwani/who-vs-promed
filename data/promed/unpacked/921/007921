Emergence of tick-borne encephalitis in new endemic areas in Austria: 42 years of surveillance.

Summary
-------
Human infections with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus are a public health concern in certain regions of Europe, central and eastern Asia. Expansions of endemic areas and increased incidences have been associated with different factors including ecological changes supporting tick reproduction, socioeconomic changes increasing human outdoor activities and climatic changes favouring virus circulation in natural foci. Austria is among the most strongly affected countries in Central Europe, but the annual number of cases has strongly declined due to vaccination. Here, we have analysed changes of the incidence of TBE in the unvaccinated population of all federal states of Austria over a period of 42 years. The overall incidence in Austria has remained constant, but new strongly affected endemic regions have emerged in alpine valleys in the west of Austria. In parallel, the incidence in low-land regions in the north-east of the country is decreasing. There is no evidence for a shift to higher altitudes of infection sites in the traditional TBE zones, but the average altitudes of some newly established endemic areas in the west are significantly higher. Our analyses underscore the focal nature of TBE endemic areas and the potential of TBE virus to emerge in previously unaffected regions.

Conclusion
----------
Overall, our data document strong region-specific differences in the changing epidemiology of TBE and conform to a tendency of establishment of new natural foci of TBE in Europe. This has been observed on a wide geographical scale and includes countries with different climates and topographies such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Switzerland. The mechanisms of establishment as well as spread and the factors controlling these processes, however, are still far from clear. This may be exemplified by the situation in the lake district east of Salzburg. Here, the virus is highly endemic in certain locations but several lakes and intervening hill sides are completely spared (Figure 2A [available at the source URL above]) and not a single case has been documented in the 42 years of observation, although all known parameters potentially affecting TBE virus circulation and human infection (climate, landscape, and geography, human outdoor activities, animal reservoirs, etc.) are seemingly identical in the whole region. The elucidation of the interplay of processes driving or restricting the spread of TBE virus and, consequently, a detailed understanding of the focal nature of TBE endemic areas remain a formidable challenge for the future.

[The complete report, available at the source URL above, provides a long-term overview of occurrence of TBE virus infections in humans in Austria, relevant to appearance of cases in new localities. ProMED-mail subscribers interested in the epidemiology and epizootiology of TBE will find that this report provides new insights and identifies new challenges to understand more fully the complex ecological factors responsible for spread and maintenance of this virus in nature and the risk of human exposure to it.
