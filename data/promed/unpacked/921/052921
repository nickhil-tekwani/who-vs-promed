SINGAPORE - Taiwan's livestock industry, still reeling from a deadly
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in 1997, yesterday reported a fresh
outbreak of the contagious virus among pigs.
An official at the Council of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine said the government had destroyed 5 pigs
infected with the disease in the northern county of Taoyuan.
An intensive inspection of around 30 pig farms in Taiwan's 9 counties
showed no signs of further inspections, he said.
The council was still tracking the source of the virus, which it
suspected might have come from small farms which failed to vaccinate
their animals, he added.
According to The Straits Times, Taiwan had ordered a vaccination of
livestock following the 1997 outbreak, but isolated cases of infection
have been reported.
The outbreak 3 years ago forced the authorities to slaughter a quarter of
the island's 14 million pigs and decimated what had been a US$1.55
billion-a-year pork export industry.
