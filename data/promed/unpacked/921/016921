Netherlands:
------------
[Subscribers are referred to the full presentation (20 slides) at the source URL. The following data, from slide No 10, have not been included in earlier postings on SBV in the Netherlands. - Mod.AS]

Sheep farms concerned
- Lambs are mainly born at 135-151 days; normal 147;
- Lambs are sometimes born alive;
- 4 Farms also had a lambing period in November; in all cases without problems;
- Several breeds (Suffolk, Texel, Blue Texel, Dairy, Flevolander, Swifter, Blessumer, cross-breds)
- As well synchronised as non-synchronised sheep

[The Dutch presentation shows malformed lambs; no malformations in cattle are shown (neither are they shown in the Belgian or the German presentations). On what ground have cattle holdings been reported suspicious and tested for SBV? (eg 84 holdings -- so far -- in the Netherlands, of which 57 already tested and found negative).

According to the official Dutch and Belgian updates, the SBV situation, expressed in lab results as of noon 13 Jan 2012, was the following:

1. Belgium:
Total tested (all species) - 76
Cattle: tested 40, positive 0
sheep: tested 34, positive 23 (67.6 percent)
goats: tested 2, positive 0.
Map at: http://www.afsca.be/_pictures/users/Schmallenberg_20120113_000.jpg

2. Netherlands:
Total number of tested holdings - 138 (all species; out of 212 holdings from which samples have been derived).
cattle: tested 57, positive 0.
sheep: tested 74, positive 55 (74.3 percent)
goats: tested 7, positive 2 (28.6 percent).

The Netherlands and Belgium have already notified to the OIE the introduction of SBV as an emerging disease. The 2 counties commendably publish daily bulletins on the test results and their mapping. -Mod.AS].

SBV in Germany
--------------
[Subscribers are referred to the full presentation (8 slides) at the source URL. The following data, from slides 6,7,8 are new or have only been partly included in earlier postings on SBV in Germany. - Mod.AS]

Slide 6
- Virus provisionally designated "Schmallenberg virus" (SBV) according to the origin of the 1st positive samples
- 12 PCR-positive cattle in 6 holdings detected between August and December [2011], including one positive stillborn twin calf.[see also item 4 and commentary at bottom].
- Samples from holdings in unaffected regions (southern part of Germany, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) are negative
- 09 Jan 2012: First SBV-positive samples from malformed lambs. Up to now, positive lambs from 14 farms (7 in North Rhine-Westphalia and 7 in Lower Saxony). Positive PCR results from brain samples.
- Further cases from malformed lambs are reported and samples are under investigation.

Slide No 7
Ongoing activities in FLI
- further epidemiological examination of cattle and sheep holdings in the affected area
- laboratory testing mainly of brain samples of malformed calves/lambs; the PCR protocol was also transferred to laboratories in the Netherlands, Belgium, UK, Italy, Denmark.
- first inoculation experiment with cattle finished
- virus isolation in cell culture successful. Virus is well growing on BHK-cells.
- development of tools for serological testing of cattle for SBV; indirect IF and neutralisation test have been established.
- Simbu-serogroup reference viruses were obtained from the World Reference Center for ARBO viruses (UTMB, Texas, USA). The viruses are well growing and sequencing for comparison studies has started.

Slide No 8
"news" around the virus since last SCOFCAH
- virus seems to cause intrauterine malformations in sheep (NL/D) and cattle (1 confirmed case up to now)[see comment]
- detection of the virus in samples from sheep in Belgium
- detection of stillbirth and malformations in new born lambs in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony; SBV was detected in brain samples from lambs with congenital abnormalities (FLI)
- Small scale serological studies will start as soon as possible
- no indications for the affection of humans by SBV

Subject: 'Schmallenberg Virus': Accession numbers for sequence information available
-----------------------------------------------------
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) publishes accession numbers at the Europe Nucleotide Archive.

After the discovery of the novel orthobunyavirus tentatively designated as 'Schmallenberg Virus' in November 2011, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) confirmed now about 20 cases (6 in cattle, 16 in sheep with analysis of more suspected cases from new areas still pending) in Germany so far [see comment].

The institute already distributes the protocol for genome detection and will provide the virus isolate. The full-length sequences for the segments L, M, and S of the Schmallenberg virus genome will shortly be available from the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) and with a short delay from GenBank and DDBJ under the accessions HE649912, HE649913, and HE649914.

On behalf of the FLI Schmallenberg Virus Study Group

[In view of the fact that, so far, no SBV-positive results have been reported from the Netherlands and Belgium in cattle progeny (in contrast to sheep), we have asked Dr Beer to kindly provide us with additional details on SBV in German cattle (items 3 and 4 above). We are very grateful for the following information which he has proficiently and immediately provided:

1. The cases in sheep are all from congenitally malformed lambs. The cases in cattle are different. Only one case is a stillborn twin calf. The other 5 cattle cases are farms with PCR positive adult cattle (these are the early cases from autumn 2011) which were sampled due to acute signs of disease (fever, milk drop).

2. The calf was stillborn mid of December 2011, about 10 days before the calculated date of normal birth. As far as I know, the calf was more or less normal. Only the abdomen was a little bit enlarged."

The reason for the absence of positive cases in cattle remains to be clarified. Could it be related to the fact that cattle reacted clinically to the initial infection in Aug-Sep 2011, in Germany and the Netherlands, and the virus did not cross the placental barrier?! Other possible explanations have been suggested as well. A definitive answer is not expected before April-May; in case transplacental infection of foeti took place during early pregnancy, CNS-related changes in cattle progeny may still be encountered. - Mod.AS
