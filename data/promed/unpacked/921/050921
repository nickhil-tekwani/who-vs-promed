A poultry farm in Wicomico County had an inconclusive test for avian influenza, leading to 40 000 chickens being put down at a farm in Powellville.

The farm was experiencing "higher than normal mortality" and was submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture laboratory for a disease screening, according to a release from Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc. [DPI]. Disease screenings include testing for bird flu.

Bird flu is a viral disease affecting multiple species throughout the world, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The risk of infecting humans is very low and is often limited only to the people in direct contact with the birds, although occasionally other people have been affected.

The Powellville chickens were diagnosed with and treated for an unnamed "common bacterial disease," according to the DPI release, and mortality returned to normal expected rates. However, "out of an abundance of caution," the decision was made to put the birds down, DPI said.

Bob Culver, Wicomico county executive, said 40 000 birds were put down from 2 houses. "They did everything they could do to handle it in a positive manner," he said in an interview.

Over the next 2 weeks, there will be increased testing and surveillance to make sure no other cases of illness appear in other local poultry flocks.

"All poultry flock owners are encouraged to follow strict biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of disease," DPI said in a release.

There are no health concerns for human beings, and poultry and eggs are still safe for human consumption.

[This article does not note which type of flu this may have been, or even if it was a confirmed case. Nevertheless, caution is necessary.

It always takes continual vigilance to prevent and minimize disease. Biosecurity of workers and everyone entering the premises, including veterinarians, is vitally important. Prevention measures regarding wild birds and rodents are critical in keeping down the chances of an infestation. Part of biosecurity is early detection of one or a few ill birds. Fortunately, this infestation seems contained and hopefully eliminated. We hope it does not spread.

The Delaware, Maryland, Virginia (Delmarva) area is a large poultry production area. So while unsettling, it is likely an abundance of caution to protect other production sites from possibly acquiring the virus in some fashion. Avian flu, even low pathogenicity, is concerning.

Further information as to etiology is requested from knowledgable parties. - Mod.TG
