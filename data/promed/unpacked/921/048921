An outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in North Eastern counties has left at least 13 people dead. Hundreds have survived the haemorrhagic disease that leaves victims bleeding from most parts of their bodies including the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Blood is also passed through patients' faeces and urine.

A week ago, Marsabit County residents were cautioned after the disease broke out in neighbouring Wajir. Those who died are said to have consumed infected meat. Samples of the meat were tested by veterinary officers and found to contain the RVF virus.

According to County Director of Public Health Adano Kochi, RVF broke out in Marsabit in 2006. Other outbreaks were reported in 2016 and 2018. A total of 234 suspected cases have been discovered since the 1st outbreak, with about 13 deaths reported so far.

The outbreak has been blamed on prolonged rains leading to heavy flooding and stagnant waters, which create a conducive breeding environment for the _Aedes_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes, the main vectors for transmission of the disease. Human beings are infected through livestock when one comes in contact with body fluids or eats animal products like meat, milk and blood from sick animals.

Abortion, mostly among sheep and camels, haemorrhage and fever are among the signs of RVF in animals. For the past 3 weeks, the county has experienced increased cases of abortion in camels, goats and sheep. A total of 14 camels died in Funanyatta and Bori in Moyale, while 12 camels aborted. There are reports of more cases in Badanrero, Amballo, Ittir, Kargi, Olturot, Loglogo, Korr and Laisamis. Residents in affected areas have been advised to feed only on inspected livestock products including meat, milk and blood.

According to the county government, Moyale is hardest hit by the outbreak. In North Horr sub-county, North Horr, Balesa, Demo, Shuur and Maikona are the most affected.

The veterinary department this week rolled out plans to enhance surveillance, institute ring vaccination, increase public awareness, quarantine livestock, restrict home slaughter and close livestock markets to control the spread of RVF.

The department said prolonged heavy rainfall and increased vegetation had led to increased vector breeding, and urged residents to sleep under treated mosquito nets to avoid infections from the deadly mosquitoes.

Marsabit County Director for Veterinary Services Boku Bodha said residents were at a higher risk than Mandera and Wajir locals because animals in small stocks were being ferried using all means of transport from Wajir and Mandera to the Moyale markets. "Our main challenge now is to handle and control movement of livestock from the affected areas as already thousands are currently being transported from areas bordering Badanrero, Bute, Buna, Basir, Lakole, Rahmu, Daandu, Qofole and the wider Wajir and Mandera counties," he said. "Slaughtering of livestock en masse during the Idd celebrations likely posed a greater risk for residents." Mr. Bodha added that the only animals not affected by RVF were poultry and donkeys.

Speaking to The Standard in Marsabit town after dispatching surveillance teams to the border sub-counties of North Horr, Laisamis and Moyale, County Chief Officer for Health Jaldesa Dima urged residents to be vigilant to help prevent the disease from spreading. He told pastoralists in Marsabit not to take their animals along the borders to minimise chances of their livestock being infected. In the last 2 weeks, 1800 head of cattle have been tested for the disease in the 3 border towns. On [Thu 14 Jun 2018], the county government resorted to provisional quarantine and ring vaccination of livestock to curb any spread of RVF. This came a day after a resident tested positive for the disease after an analysis by the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi.

The patient was one of 2 who were admitted to Marsabit County Referral Hospital a week ago. The county government admitted it had challenges handling the disease due to lack of sufficient field and laboratory equipment, and trained medical and public health practitioners.

The last major RVF outbreak was reported in 2006-2007, at the end of a prolonged rainy season. About 160 people died while the livestock sector lost about Sh4 billion [39 580 000 USD].

According to Wajir County Veterinary Director George Kiprono, RVF was 1st identified in 1931 during an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley in Kenya.

[The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak is continuing. The human death toll has gone from the 6 reported on 18 Jun 2018 to at least 13 now. Camels, sheep and goats are affected as well, with both deaths and abortions reported. The prolonged rains and flooding have provided breeding sites for RFV virus vector mosquitoes. The animal quarantine and ring vaccination may be helpful in halting spread of the virus but will have no effect on the vector mosquito population. With human and domestic animals affected by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and direct animal to human transmission, an integrated one health approach is needed o deal with the situation holistically. The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. It is difficult to predict how long this outbreak may last. The domestic animal vaccination efforts will be a helpful preventive measure. - Mod.TY]

[According to FAO's updated RVF manual (2018, at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf): "Mass vaccination in the face of an outbreak has never been successfully applied. This is because of the hyperacute nature of the outbreaks and the difficult environmental conditions often prevailing at onset. Without subsidized vaccine banks, the quantities available at the time of an outbreak -- whether predicted or not -- are often insufficient for mass vaccination. It has been estimated that the best-case scenario for procuring and positioning vaccines in the face of an expected epizootic episode, when vaccine production needs to be re-activated, is 147 days. This is prohibitively long, even if decision-makers were able to commit funds at the 1st indication of an early warning. National experts suggest that targeted vaccination of critical populations believed to be involved in the initial amplification of the virus can pre-empt outbreaks - or has the potential to do so. Irrespective of the above considerations, it makes sense to focus vaccination on the hotspots for emergence (as indicated by risk maps). This approach warrants further consideration and piloting (...) Protecting animals at hotspots would reduce the impact of the outbreak on the livelihoods of affected communities." - Mod.AS
