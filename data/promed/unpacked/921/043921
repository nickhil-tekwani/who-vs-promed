Biohazard procedures to change, officials acknowledge anthrax scare missteps
-----------------------------------------------
The Defense Department is changing how it handles biohazard threats,
acknowledging that internal breakdowns delayed its response to a 14 Mar
2005 anthrax scare at the Pentagon and nearby office buildings, confused
the rest of the federal government, and alarmed state and local public
health workers, officials said. Under fire for gaps with civilian
bioterrorism detection and response systems, military officials said they
will quicken reporting of test results from biological sensors around their
Arlington headquarters to no more than 24 hours, and, shift away from using
contract laboratories. It took 3 days to get results from a contractor
after the 14 Mar 2005 incident.
Defense officials acknowledged the need to align laboratory testing
protocols with those used by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. They also agreed that they should coordinate with local health
officials when ordering emergency medical treatment for defense workers.
Pentagon representatives discussed the steps on Friday [25 Mar 2005] during
an "after-action" review chaired by Thomas J. Lockwood, national capital
region coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security. Representatives
from the White House, FBI, the Health and Human Services Department, and
the U.S. Postal Service, as well as state and local officials, were present.
Officials described preliminary results on condition of anonymity, because
the review is not complete, and because multiple agencies are involved. One
participant said the 2-hour meeting evolved from a "tense" set of exchanges
to "a real air of candid, . . . open sharing of information."
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff ordered the review, after
alerts in 2 military mailrooms shut the main delivery center at the
Pentagon, disrupted mail delivery to U.S. government offices, and put 900
workers in several buildings on antibiotics for 3 days.
Although the presence of anthrax bacteria in one of 4 samples taken on 10
Mar 2005 from the Pentagon's Remote Delivery Facility was confirmed by 3
laboratories, subsequent testing found no trace of the pathogen. Senior
military officials said the most plausible explanation was contamination by
the original contractor laboratory, Commonwealth Biotechnologies Inc. of
Richmond, Virginia, which has said a subsequent review produced no evidence
of surface, air or sample contamination.
Another 14 Mar 2005 airborne alert at a mailroom in the Skyline office
building complex in Baileys Crossroads -- whose defense contractor
employees receive mail from the Pentagon facility -- turned out not to
signal the presence of any hazardous substance and apparently was a
coincidence. About 800 workers were locked down for 6 hours in that case.
Overall, national bioterrorism experts inside and outside of government say
the episode revealed lingering problems in achieving a coordinated
emergency response since the area's anthrax attacks through the mail in
2001. Virginia and District leaders have said they were kept out of the
loop early in the recent incident, potentially endangering the public.
Local elected officials as well as members of Congress have called for reviews.
Representative Christopher Cox (California Republican), chairman of the
House Homeland Security Committee, plans to lead a 4 Apr 2005 hearing into
national anthrax testing policies.
On Friday [25 Mar 2005], military representatives said the Pentagon was
making "substantial improvements," including requiring contract labs to
report test results in 24 hours. In the recent incident, Commonwealth
Biotechnologies Inc. reported the result of its 10 Mar 2005 test the next
day, a Friday, to prime contractor Vistronix Inc., of McLean. Senior
defense officials said they took immediate action, including contacting
emergency responders, upon learning of the results on Mon 14 Mar 2005.
"Clearly, a sample was taken to their lab Thursday [10 Mar 2005]," one
federal official said. "Especially over a weekend, it apparently can take
much more than 24 hours, maybe 3 days." [How does a culture know that it is
after 4 p.m. on a Friday afternoon? - Mod.MHJ]
Timing is critical, because scientists believe that healthy people exposed
to anthrax bacteria can die in 7 days, another federal official said. If a
letter had been the source of the anthrax found in the sample, it could
have been mailed 4 Mar 2005, given the time it takes mail to move through
the postal system and reach the Pentagon, the official said. [And if it had
been similar to the 2001 letters, it would have exposed post office workers
to infection soon after being mailed. Put another way, their incubation
periods would have been completed by 10-14 Mar 2005. - Mod.MHJ]
The review group also reached preliminary agreement that government
agencies should rely on the CDC's bioterrorism Laboratory Response Network,
which includes 140 specially certified labs, to test for such incidents
instead of contract facilities, 2 officials said. The review group also
agreed that federal agencies should coordinate with state and local public
health agencies before ordering antibiotic treatment solely for federal
employees.
