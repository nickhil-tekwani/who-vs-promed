EcoHealth Alliance, an environmental health nonprofit organization that focuses on local conservation and global health issues, published findings showing evidence of Reston Ebola virus (RESTV) in various species of bats from research conducted in the Philippines. The research article, "Molecular evidence of Ebola Reston virus infection in Philippine bats," was published in the Virology Journal on 17 Jul 2015. The research team was called together after Reston Ebola virus was found in domestic pigs at several farms in the Philippines during a 2008 - 2009 outbreak. While the Philippine government determined that Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome was the most likely cause of the disease in pigs it was also discovered that the pigs were infected with Ebola Reston virus. Subsequent detection of Ebola Reston antibodies in farm and abattoir workers in the area of the outbreak suggested that they had been exposed to the virus, likely through contact with infected pigs. There was no indication that exposure to the virus had led to any illness in people.

Reston Ebola virus is one of the 5 known types of Ebola viruses. While it can cause severe disease in non-human primates, to date, it has only caused asymptomatic infections in people. Reston Ebola virus was 1st identified in 1990 and is named after Reston, Virginia where the virus was 1st discovered among laboratory macaques imported from the Philippines. While this particular strain of virus is not known to cause disease in healthy individuals, it is uncertain how the virus would threaten persons with underlying medical conditions. It is necessary for more research to be conducted to better understand the effects of Reston Ebola virus on both non-human primates as well as people.

The outbreak sparked questions about where Reston Ebola virus came from and how it ended up infecting pigs and people during the 2008 - 2009 outbreak. In 2010, at the invitation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Philippine government, a team of EcoHealth Alliance scientists set out to determine if the Reston Ebola virus found in pigs resulted from exposure to local bat species. Consequently, bats are believed to be reservoirs for Ebola and related viruses.

The team surveyed bat populations at multiple locations in the Philippines in close proximity to the 2008-09 outbreak farms, and collected biological samples from a total of 464 bats from 21 species. Bats were humanely captured, sampled, and released. The samples were then sent to labs in the Philippines and in Australia to conduct virus testing. "This study was a true, international collaboration and wouldn't have been possible without strong technical and political support from our Philippine colleagues," said Dr. Kevin Olival, Senior Research Scientist at EcoHealth Alliance and co-author of the study.

This study provides the 1st molecular evidence of Reston Ebola virus infection in Philippine bats, but the low prevalence and low viral load warrants the crucial need for expanded surveillance. According to Dr. Jonathan Epstein, a veterinary epidemiologist at EcoHealth Alliance involved in the study, "What we've found is another piece of the Ebola puzzle; more evidence that bats are a natural host for these type of viruses. We need to better understand how this virus jumps from bats into other animals or people, and work to reduce the risk of that happening, whether it's in the Philippines or in Africa."

Further research will help provide targeted geographic hotspots to understand the transmission potential of Ebola viruses in that region, as well as the underlying risk factors that lead to the virus spilling over into pigs and people.

Of the 21 species analyzed, the 3 corroborated infections were found in 3 _Miniopterus schreibersii_ (out of 44 tested; 6.8 percent).

The genus Ebolavirus was discovered in 1976, and so far includes 5 species, namely Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Ivory Coast ebolavirus [also known as Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus (CIEBOV)], Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV), and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). REBOV is the only of those not associated with disease in humans, but it can cause illness in non-human primates and swine. Gaining new knowledge on the ecology of all Ebola viruses is crucial, and elucidating the host range that these pathogens can use is a fundamental step forward. - Mod.PMB
