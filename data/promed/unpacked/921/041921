[While we do not have the dates of onset of illness, it appears as though the outbreak in Buraidah is continuing, with reports of 2 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. This brings the total number of MERS-CoV cases reported by Buraidah since 3 Mar 2016 to 24, including 13 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 54.2%).

According to twitter chatter, one of the newly confirmed cases reported today is a patient with end stage renal disease who was dialized in the same unit where 3 other confirmed cases had been treated, a scenario seen in prior nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 16 Mar 2016
------------------------------
Between [9 and 10 Mar 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 7 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 2 deaths.

The patient has a history of frequent contact with dromedaries and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. [reported as a newly confirmed case on 10 Mar 2016 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. He was reported as a fatality on 11 Mar 2016. At the time of initial confirmation report he was classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels. - Mod.MPP]

The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [9 Mar 2016]. Currently, he is in stable condition in home isolation. The patient is a healthcare worker in the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is occurring. Investigation of epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases hospitalized in the same hospital is ongoing.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [14 Mar 2016] (case no. 14).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1684 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 600 related deaths.

[The WHO update provides additional details including dates of onset of illness. Similar to yesterday's observation, it is difficult to ascertain where and when the contacts may have taken place for some of the secondary healthcare acquired cases. For example, case No. 3 above was ill on 6 Mar and on 7 Mar 2016 was admitted to hospital and was positive for MERS-CoV on 9 Mar 2016. As the average turnaround time for MERS-CoV laboratory confirmation observed in the reports is 2 days, that suggests this patient was MERS-CoV positive on 7 Mar 2016, 24 hours after admission to the hospital. Can we presume there were prior hospital based contacts, or should we presume there are cases with a 24 hour incubation period? These questions come to mind in trying to understand the risk factors for transmission of the MERS-CoV.

Another question that repetitively comes to mind is why primarily Saudi Arabia? This is clearly the season for increased transmission of the MERS-CoV, including presumably increased numbers of infections in camels. According to Saudi Arabian MOH data, since 1 Jan 2015, 41% of all reported cases were classified as primary cases, and since 24 Sep 2015 when information was consistently reported, 37 of 103 reported cases (35.9%) gave a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Camels have been found to be MERS-CoV positive in the region outside of Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV (40): Egypt, animal reservoir, camel, ex Sudan, susp. 20160316.4097730), yet cases are overwhelmingly reported by Saudi Arabia and not other countries in the region. Have the medical anthropologists been busy trying to address this question? Are there studies underway addressing differential animal husbandry practices in the region? Is this more a case of "seek and ye shall find"?
