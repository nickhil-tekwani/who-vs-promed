The Plateau state government on [Tue 10 Oct 2017] confirmed a suspected case of Lassa fever in the state.

The commissioner for health, Kuden Kamshak, a medical doctor said the infected person had been quarantined.

"Currently, there is a case of Lassa fever in Tudunwada, here in Jos, but the infected persons have been quarantined alongside with his brother. The said person also has symptoms of yellow fever," he said.

He added that "the entire family of the patient had been put under surveillance for the next 21 days."

The health commissioner made the disclosure [Tue 10 Oct 2017] in Jos, in an interview with journalists, while speaking on measures being taken by the state health officials to prevent possible outbreak of monkeypox in the state.

[Health authorities in Plateau state are dealing with this case promptly and implementing surveillance of contacts. Plateau state officially reported 31 cases of Lassa fever with 7 deaths as of 25 Aug 2017. Occurrence of another case in this state is not surprising. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.
