Two weeks after Seeka reported bacterial symptoms reminiscent of kiwifruit disease _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) in an Australian orchard [ProMED-mail post 20181004.6069533], Agriculture Victoria has confirmed the tests came up positive. However, as the diagnosis points either to Psa biovar 2 or 3, scientists cannot be sure whether it's the same strain found [in New Zealand]. Agriculture Victoria is following standard biosecurity processes in response to this detection.

Having experienced the devastation that the disease wrought in New Zealand, Seeka pulled out 4.5 hectares of 2-year-old vines around the detection zone [and] continues to proactively monitor the orchards.

Seeka's Michael Franks explained, "We believe that the Australian environment and climate will not be conducive to Psa because of the extreme heat in summer. It is likely that [Psa] will be prevalent in spring. We will now reset the varietal mix in the orchards we are developing [in Australia]." He added that normal containment protocols had been in place since the detection, with "high hygiene" and restrictions on plant movement. All plant material in orchards in Australia had come from Australia, he added.

[Bacterial canker of kiwi fruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) is caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa). Symptoms may include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, and fruit collapse, followed by death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Psa infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means, and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected (ProMED-mail post 20180221.5643210). Spread with infected fruit, so far, cannot be excluded. Alternative hosts (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160225.4050698) are likely pathogen reservoirs. A number of different biovars (populations) of Psa exist that vary, for example, in geographical origin and/or aggressiveness. A very virulent strain, Psa-V (biovar 3), was detected in central Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207).

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen), and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a streptomycin-resistant strain is emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

Psa taxonomy is complex and is still being refined (see links below). Confusion exists due to varying nomenclature of "biovars," "haplotypes," strains, and pathovars. The current consensus seems to be that Psa includes 3 biovars, with a 4th recently classified as a new pathovar, _actinidifoliorum_. Each Psa biovar consists of a number of haplotypes. Biovar 1 and 2 strains produce different plant toxic compounds and are considered "mild," while biovar 3 (synonym Psa-V) strains do not produce these toxins and are responsible for the global emergence of bacterial canker of kiwi in recent years.

Global distribution of the biovars is still under investigation. In Australia, haplotypes of Psa biovar 2, corresponding to the Asian group of strains, have been reported earlier (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206). In New Zealand, at least 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified, one of them an aggressive strain related to the Italian lineage of biovar 3. It will be important to identify the Psa strains and biovars involved in this recent Australian outbreak in order to find the pathogen source, whether it be local or a quarantine incursion.
