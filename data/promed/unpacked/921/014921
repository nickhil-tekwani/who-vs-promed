Re: ProMED-mail post Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (02): (UP) 20151008.3698951
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In ProMED-mail Archive Number: 20151008.3698951, the statement: "The Gorakhpur encephalitis (AES) [acute encephalitis syndrome] has been [resolved]. It is scrub typhus, a mite-borne bacterial disease caused by _Orientia tstsugamushi_" is unscientific and misleading.

The report says: "An ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] sponsored investigation during August-September 2014 identified the etiology. Out of 249 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases investigated, 152 (61 percent) of the cases were attributable to scrub typhus either by IgM ELISA, IFA or PCR. A pathognomonic eschar was evident in 20 per cent of the AES cases we investigated."

Finding that 61 per cent of cases initially considered acute encephalitis syndrome were actually misclassified and were not encephalitis but scrub typhus does not resolve the so-called mystery of the remaining really problematic cases.

Obviously, the correspondent (if the same person was also the investigator) does not know how to investigate an outbreak. One does not put together all illnesses remotely resembling each other for outbreak investigation but uses a strict case definition to include cases in the study; had that been done, scrub typhus cases would automatically have been excluded from study samples as they would not fit a case definition demanding specificity. Many investigators have opted for criteria chosen for high sensitivity and have landed in trouble, like this one study well illustrates.

Scrub typhus is widely prevalent in most parts of India, and its clinical presentation is not like that of acute encephalitis at all. It is not at all surprising that scrub typhus occurs in Gorakhpur. Had the investigator discussed this issue with local physicians, they would have clarified that the disease occurs in adults also. Scrub typhus is not confined to children, whereas acute encephalitis is mostly only in children.

What seems to have misguided this investigator is the diagnostic term "acute encephalitis syndrome." While most pediatricians would use that term only for clinically proven encephalitis but without aetiology determined, others use that term to cover bacterial meningitis, cerebral malaria, typhoid encephalopathy, Reye's syndrome, acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy, etc. If we drop the syndrome part, and use the term acute encephalitis, the situation may improve; then only what fits with the well known criteria of encephalitis would be included for investigation and not any acute febrile illness presenting with headache, lethargy or drowsiness, which are characteristic of uncomplicated scrub typhus.

[Dr. John makes a compelling case for the need for a more precise case definition of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). As things stand now, the etiology is unclear. As noted in a 22 Sep 2015 report, there were 10 834 AES cases in 2014. That report describes AES as, "a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins" (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/india-had-over-10000-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-cases-in-2014_1800724.html).

Previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye's syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus infections, as responsible for AES. One hopes that a specific case definition, as Dr. John proposes, and prospective studies may help identify the etiologies of these cases so that appropriate treatment as well as targeted control and preventive measures may be taken.

Exclusion of scrub typhus from AES diagnosis does not diminish its importance as a public health problem in India. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important. - Mod.TY
