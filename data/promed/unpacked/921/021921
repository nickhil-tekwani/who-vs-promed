Farmers in Rwamagana District [Eastern Province] have expressed concern over a disease that has attacked their mango plants. Sooty Mould is recognisable by black fungi on the leaf surfaces. In severe cases the trees will turn completely black due to the presence of mould over its entire surface of twigs and leaves. Some parts of Kayonza District, especially those neighbouring Rwamagana, are also affected.

Farmers predict that production is likely to dwindle compared to previous seasons. [One farmer] is anticipating a drop of more than 50 per cent. [He said], "When one farmer applies insecticides and the neighbour doesn't, the disease spreads again." [He] called on authorities to convince farmers to apply pesticides or cut infected trees. He also appealed to the National Agriculture Exports Board for help.

In Rwamagana market, [vendors] have resorted to selling imported mangoes from Tanzania due to shortage of supply from local producers.

[Sooty moulds are saprophytes which live on the host's surface. They are not pathogens in the true sense because they do not invade the plant tissue, but are secondary parasites. They follow different pests (for example, scale insects or aphids) excreting honeydew which coats the plant and provides a growth substrate for the fungi. They occur on a range of hosts including many fruit trees, shrubs and ornamentals. On mango, species of several genera (for example _Capnodium_, _Meliola_, _Tripospermum_) are known to occur.

Plants become blackened with velvety fungal growth and are usually sticky. The whole plant may be affected, and the moulds are difficult to remove. They reduce plant vigour and productivity by restricting the light available to the host for photosynthesis. The moulds may also grow on plants not affected by insects if honeydew drips from overhanging vegetation. They are more likely to grow in dry conditions as rain washes the honeydew away.

Disease management mainly focuses on control of the insects and may involve pesticides, soap or oil-based organic sprays, or biological control by specific predator insects.
