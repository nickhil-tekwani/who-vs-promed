[1] Indonesia: human, dog, recurrence of rabies in West Nusa Tenggara
Date: Sun 17 Feb 2019

The [Indonesian] Health Ministry has said that, from January to February [2019], 628 people were infected [see comment] with rabies nationwide, with at least 12 cases that turned fatal.

Six deaths were recorded in Dompu in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), 3 in North Sumatra, and 3 in Central and North Sulawesi [see map at https://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/asia/indonesia/].

According to Antara, health officials in Ambon reported one fatality and 101 infected in the Maluku city [Maluku province].

The ministry's director for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said the outbreak was caused by low rabies vaccination coverage for both stray dogs and pet dogs.

She further said that giving vaccines to the dogs was the responsibility of the Agriculture Ministry, especially its Animal Husbandry Directorate General.

"The coverage [across provinces] is still at 30 percent. We still have 26 other provinces that have not eliminated from rabies," she told The Jakarta Post on Thursday [14 Feb 2019].

The ministry said what was more appalling was that NTB, one of 9 provinces that had been declared rabies-free, suffered the most from the outbreak.

"This happened because the population of stray dogs increased and there is no proper control [for rabies]," said the ministry's disease control and prevention director general, Anung Sugihantono. "This issue must be dealt with by the Agriculture Ministry."

Rabies is a serious infection of the nervous system caused by lyssaviruses, which is transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal.

The government earlier announced that there were 9 regions that had been declared free from rabies, namely Bangka Belitung, Riau Islands, Jakarta, Central Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, Papua, West Papua, and NTB.

An emergency status for rabies was declared in Dompu [NTB], where the Health Ministry distributed 2800 anti-rabies vaccines.

"There will be another 600 vaccine bottles from Jakarta, so the supply so far is secure," said NTB Health Agency head Nurhandini Eka Dewi, expressing hope that agriculture officials would soon eliminate stray dogs in Dompu to curb the outbreak.

The Dompu administration recorded a population of over 9000 dogs in the regency, 4000 of which were pets while the rest were strays. So far, 1028 dogs have been put down.

"We will continue to eliminate them," NTB Animal Husbandry and Health Agency head Budi Septiani said, adding that the agency had cooperated with members of the Indonesian Shooting and Hunting Association (Perbakin) to put down stray dogs.

For pet dogs, vaccinations were conducted in stages. Her agency was also educating dog lovers on rabies, she said.

The results of tests on brain samples taken from the eliminated dogs show that 10 were positive for rabies.

The animal husbandry agency imposed tight security in the seaport connecting Lombok and Sumbawa islands.

"No dog is allowed to go out or enter Sumbawa. The ones in Lombok have been eliminated. The pet ones have been vaccinated," she said.

Dompu (Indonesia: Kota Dompu) is a town and the administrative capital of the Dompu Regency, located in the eastern part of the island of Sumbawa, in central Indonesia's province of West Nusa Tenggara. It is the 3rd largest town on the island of Sumbawa, with a population of 49 854 at the 2010 census.

The term "outbreak" deserves to address specifically the explosive event in Dompu, situated in a province hitherto considered rabies free. For the 26 Indonesian provinces, where rabies continues its endemic circulation without significant changes, the term "outbreak" is excessive.

In reference to the 628 people reportedly "infected" nationwide since January 2019, of which 12 turned fatal: the reporter should have rather referred to "exposed" patients, namely people bitten/scratched by rabies vector animals, such as stray dogs or unvaccinated pets (an "incident"), and consequently underwent post-exposure treatment. Such treatment should be given to those involved in such "incidents" (exposed to animals suspected of rabies); their infection status is not known. Unfortunately, there is, so far, no test available for the identification of rabies infection in victims bitten by rabid or suspected-rabid animals, prior to advanced stages of each case, eventually expressed by the appearance of clinical signs.

In rabies-endemic countries, strays and unvaccinated pets deserve being considered as suspected, unless they have undergone a 10-day observation period, immediately after the incident, without showing clinical disease. It may be assumed that the 12 fatal cases have not undergone a timely post-exposure treatment. - Mod.AS]

[2] Pakistan (Khyber-Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) human, deficient supply of post-exposure vaccine

A minor girl, who was allegedly bitten by a stray dog, has died owing to shortage of anti-rabies vaccine at hospitals in the district.

"My daughter was bitten by a dog and we took her to the Civil Hospital in Darband but she couldn't be vaccinated owing to shortage of anti-rabies vaccine and she died," Abdul Rehman, who belonged to Lakh Guar village in Darband Union Council, told reporters on [Tue 12 Feb 2019].

He said that his daughter, 7, was bitten by a dog in fields nearby his home some one-and-half month ago.

Dr Shahzad Ali Khan, the district health officer [Mansehra district, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], when contacted said according to verbal (?) autopsy, [the girl], had died after being treated for the disease. "I will release a comprehensive report tomorrow [Wed 13 Feb 2019]," he added.

"Our country imports anti-rabies vaccine from neighbouring India and this time they didn't release the stock," said Dr Shahzad.

He said that his department had purchased anti-rabies vaccine on higher prices from a pharmaceutical company in Karachi, which would be available at 6 specified health centres by 15 Feb 2019.

The cases of dog bites have also been reported from across the district but affected people couldn't be vaccinated against the anti-rabies because of the shortage of vaccine.

"I was also bitten by a dog and roamed at various public sector hospitals but couldn't be vaccinated owning to non-availability of vaccines and finally managed to acquire a voile from a local chemist on high price," a resident of Bohraj, told reporters.
