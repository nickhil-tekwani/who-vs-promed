Comment on route of inoculation
-------------------------------
Monkeypox in central Africa is not a trivial disease and carries a case
fatality rate of about 10 per cent there. The finding of so many mild cases
and no deaths so far is surprising. Some have commented that it is the
"comorbidity" present in Africa that enhances the impact of monkeypox. I
find this explanation to be facile; there is no evidence that any
particular disease impacts on the outcome of infection with the virus in
Africa and there is no evidence that concomitant malnutrition or other
condition is needed to make monkeypox a serious disease. This may be so,
but I don't know of any data.
In fact, the only cases of monkeypox I have seen were in pygmies in the mid
1980s and the general health of the group was quite good, although the
state of the recovering children reminded me very much of that of persons
recovering from measles with the added visible lymphadenopathy. Which of
course brings to mind another obvious explanation for the mild course in
the US. There is better supportive care. This doesn't wash because the
cases seem to be quite mild and not snatched from the jaws of death by
nursing, antipyretics, rehydrations, and antibiotic treatment of secondary
infections as we attribute to differences in measles mortality.
There are, of course, many possible speculations including host and viral
genetics, recent passage in prairie dogs, etc. I would like to suggest a
rather off-the-wall, but not unreasonable, idea that should be factored
into the equation: route of inoculation. This idea originates from the old
practice of smallpox prevention by "variolation" or "inoculation". Smallpox
virus was introduced into the skin or nasal mucous membrane of a
susceptible person and the resulting disease was relatively mild and
immunized. If one reads the old English literature, one finds that the low
mortality of about two per cent was obtained by a shallow inoculation in
the skin. The subsequent local cutaneous lesion appeared quickly and
apparently initiated a vigorous immune response that attenuated the disease
with the result of few pocks (appearing later) and mild host impact. This
seems to fit some of the situations floating about on the rumor mill,
although I have had no contact with these cases.
