Although Ebola is from a different virus family, survivors' long-term symptoms are similar to those of people with long Covid. Scientists are studying the similarities between long Covid and ongoing symptoms experienced by survivors of Ebola and chikungunya virus in the hope of devising new treatments to improve their health.

Like patients with long Covid, survivors of these other, relatively new human viruses, often experience lingering symptoms which can make it difficult to work or function in everyday life.

For Ebola, roughly 3/4ths of survivors are still experiencing symptoms a year after the initial infection, and sometimes for much longer, including joint and muscle pain, migraine-like headaches, visual problems, and fatigue.

It's a similar story for chikungunya, a mosquito-transmitted virus that mostly affects people in African and Asian countries, causing fever and debilitating joint pain. Around 1/3rd of people go on to develop crippling arthritis that can last years or other symptoms such as fatigue.

"It's the same kind of discussions as we're having for Covid; it's people whose lives have never been the same again, who describe joint pain and fatigue and cognitive problems and all those familiar lists," said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London.

"The experience of chikungunya and Ebola should be sounding alarm bells, because although we're talking about very different virus families, and very diverse infections, they seem to do quite similar things. There's a desperate need for some immunology to understand what's going on," he said.

Some of those studies are starting to happen. Yves Levy at Paris-Est Creteil University and colleagues have been analysing the blood of Ebola survivors in Guinea 2 years after they were infected with the virus, which causes a severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever.

Levy said: "Usually, when you are fighting an infection, there is inflammation and activation of the immune system, but this returns to a steady state once you recover. What we're showing with Ebola is that the patients are recovering, and the virus is gone, but they still have this persistent inflammation and immune activation."

Whether this is the cause of their lasting symptoms is unclear, but other studies have shown a link between some of the inflammatory markers they identified and fatigue, said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England's national infection service, who is also studying Ebola survivors. "Just understanding that there is this link between prior infection and a chronic syndrome is a good start," he added.

The cause of this inflammation is unclear. One possibility is that small reservoirs of virus are surviving in places like the testicles or the eyeball, which the immune system has less access to, but which nevertheless triggers a baseline level of immune activation. Another is that the virus is gone, but some of its proteins remain attached to the survivors' cells, so the immune system attacks these instead. Or, that it just takes the immune system a long time to recover after Ebola. "We need to follow these patients in the long term, because, when they say they have symptoms, it is clearly not just a psychological issue," Levy said.

[2] Antibody resurgence

A high proportion of survivors of Ebola experienced a resurgence in antibody levels nearly a year after recovery, a new University of Liverpool study has found.

Published today [27 Jan 2021] in Nature, the finding hints that hidden reservoirs of virus could exist long after symptoms ease and has implications for monitoring programmes and vaccine strategies.

When a person is infected with Ebola virus, their body produces antibodies to fight the disease. Antibody concentrations peak and then decline slowly over time, providing the body with some degree of immune protection over the infection. However, little is known about the antibody response over prolonged periods.

Researchers from the University's Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences tracked antibodies in a cohort of survivors of Ebola virus disease from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone outbreak for up to 500 days after recovery from their infection. As expected, antibody levels dropped away slowly after the acute phase of recovery, but then unexpectedly increased rapidly once more around 200 days later, only to decline thereafter. This particular pattern was observed in over half of participants with longitudinal data.

Although there was no detectable Ebola virus in the participants' plasma taken around the time of asymptomatic antibody resurgence, the study indicates that the Ebola virus may be able to persist inside the bodies of many recovered patients for long periods of time. "Hiding" inside immunologically privileged sites, such as the eyes, central nervous system, or testes, the virus may then start to replicate spontaneously, prompting the renewed antibody response.

With this in mind, the researchers suggest that long-term monitoring of survivors is warranted, and that repeat immunization with vaccines should be considered to boost and maintain protective antibody responses in survivors.

Abstract:
"Neutralizing antibody function provides a foundation for the efficacy of vaccines and therapies1,2,3. Here, using a robust in vitro Ebola virus (EBOV) pseudo-particle infection assay and a well-defined set of solid-phase assays, we describe a wide spectrum of antibody responses in a cohort of healthy survivors of the Sierra Leone EBOV outbreak of 2013-2016. Pseudo-particle virus-neutralizing antibodies correlated with total anti-EBOV reactivity and neutralizing antibodies against live EBOV. Variant EBOV glycoproteins (1995 and 2014 strains) were similarly neutralized. During longitudinal follow-up, antibody responses fluctuated in a 'decay-stimulation-decay' pattern that suggests de novo restimulation by EBOV antigens after recovery. A pharmacodynamic model of antibody reactivity identified a decay half-life of 77-100 days and a doubling time of 46-86 days in a high proportion of survivors. The highest antibody reactivity was observed around 200 days after an individual had recovered. The model suggests that EBOV antibody reactivity declines over 0.5-2 years after recovery. In a high proportion of healthy survivors, antibody responses undergo rapid restimulation. Vigilant follow-up of survivors and possible elective de novo antigenic stimulation by vaccine immunization should be considered in order to prevent EBOV viral recrudescence in recovering individuals and thereby to mitigate the potential risk of reseeding an outbreak."

Antibodies periodically wax and wane in survivors of Ebola rather similar to survivors of COVID-19.

For those fortunate enough to have survived a deadly disease, a vital question remains: how long does their hard-earned immunity last? Tracking of antibodies in Ebola survivors reveals a surprising pattern.

The West African Ebola epidemic in 2013-16 was unprecedented in its size, affecting more than 28 000 people. A more recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that ended last June added more than 3000 cases to this total. The scale of these outbreaks is devastating, but there is nevertheless a large pool of survivors. This offers a welcome chance to study the stability of anti-Ebola antibodies, an indication of whether the body's immune system remembers the virus. Numerous groups have reported patients' antibody concentrations during the acute phase of Ebola disease and immediately after, but few studies have measured these levels long after recovery. Writing in Nature, Adaken and colleagues address this knowledge gap.

Little is known about the immunological memory of past Ebola infection. Previous outbreaks have been small and sporadic; the large size of the more recent epidemics, therefore, offers a unique opportunity. Adaken et al. tracked IgG in 115 Ebola survivors for up to 500 days after infection, making it the 1st study of its kind. They found a rapid decline in IgG levels after recovery. However, a substantial proportion of survivors experienced antibody resurgence approximately 200-300 days after recovery; the antibody levels then decayed again. This "decay-stimulation-decay" pattern suggests new antigenic stimulation without overt disease or detectable levels of virus."

The reports presented in this ProMED-mail post address persistence of symptoms or antibodies following acute infection with Ebola and other viruses such as chikungunya over the long term. The reports draw parallels with COVID-19, where persistent symptoms have been reported (e.g., Carfi A et al. Persistent Symptoms in Patients After Acute COVID-19. JAMA. 2020;324(6):603-605. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12603).

It is proposed that the long-term response to viral infection may be due to sequestered virus or lingering protein of the virus attached to surviving cells. Although not mentioned in these reports, long term effects following infection with West Nile virus have been noted (e.g., Sejvar JJ. The long-term outcomes of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Clin Infect Dis. 2007 Jun 15;44(12):1617-24. doi: 10.1086/518281. Epub 2007 May 2. PMID: 17516407) regardless of whether the infection initially led to neurological disease in the acute phase or mild symptoms. Similarly, WNV leads to long term persistence of IgM antibody (Roehrig JT et al. Persistence of Virus-Reactive Serum Immunoglobulin M Antibody in Confirmed West Nile Virus Encephalitis Cases. Emerg Infect Dis. 2003;9(3):376-379. https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid0903.020531).

These sequelae are important to understand because they extend the impact of these viral infections on quality of life and add to the drain on the already taxed medical system. - Mod.LK]
