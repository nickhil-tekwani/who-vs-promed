Avian influenza situation in Lao People's Democratic Republic -- WHO Update 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 16 Mar 2007, the Ministry of Health in Lao People's Democratic
Republic has reported a 2nd human case of infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. The case was fatal.
Initial testing was conducted by the National Centre for Laboratory
and Epidemiology in Laos. In line with WHO policy, samples were sent
to a WHO collaborating laboratory in Tokyo for diagnostic
verification and further analysis. The collaborating centre has now
confirmed H5N1 infection.
The 42-year-old female was from Saka village, Pong Hong district in
Vientiane province. She developed fever on 26 Feb 200, was
hospitalized in Vientiane Provincial hospital on 28 Feb 2007 and then
transferred to Sethathirat hospital on 1 Mar 2007, where she died on
4 Mar 2007. Tests taken during an investigation to determine the
source of exposure have found a duck positive for H5 in the woman's
household. Close family and hospital contacts are being monitored and
to date, none has shown signs of infection.
WHO continues to work closely with the Lao government to strengthen
case reporting, improve diagnostic capacity, and increase awareness
of the disease in the community.

[2] Laos - 2nd confirmed case (fatal)

Laos: tests confirm 2nd bird flu death
--------------------------------------
Tests have confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus killed a
42-year-old woman in Laos, who possibly had contact with an infected
duck, the Lao Health Ministry and World Health Organisation (WHO)said
on Friday [16 Mar 2007]. The woman, the 2nd confirmed bird flu death
in landlocked Laos, fell ill in late February [2007] and died on 4 Mar 2007.
A healthy duck kept at her home in a province near the capital
Vientiane, had tested positive for H5, the Lao Health Ministry and
the WHO said in a joint statement. The government has stepped up
surveillance and containment measures since a 15-year-old girl fell
sick from bird flu in February [2007], and died on 8 Mar 2007.
The virus appears to be spreading among poultry into southern
provinces of the impoverished Communist-led country after outbreaks
around Vientiane in January [2007], the 1st in 7 months. "We ask the
Lao people to join together to halt the spread of the disease,"
Health Minister Ponmek Dalaloy said in the statement.

[3] Indonesia - 65th fatal case

Indonesia: 65th Fatal case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection
------------------------------------------------------------------
A 32-year-old Indonesian man has died of bird flu, bringing the death
toll from the virus in the country to 65, a health ministry official
said on Fri 16 Mar 2007.
The man died at Persahabatan hospital in the capital Jakarta on
Thursday morning [15 Mar 2007], Ahmad Prihatna, an epidemiologist at
the health ministry's bird flu information centre said by telephone.
The man kept a pet bird in his house, the official added. "But it has
not been determined whether the bird was infected with bird flu," he
said. The man was admitted to Persahabatan hospital, one of Jakarta's
2 bird flu treatment centers, on Wednesday [14 Mar 2007], after being
treated at another hospital in the eastern part of Jakarta.
Indonesia, which has millions of backyard fowl, has the world's
highest death toll from the H5N1 bird flu virus. Bird flu is endemic
in fowl in many of the 33 provinces in Indonesia and there was a
sudden increase in the number of human deaths from the virus early
this year [2007] after a brief lull. The country has tried to
intensify efforts to control the disease by banning backyard fowl in
Jakarta and surrounding provinces, and increasing culling. Although
H5N1 avian flu mainly affects birds, the big concern is that it could
mutate into a disease that easily passes between people, triggering a
global pandemic.
In a controversial move, Jakarta declared last month [February 2007]
it had stopped sharing H5N1 samples with the World Health
Organization (WHO), saying it would only share them with parties who
agreed not to use them for commercial reasons. The 2 sides then
struck a deal on February 16 [2007] to resume sharing samples, but
under a new framework to give developing nations access to vaccines.
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said on Wednesday [14 Mar 2007]
Indonesia would only resume sharing samples after a global mechanism
of virus sharing was in place. The sharing mechanism is expected to
be discussed at a meeting of health ministers from the Asia-Pacific
region and select countries in Jakarta, on 27-28 Mar 2007, but the
new mechanism would still need to be discussed at a WHO advisory
board meeting in May [2007].
Indonesia has said it had restricted sharing samples with foreign
laboratories because it is unfair for foreign drug firms to use the
samples, design vaccines, patent them, and sell the product back to
the country. But sharing of virus samples is crucial as it allows
experts to study their make-up and map the evolution and geographical
spread of any particular strain. Samples are also used to make vaccines.
