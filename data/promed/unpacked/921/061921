_Citrus tristeza virus_ is destroying orange groves in Sicily
--------------------------------------------------------------
The _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV) has infected thousands of hectares of orange groves in Sicily. CTV started spreading near Catania. A Sicilian producer testified on the losses caused by the virus: "During the 1st year, we lost 60 plants in 17 hectares, 1000 in the 2nd and 3000 in the 3rd."

By taking part at a meeting on 21 Mar 2013 between protesting transporters and the president of Sicily, a delegation of autonomous citrus growers (organisations are considered negligent as regards the matter) managed to put the CTV question on the agenda. The Region therefore committed to opening a debate with the European Commission regarding the virus which is destroying orange groves.

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of _Rutacea_), it affects hosts in only few other families, and it appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in severity, and symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination. The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. CTV has been included on the alert lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting and a mild type, and may occur singly or in combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas. Disease management for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum, and vector control.

In Italy, the 1st report of a significant outbreak in a citrus-growing area was reported from Sicilia in 2003 (ProMED-mail post 20030312.0609). It appears that, unfortunately, since then no effective CTV control measures have been implemented leading to the current high CTV incidence in Sicilian citrus.
