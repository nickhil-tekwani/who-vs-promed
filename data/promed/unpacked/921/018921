Do not neglect inflammation in the eye, warn doctors. The cases of conjunctivitis or pink eye are usually prevalent during the summer season. However, a large number of cases have been reported during the month this year [October 2014] in Mysore district [Karnataka state].

Ophthalmologists in the city who have been receiving a good number of cases since the last fortnight, have issued precautions for others, to avoid getting infected. Speaking to Deccan Herald, Dr Rajesh K V, Chief Medical Officer, Vasan Eye Care Hospital, said the hospital has been receiving about 20 cases a day during the past week. The allergy [?] can spread easily from person to person, he said. Dr Kantharaj of K R Hospital said that the Eye Hospital too was receiving many cases, but had decreased in the past few days. He added that precaution was necessary to avoid infection.

He said that there were 2 types of conjunctivitis -- viral and bacterial, both causing purulent discharge in the eye (pus formation). "The condition, if it affects a large number of people, is usually bacterial conjunctivitis," he said. He added that the duration of viral conjunctivitis was more than that of bacterial conjunctivitis, with the latter lasting for about 7 days.

While there were antibiotics against bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis usually subsides on its own, he said. "Patients should consult ophthalmologists, if there is an inflammation in the eye. If not treated in time, the condition will take a while to reduce," he said. The cases recorded were typically more among children.

District Health Officer, Dr K Puttaswamy, said that most of the cases were reported from urban areas. "There have not been any reports of conjunctivitis from rural areas yet. We will have to await the monthly report to know whether cases have been reported in rural pockets too," he added.

[Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as "red" or "pink" eye, a sign of inflammation that is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water). A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A mucopurulent or purulent discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea, and is accompanied by conjunctivitis. However, the news report above does not give us a clinical description of the outbreak cases.

Outbreaks of conjunctivitis are commonly due to viruses (e.g., adenoviruses and enteroviruses), adenoviruses being a common cause (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf). Conjunctivitis due to adenoviruses is spread through hand-to-eye contact or by contact with objects, such as ophthalmologic equipment, that are contaminated with infectious tears, eye discharge, or respiratory discharges. There may be prolonged shedding of adenovirus; a person can be contagious a few days before developing symptoms to approximately 14 days after symptom onset; and adenovirus may be resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain viable for long periods in the environment (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf). Treatment of viral conjunctivitis is supportive.

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by conjunctival erythema and edema and subconjunctival hemorrhages and caused by either coxsackie group A24 and enterovirus E70. AHC may be accompanied by polio-like neurologic involvement (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/147/4/660.abstract). Epidemics of AHC have occurred worldwide, spread by the fecal-oral route especially where sanitation is poor (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1203216-overview). AHC usually resolves without sequelae.

Mysore District, with a population of over 2.5 million people, is the 3rd largest city in the state of Karnataka, India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_district).
