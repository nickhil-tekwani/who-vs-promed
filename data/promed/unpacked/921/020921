The Miyazaki Prefectural Government said Tuesday [1 Feb 2011] that
191 chickens died at a poultry farm in the city of Miyazaki and that
6 of the 7 dead birds tested positive for avian influenza in a
preliminary exam.

Officials decided to launch more detailed examinations on the 6 dead
birds to confirm whether they were infected with bird flu. It would
be the prefecture's 7th outbreak.

In Tottori Prefecture, meanwhile, officials said the highly virulent
strain of the H5N1 virus was detected in 2 wild birds that tested
positive for avian flu in earlier tests.

The infection, involving a tufted duck and hooded gull found in a
weakened state in Yonago last month [January 2011], marks the 2nd
outbreak of a highly virulent strain of bird flu in Tottori this
winter.

No signs of infection have been confirmed so far among the 924 000
chickens at 18 poultry farms within 10 km of where the 2 wild birds
were found, the prefectural government said.

The Hokkaido government said detailed tests on a dead whooper swan
recovered in the town of Hamanaka in mid-January 2011 were positive
for the H5N1 virus, the 6th case of a wild bird infected with bird
flu in Hokkaido.

In Aichi Prefecture, 2 quail farms in Toyohashi resumed shipping
quail eggs for the 1st time in 6 days after a ban was put in place on
transporting birds and eggs following the outbreak of highly
pathogenic avian influenza at a chicken farm there.

The prefecture authorized quail farms within a 10-km radius of where
the bird flu had broken out to restart egg shipments after confirming
the farms had taken measures to prevent infection.
