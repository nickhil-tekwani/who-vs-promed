The Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Nov 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 3 Nov 2006:
-----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 158
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 164
(The next table will be published on Mon 4 Dec 2006).
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Nov
2006, the total number of deaths from definite vCJD has increased by
2 and stands at 158, and the overall total number of definite or
probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) has increased by 2, making the
overall total 164.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The total number of deaths due to vCJD in the UK is
now 158. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed
by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005. The
number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during
the 1st 10 months of 2006 has risen to 5.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2005 and 2006
-----------------------------------------------
As of 3 Nov 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 122
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 65 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from vCJD.
The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 10 months of 2006 are:
87 referrals, 48 deaths from sporadic CJD, 5 from vCJD, 4 from
familial CJD, 3 from GSS and one from iatrogenic CJD.
During the period 1995, when vCJD was 1st diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 946 deaths from all forms of CJD, including
the 158 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD.

UK. The NEUROCJD project started in 1998 after the European Union
Council recommended that epidemiological surveillance of CJD should
be extended to all member states. The member states involved in this
project are Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland,
Israel, Norway and Portugal. Both projects are coordinated from the
National CJD Surveillance Unit based in Edinburgh.

[3] France: novel prion strain
Date: Thu 12 Oct 2006
From: Terry Singeltary <flounder9@verizon.net>
Source: PLoS Pathogens 2(10); published ahead of print [edited]
<http://pathogens.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020112>

Terry S. Singeltary Sr. has drawn ProMED-mail's attention to the
following paper published ahead of print in PLoS Pathogens, which
although not directly featuring vCJD, he considers is relevant to
understanding the origin of the BSE outbreak in cattle and vCJD in
humans. He comments that this research indicates that different prion
disease phenotypes result from inoculation of cattle with 2
temporally separated sources of sheep scrapie from Great Britain.
The paper is entitled "Isolation from Cattle of a Prion Strain
Distinct from That Causing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy" and is
authored by Vincent Beringue and 10 others. The abstract reads as follows:
"To date, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its human
counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been associated
with a single prion strain. This strain is characterized by a unique
and remarkably stable biochemical profile of abnormal
protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) isolated from brains of
affected animals or humans. However, alternate PrP(res) signatures in
cattle have recently been discovered through large-scale screening.
To test whether these also represent separate prion strains, we
inoculated French cattle isolates characterized by a PrP(res) of
higher apparent molecular mass, called H-type, into transgenic mice
expressing bovine or ovine PrP. All mice developed neurological
symptoms and succumbed to these isolates, showing that these
represent a novel strain of infectious prions. Importantly, this
agent exhibited strain-specific features clearly distinct from that
of BSE agent inoculated to the same mice, which were retained on
further passage. Moreover, it also differed from all sheep scrapie
isolates passaged so far in ovine PrP-expressing mice. Our findings
therefore raise the possibility that either various prion strains may
exist in cattle, or that the BSE agent has undergone divergent
evolution in some animals."
The authors' synopsis of their paper reads as follows: Prions are
unconventional agents of proteic nature that are formed of abnormal
conformations of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP). They cause
fatal neurodegenerative diseases in both animals and humans and can
be transmitted between species, as exemplified in humans by the
emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease following the epidemic
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom.
Since diagnosis of prion infection is only possible once the central
nervous system has been invaded, brains of slaughtered or fallen
cattle are routinely screened in Europe to protect the consumers from
BSE. This has unexpectedly led to the discovery of unprecedented PrP
conformations that were distinct from the single one associated so
far with BSE or BSE-related diseases. To precisely determine their
etiology, the authors have studied the transmissibility of these new
conformations, termed H-type, to transgenic mice expressing either
bovine or ovine PrP. They show that these cases are highly pathogenic
for these mice. The authors also demonstrate that they are not
directly related to the agent involved in the BSE epidemic,
supporting the view for isolation of a new prion strain from cattle,
whose prevalence and associated zoonotic risk should be carefully
monitored in the future."
