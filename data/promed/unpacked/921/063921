Crews at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Aurora [Colorado] are trying to keep scabies from spreading. It's a highly contagious infestation of mites that burrow into the skin. The people living in one dorm are being kept away from everyone else.

A spokeswoman says these cases typically involve someone who is already infected when they arrive at the southern border. Scabies is treated with a topical medicine.

ICE officials released the following statement [Mon 9 Dec 2019]: "With the recent influx of migrants entering from the US southern border, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has confirmed 6 cases of scabies at our Aurora Contract Detention Facility (ACDF). On-site medical personnel are credited with reducing the risk of further spreading the disease by quickly cohorting the 6 infected detainees along with 19 others who were also exposed to the disease.

"Each ICE detainee receives a medical examination upon arrival at the facility to check for potential signs of illness. However, ICE has no way of knowing what diseases or viruses a person may have been exposed before they enter the facility".

"A topical ointment will be administered to ICE detainees once the ointment is received at ACDF, which is anticipated to be [10 Dec 2019]. Once the treatment is administered, detainees will be removed from cohort. ICE and the on-site medical professionals employed by GEO took the necessary steps to quickly isolate the exposed detainees, provide proper medical care and prevent further spread of the disease. Preventative steps included early recognition and following the guidelines established by the CDC and the ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC)."
