More than 4000 people in Denmark may be infected with salmonella in
what may become the worst outbreak there in 15 years, health
officials said Wednesday [2 Jul 2008]. Urgent checks are being
conducted to find the source of a salmonellosis outbreak that
officials say may be caused by a food product distributed only in
Denmark, but no single source has yet been named.

According to the Danish Ministry of Health, 330 cases have been
confirmed and about a quarter of those people have been hospitalized.
No deaths have been reported. Officials at the government's center
for prevention and control of infectious diseases say the real number
probably exceeds 4000 people.

About 30 new cases are reported every day and the number has risen
significantly over the past 6 weeks. Officials suspect the outbreak
to be linked to meat products. The strain has been identified as
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium U292, a fairly rare type
of the disease.

[Apparently the outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium U (undefined phage type)
292 has been ongoing in Denmark since February 2008 but, with the
onset of warmer weather, has begun to increase prominently.
ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this growing cluster.
