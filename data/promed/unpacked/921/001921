Another case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] has been reported, this time in Carteret County.

Carteret County Department of Human Services said in a press release that an 8-year-old mare was euthanized after contracting EEE. At least 3 other cases have been discovered in eastern North Carolina: 2 horses in Onslow County and a donkey in Duplin County. No human cases have been identified in the state this year [2018].

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare disease that is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. EEE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Only a few cases of people infected by EEE are reported in the United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most years, no human cases are reported in North Carolina, but in the years when one (or rarely 2) cases are reported, they tend to be from the eastern part of North Carolina where the virus is normally passed back and forth between wild birds and mosquitoes.

EEE virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Disease transmission does not occur directly from person to person. Anyone in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with EEE virus. The risk is highest for people who live or visit woodland habitats, and people who work outside or participate in outdoor recreational activities, because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes.

Most persons affected with EEE have no apparent symptoms. According to CDC, severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma, which may result in death or in severe brain damage. About one in 3 reported symptomatic cases is fatal, with young children and the elderly most at-risk.

There is no vaccine to protect humans from EEE and no cure once a human is infected. Therapy is limited to treating the symptoms of the disease. "If someone is experiencing flu-like symptoms, including a fever and a headache, they should contact their medical provider immediately," states Kim Davis, Nursing Director, for the Carteret County Health Department.

The Health Department and Animal Control encourage horse owners to take this opportunity to speak with their veterinarian to make sure their horses have been fully vaccinated. There is a vaccine for horses to protect against EEE. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends vaccination against EEE as a part of a core vaccination protocol:

Once a horse is infected, therapy is limited to treating the signs of the disease, and there is no specific cure.

The Health Department advises the public to remain diligent in their personal mosquito protection efforts. These efforts should include the "5 D's" for prevention in human beings:

-- Dusk and Dawn: Minimize time outdoors when mosquitoes are seeking blood. The common species that transmit EEE to humans often bite at just before or after sunset.

-- Dress: Wear loose, light-colored clothing that covers most of your skin.

-- DEET: When the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes, repellents containing DEET are recommended. Picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are other repellent options. See http://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents for options.

-- Drainage: Check your home to rid the area of standing water, which is where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

-- Dispose of any tires. Tires can breed thousands of mosquitoes.

-- Drill holes in the bottom of recycling containers.

-- Clear roof gutter of debris.

-- Clean pet water dishes regularly.

-- Check and empty children's toys.

-- Repair leaky outdoor faucets.

-- Change the water in bird baths at least once a week.

-- Turn over canoes and other boats or treat them with approved larvicides.

-- Avoid water collecting on pool covers.

-- Empty water collected in tarps around the yard or on woodpiles.

-- Plug or fill tree holes.

- Add minnows to isolated water such as rain barrels and ornamental ponds.

For more information on Carteret County mosquito spraying efforts and how to request mosquito spraying in your area, please contact Carteret County Public Works at (252) 648-7878. For more information on health prevention efforts, please contact the Carteret County Health Department at (252) 728-8550.

A horse in Suffolk has tested positive for a deadly mosquito-borne disease.

The horse was taken to the veterinary hospital at North Carolina State University in late July 2018 where it died. It is the 1st recorded case of the disease in Virginia this year [2018].

Tests on the horse, a quarter horse mare, confirmed it died from EEE, which has an 80 to 90 percent mortality rate.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture said the horse was not properly vaccinated against the disease. Horses are supposed to receive a booster every 6 to 12 months following an initial vaccination.

Otherwise known as "sleeping sickness," the disease causes a swelling and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

Signs of the disease include impaired vision, circling, inability to swallow, staggering gait, convulsions and paralysis.

[This disease is carried by mosquitoes. There is a very effective vaccine. The EEE vaccine is usually combined with other vaccines, such as for western equine encephalitis, and West Nile virus, and usually a vaccine for tetanus is included.

In areas where the virus is circulating or where there have been frequent rains and thus more mosquitoes, it may be wise to vaccinate every 4-6 months to keep immunity at a peak level, as EEE immunity can wane somewhat faster than immunity to the other diseases in the vaccine. Extra vaccination is well worth it. - Mod.TG
