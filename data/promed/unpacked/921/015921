Thousands of people from 7 villages along the Baram river as well as
Penan settlements along the Silat river are feared to be threatened
by a malaria outbreak, with at least 5 confirmed cases in the last
few days.

The 7 villages in Ulu Baram comprise Long San, Long Selatong, Tanjong
Tepalit, Long Apu, Long Julan, Long Anap and Long Palai.

Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Dr George Chan confirmed
the outbreak when met at Miri Airport yesterday [4 Jul 2010].

Without giving the full details, Dr Chan, who is also chairman of the
State Disaster and Relief Management Committee, said quite a few of
the people in the affected areas were suspected to have contracted
the disease.

"I have been informed by medical officers on the cases. A medical
team has already been dispatched to the area to get a clearer picture
of the outbreak," he disclosed.

Five villagers from Long Palai, including the village head, had been
admitted to Miri Hospital in the last few days. All were confirmed to
have contracted _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria, a common type of malaria
which normally occurs in temperate regions and is not
life-threatening.

However, regarding one of the patients, a 60-year-old who was
reported dead at about 1:00 AM on Friday [2 Jul 2010], Dr Chan
clarified that his death was not due to malaria but other health
problems.

Meanwhile, Telang Usan assemblyman Lihan Jok, when contacted
yesterday [2 Jul 2010], said he had been informed and had sent his
men to go to the ground to get the full picture. The situation is
under control at the moment, he said, urging the people in the
affected areas not to panic.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease, and those who contract it show
symptoms that include fever and headache. In severe cases, the
disease can lead to hallucinations, coma and death.

[_Plasmodium vivax_ is not as benign as stated in the paper,
especially with people with little or no previous immunity to
malaria, as recently reviewed by Baird JK (Severe and fatal vivax
malaria challenges 'benign tertian malaria' dogma. Ann Trop Paediatr.
2009;29:251-2). There is no indication in the report on what
triggered the increased transmission. - Mod.EP]
