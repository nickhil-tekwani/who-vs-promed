[Submitted in response to the ProMED-mail post archived as: Mumps -
Canada (02): (BC) alert 20110622.1912. - Mod.CP]

Background:
Vancouver Coastal Health Authority has been investigating an outbreak
of mumps occurring initially in Whistler and spreading more recently
to surrounding municipalities. Mumps is a viral illness characterized
by swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. In severe cases,
meningitis, orchitis (testicular swelling) and hearing loss can
occur.

Since February 2011, a total of 90 cases have been reported, mostly
in young adults.

Setting:
Whistler is a popular ski and outdoor activities destination north of
Vancouver that attracts visitors and seasonal employees from all over
the world. The permanent population of Whistler is estimated to be
approximately 10 500, although the area attracts over 2700 seasonal
employees and 14 800 visitors each year. An additional estimated 3700
employees commute to Whistler on a daily basis from surrounding
communities, increasing the daily average population to approximately
32 000. The entire region of Vancouver Coastal Health, which includes
Whistler, has a population of 1.1 million.

Epidemiology:
Mumps is spread by direct contact with the saliva of an infected
person. Current case definition includes individuals having symptoms
consistent with mumps illness and:
(a) laboratory confirmation of mumps RNA; or
(b) epidemiological links to a laboratory confirmed case; or
(c) recent travel to Whistler.

The earliest date of symptom onset was 22 Feb 2011 in a Whistler
resident, and while cases continue to reside predominantly in the
Whistler region, increasing numbers of cases in surrounding cities,
including Vancouver and Richmond, have been reported. Several of these
recent cases have no known links to Whistler; though many are
clustered among the same household or social network.

The disease is primarily affecting young adults; the median age of
all cases is 27.0 years (age range: 1-54 years), and 54 cases (60.0
per cent) are male.

Transmission among initial Whistler-linked cases was primarily by
sharing marijuana joints, cigarettes, drinks, and utensils.

Nearly 60 per cent of cases with links to Whistler are employed
either by the mountain resort or in the hospitality and retail sector.
These sectors employ a largely seasonal workforce arising from many
different countries across the globe.

Clinical presentation:
Nearly all cases presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis
(97.8 per cent). 22 per cent of male cases presented with orchitis.
Other symptoms included fever (58.9 per cent), myalgia (34.4 per
cent), headache (24.4 per cent), pharyngitis (22.2 per cent),
arthralgia (7.8 per cent), fatigue (7.8 per cent), and nausea (5.6 per
cent).

Identified cases have been encouraged to self-isolate for 9 days
following symptom onset.

Immunization history:
The majority of cases have not received the 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine needed for full protection. As Whistler hosts
a largely transient (and international) population, immunization
histories of residents vary greatly.

In our health region, most children and youth born between 1970 and
1995 will not have had 2 doses of MMR, as the 2nd dose was not
included in the routine immunization schedule for this age group. A
2nd MMR at 18 months of age became part of routine infant immunization
in 1996.

Genotype:
16 cases to date have been confirmed as Genotype G, a common genotype
of mumps that was observed in several other recent North American
outbreaks.

Public health response to date:
- Notification has been given to all primary care providers and
emergency physicians in the health region to be vigilant for patients
presenting with swelling of the parotid gland, or other
mumps-compatible illness.

- Collection of laboratory specimens including blood for serology and
buccal swabs and/or urine for detection of mumps virus RNA.

- Recommendation of 2 doses of mumps containing vaccine for all
individuals born on or after 1 Jan 1970. One dose is recommended for
all individuals born between 1 Jan 1957 and 31 Dec 1969 who do not
have evidence of immunity to mumps.

- Notification to all health jurisdictions across Canada through the
CNPHI (Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence) web platform.

- Media advisory in Whistler (March and April 2011) on outbreak and
information on where to access vaccine and messaging for those without
health insurance.

- Drop-in immunization clinics have been held at the Whistler Health
Care Centre since March 2011.

- A targeted immunization campaign was launched in Whistler to
coincide with the 10-day Telus Ski & Snowboard Festival (15-24 Apr
2011), the largest annual winter sports and music festival in North
America. Over 600 doses of MMR were given to contacts of cases and
individuals who live and work in Whistler through vaccination at
worksites and a drop-in clinic at a centrally located community
pharmacy. Approximately 50 per cent of those taking up vaccination
were overseas nationals of Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom,
South Africa, and smaller numbers from other European and Asian
countries.

Further planned public health response:
- Continued messaging and immunization to target post-secondary
educational institutions in the region with a particular focus on new
students arriving in August 2011 for the start of the new academic
year.

- Targeted immunization at staff orientations to be held by major
employers in the resort municipality of Whistler in anticipation of
new international staff arriving in the fall [2011].

Since the previous report, the number of confirmed cases of mumps
virus infection has increased from 77 to 90, indicating that the
outbreak has not yet been contained. ProMED-mail thanks Dr Jat Sandu
and colleagues for provision of this detailed account of the current
situation regarding the mumps outbreak centered on the Whistler resort
area of British Columbia and the response of the local health
authority.
