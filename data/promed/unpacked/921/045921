Dirty needle suspected in outbreak of hepatitis
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis C among 56 children is thought to have been
caused by the use of unsterilized syringe needles at a private clinic
in central China's Henan Province.

The infected children, from Dacheng Town in neighboring Anhui
Province, all received injections at Miaoqian Village clinic,
according to a preliminary investigation by the Anhui health
administration, the Xinhua news agency reported yesterday. Angry
parents claimed doctors used a single syringe needle for dozens of
children without sterilizing it, according to Star News.

Several villages in Guoyang County, Anhui, use the clinic, which is on
the border between the provinces, the mother of a 2-year-old infected
boy told the newspaper. A 5-year-old child was the 1st to be diagnosed
with hepatitis C after a routine check-up 2 weeks ago. He was
transferred to a hospital in the provincial capital, Hefei, last week,
the newspaper said. His father said the boy could not sleep and cried
at night. "His hands have swelled up with days of drips," he added.
The infected children are being treated at hospitals in Hefei,
Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing.

Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting the liver. There may be
no obvious symptoms but it can lead to liver failure or even liver
cancer. It is spread by blood-to-blood contact.

[Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV
infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic illness. It can
range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a
serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the
liver and liver cancer. HCV is transmitted through contact with the
blood of an infected person. The virus is most commonly transmitted
through exposure to infectious blood such as through: receipt of
contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ
transplants; and as in this case injections given with contaminated
syringes/needles in health-care settings.

Following initial infection, approximately 80 percent of people do not
exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may
exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and
jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).

The long term consequences of the HCV infection for some of these
children in Anhui province may be serious and ultimately
life-threatening. Statistically, 60-70 percent of persistently
infected people develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 percent develop
cirrhosis, and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
