North Sumatra bird flu alert
-----------------------------
Cases of bird flu [HPAI H5N1] continue to be a concern, due to the
lethal nature of this disease. Based on the study during January and
February 2011, hundreds of birds died suddenly in 4 regions in North
Sumatra. The 4 affected areas are Serdang Bedagai Regency, Deli
Serdang, South Tapanuli, and the city Tebing Tinggi. Thus far, the
infection has remained limited to poultry, not affecting humans.

Farmers have been urged to report any poultry mortality immediately
to the relevant agencies, including the village and local districts. A
circular was distributed to districts to increase their vigilance
against viruses that attack birds.

[The communicator added: "It seems soon we will hear about (1st?)
cases of avian influenza in humans in North Sumatra.... One (of the 4)
outbreaks happened in a suburb (Pancur Batu) of Medan, a metropolitan
area with 4 million people in total."

In 2006, HPAI H5N1 spread in North Sumatra in poultry. During that
year, a cluster of "up to 8 members of a family" was reported from
Medan; this case, reportedly affecting "3 generations", was later
discussed (see ProMED-mail posts 20060518.1393 and 20100722.2463).
