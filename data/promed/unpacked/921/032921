The State confirmed a fourth West Nile virus (WNV) positive horse in
Connecticut. The Middlefield horse had not traveled. Its condition is
improving. Other horses in the stable were reported to have no signs of
sickness.
Also, 7 additional WNV positive birds were found in 5 new towns. The birds
were collected 6-18 Sep 2000, from the towns of: Clinton (2 crows), East
Haven (1 crow), Guilford (1 crow), Lyme (1 crow), Redding (2 crows). As of
5 Oct 2000, 568 birds have tested positive for WNV ­ 561 crows and 2
bluejays, 2 robins, one dove, one finch, and one cowbird ­ from 72
different towns.

Test Results as of 4 Oct 2000 [edited
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/104results.htm>

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 42 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 17 were negative and 21 are pending.
These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered. New
Jersey's positive human cases include an 82-year old Little Falls man who
became ill 3 Sep 2000, was admitted to a hospital 3 days later, and died 14
Sep 2000. New Jersey's other human cases include a 43-year old Jersey City
man, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside
Park, Bergen County, and a 72-year old Bayonne woman. All 3 individuals
have either recovered or are recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, 1 015 birds (1 014 crows and a cockatiel) found in 17 counties
have tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been
found in Atlantic (1), Bergen (188), Burlington (11), Camden (3), Cape May
(3), Essex (99), Gloucester (4), Hudson (63), Hunterdon (5), Mercer (9),
Middlesex (213), Monmouth (146), Morris (49), Ocean (13), Passaic (79),
Somerset (24) and Union (105) Counties. The tests were conducted at the
Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton. A total of 1 772
crows have been accepted for testing this year.
Mosquito and House Sparrow and Testing
Thirty-seven mosquito pools collected in Bergen (20), Essex (1), Middlesex
(3), Monmouth (3), Passaic (8) and Sussex (2) Counties have tested positive
for the presence of WNV. In total, 14 020 mosquito pools from all 21
counties have been collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control
Unit and tested by the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples are taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all
21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture for the
presence of WNV. To date, one chicken, stationed in Middlesex County, has
tested positive for WNV. The National Veterinary Services Lab (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa, has confirmed the test results. Sentinel chickens previously
reported by the Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination Commission (8 Sep
2000) as being positive for WNV have been re-tested by the New Jersey
Department of Agriculture and NSVL and do not have the virus. The WNV
positive chicken reported today from Middlesex County is the first chicken
from the sentinel program to be found with the virus this year in New Jersey.
Horse Testing
A total of 11 horses from Atlantic (2), Burlington (2), Cape May (1),
Monmouth (2), Ocean (2) and Sussex (2) Counties have tested positive for
WNV. Equine testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to
NVSL for confirmation.

A total of 6 horses were classified as having cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection this week. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories
(NVSL) found that all 6 were WNV-positive on a 1:1000 dilution (or greater)
of serum on IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Five of
the horses also had WNV-positive results on a 1:10 dilution (greater) of
serum on a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and, based on their
history of clinical illness, were classified as confirmed cases. The sixth
horse, from Middletown, New York, was classified as a probable case. This
brings to 15 the total number of equine cases of WNV infection in 2000.
Equine cases of WNV infection in the United States, 2000:
1 - Staten Island, New York - 26 y.o. gelding; onset 8/17, euthanatized 8/20
2 - Wakefield, Rhode Island - 2 y.o. mare; onset 8/23, euthanatized 8/28
3 - Tuckahoe, New Jersey - 6 y.o. gelding; onset 8/27, euthanatized 8/30
4 - Bedford, Massachusetts - 12 y.o. gelding; onset 8/26, euthanatized 8/29

14 - Middletown, New York - 17 y.o. gelding; onset 9/04?, still alive
15 - Hammonton, New Jersey - 14 y.o. mare; date of onset unknown, recovered
(but later euthanatized due to another problem)
The European Union previously issued import restrictions, in effect since
15 Sep 2000, for horses originating from the 5 States that have had an
equine case of WNV. No other countries have notified the USDA of any
WNV-related restrictions on the importation of horses.
6 additional mammals were reported as WNV-positive in New York this week,
including a raccoon and 2 cats from Albany County. Three squirrels were
also found positive in 3 different counties: Bronx, Kings, and Richmond.
There were 307 more birds reported as positive for WNV during the week. The
first confirmation of WNV activity in Pennsylvania was reported, as a total
of 4 positive crows were reported from 3 counties: Bucks, Chester, and
Delaware. Over 2 500 birds have now been documented as infected with WNV in
2000.
One new sentinel chicken was confirmed as WNV-positive in Queens County,
New York. The bird was located in Jamaica, New York, and was bled on 14
September. This is only the second sentinel bird found positive in 2000.
The cumulative totals for the period 1 May 2000 through 30 Sep 2000 are the
following: 16 humans, 15 equines, 25 other mammals, 2 510 birds, 350
mosquito pools, and 2 sentinel birds.

West Nile Virus Infected Crows In Washington D.C.
-------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne illness that has moved inexorably
southward this year with the fall bird migration, has for the first time
appeared in the District and Montgomery County, officials said yesterday. A
total of 2 dead crows found in recent days in and around Rockville have
tested positive for the virus, along with 2 others from neighborhoods in
the District, according to Maryland and city officials. These discoveries
marked a geographic jump from the area south of Baltimore, where the virus
first turned up in Maryland 2 weeks ago, as well as the southernmost
extension of the virus since it appeared in the United States last year.
The state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's announcement yesterday
also said that 6 more infected crows were found in Baltimore and Baltimore
County, bringing to 21 the number of infections found in the state.
Virginia officials said yesterday that no infected birds or mosquitoes had
been found there, although Suzanne Jenkins, assistant state epidemiologist,
said, "I wouldn't be surprised if it was here now and we just haven't found
it." No human infections have been reported in Maryland, Virginia or the
District.

More West Nile Virus Infected Crows found in Baltimore
-------------------------------------------------------
The state's mosquito-spraying campaign moved into eastern Baltimore County
Thursday night after 2 dead crows infected with the West Nile virus were
found in Eastpoint and Dundalk. A total of 4 more infected crows were also
found in Baltimore, and 2 in Montgomery County - the first in the
Washington suburbs. In all, 21 infected crows have been found this year in
Maryland.
Also Thursday, Washington, D.C., announced the discovery of 2 infected
crows in that city's northwest section. The southward movement of the virus
in September and October is consistent with a federal government prediction
last week that the virus would spread south with fall bird migrations.
The pesticide Permethrin is being used in Maryland in the hope it will kill
enough adult mosquitoes to delay the inevitable entrenchment of the virus
in the local mosquito and bird populations. "There's no question it's in
the country to stay," said state Agriculture Department spokesman Don
Vandrey. In time, he said, West Nile-related spray campaigns will become "a
normal part of summer living." Baltimore Health Commissioner Peter L.
Beilenson said Thursday the spray campaign in the city is probably over for
the year because of cool weather, even though more dead crows are waiting
to be tested and may prove to be infected.

West Nile Virus Confirmed In Dauphin County Horse
-------------------------------------------------
HARRISBURG: On 4 Oct 2000, the Department of Health announced that West
Nile virus has been found in a horse in East Hanover Township, Dauphin
County. The 25-year-old infected horse from the Capital Area Therapeutic
Riding Association horse farm was put down on 22 Sep 2000 after it began to
show signs of encephalitis. The state Department of Agriculture and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture now have confirmed the horse's West Nile
virus infection.
This is the first confirmed case of West Nile infection in a Pennsylvanian
horse. An infected horse does not transmit the virus to people and does not
pose a threat to other horses or people who may have come in contact with
or cared for the horse. Agriculture Secretary Samuel Hayes Jr. said
concerned horse owners should contact their veterinarian. A fact sheet for
horse owners also is available through the West Nile website,
.
Also reported was confirmation [first reported 26 and 28 Sep 2000 of West
Nile virus in Bucks (2 crows), Chester (1 crow) and Delaware (1 crow)
Counties. Previously no positive birds or mosquito pools had been found in
Pennsylvania. <http://www.westnile.state.pa.us/StateSummary/>

Chicken Color Hypothesis
-------------------------
The hypothesis that chickens do not make good sentinels because of their
color needs further investigation. This would mean a difference between
_Culex_ transmitting West Nile virus and _Culiseta_ or _ Culex_
transmitting Eastern equine encephalitis virus or Western equine
encephalitis virus, respectively. Having had no experience with sentinel
chickens and St Louis encephalitis virus, I would be interested in comments
from those who have.
This year in Connecticut, we found West Nile virus antibody in white geese
at the same place we tested chickens of many different colors and did not
find antibody.

Sentinel Chicken Color Unlikely to be Relevant
----------------------------------------------
In the previous West Nile Virus surveillance - USA (40) post, it was
suggested that an explanation for the poor performance of sentinel chickens
might be that _Culex_ spp. mosquitos are attracted mostly to black or dark
birds. Consequently, if White Leghorn chickens are being employed as
sentinels, they are less well-endowed to function as sentinels.
This seems a feeble explanation at best; White Leghorn chickens have been
used successfully as sentinels for Western equine encephalitis and St.
Louis encephalitis viruses in other parts of the USA. Also, _Culex_
mosquitoes typically feed mainly during crepuscular periods and at night.
The hypothesis put forward would require that such mosquitoes have night
vision sufficient for distinguishing light and dark colors.

Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Sentinel Vertebrates
------------------------------------------------------------
We read with interest the hypothesis that the failure of northeast sentinel
flocks to detect West Nile virus (WNV) was possibly due to _Culex_ not
being attracted to white chickens. We can assure readers that Florida's
experience does not support this. Both white and dark chickens attract
_Culex_, and the Florida sentinel program is a proven indicator of St.
Louis encephalitis virus transmission by _Culex nigripalpus_.
We are puzzled by the large numbers of different bird species with reported
WNV "positives", many of which are not subject to substantial mosquito
feeding, i.e., hummingbirds and a cockatiel in a 6th floor New York
apartment. In view of these, it seems far-fetched to advocate that white
chickens are the only avians not attractive in this setting.
Sentinel vertebrate surveillance can provide a near real-time measure of
local virus TRANSMISSION, but only if local vector relationships are
sufficiently understood to select a relevant sentinel vertebrate. No one
can understand the specific roles played by the various suspect WNV vector
species identified to date in the Atlantic states, and reported lack of
involvement of the sentinel chickens, based on the data reported in
ProMED-mail and on other web sites. The uncritical comparison of numbers of
sentinel chicken seroconversions with (a) numbers of dead, WNV-"positive"
wild birds, (b) wild bird serosurvey data, or (c) numbers of WNV-"positive"
mosquito pools misses the point that these surveillance tools monitor
different aspects of a complex local transmission cycle. Only documented
human cases and seroconverting sentinel vertebrates can estimate WHEN and
WHERE the infective mosquito bite occurred.
There are many possible explanations for the lack of activity in the
northeast sentinel flocks. A full assessment of the situation requires
details on the flocks, placement, diagnostics being used (are these the
same tests being used as for the wild birds?), numbers, probability of
detection. If these data substantiate that the chickens indeed have been
different, then clearly transmission has not been as dispersed as indicated
by the wild bird reports. Our hypothesis would then be that WNV
transmission in the northeast is likely multi-focal at best, and sentinels
have not been placed within areas of active transmission.
A complete disclosure of the data should be helpful in differentiating
between some of the possibilities. We continue to hope that those reporting
information will provide useful details as requested previously in several
ProMED-mail postings.
