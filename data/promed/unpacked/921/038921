Soybean rust has now been found in 334 counties in the United States.
This is the highest number of counties reporting the disease since it
was 1st discovered in the continental US in 2004. Soybean rust has
now been detected in one Province in Canada, in 2 states (3
municipalities) in Mexico, and in 19 States and 334 counties in the
US including: 40 counties in Alabama (19 soybean), 33 counties in
Arkansas (soybean), 24 counties in Florida (11 soybean), 51 counties
in Georgia (14 soybean), 4 counties in Illinois (soybean), one county
in Indiana (soybean), 14 counties in Iowa (soybean), 9 counties in
Kansas (soybean), 3 counties in Kentucky (soybean), 21 parishes in
Louisiana (18 soybean), 26 counties in Mississippi (21 soybean), 37
counties in Missouri (soybean), 4 counties in Nebraska (soybean), 6
counties in North Carolina (soybean), 12 counties in Oklahoma
(soybean), 7 counties in South Carolina (soybean), 7 counties in
Tennessee (soybean), 26 counties in Texas (25 soybean), and 9
counties in Virginia (soybean). Soybean rust monitoring continues
only in the south on kudzu.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902
as the cause of soybean rust. It can cause premature defoliation,
with yield losses of up to 70 per cent reported on farms in Asia. It
is widespread in Asia and Africa, but data are lacking concerning its
establishment in Europe. The 1st detection of _P. pachyrhizi_ in the
New World was in Paraguay in 2001. It has a wide host range, unusual
for rust fungi, and besides soybean, a number of other species in the
family of _Fabaceae_ can also be affected. Weed species, for example
kudzu (Japanese arrowroot, _Pueraria lobata_), can serve as pathogen
reservoirs, and spores are spread by wind over long distances.
Fungicides may be used in disease management, and partially resistant
soybean lines are available. However, new strains of _P. pachyrhizi_
with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging.

A less-virulent related species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in South
America and the Caribbean and also causes rust symptoms on a similar
range of hosts. Previously, these 2 species were considered strains
of the same species, with _P. pachyrhizi_ called the aggressive Asian
strain, and _P. meibomiae_ called the mild American strain.

_P. pachyrhizi_ was introduced into the USA in 2004 and has been
spreading since. At the end of 2006, soybean rust was present in a
total of 274 counties in 15 states including 26 in Alabama; 24 in
Florida; 21 in South Carolina; 26 in Louisiana; 17 in Georgia; 7 in
Texas; 5 in Missouri; 9 in Mississippi; 42 in North Carolina; 18 in
Kentucky and Virginia, 8 in Illinois; 6 in Indiana; 19 in Tennessee;
28 in Arkansas. Thus the disease was discovered in 2007 for the 1st
time in 4 states: Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma.

Worldwide, in 2007 _P. pachyrhizi_ was reported for the 1st time from
Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo and Canada.
