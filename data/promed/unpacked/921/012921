A Kentucky healthy agency is reporting 10 adults recently tested positive for _E. coli_ and many of the people live in west Kentucky. An exact county or area in west Kentucky was not made public.

The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services said 2 cases resulted in people developing a rare but serious condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. It's a serious complication that can cause kidney failure and can occur a week or more after the onset of diarrhea.

Public health investigators have not identified the source of the outbreak but have said that some sort of food distribution is likely.

The cabinet said reported cases primarily include adults in west Kentucky. No deaths linked to the outbreak have been reported but 6 people have been hospitalized.

This strain of _E. coli_ produces Shiga toxin that can be dangerous for those infected.

Symptoms of this strain of _E. coli_ typically include stomach cramps and diarrhea, including bloody diarrhea, and people generally become ill 2 to 5 days after consuming contaminated food.

Those most at risk of developing complications from_E. coli_ infection include the very young, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.

State health officials are working with staff at local health departments in the counties with suspected or confirmed cases to determine the source of the infections.

[The serotype of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) is not stated. It is likely the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga-toxin-producing serotypes. ProMED awaits more information about this outbreak.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock, wild animals, or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario (Canada), an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals. - Mod.LL
