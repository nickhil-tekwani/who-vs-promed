Comment on malaria in Pakistan after the flooding
------------------------------------------------
Our team has been monitoring the situation with ground partners in
Pakistan via the Epidemic Advisory System-Pakistan (EAS-P,
<http://biosurveillance.typepad.com/epidemic_advisory_systemp/>)
using similar approaches to those used in Haiti
(<http://biosurveillance.typepad.com/haiti_operational_biosurv/>).

The operational emphasis is on anticipation and rapid identification
of infectious disease crises that may either acutely disrupt medical
response or trigger community disintegration (i.e., voluntary evacuation).

Although increases in malaria cases have been documented in the past
and currently in Pakistan following monsoon-triggered flooding, we
have not found malaria to be acutely disruptive to ground medical
response as, for example, a cholera epidemic might.

The term 'disruption' is defined by strain to the point of acutely
and unexpectedly exceeding personnel and materiel resources.

Currently, despite the increase in cases, we have seen no evidence of
medical responders becoming acutely overwhelmed with malaria cases.

Should anyone on the readership have observed to the contrary, please
do let us know.

This operational emphasis certainly does not detract from the
necessary implementation of public health preventive measures such as
vector control.

Anticipatory analysis released on 24 Aug 2010 by EAS-P suggested that
we were entering peak seasonal malaria activity by October 2010,
which would decrease beginning in November 2010; however, this is a
tremendous generalization for a country with some degree of
variability in peak activity periods for vivax versus falciparum by month.

Clarity in regards to typical peak seasonal activity levels for
Plasmodium species, by specific locale in Pakistan, would better
inform anticipatory assessments such as those used in post-disaster settings.

the situation concerning outbreaks of infectious diseases following
the flooding as information becomes available. - Mod.EP]
