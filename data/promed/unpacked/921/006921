Officials of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Vellore have contained an outbreak of anthrax in a village in Ambur following the death of an animal due to anthrax last week. Over 8500 livestock head in Bairapalli village have been vaccinated;

T. Manoharan, deputy director (Cattle Breeding and Fodder Development) specialist of the department, said they had formed 15 teams to vaccinate the livestock against anthrax. "We have now contained the spread of the disease, and there are no more deaths. We have vaccinated a sizeable population of livestock in the affected village and also villages located in an 8-km radius. This way, we can prevent spread of infection from the affected area," he explained.

In Bairapalli alone, 1209 cattle, 744 sheep and 311 goats have been vaccinated so far. And in the surrounding villages, the teams vaccinated 2891 cattle, 86 buffaloes, 1914 sheep and 1677 goats.

The officials also created awareness among farmers on the symptoms of anthrax in the livestock. This included sudden death and bleeding, including from the rectum and vagina. "In such cases, the farmers should not resort to removing the skin of the animal for selling purposes. This could lead to spread of the disease," he added.

[Vellore is on the northern border of Tamil Nadu; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellore.

As yet, there is no notification by the Indian government to OIE on this outbreak, so it is presently unclear what triggered this very effective and efficient veterinary response. But I suspect it was not trivial. And in many ways, it reflects the response in March 2016 to a sheep outbreak involving a minimum of 37 sheep on 7 separate farms, see 20160307.4074807. - Mod.MHJ
