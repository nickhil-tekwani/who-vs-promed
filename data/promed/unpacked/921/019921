Cases of falciparum malaria imported from Thailand
------------------------------------------------
Holiday destinations where _Plasmodium falciparum_ infections in tourists
are hitherto unknown are by no means always safe, as a recent report in
Germany's surveillance bulletin shows (1). So far 2 almost simultaneous but
unrelated cases of falciparum malaria have been reported to the Robert
Koch-Institut in Berlin. Both patients had visited Thailand, where
tourist destinations are regarded as non-malarial, and no recommendations
for chemoprophylaxis have so far been issued for tourists.
The first case was in a 20-year-old woman who had travelled to Thailand as
a backpacker with a friend. Her itinerary had started in Bangkok and from
there she had travelled around the south of the country, including Khao Sok
national park, where she had stayed for 2 nights. She felt ill on 3 Apr
2002 with headache, aching limbs, and slight catarrh but presented to a
duty doctor only on 7 Apr 2002 when paracetamol had not improved her
symptoms. She was prescribed a combination drug consisting of salicylic
acid, paracetamol, and codeine and the next day she presented to her
general practitioner, who prescribed doxycycline without further diagnosis.
After taking a 200 mg dose of doxycycline she presented to the outpatient
department at the hospital for tropical diseases on 9 Apr 2002. Blood
analysis showed _P. falciparum_ at a parasite concentration under 0.1
percent. Her friend, who was also ill with a fever, was admitted at the
same time and acute dengue fever was diagnosed, but she was malaria-free.
The second case was in a 43-year-old patient who had a parasitaemia of 0.1
percent. The woman had visited southern Thailand for a beach holiday on the
island of Phuket 11-21 Mar 2002 but had visited the Khao Sok national park
for 2 days during this time, where she stayed in a stone house without
a mosquito net.
Both patients were successfully treated with Malarone (atovaquone and
proguanil) and were discharged after a few days. There was no link between
the 2 patients except for the time of travel and the stay at Khao
Sok national park. No previous cases of falciparum malaria have been
reported from this area.

[Southern Thailand is not malaria-free, as stated in the report. The area
around Phuket had an incidence of over 20 cases per 1000 population in 1998
and between 5 and 20 per 1000 in 1999 (see maps at:
<http://w3.whosea.org/malaria/malincithai.htm>)
The risk is most certainly lower in tourists. However, this incidence may
seem so low that chemoprophylaxis is not used, but travellers still need to
be informed that there is a small risk. In cases of fever after visits to
tourist areas in the south of Thailand, diagnostic tests for malaria should
be performed. - Mod.EP]
