Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or

Epidemiological comments: vaccination has been applied with a locally
developed vaccine but was not effective to control the disease.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department:
This report has been extracted from an official letter sent to the
OIE by the delegate of the DPR of Korea dated 7 Feb 2011 and received
on 8 Feb 2011. Since that date, the use of the standardized reporting
form was requested from the country to have the exact details on the
locations of the outbreaks.

This immediate notification report has been prepared and published by
the Animal Health Information Department in the meantime and outbreaks
are gathered by clusters of outbreaks and by affected district. This
is only an approximation of their location. When the exact data on the
location of each outbreak will be provided by the National Veterinary
Authorities, this report will be amended to reflect more precise
locations of the outbreaks and the disease distribution. Not all the
outbreaks are processed since approximate geographic locations have
not been found. There are additional outbreaks notified in January
that are not yet processed and that will be processed as soon as the
completed information is received from the country.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in
response to the outbreak (s); disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: no other measures
