It is interesting to see the details on the case, and interesting that the case came from Hubei, suggesting the virus is circulating in Hubei province, even though the only reported cases were a cluster in Wuhan. - Mod.MPP]

Up to [15 May 2020] at midnight, the entire province had 6 confirmed cases (all in Wuhan) of which one is a critical case and one is severe. There are currently no suspected infections.

On [15 May 2020], the entire province added 10 new asymptomatic infections, with none converted to confirmed cases. 63 people were released from isolation and 439 asymptomatic infection cases are still undergoing medical observation. Shanghai Observer noted that in the past few days, Hubei Province has not experienced especially great changes in the numbers of new asymptomatic infections: 6 cases on [12 May 2020], 11 on [13 May 2020], 9 on [14 May 2020], 10 on [15 May 2020]. According to Wuhan Health Planning Commission, all new asymptomatic cases have come from Wuhan over the past few days (those on [15 May 2020] not yet certain, as Wuhan Health Commission hadn't yet released related information).

On [12 May 2020], Wuhan conducted city-wide nucleic acid testing on 42 618 people. There were 6 new cases of asymptomatic infection. 13 cases were released from isolation that day and there were no conversions to confirmed cases. 582 patients were undergoing medical observation.

On [13 May 2020], Wuhan conducted city-wide nucleic acid testing on 67 026 people. There were 11 new cases of asymptomatic infection. 34 cases were released from isolation that day and there were no conversions to confirmed cases. 559 patients were undergoing medical observation.

On [14 May 2020], Wuhan held a working meeting on "Acceleration of city-wide nucleic acid testing to screen for asymptomatic infections." In the coming period, there will be orderly arrangements for nucleic acid testing of all city residents to further ascertain the base number of asymptomatic infections and effectively control the novel coronavirus outbreak.

On that day [14 May 2020], Wuhan conducted city-wide nucleic acid testing on 72 791 people. There were 9 new cases of asymptomatic infection. 88 cases were released from isolation that day and there were no conversions to confirmed cases. 480 patients were undergoing medical observation.

Wuhan Health Commission hasn't yet announced nucleic acid testing numbers for [15 May 2020]. But, looking at figures for [14 and 14 May 2020], the number of nucleic tests has clearly increased and both days are greater than the 39 735 on [10 May 2020] (which added 11 asymptomatic infections), the 40 389 on [11 May 2020] (which added 10 asymptomatic infections), and 42 618 on [12 May 2020] (which added 6 asymptomatic infections).

Does this indicate that the number of nucleic acid tests is continuously growing? Shanghai Observer found that this isn't necessarily so. Wuhan Health Planning Commission's data shows that on [9 May 2020] there were 59 852 nucleic acid tests conducted city-wide (16 new asymptomatic infections, the same format below),

8 May 2020: 60 881 (12 asymptomatic cases)
7 May 2020: 51 568 (16)
6 May 2020: 48 137 (5)
5 May 2020: 30 878 (14)
4 May 2020: 28 771 (12)
3 May 2020: 35 213 (8)
2 May 2020: 40 720 (8)
1 May 2020: 54 340 (18)

It seems that there is variability in nucleic acid testing numbers and there hasn't been an obvious trend up or down.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dan Silver for finding and translating this article. It documents that Wuhan has been doing daily testing of the population in search of infected individuals, as projected when the cluster of cases was identified last week. On 12 May 2020 through 15 May 2020, a total of 36 asymptomatic infections were identified. To date according to the national reports, none of these in asymptomatic infections have converted to symptomatic. It will be interesting to see the actual total of asymptomatic infections identified through this testing, although caution on the interpretation as one might not safely conclude all are active infections that pose a risk of transmission to others, but rather may be residual viral genetic particles after the active infection, which are not infectious. - Mod.MPP

[5] USA (Texas): healthcare workers
Date: Sun 17 May 2020 4:27 PM CDT
Source: LMT Online/Laredo Morning Times [edited]
https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/Laredo-Medical-Center-details-COVID-19-outbreak-15276514.php


At the beginning of April [2020], an emergency room doctor tested positive for COVID-19. He had been working with patients who he highly suspected were sick with the virus. These patients were coughing a lot but wearing masks, and so was he. But then [he] developed a sore throat, and then a cough and then a fever, at which point he stopped going to work and took a confirmatory COVID test.

[He] would be one of over 120 local doctors, nurses and hospital auxiliary staff to test positive for this virus. In Laredo, more than a quarter of the positive cases come from this group of healthcare personnel.

Across the country, a preliminary study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that somewhere between 3% and 11% of all patients who test positive for the virus are healthcare workers. Laredo is an outlier here mainly due to an outbreak that occurred at Laredo Medical Center [LMC], where 84 of their healthcare personnel and 18 of their independent contracted medical, dietary, and custodial staff have tested positive for COVID-19.

The outbreak has been traced back to an asymptomatic patient who visited the hospital in early March [2020], weeks before the coronavirus was considered a local issue. Travel-related cases in only a few US cities such as San Antonio and Seattle were among the only known patients at the time. The patient who visited LMC had not traveled and did not meet what was then the criteria to be considered a COVID-19 patient, hospital CEO Enrique Gallegos told LMT this week. "As we did our investigative work, and our chief medical officer pieced it together and looked at the medical record, looked at the symptoms, looked at how this patient was cared for -- it clearly was a COVID patient in retrospect," Gallegos said.

This patient went from the emergency room to a telemetry floor to the skilled nursing unit, meanwhile interacting with a whole team of doctors and specialists. "In hindsight, clearly that patient exposed a lot of the staff. ... That represented a cross section of our healthcare team here," Gallegos. And as more and more of their staff tested positive for the virus, patients continued to be hospitalized too. Gallegos notes that 90% of Laredo's hospitalized COVID patients have been treated at LMC.

Luckily, because elective surgeries were postponed and people were out and about less often, leaving less opportunity for accidents, the number of patients being treated at Laredo's hospitals decreased dramatically. Therefore LMC was never short-staffed even as dozens of their healthcare workers were out sick, Gallegos said. But the hospital and City of Laredo requested back up from the state's cohort of volunteer medical staff, asking for 73 emergency healthcare personnel to come to help Laredo Medical Center. "What we were trying to do was give people a break. Working 12 hours in a COVID unit with all of your (personal protective equipment) on is very physically and mentally exhausting," Gallegos said.

On Wednesday [13 May 2020] afternoon, LMC was notified that they would be receiving 4 respiratory therapists this month [May 2020]. These are the personnel who manage the ventilators needed by the sickest patients.

Meanwhile, the hospital has implemented safety procedures in line with the CDC's: closing 6 of their 10 entrances to the hospital; pausing all visitation; conducting health screens and temperature checks; providing clean scrubs at the hospital; and allowing medical staff to shower there before going home, and so on. They will also be testing every employee who works at the hospital, of whom there are over 1200. Gallegos said thus far they have tested about 40% of their staff, and have already discovered some asymptomatic positive cases. Any employee who tests positive must quarantine for 28 days and test negative twice before coming back to work, he said.

[The ER doctor mentioned above] has been feeling better for the last 3 or 4 weeks and is now back at work in the ER. But he had to take the test 7 times before he got 2 negative results. He said he feels lucky to be back at work with his team. "I know we've had a lot of people getting sick, but I still feel that everybody is looking forward to coming to work and helping patients out," [he] said.

Even as the virus made its way around the hospital staff, they remained at the front line to help the sick recover. This experience has been extraordinarily trying for everyone at the hospital, Gallegos said. And it was hard to see their staff sacrificing themselves every day, he said. "It was very unsettling for us. We care deeply about our staff and everyone who works here, so that was difficult to come to grips with," Gallegos said.

Even as Laredo's infection rate and test positivity rate goes down, he does not believe they are out of the woods yet. "We have seen a decline. I think the number of new cases in the community, from what I can tell, appears to be on a downward trajectory," Gallegos said. "But we don't want to get a false sense of security. So we're still very much guarded and intensely focused on what we've been doing."

[This story highlights the stealth nature of this virus in terms of presenting as another disease prior to a recognition of the virus in a geographic area. In this instance, according to the media report over 25% of the cases were healthcare workers, and the majority of cases were in individuals with a history of contact at the medical center.

[6] Germany: outbreak associated with traveler case

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
In December 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.

Methods
A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for 15 min or longer, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of healthcare workers, had worked within 2 [meters] of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.

Findings
Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in 4 transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4.0 days (IQR [interquartile range] 2.3-4.3) and the median serial interval was 4.0 days (3.0-5.0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly 5 more), at the day of symptom onset for 4 cases (possibly 5 more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or 2 cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75.0% (95% CI 19.0-99.0; 3 of 4 people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10.0% (1.2-32.0; 2 of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5.1% (2.6-8.9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.

Interpretation
Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

[This outbreak was presented back in February 2020. This updated more detailed paper is interesting in terms of the finding that the peak transmission of the virus appeared to be in the pre-symptomatic or peri-symptomatic stage of the infection, or at times in asymptomatic individuals, further confirming the challenges of identifying sources of infection. It is also interesting that mutations were seen on the viral genome beginning in the 2nd generation of transmission. The significance of this finding awaits further definition.- Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 17 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Presidents Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica and Sebastian Pinera of Chile joined the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros on [15 May 2020] (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---15-may-2020) to announce progress on a technology platform (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/15-05-2020-who-and-costa-rica-preview-technology-pooling-initiative-to-ensure-access-to-covid-19-health-products-for-all) that aims to lift access barriers to effective vaccines, medicines and other health products against COVID-19. The platform, which will officially launch on [29 May 2020], will pool data, knowledge, and intellectual property for existing or new COVID-19 health products to deliver 'global public goods' for all people and all countries.

- Japan has agreed to contribute over USD 2.7 million to help 9 countries in the Americas strengthen their capacities to detect cases, monitor, and control outbreaks of COVID-19, as well as ensure that reliable public health information on the COVID-19 pandemic is available to people involved in the response and the general public (https://www.paho.org/en/news/15-5-2020-government-japan-contributes-27-m-scale-covid-19-response-nine-countries-americas).

- A community of youth influencers named the Global Shapers Community is working with the WHO Regional Office for Europe to ensure that tailored health advice reaches communities, families, and individuals in countries across the European Region. This collaboration allows young community members to flag rumours, report on the tone of discussions on their channels, and ask questions, as well as share information and project ideas to WHO. The information is then used by WHO to better tailor risk communication and address misinformation (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/5/covid-19-who-joins-forces-with-young-global-shapers-to-disseminate-health-advice).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 57 449 new cases (57.4% of the global newly reported cases), and 3742 deaths (70.1%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 47.2% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 26.6%, Chile 7.6%, Peru 6.8%, Mexico 4.2%, and Canada 2.0%. The Americas region is approaching 2 million cases and is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 22 100 new cases (22.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 1228 deaths (23.0%). Russia reported 43.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 15.6%, Turkey 7.3%, Belarus 4.3%, Italy 4.0%, Germany 2.6%, and Spain 2.3%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10 900 new cases (10.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 140 deaths (2.6%). Saudi Arabia reported 26.1% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 16.1%, Qatar 14.2%, Pakistan 12.4%, Kuwait 8.6%, and the United Arab Emirates at 7.3%.

The African region reported 2202 new cases (2.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 43 deaths (0.8%). South Africa reported 37.7% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 8.7%, Nigeria 7.8%, Guinea at 5.8%, Senegal at 5.4%, and Ghana 4.4%.

The Western Pacific region reported 825 new cases (0.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 33 deaths (0.6%). Singapore reported 56.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 25.9% and Japan 5.8%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 59.4%, Japan 13.3%, Malaysia at 4.7%, Australia at 4.7%, and South Korea at 3.6%.

The South-East Asia region reported 6536 new cases (6.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 150 deaths (2.8%). India reported 76.3% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 14.2% and Indonesia 8.1%. These 3 countries make up 98.6% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 60.0% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 34.2%, and the Maldives 3.0%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 17 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia. Of note is that today's entry was a new high in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours, spurred mostly by the Americas region.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
