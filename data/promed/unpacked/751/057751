An FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) evaluation has estimated the
cattle population in the Kivu provinces was now 174 500 heads, down from
530 000 before the start of the Great Lakes crisis in the early 1990s. The
figures represent a loss of 85 percent for North Kivu and 11 percent for
South Kivu. In the Ituri area of Province Orientale, the cattle population
had gone down from 420 000 to 312 000 during the same period. An FAO
report, received by IRIN on Friday, said cattle deaths due to
gastrointestinal and blood diseases were increasing in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) due to the neglected state of all dipping tanks
and poor veterinary hygiene practices. Anthrax persisted in South Kivu and
in parts of North Kivu and Province Orientale, while there was a threat of
cattle plague (Rinderpest) and FMD (Foot and Mouth Disease) in areas
bordering Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania, it said. The
evaluation mission recommended that emergency cattle!
vaccination campaigns be organised in the area.
