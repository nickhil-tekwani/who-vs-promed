Outbreak of mumps in Monsey, Spring Valley
------------------------------------------
At least 45 children in Rockland have been diagnosed with mumps, a highly
infectious disease that is also being reported in communities in Brooklyn
and Orange County, New York, according to the state Department of Health.
The Rockland cases have all occurred in religious communities in Monsey and
Spring Valley, according to an alert issued this week [week of 2 Nov 2009]
by the State Department of Health.

The State [Department of Health] is also tracking 62 cases reported in the
Borough Park section of Brooklyn, as well as 7 confirmed cases in Kiryas
Joel in Orange County. Other cases connected to the outbreak have also been
reported in Lakewood, New Jesey, and in Quebec [Canada], according to
health officials.

The outbreak apparently started in August [2009] in a summer camp in
Sullivan County, New York, attended primarily by children from Borough
Park, according to the State [Department of Health].

Rockland health officials are working to try to make sure that the disease
doesn't spread, said commissioner of health Dr Joan Facelle. "We are
working with the community to try to contain it," she said. "We are
encouraging timely vaccinations and urging parents to keep kids home when
they are sick." The number of cases appears to be increasing, but the
disease is not spreading beyond religious communities in Monsey and Spring
Valley, she said.

[The New York Department of Health confirmed an outbreak of mumps in the
Borough Park section of Brooklyn where at least 57 confirmed or probable
cases occurred beginning 21 Aug 2009. That outbreak was traced back to a
child who had visited the United Kingdom, then on return attended a summer
camp in upper New York state. It appears this child had contracted mumps
(presumably in the UK) and then infected fellow campers who brought the
disease back with them to Brooklyn where it has continued to spread. Most
of the victims in Brooklyn have been between the ages of 10 to 15, but the
youngest patient so far was 1 year old, while the oldest victim was 42. It
is likely that the outbreak in Rockland County described above originated
among attendees at the summer camp and subsequently spread among
communities in the lower Hudson Valley poorly protected against mumps virus
infection as a consequence of their religious persuasions.

Rockland County is located in the state of New York, 19 km (12 mi)
north-northwest of New York City. It is part of the New York Metropolitan
Area. A map showing the location of Rockland County can be accessed at
