Hepatitis E case in Windhoek's informal sector have risen to 490, Namibia's health ministry said [Thu 25 Jan 2018], while blaming poor sanitation for fueling the spread of diseases. Health Minister Bernard Haufiku told a media conference that to date the outbreak has caused 2 maternal deaths, with majority of the cases coming from Havana and Goreangab settlements. "The outbreak control and disease prevention activities are still ongoing, such as coordination, surveillance, case detection and management, wash and environmental health and social mobilization," he said.

Director of Health Information and Research Directorate Puumue Katjiunjo told Xinhua that currently health centers in the city get cases of suspected hepatitis E on a daily basis. "Currently we cannot say it has been contained but efforts to reduce and contain the disease are being employed by the health ministry with the assistance of NGO agencies," he said.

The ministry encouraged the community in affected areas to continue with preventative measures including purifying drinking water and practicing healthy sanitary exercises. Poor sanitation has been blamed for fueling disease outbreaks in Namibia, with the health ministry saying 68 percent households in the country's informal settlements still practise open defecation. It also stated that 92 percent of households in the informal sector collect water from communal taps and 2 percent from unsafe water sources, compared with 6 percent that have household taps.

Katjiunjo said that 55 percent of water samples collected at point of use tested positive for total coliforms, an indication of fecal contamination. A representative from Windhoek's City Authorities told Xinhua that currently the city is rehabilitating old toilets and cleaning up communities to assist in the prevention of further disease outbreaks.

Namibia experienced its 1st hepatitis E outbreak in 1983 in Rundu, where 9 cases were confirmed, and the last outbreak was experienced in 1995-1996 also in Rundu. United Nations Resident Coordinator to Namibia Kiki Gbeho on [Thu 25 Jan 2017] said the UN is ready to assist the Namibian government's response to the Hepatitis E outbreak.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).
