INFECTION CONTROL - CALIFORNIA, USA (3)
=======================================
Date: 27 Jun 1996 11:05:11 PST
From: jrosenbe@hw1.cahwnet.gov

I'm an M.D. in the California Department of Health Services, Division of
Communicable Disease Control, together with Chris Cahill, a nurse with the
department's Licensing and Certification Program.
We would like to be enumerated in the ProMED-mail list of ICPs. We handle IC
issues for the State, conduct surveillance for antimicrobial-resistant
organisms of nosocomial significance, and are currently developing a
comprehensive infection control manual for
long-term care facilities.
