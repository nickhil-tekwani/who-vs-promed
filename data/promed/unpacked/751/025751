The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) now puts the number of suspected and lab confirmed mumps cases in the country's largest outbreak to 1028, according to data published Mon [7 Nov 2016]. The north western counties of Benton, Madison and Washington and the central Arkansas county of Pulaski are affected by the outbreak.

As previously reported, a large percentage of cases are in adults and children who have been vaccinated. Through the end of October [2016], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provisionally reported more than 2800 cases. This tops the total mumps cases reported in all of 2010 (2612), the previous high.

Mumps is an acute viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include swelling and tenderness of the cheeks, usually preceded by fever, headache and muscle aches. Mumps infection can also lead to more serious health complications such as testicular infection and inflammation, meningitis, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).

Transmission occurs through sneezing, coughing, contact with saliva (through sharing of utensils, towels, kissing, sharing cigarettes and drinks, etc), or from contact with surfaces that have become contaminated with the mumps virus. The incubation period is 16-18 days, and individuals are considered most infectious from 2 days prior through 5 days after the onset of symptoms.

Update #3: Mumps outbreak in north west Arkansas community and schools -- Arkansas, 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Arkansas Department of Health continues to investigate and respond to a large outbreak of mumps in north west Arkansas. The majority of cases are Marshallese and are believed to have acquired the infection within local churches and school settings. MMR vaccination clinics are ongoing.

The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) has been investigating an outbreak of mumps in north west Arkansas (NWA) since Mid-August. A CDC Epi-Aid team deployed to Little Rock and NWA to assist with the outbreak response from 8 Sept 2016 until 28 Sept 16. They returned again on 4 Nov 2016 to investigate vaccine effectiveness among the affected community. A Marshallese dignitary group traveled from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to NWA on 2 Nov 2016 to assist in community outreach and vaccination efforts.

As of Tue 8 Nov [2016], we are aware of 1140 cases (626 laboratory confirmed -- via PCR -- and 514 probable cases). At least 134 additional suspects have pending laboratory testing at the state public health laboratory. The majority of cases are in the Marshallese (65 per cent). Transmission has spread to 53 schools in 5 different school districts and 4 private schools, 41 businesses or work places and 54 churches. The majority of cases are 5-17 years old (67 per cent) with an age range of 4 months-82 years. Language barriers are a major issue in conducting investigations as most of the cases are Marshallese or Spanish speaking and interpreters are needed to conduct effective interviews.

Thankfully, most cases have had mild disease. A total of 3 cases were hospitalized, 4 had orchitis, 1 had deafness, and 958 cases had typical parotitis. No pancreatitis or encephalitis has been observed.

Vaccination clinics are ongoing. To date approximately 4514 doses of MMR have been given at 55 vaccination clinics. As of Tue 8 Nov [2016], about 93 per cent of cases in children are up-to-date on vaccine. In contrast, 42 per cent of adult cases are up-to-date. Several 3rd MMR dose clinics have been conducted and more are planned.

There are 626 confirmed cases, 514 probable. An estimated 9000 individuals have been exposed, but there have been no deaths.

Arkansas is not the only state in the United States reporting increased cases of mumps. See ProMED-mail: Mumps - USA (21) 20161008.4545923 for reports of cases in Oklahoma and Washington, and a discussion of the particular problem of providing protection to the Marshallese in Arkansas against vaccine-preventable diseases. The Arkansas Department of Health helped to open a health care clinic for this population, with assistance from the Affordable Care Act. One can only hope this program is left intact. - Mod.LK]

The count in the mumps outbreak at SUNY [State University of New York] New Paltz is up to 12 and could grow higher. On Mon [7 Nov 2016], the college posted the update on its website saying the latest person to come down with the disease is a member of the athletics staff. That person is currently at home, recovering.

Last week, officials said 23 students who [had not been] immunised against mumps had been sent home as well. Most of the students with confirmed cases were on the campus swim team. Officials have canceled swim meets for the rest of the semester.

The notice on Mon [7 Nov 2016] said more cases could develop. If they do, they are expected to show up between Mon [7 Nov 2016] and [28 Nov 2016]. That is based on the 26-day incubation period for mumps.
