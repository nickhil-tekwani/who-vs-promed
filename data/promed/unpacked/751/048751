[Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been occurring in the Bolivian tropics. The specific hantavirus involved in these or previous cases last year (2013) in Bolivia, or those in 2012, is not given.

In the lowland Amazon basin of Bolivia, the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases is Laguna Negra virus and its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_, the small vesper mouse (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg) and _C. callosus_, the large vesper mouse (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/Calomys%20callosus%20www.pybio.org%201.jpg). Other hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include:
- Bermejo virus (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_) http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Oligoryzomys%20chacoensis%20enciso%2015jul11.jpg, and
- Oran virus (_O. longicaudatus_) http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg.
