NEWCASTLE DISEASE, POULTRY - USA (09): (CALIFORNIA) COMMENT

More than 8000 gamecocks have been seized in cockfighting raids in San Bernardino and adjacent counties during the past 18 months.

As you commented back on 4 Jun 2018, "This appears to be a repeat of 2003 in that these flocks are of fighting cocks, probably all with a common source event. It would not be a surprise if this virus has a Mexican origin."

Cockfighters are by definition scofflaws [habitual flouters of the law; noun coined in the US Prohibition era. - Mod.SH]. Proactive vaccination to prevent disease outbreaks does not tend to be in their vocabulary.

[I fear that Merritt may well be correct in his comment, and if so, this epizootic will just eat up time and money until it burns out. - Mod.MHJ
