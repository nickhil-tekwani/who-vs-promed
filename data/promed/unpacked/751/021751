Russian Scientist Dies in Lab Accident Involving Ebola Virus
---------------------------------------------------
A Russian researcher has died after sticking herself with a needle
containing the deadly Ebola virus, her organization said on Tue 24 May
2004. The accident occurred on 5 May 2004, when the scientist was
conducting research on Ebola virus, a virus for which no vaccine or remedy
exists, said Natalia Skultetskaya, a spokeswoman for the Vector State
Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology outside Novosibirsk in
central Siberia.
Skultetskaya said that efforts to save the scientist failed and she died on
Wed 19 May 2004 at a special hospital located in the grounds of the
Centre. Research and medical personnel who were in contact with
Presnyakova during her treatment will remain under medical observation for
3 weeks, she said.
Skultetskaya denied a report in the New York Times that the Centre was slow
to inform the World Health Organization about the incident, reporting it
only last week. She said the case was reported immediately to both the
Russian Health Ministry and the WHO. "We received all the necessary medical
assistance," Skultetskaya said. "On the WHO's advice, we had a conference
call involving a doctor who treated Ebola haemorrhagic fever patients in
Africa."
The incident was the 3rd case of accidental contraction of a deadly virus
at Vector, which [once] served as a top biological weapons laboratory in
Soviet times. One Vector researcher accidentally contracted Marburg virus
and died in 1988, while another worker contracted the same virus and
survived in 1990, Skultetskaya said. [Marburg virus and Ebola virus are
similar but genetically and antigenically distinguishable viruses that
cause lethal acute haemorrhagic fevers in humans and belong to the same
virus family -- the family _Filoviridae_. - Mod.CP] In a 1996 incident at
another Russian biological research centre, the Defence Ministry's Virology
Center in Sergiyev Posad near Moscow, a worker accidentally contracted the
Ebola virus infection and died, Skultetskaya said.
Ebola virus is spread by contact with body fluids, including sweat and
saliva. Outbreaks of the disease are rare, and [the source and vector of
the virus are unknown]. Skultetskaya said the Vector Laboratory was
conducting research on Ebola and Marburg viruses to develop specific vaccines.
