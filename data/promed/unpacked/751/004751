Yellow rust has alarmed cereal farmers in Castile and Leon, especially those who grow wheat. In some cases, the situation is such that yield losses appear likely.

While yellow rust has always been present in the area causing small outbreaks that could be easily controlled by fungicides, a new race has changed the type and extent of damage caused. Previously resistant wheat varieties have now become susceptible to the rust. These characteristics have previously been observed in the 2009-2010 season in northern Europe, later in the UK, then France, and now in Spain.

The new race is more virulent and suspected to be the Warrior strain, which has arrived in other parts of Spain from northern Europe. Crop damage can be limited with fungicides, but these add considerably to production costs.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge." Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or new "virulences" (ability to break down disease resistance conferred by specific host genes). Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

The aggressive Warrior strain now dominates the stripe rust population, for example, in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2224928). The new strain was named after a previously resistant wheat variety on which it was discovered and is thought to have originated in China.
