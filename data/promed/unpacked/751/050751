The BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control [BCCDC] has issued a public health alert asking people to avoid eating Gort's Gouda brand of raw-milk cheeses after an _E. coli_ outbreak has been linked to a death in the Interior and illness in 14 others across BC and Alberta. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has recalled all types of cheese -- including various Goudas, Maasdammer, Parmesan, Mazouda, and Beaufort -- from the artisanal Salmon Arm facility.

The 1st BC case was recorded in July 2013 and a death occurred in August 2013, but it wasn't until a "cluster" of several cases were confirmed in late August 2013 that the center started investigating the possibility of an outbreak. "We couldn't pick (the _E. coli_ problem) up in July or early August 2013 because the number of people infected was very low," said Dr Eleni Galanis, an epidemiologist with the BCCDC.

The outbreak of _E. coli_ serotype O157 was eventually linked to Gort's Gouda Cheese Farm, which espouses traditional cheese making using raw milk. In an FAQ section on its website, the company says its cheese is made from unpasteurized milk and stored on the shelf for a minimum of 2 months. "The time that it sits on the shelf, allows harmful pathogenic bacteria to die off," the site states.

So far 3 people have been hospitalized, including the person who died, according to Dr Rob Parker, Medical Health Officer for the Interior Health Authority. Parker said the person who died was admitted to the hospital after showing symptoms of an _E. coli_ infection.

The company stopped selling all of its cheeses last Sat 14 Sep 2013, but is still able to sell other dairy products like milk, according to Galanis. "At this point what we're telling BC residents is to avoid eating any cheese from Gort's Gouda Cheese Farm and to discard it," Galanis said. Anyone who has eaten Gort's cheese in the past 10 days and has had severe diarrhea or feels very sick should see a doctor, Galanis added.

A Gort's representative was unavailable for comment Tue 17 Sep 2013. But, Kathy Wikkerink, whose family bought the operation in August 2007, responded online to concerns from customers who began posting on the company's Facebook page Tuesday afternoon. "_E. coli_ has been linked to our raw milk cheese," the user named Kathy Wikkerink posted. "They have yet to determine where this came from."

In May 2012, the company had its heavy cream recalled by the CFIA [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] due to a microbiological issue.

[In the USA, the FDA has established (FDA 21 CFR Part 133 http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=133) that unpasteurized milk cheese that is aged for 60 days or more at a temperature greater than 35 deg F (2 deg C) creates conditions able to eradicate milkborne pathogens. These observations followed epidemics of typhoid fever caused by cheddar cheese made from raw milk in the 1940s and survival data on _Brucella abortus_ in cheddar led to the 60 day curing period in the USA (1,2).

Reitsma (3) reported, however, that EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_) could survive the manufacture and curing of cheese, and using a 5-strain inoculum, others (4) confirmed that the 60 day aging was inadequate to eliminate EHEC. Confirming these experimental findings, several outbreaks of EHEC have been reported related to aged raw milk cheeses (5,6). The physiological responses of EHEC (7) as measured by stress responses to acid, osmotic pressure, and heat shock seem to contribute to the survival of EHEC during raw milk production.

It may be time to reassess this issue.
