The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) confirmed 2 horses in Suffolk were euthanized after testing positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Both horses were tested for EEE after presenting with acute neurological signs.

The 1st horse tested positive for EEE on 14 Jul 2020 and the 2nd horse tested positive on 15 Jul 2020.

Sometimes called sleeping sickness, EEE is a mosquito-borne illness that causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death.

Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

VDACS encourages horse owners to speak with their veterinarians about vaccinating their horses for West Nile virus (WNV) and EEE.

The mortality rate for WNV is 30 percent and up to 90 percent for EEE. Vaccinations are effective for 6 to 12 months.

Horse owners may also contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services or consult their local veterinarian.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed that a Dunn County horse tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). It is the state's 1st confirmed equine case of EEE this year [2020].

The unvaccinated crossbred mare was approximately 10 years old and was euthanized due to her rapidly progressing neurologic symptoms. Subsequent testing was positive for EEE. DATCP encourages horse owners to vaccinate their horses against EEE and West Nile virus (WNV), which are both transmitted by mosquitoes. EEE is fatal in more than 90% of equine cases, and WNV is fatal in 30-40% of cases.

"The equine vaccines for both EEE and WNV are very effective," said Dr Julie McGwin, DATCP's equine program manager. "It's always heartbreaking seeing equines succumb to these diseases knowing that the suffering may have been prevented by vaccination. It's important that horse owners contact their veterinarians to discuss effective vaccination protocols."

Equines, other animals, and humans can become infected by EEE. In 2019, Wisconsin confirmed 5 equine cases of EEE and no cases of WNV; in 2017, the state recorded a record 24 cases each of EEE and WNV. EEE is not contagious between horses and, while humans can be infected by both WNV and EEE, the viruses do not pass directly between people and horses. Mosquitoes carry the viruses from infected birds, and the only route of transmission is from a mosquito bite. Confirmation of a horse infected with EEE means the virus is in Wisconsin's mosquito population.

Because the viruses follow mosquito populations, the threat in Wisconsin varies depending on the weather but normally starts in mid- to late summer and remains until the first killing frost. Besides vaccination, limiting exposure to mosquitoes will help control these diseases.

DATCP's Division of Animal Health monitors animal health and disease threats, promotes humane treatment of animals, and provides licensing and registration regulation for animals in Wisconsin.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Sciences (FDACS) has confirmed 2 Florida ponies with eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). Affected counties include Bradford and Santa Rosa.

The Bradford County pony, a 7-year-old gelding, exhibited clinical signs including recumbency (inability to stand), incoordination, and hind-limb weakness on 18 Jul 2020. He was reported as being under-vaccinated.

The Santa Rosa County pony, an 8-year-old mare with unknown vaccination status, exhibited similar signs beginning 20 Jul 2020.

Both ponies were euthanized. These are Florida's 13th and 14th cases of EEE in 2020.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn;
- look for EPA [United States Environmental Protection Agency]-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol);
- apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite;
- mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs;
- protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses;
- use approved insect repellents to protect horses;
- if possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn;
- eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly;
- stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

A horse in Brunswick County has been diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), according to a news release from county officials. The identification of EEE in the horse took place on 21 Jul 2020.

Transmission of the virus is caused by the bites of an infected mosquito.

If you are a horse owner, consult your veterinarian regarding proper protective vaccines for your horses and change the water in water troughs at least twice a week to discourage mosquito breeding.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, the cases occur relatively infrequently, largely because the primary transmission cycle takes place in and around cedar or hardwood swamp areas where human populations tend to be limited.

County mosquito control officials regularly monitor the mosquito species to identify EEE activity and direct mosquito spraying operations to reduce the risk to the human and horse populations.

"We can address areas we can access with the mosquito truck, but we cannot effectively address mosquito populations deep in the woods, where they tend to be more active," Mosquito Control Supervisor Jeff Brown said. "This is why personal protection measures are so important to hunters and outdoorsmen."

Residents can better protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and long pants, avoiding outside activities at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and applying mosquito repellent.

If using a repellent with DEET, make sure to follow label instructions, and keep DEET out of the eyes, mouth, and nose.

According to the CDC, only about 4 to 5 percent of human beings EEEV infections result in EEE. In the United States, an average of 7 human cases of EEE are reported annually. However, most cases of EEE have been reported from Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina. EEEV transmission is most common in and around freshwater hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region.
