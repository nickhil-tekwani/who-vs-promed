Synopsis
--------
Following the appearance of influenza A/H5 virus infection in several
wild and domestic bird species in the Republic of Azerbaijan in
February 2006, 2 clusters of potential human avian influenza due to
A/H5N1 (HAI) cases were detected and reported by the Ministry of
Health (MoH) to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office
for Europe during the first 2 weeks of March 2006. On 15 Mar 2006,
WHO led an international team, including infection control, clinical
management, epidemiology, laboratory, and communications experts, to
support the MoH in investigation and response activities.
As a result of active surveillance, 22 individuals, including 6
deaths, were evaluated for HAI and associated risk infections in 6
districts. The investigations revealed 8 cases with influenza A/H5N1
virus infection confirmed by a WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza
and one probable case for which samples were not available. The cases
were in 2 unrelated clusters in Salyan (7 laboratory-confirmed cases,
including 4 deaths) and Tarter districts (one confirmed case and one
probable case, both fatal). Close contact with and de-feathering of
infected wild swans was considered to be the most plausible source of
exposure to influenza A/H5N1 virus in the Salyan cluster, although
difficulties in eliciting information were encountered during the
investigation, because of the illegality of some of the activities
that might have led to the exposures (hunting and trading in wild
birds and their products). These cases constitute the first outbreak
worldwide where wild birds were the most likely source of influenza
A/H5N1 virus infection in humans.
The rapid mobilisation of resources to contain the spread of
influenza A/H5 in the 2 districts was achieved through collaboration
between the MoH, WHO and its international partners. Control
activities were supported by the establishment of a field laboratory
with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) capacity to detect
influenza A/H5 virus. Daily door-to-door surveillance undertaken in
the 2 affected districts made it unlikely that human cases of
influenza A/H5N1 virus infection remained undetected.
Introduction
------------
Following anecdotal reports of die-offs of birds in January 2006,
influenza A/H5N1 virus infection was confirmed in February 2006 by
the State Veterinary Laboratory in Baku in samples obtained from wild
birds, commercial poultry (chickens), and backyard poultry (ducks) in
central and south Azerbaijan [1]. However, there was reportedly no
extensive spread through backyard poultry in the villages. The
Republic of Azerbaijan, with approximately 8.4 million inhabitants
[2], lies on the shore of the Caspian Sea in the Caucasus, bordering
the Russian Federation, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, and Iran. As common
in the whole subregion, migratory birds fly through Azerbaijan twice
each year, from Siberia to Africa in the autumn (August-December) and
back in the spring (February-May) [3].
On 6 Mar 2006, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Republic of
Azerbaijan reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Europe a cluster of 9 cases, including 2 deaths, of
potential human influenza with influenza A/H5N1 HAI [4]. The patients
had become ill over a 2-week period, with dates of illness onset from
15 Feb to 4 Mar 2006, and lived in Daikyand settlement in Salyan
district, 130 km southeast of the capital, Baku [see map in the
original report]. Their symptoms included fever, headache, cough and
meningeal signs. The clinical presentation was varied, which may have
obscured and delayed the suspicion of influenza A/H5N1 virus
infection.
On 9 Mar 2006 another pair of cases where influenza A/H5N1 virus
infection was suspected was reported to the MoH from Bayim-Sarov,
Tarter district in central eastern Azerbaijan. The date of illness
onset of the first case was 28 Feb 2006 and was initially diagnosed
with reactivation of tuberculosis (TB). Because of this diagnosis,
influenza A/H5N1 virus infection was only considered when the second
patient became ill on 4 Mar 2006.
On 15 Mar 2006, further to a request for assistance by the MoH, a
WHO-led international team that had been in Azerbaijan since 5 Mar
2006 to support the implementation of the national surveillance
system for HAI was strengthened by experts in infection control,
clinical management, epidemiology, laboratory work and communication.
The team, which eventually comprised 11 individuals representing 5
institutions and organisations (Robert Koch-Institut, Germany; Statni
Zdravotni Ustav - Centrum Epidemiologie a Mikrobiologie, Czech
Republic; US NAMRU-3, Egypt; WHO Headquarters, Switzerland; WHO
Regional Office for Europe, Denmark), was deployed in order to assist
in: (i) describing the outbreak; (ii) public health surveillance,
including active case-finding; (iii) timely and accurate laboratory
diagnosis of influenza A/H5 virus
infection; (iv) safe and effective case management and transport of
patients for whom influenza A/H5N1 virus infection was considered.
Discussion
----------
Between February and March 2006, 2 clusters of HAI with 9 cases (8
confirmed and one probable) were identified in Azerbaijan. The
majority of patients developed respiratory symptoms, with the
exception of one patient where meningeal signs were predominant, as
already observed in Vietnam [9]. Severe hypoxia, caused by the
prolonged course of viral pneumonia, appeared to be under-recognised
and treated late in children. The early establishment of oxygen
saturation monitoring and provision of continuous oxygen therapy is
therefore crucial to prevent decompensation and multi-organ failure
already observed in cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection elsewhere
[10].
Close contact with and de-feathering of infected wild swans were the
most plausible exposures to influenza A/H5N1 virus in the Daikyand
cluster, although the investigation of the possible source of
infection was made difficult because hunting and trading wild birds
and their products is illegal, and therefore there was some
reluctance in the community affected to disclose information on
possible exposures. Repeated interviews of relatives of the cases
finally revealed that, in February 2006, all cases had been involved
in de-feathering dead wild swans, after a massive die-off of swans
had occurred in the area. Swan feathers are used for pillows and can
be sold at a good price in the locality. De-feathering birds is often
undertaken by women, which explains the predominance of female cases
[10,11].
The HAI cluster in Daikyand settlement is the first event where wild
birds were the most likely source of influenza A/H5N1 virus infection
in humans. However, the difficulties in gathering accurate
information, confusion over reported dates of illness onset, and
similar experiences with past influenza A/H5N1 outbreaks where
multiple plausible exposures were reported, mean that the possibility
that limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out.
The economic implications associated with the ban of hunting and
trading in wild birds introduced in October 2006, and the fact that
the issue of financial compensation related to potential culling of
backyard poultry was not addressed in messages to the population may
have hindered effective collaboration with the community.
Unfortunately, this might have influenced the implementation of
control measures as well as the investigation of the source of
infection. However, because of door-to-door surveillance undertaken
in Salyan and Tarter districts, it is unlikely that additional HAI
cases remained undetected.
The rapid establishment of the RT-PCR laboratory in Azerbaijan
provided timely and reliable diagnosis of influenza A/H5 virus
infection close to the outbreak site overcoming the difficulties of
shipping procedures to NIMR for confirmation which were not well
established and subject to delay. The specificity of the field
laboratory RT-PCR was supported by the absence of false-positive
results. The rapid mobilisation of resources to contain the spread of
influenza A/H5 in the 2 districts was possible because of the close
and transparent collaboration between the MoH, WHO and its
international partners.
The risk of spread of HAI to western European countries by wild birds
is considered to be limited due to widespread awareness that sick and
dead wild birds are a potential source of influenza A/H5 virus
infection [12].

[Use of the term "cluster" in this investigation denotes the
detection of several human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in a single
community. It does not imply either transmission from a common source
or spread of infection from person-to-person as has been assumed
frequently elsewhere. The outcome of this investigation favours the
interpretation that the cluster originated from handling of carcasses
of diseased wild swans. - Mod.CP]
