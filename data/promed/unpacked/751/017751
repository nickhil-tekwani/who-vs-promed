Natural occurrence of Tomato ringspot virus on grapevines in Iran
R. Pourrahim <pourrahim@yahoo.com> (Plant Virology Department, Plant Pests
and Diseases Research Institute, Tehran, Iran. P. O. Box 19395-1454, Fax:
009821 2403691); F. Rakhshandherob (Research and Science Branch, Islamic
Azad University, P.O. Box 14515- 775, Tehran, Iran); Sh. Farzadfara (as for
Pourrahim); and A. R. Golnaraghib (as for Rakkshandherob). Accepted for
publication 28 Aug 2003.
During the last few years several virus-like disease symptoms, including
fan leaf, mosaic, leaf and vein yellowing, leaf distortion, and decline
were observed in grapevines (_Vitis vinifera_) in Ourmia province of
northwestern Iran; an area which produces 178 000 tonnes of grapes annually.
In a survey between May and September 2001, 348 leaf samples were collected
from symptomatic plants of 24 grapevine gardens in Ourmia province. The
samples were tested for the presence of 3 important grapevine nepoviruses:
Grapevine fanleaf (GFLV), Tobacco ringspot (TRSV), and Tomato ringspot
(ToRSV) by DAS-ELISA, using specific antisera against GFLV (No. 51318),
TRSV (No. 51617) and ToRSV (No. 51306), (Sanofi, France).
GFLV, TRSV, and ToRSV were found in 2.6, 0.0, and 1.4% of the samples,
respectively. Sap inoculation with extracts from the ToRSV-positive leaf
samples induced chlorotic local lesions with systemic top necrosis in
_Chenopodium amaranticolor_, necrotic local lesions followed by systemic
ring pattern in _Nicotiana tabacum_, and chlorotic lesions followed by
chlorosis in _Cucumis sativus_.
Inoculations using extracts from the GFLV-positive leaf samples induced
mild systemic mottling and leaf malformation in _C. quinoa_ and _N.
tabacum_ and systemic chlorosis in _C. sativus_. These symptoms are
characteristic of TRSV and GFLV, respectively (Brunt et al., 1996) and the
presence of the viruses was confirmed in the indicator plants by ELISA.
GFLV has previously been reported from Iran (Ghorbani, 1988; Pourrahim et
al., 2000), but this is the first report of ToRSV in grapevines in Iran.
ToRSV can significantly affect the growth of grapevine and causes grapevine
decline (Pearson & Goheen, 1990).

[ I suspect that the first instance of ToRSV infection in grapevine in Iran
was by an unwitting introduction of infected planting material. Chronically
infected grapevines tend to be asymptomatic, thus are difficult to detect
under vineyard conditions, although productivity is reduced.
Soil-inhabiting nematodes (_Xiphinema_ spp.) acquire the virus during
feeding on infected plants and transmit it to roots of neighboring plants.
Long-distance spread is by movement of virus-infected seed. - Mod.DH]
