The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 26 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 591, of which 543 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 357 deaths (309 confirmed and 48 probable) and 203 people healed.
- 12 suspected cases under investigation. The surveillance activities by the Beni and Butembo teams were severely limited on Thu 27 Dec 2018 following protests by the population. Thus, very few alerts could be investigated.
- 6 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Kalunguta, 2 in Oicha, 1 in Beni and 1 in Komanda.
- 1 new death of a confirmed case in Beni (community death).
- 2 new recoveries released out of Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Beni Transit Center
-------------------
- On Thu 27 Dec 2018, protesters vandalized facilities inside the Beni Transit Center compound where suspicious cases awaiting laboratory test results are being handled. This was not the Ebola treatment center [ETC] in which confirmed cases are treated and isolated.
- The extent of the material damage is being evaluated. The tents in which the teams in charge of dignified and safe burials meet were partially burned. Protesters also stole some chairs, tables and tarpaulins at the Transit Center. Some electrical and sanitary facilities at the Transit Center have been damaged rendering the Center non-functional at this time.
- When the protesters arrived, 24 suspected cases were treated at the Transit Center. Of these patients, 3 were in serious condition and could not leave their bed at the time of the disorders. After the protesters left, they were transferred to the Ebola treatment center (ETC) to await the outcome of their lab tests.
- Of the 21 suspected cases that left the transit center, 17 had already been tested negative for Ebola the 1st time and were waiting for the 2nd lab test before being discharged. The remaining 4 patients had already been collected and were waiting for the results of their 1st laboratory test.
- The medical teams are in contact with the families of patients who have left the transit center. Later in the afternoon, 11 patients returned on their own and were placed in additional tents installed at the Ebola treatment center to accommodate them. Although these patients are still traumatized by the events that occurred in the morning, they came back because they understand that a fast and adequate care will increase their chance of survival if they prove to be infected by the Ebola virus.
- Since the Beni laboratory was not operational today, patients will receive the results of their laboratory test the next day if the security situation allows it. This will help unload the non-cases (the people whose tests have come back negative) and accommodate the new suspected cases.

Activities of the response to Beni and Butembo
----------------------------------------------
- The activities of the response to Beni and Butembo have been severely disrupted following the demonstrations of the population. The majority of the teams were unable to deploy in both cities but were able to work remotely with local health workers who maintained minimal field activity.
- No vaccination activities took place in the health zones covered by the Beni and Butembo vaccination teams.
- The community-based surveillance system and local health workers identified 29 alerts in Beni, of which 24 were investigated. Following these investigations, 5 new suspected cases were admitted to the ETC of Beni. In Butembo, a small number of alerts could be investigated and some suspect cases were admitted to the ETC.
- At the level of the support, the Transit Center of Beni is not operational for the moment but the ETC could function normally. In Butembo, the ETC was also operational but with a reduced number of caregivers.
- No dignified and secure burial (EDS) has been performed in the health zones covered by the EDS teams in Beni and Butembo.
- The Beni laboratory was not functional today while the Butembo laboratory managed to test some samples in the afternoon.
- The Butembo Ebola Response Coordinator, Dr. Jean-Christophe Shako, participated in an outreach activity of the Catholic Youth Union. Organized by the Bishop of the diocese of Butembo-Beni, Monsignor Melchisedec Sikuli Paluku, the training session was under the theme of "Family without Ebola". Nearly 300 young Catholics have been trained on Ebola and have been invited to accompany the activities of the response and raise awareness in their community.

Vaccination
-----------
- Further wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber locality (in Komanda health zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako health zone).
- Continued immunization of primary care providers in the Goma health zone.
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 53 523 people have been vaccinated, including 19 363 in Beni [North Kivu], 10 761 in Katwa [North Kivu], 5875 in Butembo [North Kivu], 5377 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2258 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1207 in Komanda [Ituri], 1009 in Oicha [North Kivu], 942 in Goma [North Kivu], 791 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 700 in Lubero [North Kivu], 659 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 394 in Musienene [North Kivu], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 167 in Nyankunde [North Kivu], 70 in Biena [North Kivu], 63 in Alimbongo [North Kivu], 13 in Karisimbi [North Kivu], and 13 in Kisangani [Tshopo province].
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

[The unrest is causing serious disruption in the response to Ebola, with vaccinations being suspended, burials not being performed, and laboratory testing cut back. Suspension of any of these activities alone could have dire consequences, and taken together, it is extremely disturbing. It is likely these disturbances will continue with the election approaching and even after, thus it is not clear what the consequences to the spread of the virus will be. One has to admire the steadfast dedication of the local Ebola teams who continue to do what they can in the midst of all this chaos. - Mod.LK]

- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 585, of which 537 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 356 deaths (308 confirmed and 48 probable) and 201 people cured.
- 74 suspected cases under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
[The total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, and Tshopo provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

Sensitization
-------------
- Beyond the medical arsenal, the Ministry of Health recalls that the response against Ebola is above all a community effort.
- As a reminder, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health are as follows:
1. Follow basic hygiene practices, including regular hand washing with soap and water or ashes;
2. If an acquaintance from an epidemic zone comes to visit you and is ill, do not touch them and call directly the North Kivu civil protection hotline;
3. If you are identified as an Ebola patient contact, agree to be vaccinated and followed up for 21 days;
4. If a person dies because of Ebola, follow the instructions for safe and dignified burials. It is simply a funeral method that respects funerary customs and traditions while protecting the family and community from Ebola contamination.
5. For all health professionals, observe the hygiene measures in the health centers and declare any patient with symptoms of Ebola (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, bleeding).

[2] Unrest
- Wed 26 Dec 2018. Trek into Congo forest reveals an Ebola crisis fueled by violence
[The New York Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/world/africa/ebola-congo.html
[Byline: Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura]

Dr Kasereka Bernardin, a vaccinologist, looked over his shoulder, made the sign of the cross, and acknowledged that the lethal virus was not his most immediate fear. "We're scared of the Mai-Mai," he said, using a local term for militias, his forehead lightly beaded with sweat. "We're afraid they might kill us."

The trip had already been delayed by clashes between government forces and a militia group in the surrounding Kanyihunga district, an emerging hot spot in a new outbreak of Ebola, and nerves were on edge. The team -- an epidemiologist, two contact tracers and Dr. Bernardin -- had not been able to line up guarantees of safe passage from the militia leaders, or even to make contact.

As concerned as they were about security, however, with every passing hour, the doctors were even more fearful that the deadly virus could spread to the entire village, Luseghe -- or, worse, expand beyond its borders.

Venturing into militia territory
--------------------------------
The people in the Ebola zone are deeply suspicious of outsiders, whether government soldiers or health workers, and they often shun visitors, sometimes threateningly. Before setting off for Luseghe, the health workers discussed the security risks animatedly, and particularly whether it was safe to bring along two Western journalists.

Civilians often do not know whom to trust and end up fending off all outsiders. When the police recently tried to take an infected two-week-old baby from his family, the child's grandmother charged out of her house with a machete and threatened to kill them.

Suspicions have been compounded by local opposition politicians who have exploited the crisis ahead of national elections this month, spreading rumors that Ebola was concocted by the government to exterminate them. The thermo-guns aimed at people's foreheads to take their temperature, the politicians say, are weapons to steal votes. Ebola, they also sometimes say, was brought in by foreigners.

Health workers have also taken steps to respect local traditions, helping to break down barriers that can get in the way of treatment. This can be something as simple as burying the dead in body bags placed inside coffins, instead of placing victims into a grave in just body bags.

Ebola survivors, who are immune to the virus and growing in number, are being recruited to look after and nurture orphans who were infected by their parents.

- Thu 27 Dec 2018. Election protesters
[Reuters, abridged, edited]

[Reporting: Stanis Bujakera with additional reporting by Fiston Mahamba in Goma and Juliette Jabkhiro in Dakar; writing: Aaron Ross and Alessandra Prentice]

Security forces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo fired live rounds and tear gas on [Thu 27 Dec 2018] to scatter demonstrators who burned tyres and ransacked an Ebola center in protest at their exclusion from the presidential election.

Protesters ransacked an Ebola isolation center in Beni, causing 24 patients to flee, health ministry spokeswoman Jessica Ilunga said.

Demonstrators also attacked the office of the government agency coordinating the response to the Ebola virus in Beni, said Aruna Abedi, the deputy director of the Ebola response.

Colonel Safari Kazingufu, the police commander in Beni, said 3 policemen were wounded while trying to restore order, including around the Ebola centers. Seventeen protesters were detained in connection with the attack on the center, he said.

Ebola outbreak
--------------
But health authorities had repeatedly said the outbreak would not prevent the vote from going ahead, and locals say it is being used as a pretext to disenfranchise them.

[Additional reports on the unrest in the DRC over the presidential elections can be found at the MoH report of 27 Dec 2018 above,
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/27/congo-protesters-ransack-ebola-isolation-centre-amid-widespread/, and

http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5266 [in French].

One might not have thought the fight against Ebola in the DRC could become even more difficult than it already was, but the unrest around the election is making what was already a difficult situation nearly impossible to manage. The inevitable disruption to the control effort could facilitate the further spread of Ebola. The local health care workers need as much support as can be given to them during this time. - Mod.LK
