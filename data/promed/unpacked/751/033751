The South Korean government on [Sat 23 Dec 2017] confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) at a local duck farm.

The H5N6 bird flu was discovered on the farm with 29 000 ducks in Jeongeup,
260 km [161.55 mi approx] south of Seoul, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

The latest discovery raised the total number of farms contaminated with the
disease to 4, including one in Gochang, 300 km [186.41 mi approx.] southwest of Seoul, and 2 in Yeongam, 380 km [236.12 mi approx.] south of the capital.

The government said influenza found in wild bird droppings in Cheonan, 90 km [55.92 mi approx.] south of Seoul, also tested positive as H5N6.

Including the flu found in wild bird droppings, 9 cases have been
confirmed as highly pathogenic AI this season.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza refers to viruses that cause severe
disease in birds and result in high death rates, according to the World
Health Organization.
