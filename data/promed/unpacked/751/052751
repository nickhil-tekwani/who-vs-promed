Access to areas around Dzhetyoguz, northeast of Lake Issyk-Kul has been
restricted following the discovery of marmots infected with plague, the
paper said.

A special group has been sent out to shoot infected animals, and "an
information campaign has been organized amongst shepherds and hunters. No
cases of humans or cattle falling sick have yet been registered, but entry
to and exit from the area has been restricted," the newspaper said.

[This area is close to the borders of Kazakhstan & China (Sinkiang), and
plague is endemic in the region. Marmots are small mammals related to the
woodchucks & groundhogs of N.America. Cattle do not get plague - Mod.JW]
