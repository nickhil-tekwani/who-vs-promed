Equine influenza - Australia (NSW, QLD)
SUMMARY SITUATION REPORT - Issued 16 Sep 2007
---------------------
This information is an update on information provided on 11 Sep 2007,
which should be referred to for background information.
1. Key Points
There are a total of 1068 infected premises (IPs) - 944 in New South
Wales (NSW) and 124 in Queensland (Qld). Confirmed cases remain
confined to NSW and Qld.
There are 433 dangerous contact premises (DCPs) and 322 suspect
premises (SPs) being assessed within NSW and Qld.
State-wide horse movement bans remain in place in NSW, Qld and the ACT.
While containment with a view to eradication remains the current
policy, procedures for emergency import and use of equine influenza
(EI) vaccine are underway.
Local spread from IPs appears to be a continuing issue.
Collaborative NSW and Qld national EI risk-based zoning (3 zones) and
movement conditions have been proposed. No interstate movement is to
be permitted.
2. Current Situation
New South Wales
There are now 944 IPs, 357 DCPs and 241 SPs in NSW. The newest IPs
are in known hot spots with only one new Restricted Area (RA) having
been declared (in western Sydney) in the past few days. Increasing
numbers of new IPs are anticipated in the current hot spots.
A number of amalgamations of RAs have occurred. There are currently
23 RAs: Brackendale, Brocklehurst, Broughton (near Gerringong),
Camden and suburbs within Liverpool, Caroona (north-west of
Quirindi), Centennial Park and Redfern, Coonamble, Cooyal (north-east
of Mudgee), Gulargambone, Gunnedah, Gwydir, Hornsby, Hunter Valley
and Tamworth, Ku-ring-gai and Warringah, Lake Macquarie, Lexington
(Coonamble), Moree Plains, Narrabri, Parkes, Sydney Metropolitan and
its Environs, Warrumbungle, Wauchope (Oxley Highway) and Wollondilly.
Tracing activities are continuing with priority given to any areas
outside existing RAs. Negative test results from "outliers" tested at
Kembla Grange, Kempsey and Casino have been reported.
The development of buffer zones at strategic points to prevent
further spread of infection south of Sydney or north/west of the
Hunter is being considered.
An order prohibiting all horse sales, shows or events within NSW has
been extended until Mon 17 Sep 2007, when it will be reviewed.
Modified race meetings have been held, and more are being planned.
Meetings are held subject to stringent quarantine and daily
monitoring of horses involved.
Queensland
There are now 124 IPs, 76 DCPs and 81 SPs in Qld. The IPs are in/near
Warwick, Minden/Rosewood, Brisbane western suburbs, Tamborine, and Goondiwindi.
The pattern of daily increases in IPs in Qld has been investigated,
and it has been found that the rate of increase over time is phasic.
It is believed that transmissions have largely been "fill-in" cases
within established areas and that the rate of increase, whilst
demonstrating waves, has not been explosive at any point.
A helicopter fly-over to survey a proposed buffer zone in the Warwick
area and assess horse numbers has concluded, and a report should be
available on 16 Sep 2007.
Serum samples will be collected from all horses at Morgan Park on 17
Sep 2007 and tested through the week to provide information on each
horse for the release strategy.
Other jurisdictions
Surveillance activities in all states continue unchanged. EI is a
notifiable disease, and suspect cases must be reported to state authorities.

[The Australian government is moving ahead with importing
vaccinations for use in this outbreak. Likewise, they are beginning
to use zoning in an effort to further limit spread of the disease as
well as provide a buffer for observations. - Mod.TG]
