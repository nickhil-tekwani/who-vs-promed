Less than 2 weeks ago, Iowa public health officials reported that a bat had tested positive for rabies after biting a person in southwestern Iowa.

Now, a 2nd rabies episode, which apparently originated in Iowa, has surfaced in Nodaway County. Della Rhoades Watkins, administrator of the Nodaway County Health Center, confirmed Monday that a 9-week-old Labrador retriever puppy obtained by a local family from an Iowa breeder tested positive for rabies last week. The puppy was euthanized, since the only conclusive way to know if an animal is rabid is to identify the virus in brain tissue after death.

Rhoades Watkins said the puppy had not yet exhibited symptoms, but was put down for testing after the family was notified that 1 of its littermates had died of the disease, which is almost always fatal to humans unless treated with a series of vaccinations spread over 2 weeks and administered before symptoms appear. Rhoades Watkins said more than 30 people are undergoing the vaccination regimen after coming into contact with the puppy, which she described as playful, active and fond of playing "fetch."

One way rabies can be spread is through infected saliva coming into contact with a small scratch or lesion. No one was bitten, Rhoades Watkins said.

The Nodaway County family that acquired the puppy does not live in Maryville. Authorities withheld their name and community of residence.

Rhoades Watkins said the animal was 1 of a litter of 7 pups, and 1 of 2 that tested positive after a 3rd puppy developed rabies symptoms and died. 2 other puppies tested negative, while the results of post-mortem testing of a 6th animal were inconclusive. 1 owner initially declined to submit his dog for testing, but Rhoades Watkins said she believed that situation had been resolved.

Rhoades Watkins said that after birth, the puppies were scattered across the region, with at least 1 going to Nebraska. She did not know the disposition of the other 5 dogs, except that they had been traced by Iowa public health authorities and all owners were notified.

Post-mortem testing of the dogs, conducted in an Iowa laboratory, revealed a strain of rabies associated with bats, meaning that at least 1 of the puppies was likely bitten by a bat while the animals were still with the breeder. Rhoades Watkins said the other infected littermates could have suffered bat bites as well or received the virus through the saliva of a sibling.

Puppies are not vaccinated for rabies until they are at least 12 weeks old, said Rhoades Watkins, who emphasized that the local family who acquired the infected animal acted immediately on being warned of the danger.

She said the large number of people being vaccinated is the result of extreme caution on the part of authorities rather than a high risk of exposure.

That at least 1 member, and maybe more, of a litter of puppies should be bitten by a rabies-infected bat is extremely unusual, Rhoades Watkins said, noting that this is the 1st such case she has encountered. "This is surely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing," she said.

Rabies is a viral disease that causes acute inflammation of the brain in humans and other warm-blooded animals. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure. Later symptoms comprise violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, partial paralysis, confusion and loss of consciousness. Statistics maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate only a couple of rabies fatalities occur in the United States each year. However, an estimated 40 000 people receive rabies prevention treatment following possible exposure. More than 90 percent of all rabid animal cases reported annually to the CDC occur in wildlife, especially bats. However, most people are exposed to rabies by close contact with domestic animals, such as cats or dogs.

[Infected dogs will shed virus for a number of days before they show any signs of rabies. Thus the necessary caution in vaccinating those had been in touch with this "friendly" pup. While this litter was distributed "widely," the only states mentioned to date are Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri.

Nodaway County is on the northwestern border of Missouri with Iowa. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/missouri_90.jpg.

As the breeder was in southwestern Iowa, it was probably a local sale, and other pups might have been sold to Nebraska and Kansas, as they are adjoining. - Mod.MHJ]
