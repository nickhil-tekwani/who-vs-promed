This newswire reports the identification of Newcastle disease virus
as the etiological agent behind the Mato Grosso do Sul poultry
outbreak that forced the culling of some 17 000 chickens.
The outbreak was posted in ProMED as 20050531.1516.

[This disease is known to affect domestic and wild birds. The species of bird
affected as well as the strain of the virus dictates the morbidity and
mortality. However, chickens appear to be the most susceptible, while ducks and
geese may be the least susceptible. Psittacine birds [parrot family], and
perhaps some wild birds, may develop a carrier state, as they have been shown
to intermittently demonstrate the virus for over a year.
The disease is generally spread through direct contact of some body
excretion or secretion from an infected bird. Respiratory discharge
and fecal droppings are especially loaded with the virus. All parts
of the carcass appear to be infected. Transmission may also occur
through secretions contaminating common water and feed supplies.
Clothing, especially boots, and equipment can transmit the disease
between premises.
Incubation of the disease is generally 4 to 6 days. The virus may be
shed during the incubation time, and birds that survive may shed
virus during the convalescence period.
The disease, as well as some others, should be suspected when respiratory
signs, such as gasping and coughing, are apparent in the birds. Birds may also
demonstrate drooping wings, dragging a leg, anorexia, depression, circling and
even complete paralysis. The fecal droppings may be very watery with a greenish
appearance. Layers [hens] generally have a marked decline in production or a
complete cessation. Eggs produced may be abnormally shaped, have rough and thin
shells and very watery albumen.
Unfortunately, there are no pathognomonic [unique] lesions with this disease.
Confirmation is through virus isolation and identification. However, the
disease should be suspected when there is edema in the tissues around the
trachea. The trachea may appear congested, or there may be frank hemorrhage in
the tracheal mucosa. The proventriculus may have varying degrees of hemorrhage.
Differential diagnoses include, avian influenza, laryngotracheitis,
infectious bronchitis, psittacosis and mycoplasmosis. Differntials
may also include mismanagement, such as water deprivation, or
inappropriate air circulation.
Aside from virus isolation, the serological hemagglutination
inhibition test as well as the ELISA test are also considered to be
diagnostic.
There is no good treatment for affected birds. Biosecurity and
sanitation is the best prevention
There is a vaccine available which reduces the losses in the flocks.
Some vaccines are live viruses and may be administered as oil
emulsion. There are also killed virus vaccines, and still others may
be administered in the drinking water. - Mod.TG]
