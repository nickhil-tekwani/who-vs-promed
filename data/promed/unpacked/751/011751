Tasmania's AUD 100 million (USD 50.78 million) sheep industry is being
ravaged by a devastating, untreatable disease never before seen on the
island. The sheep-wasting Ovine Johne's disease (OJD) has been found on a
farm in the state's Northern Midlands, and tests are underway to determine
if it is an isolated case.
OJD has previously been found on Flinders Island and mainland Australia; it
is highly contagious and cannot be treated. It is spread by the feces of
infected animals and blocks the absorption of food, causing the sheep to
waste away and die.
Tasmania's chief veterinary officer Rod Andrewartha said the unidentified
farm and its sheep had been quarantined. The farm will not be able to trade
breeding stock again for 6 years.
The Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment is seeking all
farmers who bought sheep from the farm or sold it stock. They will be
barred from trading breeding stock until their farms are tested.
Dr Andrewartha said the department was scheduling talks with the sheep
industry to discuss the implications of the finding and map out a plan of
action.
There are about 3.8 million sheep in Tasmania. Tasmanian Farmers and
Graziers Association wool council chairman James Walch said the association
was still unsure how widespread the disease was. Mr Walch said it was too
early to say what course of action should be taken, as not all sheep on an
affected farm would either contract or die of the disease.
"We have to establish how widespread the disease is before we move into a
course of action," he said. "It's a very complex disease. We want the
government to conduct the tests efficiently so producers can know what
their (disease) status is." Mr Walch said farmers also needed to be told
how to manage the disease and what options were available.
Dr Andrewartha said because Tasmania was already listed as a control zone
due to the outbreak on Flinders Island, the discovery would have no trade
implications for the state's sheep producers.
