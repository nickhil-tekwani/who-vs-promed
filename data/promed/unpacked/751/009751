-----------------------------------------------------------------
While ProMED-mail may not have captured RVF [Rift Valley fever] transmission in Angola, pre ProMED-era data suggest that local RVF transmission may have been occurring undetected. In that era, South African workers documented fatal clinical RVF in a patient originating from Angola (1). The Chinese must be commended for rapidly considering RVF as a differential diagnosis.

It is not impossible that local transmission and infection, especially in humans, are missed in Angola if focus is on infections like dengue and yellow fever that have similar presentation with RVF. Furthermore, a possible lack of local diagnostic expertise used in the South African report may be contributory. Of note, evidence of local RVF endemicity in Nigeria has existed for years with extensive work having been carried out in the past at the virology lab in the University of Ibadan (2), but clinical cases remain unrecognized. An additional challenge in Nigeria may be malaria over-diagnosis. As regards animal reservoirs, though the issue of reservoir status of RVFV remains debatable, farm animals are more likely to play an amplifying rather than maintenance role. Ecologic and climatic factors influencing inter-epidemic maintenance should also be considered.
