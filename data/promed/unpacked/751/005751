New legionnaires' disease case confirmed
----------------------------------------
Health authorities on the New South Wales south coast have confirmed
another case of the potentially deadly legionnaires' disease,
bringing the total number of patients to 9.
A further 6 cases are under investigation, a spokeswoman for the
South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Health Service (SESIHS) said. The
9th case, a 68-year-old man, was in a stable condition in Wollongong
Hospital, said the spokeswoman.
The health service would confirm later today, 17 Feb 2005, the status
of 6 other patients who had recently presented with pneumonia-like
symptoms. On Tue, 15 Feb 2005, a 68-year-old woman from central
Wollongong was identified as the 8th case.
The SESIHS announced the outbreak on 11 Feb 2005, with 4 initial
cases involving men ranging in ages from the mid-30s to 84 years.
The men contracted the disease between 30 Dec 2004 and 11 Feb 2005.
The health service began an in-depth epidemiology study to track the
movements of patients, who all visited Wollongong's Central Business
District.
"These movements will then be plotted on a map and we will be
examining all of the maps to look for any common areas," director of
the Illawarra Public Health Unit, Sarah Thackway said in a statement.
