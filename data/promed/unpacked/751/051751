Horses in East Texas Die from Eastern Equine Encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------------
So far, 2 horses, one in Jasper County and the other in Newton County,
in East Texas, have died from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).
Humans also are susceptible to EEE, which causes inflammation of the
brain. The disease is spread by mosquitoes, and measures should be
taken to prevent human and animal exposure to the biting pests.

"As part of their routine health care, horses in all parts of the
state should be vaccinated to protect against dangerous mosquito-borne
diseases, including West Nile Virus, and eastern and western equine
encephalitis (EEE and WEE)," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas' state
veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC),
the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency.

"It takes a week to 10 days after vaccination for the animal to
develop protective antibodies, and booster shots must be administered
as directed by the vaccine manufacturer to maintain the highest level
of protection," he said. "As effective as vaccines are, however, they
are not foolproof, and rare instances of disease can occur. Therefore,
it is essential that you protect yourself and your horses against
mosquito exposure with a repellent containing DEET."

Dr. Hillman also said other preventive measures should include
draining stagnant water, where mosquitoes can breed, and using
approved products that kill mosquito larvae in desired water sources,
such as troughs, ponds and fountains. Avoid being outside at night or
at dawn, when mosquitoes are most active, wear long sleeves when
possible, and consider sheltering horses at night.

"Contact your veterinarian immediately, if your horse acts
erratically, is confused, staggers or collapses. These are clinical
signs of an encephalitic or brain inflammation condition, and a blood
test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. With appropriate supportive
care, about half of infected horses may survive. An infected horse
will not spread the West Nile Virus, EEE or WEE to humans," said Dr.
Hillman. Although they are not regulatory diseases, these
mosquito-spread infections are reportable to the TAHC, due to their
potential to cause human illness. In 2009, a horse in Washington
County, also in East Texas, has been confirmed to have West Nile Virus.

EEE also has been reported in July 2009 in horses in Florida,
Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia.
