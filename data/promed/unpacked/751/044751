An epidemic which struck children in Taiwan more than 30 years ago has
returned and is now hitting adults too. It was reported yesterday that a
47-year-old woman in Kaohsiung had died of Japanese encephalitis -- a viral
infection of the brain -- on Saturday. It is the first death among nine
cases which have been diagnosed in the past six months.

[JE is widespread in Asia, from India to the Western Pacific, causing
thousands of cases annually in China alone. It is carried by Culex
mosquitoes, which are
different from the Aedes mosquitoes that spread dengue. Vaccines exist. -
