Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The original report submitted [on 27 Nov 2019] for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with OIE reference number 32493 was deleted and replaced with the report number 32513 for low-pathogenic avian influenza [on 29 Nov 2019]. The latter report and correspondent follow-up report no. 32654 were subsequently deleted [on 20 Dec 2019] and replaced by the current immediate notification. These changes were done due to the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) laboratory analysis, which confirmed the H5N6 as highly pathogenic avian influenza.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection

[2] HPAI H5N6, EpiCore responses
Date: Mon 23 Dec 2019

We received 3 responses to our request for information made on 29 Nov 2019 in "Avian influenza (52): Nigeria (SO) poultry, H5N6, 1st case, OIE, RFI" archive no. 20191129.6802815. The following information was provided:

[1]
"Not an outbreak, as only one case was detected in a routine surveillance. As the state head of epidemiology and disease surveillance, I can say there is no threat for now, and there is the need for further evidence in a wider sampling frame before an outbreak could be said to be happening. Notwithstanding, the case might provide 1st evidence of H5N6 in the country."

"I confirm this was picked from routine active surveillance in Sokoto by the federal ministry of agriculture and rural development. The species involved was a duck. As a result of this finding, plans are underway to restructure the bird market as was done in similar live-bird markets to prevent risk of cross-contamination between species of poultry."

"It was not an outbreak but an active surveillance activity in 18 states of the country, and the outcome of the exercise turned to be positive in 13 states with different subtypes: H5N6, H5N8, and H9 were detected. These subtypes are circulating among the duck species; unfortunately, they are carriers and could mutate to other high-pathogenic forms. Poultry farmers are warned to avoid live-bird markets to protect their [investments]."

[ProMED-mail published on 29 Nov 2019 the original OIE immediate notification of HPAI H5N6 in Nigeria, archive number 20191129.6802815. According to the information provided in the epidemiological comments of this current OIE report, that immediate notification was deleted and replaced with the current report.

In the ProMED-mail report published in November [2019], it was commented that this is the 1st time HPAI subtype H5N6 has been identified in Nigeria and may be the 1st detection on the African continent. Although the previous OIE report was replaced for this current report, still the comment is valid, due to the information being the same that was published in November [2019].

ProMED-mail greatly appreciates the additional information provided by EpiCore Surveillance Project members. - Mod.CRD
