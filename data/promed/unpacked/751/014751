Rabid raccoons have been increasingly infesting Central Park, with 8 of the
mad animals found there in the past 2 weeks, according to the Department of
Health. The 8 cases, along with 12 reported in 2009, are a dramatic
increase over years past, when only a single rabid raccoon was reported
from 2003 to 2008. Most of the rabid raccoons were found in the northern
portions of Central Park from 79th Street to 110th Street, the Health Dept
said.

The Health Dept has posted fliers in the park and nearby subway stations
and plans to vaccinate raccoons in and around Central Park, Morningside
Park, and Riverside Park in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease.
[This is probably oral rabies bait.- Mod.TG] Park workers have increased
surveillance for sick animals. Visitors are encouraged to be on the lookout
for strange animal behavior and to call 311 if they notice animals that may
be infected.

Dog owners should keep their pets on leashes and away from raccoons and
other wild animals, the Health Dept said. The city hasn't had a human
infection of rabies since 1953, according to the Health Dept.

[Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, of the family Rhabdoviridae and
genus _Lyssavirus_. The bullet-shaped RNA virus has 3 major components:
surface glycoprotein (G protein), outer envelope protein (M or matrix
protein), and nucleocapsid. Rabies virus is transmitted by bite or saliva
of an infected mammal. Any mammal can carry and potentially transmit the
virus, but carnivorous species and bats are the usual agents of transmission.

None of these reports identifies the stain, although it is probably the
raccoon rabies strain in these cases. Five antigenic variants of rabies
strains are recognized in the United States. The single raccoon strain is
the predominant strain.

There is an oral rabies vaccine for raccoons, and this is likely what the
article is referring to.

Central park is located in New York City. Central Park's 843 acres [341
hectares (ha)] include 136 acres [55 ha] of woodlands, 250 acres [101 ha]
of lawns, and 150 acres [61 ha] of water in 7 water bodies. The park's
6mile [10 kilometre] perimeter extends from Central Park West to Fifth
Avenue and 59th Street to 110th Street. It is the 1st public park built in
America. Central Park was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and
a New York City Landmark in 1974. The Manhattan schist outcrops in the Park
are about 450 million years old.

Central Park contains 58 miles [93 km] of pedestrian paths, 4.5 miles [7.2
km] of bridle paths, 6.5 miles [10.5 km] of park drives, and 7 miles [11
km] of benches (nearly 9000). There are 21 playgrounds. More than 500 000
trees, shrubs, and vines were planted during the building of the park.
Today, there are more than 26 000 trees, including 1700 American elms. Over
275 species of migratory birds have been sighted in Central Park, a major
stopping point on the Atlantic flyway. More than 25 million visitors visit
Central Park each year. In 1980, a public-private partnership between the
City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy was formed to restore,
manage, and preserve Central Park. In 1998, the Conservancy and the City of
New York signed a historic agreement, affirming the Conservancy's authority
to manage, maintain, and operate Central Park. In 2006, the agreement was
renewed for a further 8 years.

With a park this size, and this many visitors and activities, it is easy to
see why this many rabid raccoons would warrant concern.
