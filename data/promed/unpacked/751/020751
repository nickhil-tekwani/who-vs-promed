Health officials are urging parents to be vigilant for scarlet fever symptoms following an outbreak in the region. According to Public Health England (PHE) 37 cases of scarlet fever, which commonly affects young children, were reported across the South West last week.

The authority is now urging parents and guardians to be aware of the signs in an effort to catch the illnesses early. PHE is warning parents to look for signs of a sore throat, headache, fever and pinkish rash on the chest. The rash, which appears within a day or 2, can spread to other parts of the body. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.

Initial symptoms also usually include a high temperature (38.3C/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue. Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild, providing a course of antibiotics is completed. If you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Although scarlet fever is now a much less serious infection than it used to be, complications can still arise, particularly in those who are not treated promptly. At present, there is no vaccine for scarlet fever.

March and April are typically when the highest number of scarlet fever cases are normally seen, according to the PHE, and they are likely to tail off after a few weeks. But it said it was unclear why substantial increases in cases had occurred in the past 2 years.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, head of streptococcal infection surveillance at Public Health England, said parents should keep an eye out for signs of scarlet fever. "As scarlet fever is highly contagious, children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection." GPs, schools and nurseries are being urged to inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases. PHE says good hand hygiene routines for pupils and staff were very important. It says children and adults should be encouraged to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough and sneeze and to wash their hands after using or disposing of tissues.

[South West England, with a population of 5 million people, is among the 9 official regions of England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England). It is the largest in area and includes the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. The largest city in South West England is Bristol; the city of Wells is in Somerset County, South West England.

The scarlet fever outbreak that occurred throughout England in 2014 and 2015 was worse than at any time in the past 50 years (http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/fastest-rise-in-scarlet-fever-cases-for-half-a-century-10045621.html).
