The [Morocco] national vaccination campaign against foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is continuing in order to strengthen the immunity of cattle. About 60 percent of the country's bovine population has been covered so far.

The National Health Security Office of Food Products (ONSSA) informed through a press release that FMD control measures, including a booster vaccination campaign, are being implemented in good conditions throughout the national territory. The ONSSA stated that 555 private veterinarians have been mandated to lead this campaign together with the technical staff of ONSSA veterinary services.

Thus a coverage rate reached as of [4 Dec 2015], after vaccinating 1.82 million cattle heads, is about 60 percent of the national cattle herd, estimated at 3 million head.

While the health situation at the national level is under control and no other FMD outbreak has appeared since [13 Nov 2015], the vaccination campaign will be pursued until end of December 2015.

Finally ONSSA stated that all actors including farmers, professional organizations, chambers of agriculture, private veterinarians ... are mobilized to complete this campaign to complete the vaccination of the entire national cattle herd.

[The last 2 weekly follow-up reports on the situation of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Morocco, submitted to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] and respectively dated 27 Nov 2015 and 3 Dec 2015, report no outbreak of the disease during the period covered by these 2 reports. They report the vaccination of 38 917 cattle heads in response to 6 outbreaks reported earlier in 4 provinces of the Casablanca-Settat region (Sidi Bennour, El Jadida, Settat and Berrechid). These reports are available at URLs: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=19202 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19254.

The event continues and new weekly reports will be submitted to OIE.

Vaccination has so far concerned exclusively cattle. Comparing the situation in Morocco to those that prevailed in Tunisia in 2014 and Algeria in 2014 and in 2015, one notes that FMD clinical cases were observed in sheep in Tunisia and that this country opted for the vaccination of small ruminants right from the onset of the disease; Algeria, however, did not report clinical disease in small ruminants in 2014 and has restricted vaccination to cattle only. However, in 2015, outbreaks involving sheep flocks were reported in this country and it was decided to resort to vaccination of this species in response to new outbreaks. - Mod.AB
