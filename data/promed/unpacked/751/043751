In ProMED-mail's last post on the Belgian ASF in boars, a French media source (L'est Republicaine, 24 Dec 2018) was cited, indicating the advance of the disease towards the French border. This alarming issue has become subject of some discussion.

The French Platform for Animal Health Surveillance (CIRAD-UMR) has published the following erratum BH-VSI 2018/52 (see at https://www.plateforme-esa.fr/bulletin-hebdomadaire-de-veille-sanitaire-internationale-semaine-52-erratum; translated from French):

"We have relayed in issue 52 of the international health watch bulletin an information stating that a wild boar carcass positive for ASF has been found 1.5 km [approx. 0.9 mi] from the French border (Source ProMED 20181224.6222340).

"The Ministry of Agriculture of the Walloon government on [Thu 27 Dec 2018] denied this information, regretting that "people [Belgian local authorities] release inaccurate information and speak a little impetuously".

"The carcass tested at Gérouville was negative. The sentence dealing with this information is identified in red and crossed out in the ASF card".

We have been further informed, that the mentioned denial by the Walloon government spokesperson, named Pierre Wiliquet, was published on 28 Dec 2018 in the same French media source cited in 20181224.6222340; see, in French, at https://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2018/12/28/peste-porcine-la-lorraine-resiste-encore.

The ASF case in a wild boar in Gérouville, situated about 1.5 km [approx. 0.9 mi] from the French border, was, in fact, officially notified by The Belgian Veterinary Services; see outbreak No 3 in the follow-up report No 14, submitted to the OIE 25 Dec 2018, as follows:

Location: Gérouville, Meix-devant-Virton, Luxembourg
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Dec 2018
Outbreak status: resolved (14 Dec 2018)
Epidemiological unit: forest
Affected animals
Species / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar: Sus scrofa (Suidae)/ 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=29051

The Gérouville case has also been included in WAHIS report archive, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000029093_20190102_164242.pdf.

In view of the discrepancy between the denial published by the media and the OIE report, a clarification by Belgium's authorities is warranted. Accurate, updated information on the actual site of Belgium's most western ASF-infected boar is essential on both sides of the French/Belgian border case. - Mod.AS
