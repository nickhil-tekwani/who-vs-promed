A 63 year old Eastern Virginia woman contracted malaria, prompting a
federal heath investigation into the source of the disease. The woman,
recuperating at home after an 8 day hospital stay, doesn't remember getting
bit by a mosquito, but the article states she does live near a swampy woods
area.
CDC investigators came to Westmoreland County, Virginia, and gathered
mosquitoes, and blood from 88 individuals, mostly farm laborers, to see if
travelers from Mexico or Central America might have brought the parasite
with them.
It will be at least a week before investigators will finish analyzing blood
samples, and identifying the species of mosquito.
A doctor with the local health district says that public risk is low, due
to the lack of infected human hosts to start the disease chain of infection.
According to the CDC, this is the first US case of Malaria since 1996, and
the first Virginia case in 50 years.
