Top End residents have been reminded to protect themselves against the
potentially life-threatening, soil-borne disease melioidosis after 9
new cases were reported in the past month. The disease, commonly known
[in Australia] as Nightcliff gardener's disease, is an illness that
presents after heavy rain. Health Department Centre for Disease
Control director Vicki Krause said melioidosis could cause pneumonia
and blood infection.

"The bacterium lives below the soil's surface during the dry season
and, after heavy rain, is found in surface water and mud and may even
become airborne," she said. "An increase in cases has been seen in
past years following cyclones, heavy rains and floods." Dr Krause said
there had been 13 reported cases of melioidosis so far this wet
season, with 9 cases in the past 4 weeks.

"The bacterium causing melioidosis usually enters the body through
cuts and sores in the skin, but acquiring the bacteria via inhalation
of dust or droplets, or ingestion of contaminated water is also
possible," she said.

People most at risk were those with health concerns such as diabetes,
kidney disease, lung disease and cancer, as well as those on steroid
therapy or who consume excess alcohol. Healthy people could also get
the disease if they were working in muddy soil without good hand and
foot protection.

The incubation period for acute disease can range from 1-21 days. Dr
Krause said people should wear waterproof shoes when cleaning up after
flooding and gloves when handling soil. "Cleaning up after flooding
can lead to people being exposed to the bacterium by walking in muddy
water and handling water or mud-soaked items," she said. "Using
high-pressure hoses can cause the bacteria to become airborne."

[Infection due to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (melioidosis) is endemic
in focal areas of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. In Australia,
it is also known as Nightcliff gardeners' disease (Nightcliff is a
northern suburb of the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory of
Australia. The Nightcliff area was the site of RAAF [Royal Australian
Air Force] camps with spotlights and large guns used to defend Darwin
from bombing during World War II.). _B. pseudomallei_ is deemed to be
a category B biowarfare agent. It is primarily an infection of humans
with underlying diseases such as alcoholism, malnutrition, cirrhosis,
and immunosuppression, but can also affect healthy individuals, as in
this report. In animal models, larger inocula can cause more serious
infection in immunocompetent individuals.

The manifestations of illness in these patients are not stated nor
whether the individuals had underlying risk factors. Clinically,
infection due to _B. pseudomallei_ may be subclinical, but rapidly
progressive disseminated disease involving the skin, liver, or spleen
can occur. Pneumonia may be the presenting form, either acute or
chronic. The latter may present years after exposure, when the
individual is no longer in an endemic area and may look very much like
pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed
microbiologically and/or serologically.
