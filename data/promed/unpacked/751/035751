This weekly report provides an overview of West Nile virus (WNV) epidemiology in the EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries during the WNV transmission season (expected to be June-November). Following a One Health approach, WNV infections in humans and outbreaks in equids and birds are included in the report. Visit the dedicated web pages for more information on WNV infections and ECDC's seasonal WNV surveillance.

Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
Since last week's update, and as of 10 Aug 2022, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries reported 67 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection and 3 deaths related to WNV infections. Cases were reported by Italy (50), Greece (15) and Austria (2). Deaths were reported by Italy (3). EU-neighbouring countries reported 11 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia (11) and deaths (2) related to WNV infections in Serbia.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season and as of 10 Aug 2022, EU/EEA countries have reported 188 human cases of WNV infection in Italy (144), Greece (39), Austria (2), Romania (2) and Slovakia (1) and 10 deaths in Italy. EU-neighbouring countries have reported 34 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia (34) and 3 deaths in Serbia.

During the current transmission season, within the reporting countries, human cases of WNV infection were reported from 36 different NUTS-3 or GAUL-1 regions.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, 7 outbreaks among equids and 39 outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries. Outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (7). Outbreaks among birds have been reported by Italy (38) and Germany (1).

-------
Data on human cases are collected via The European Surveillance System (TESSy) managed by ECDC. Only locally acquired cases with known place of infection are included in this report. The following EU-neighbouring countries report human cases of WNV infection to ECDC: Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey.

Animal data (i.e. outbreaks among equids and birds) are collected through the Animal Disease Information System (ADIS) of the European Commission. Reporting of WNV in equids and birds is mandatory at the EU/EEA level.

The distribution of human infections covers EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries, whereas outbreaks among equids and birds cover only EU/EEA countries.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence

The virologist Giorgio Palù said: "A progressive widening of the endemic outbreak of West Nile". The numbers released yesterday [5 Aug 2022] by the Region confirm this, given that the balance recorded in Veneto rises to 70 cases of infection, of which 28 are in the form of fever and 42 of neuro-invasive disease. Moreover, in the bulletin of the arbovirosis there is not only that virus, since it counted as well 10 patients with dengue, 2 with Tuscany and 27 with Tbe, that is, that transmitted by the bite of mint.

Updated to Thursday [4 Aug 2022], regional data on the West Nile virus says more than half of the cases have been found in the province of Padova (40), followed by Treviso and Rovigo (9), Venezia (7), Vicenza (3) and Verona (2). So far there have been 6 victims, all men with an average age of 82.2 years. The clinics of family doctors are overwhelmed with requests, says Domenico Crisarà, Paduan secretary (and deputy national) of Fimmg: "Every day we have dozens of messages, emails, phone calls from patients who ask for advice or are alarmed by suspicious symptoms. What worries citizens most, despite the numbers being much more limited than COVID infections, is West Nile. The risk of encephalitis (in any case less than 1%) is very scary".

Mosquitoes, how to kill them
----------------------------
The Prevention Department of the Region highlights the very favorable context for the circulation of the virus due to the environmental and climatic situation: "The lack of rain which causes the slowing of the flow of water in rivers and canals produces the formation of stagnations which are the environment ideal for mosquitoes; the same mosquitoes, finding less water in the sparsely inhabited areas, approach the houses where they find more easily stagnant water where they can reproduce; finally, the climate and spring temperatures allowed mosquitoes to start reproducing very early in the spring". In recent days, an extraordinary meeting of the regional intersectoral table was held, in which the measures that will be activated by the Municipalities and the Ulss were shared. "In addition to the disinfestation plans and the strengthening of the maintenance interventions of the green areas, Councilor Manuela Lanzarin stressed, a widespread information activity also aimed at citizens is essential to raise awareness on the issue and disseminate the behaviors to be implemented to protect themselves and to avoid the proliferation of mosquitoes. Surely the meticulousness of the monitoring will allow us to always have the situation updated and under control".

How to protect yourself from the Nile virus
-------------------------------------------
The technicians have compiled a list of recommendations. To reduce the spread of mosquitoes: do not leave objects and containers where rainwater can collect, in any case empty them daily and cover them tightly; carry out a correct disinfestation of the larvae in manholes, drains and ditches. To avoid insect bites: wear light and opaque clothing; use repellents to be applied directly on the skin, repeating the treatment with appropriate frequency, even on clothes to increase the protective effect; apply close-meshed mosquito nets to doors and windows, as well as use electro-emanating devices for liquid or platelet insecticides. Dengue fever virus is also transmitted through mosquitoes.

A man from Brescia died from Nile fever, the disease caused by the West Nile virus spread by mosquito bite. The victim is a resident of Cigole in Lower Brescia. He was one of the 2 most severe patients of the 4 cases in the area and was hospitalized. According to the data, the number of cases of West Nile infection continues to grow in Italy. In the last week of surveillance, those recorded since the beginning of June [2022] rose to 144 in total, compared to 94 in the previous week. Deaths increased to 10 (there were 7).

According to the latest bulletin of the Higher Institute of Health, updated on 9 Aug 2022, 87 of the total of 144 cases occurred in neuro-invasive form (22 in Emilia-Romagna, 50 in Veneto, 8 in Piedmont, 5 in Lombardy and 2 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia), 23 cases identified in blood donors (3 in Lombardy, 11 in Veneto, 6 in Emilia-Romagna, 3 in Piedmont), 33 cases of fever (1 in Piedmont, 3 in Lombardy, 27 in Veneto, 2 in Emilia-Romagna) and 1 symptomatic case (in Veneto).

As for the 10 deaths reported among the confirmed cases: 6 are in Veneto, 2 in Piedmont, 1 in Lombardy and 1 in Emilia-Romagna. The 2 asymptomatic cases of Usutu virus in Italy, reported in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, are also registered.

[West Nile virus (WNV) infection is a mosquito-borne zoonosis that is endemo-epidemic in Europe. The disease affects countries in southern, eastern and western Europe. The virus is transmitted among birds via the bite of infected mosquitoes, and incidentally humans and other mammals may become infected. About 80% of WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic. West Nile fever (WNF) is the most common clinical presentation. Elderly and immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of developing West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNVND). No specific prophylaxis or treatment exists against the disease in humans.

According to the latest European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) pin section [1], 188 WNV cases had been reported in Europe this year (2022). But the data reveals an alarming fact: of those 188 cases, 133 were reported in Italy alone. That's more than 3 times the cases reported in Greece (39), the country with the next highest number of cases among the 4 in Europe that have reported the virus in their territory. The other countries, Serbia, Slovakia and Romania, reported 34, 2 and 2 cases, respectively.

Of greater concern is that, of those who contracted the virus and developed West Nile fever, there were 10 deaths in Italy as of 11 Aug 2022, also the highest in Europe.

Since the beginning of the year (2022), Italy reported outbreaks of the virus among equids (horses and others - 7 outbreaks) and birds (39 outbreaks).

The best way to prevent West Nile is to protect yourself from mosquito bites. Use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, treat clothing and gear, and take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors. - Mod.UBA]
