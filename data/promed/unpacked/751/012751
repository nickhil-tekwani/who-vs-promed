Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials have confirmed a Brazoria County Quarter Horse with equine infectious anemia (EIA). The horse's premises is under quarantine. Until TAHC requirements have been met and quarantine released, officials will work closely with the local veterinarian and the owner to enact biosecurity protocols and monitor horses having potentially been exposed.

About EIA
---------
Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease attacking horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies which are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those doing so may
exhibit:
- progressive condition loss;
- muscle weakness;
- poor stamina;
- fever;
- depression; and
- anemia

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

[The majority of horses are inapparent carriers: they show no overt clinical abnormalities as a result of infection. These animals survive as reservoirs of the infection for extended periods. Inapparent carriers have dramatically lower concentrations of EIAv in their blood than horses with active clinical signs of the disease. Only one horse fly out of 6 million is likely to pick up and transmit EIAv from such horses. All horses infected with EIAv are thought to remain virus carriers for life. The inapparent form may become chronic or acute owing to severe stress, hard work, or the presence of other diseases.

ProMED has posted multiple times, usually with multiple cases of horses dying from EIA. Yet, there appears to be no issue regarding even research on a vaccine to prevent this horrible equine disease. - Mod.TG
