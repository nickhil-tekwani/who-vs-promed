A comment on virus diagnostics
------------------------------
I do not believe that a proper cost-benefit analysis has ever been
done for viral diagnostics. The ability to have a definite diagnosis
discourages the unnecessary use of antibiotics (particularly notable
in respiratory infections), and, can prevent hospitalization
(particularly in CNS disease). A definite diagnosis results in direct
cost-savings and could be a powerful weapon against the overuse of
antibiotics and the subsequent incalculable human, and economic,
costs resulting from the loss of effective antibiotics.
An often quoted reason for not testing for viral infections is that
"there is no therapy." This is an interesting "catch 22." The
reasoning seems to be: if we can't treat it, why diagnose it? And, if
we can't diagnose it, why worry about developing treatment?
More to the point of this ProMED-mail submission is the
long-recognized phenomenon that there is a peak in summer
encephalitis, without an identified etiologic diagnosis, and, that
this peak exactly mimics that of diagnosed mosquito-borne
encephalitis. I 1st saw this written up in an MMWR from CDC VBDB in
the late 1970's, and the observations were repeated in the 1st year
of the West Nile epidemic in New York, with more undiagnosed cases
than West Nile cases during that summer. It is not clear to me
whether the undiagnosed cases in these 2 reports result from poor
patient samples, insensitivity of current tests, circulation of
unrecognized agents not in our current test inventory, or some
combination. The most recent re-visit of this phenomenon that I have
seen is the recent EID article (Trevejo, 10:1442, August 2004). This
study did not examine the efficacy of virologic diagnosis but did
provide documentation of the low proportion of cases reported, the
large proportion of undiagnosed cases, and indirect evidence for
arbovirus participation.
The undiagnosed fraction of cases is a challenge and is also a shame
for a society that supposedly has such an advanced medical system. It
may also be relevant to the other ProMED-mail posting on Flanders
virus [ref. (04) below]. Another supposedly non-pathogenic rhabdovirus,
Chandipura virus, has recently been suggested as a cause of encephalitis in
SW Asia [see refs. below].

[I can relate 2 personal experiences. During my time at CDC´s dengue lab in
Puerto Rico from 1975-80, there were dengue outbreaks every year. We were
never able to confirm more than 50 percent of those clinically diagnosed
cases in the lab. Some of this was due to the serum specimens not being in
good condition or not having been taken soon enough after onset, but as the
dengue season was the rainy season and therefore also the influenza season,
we attributed the other 50 percent to flu. In a review of 2963 patients with
signs of infections of the central nervous system in New York State in 1966-
1977, arboviruses were found to be the confirmed or presumptive etiologic
agents in only 60 patients. Those detected were California encephalitis,
Powassan, St. Louis encephalitis & eastern equine encephalitis viruses.

State: an attempt to determine the role of arboviruses in patients with viral
encephalitis and meningitis. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1979 May;28(3):577-82. 
