On Friday afternoon [29 Jun 2001 I received the positive lab work on our
first case of anthrax in Minnesota for this year. I will be visiting the
farm on Tue 3 Jul 2001. To date, 2 cows are dead (the first one was a
"lightening" of course). The farm is located one mile from the farm in
Roseau County where an anthrax cow was butchered and processed last year.
The producer is a nephew of the latter cow.
The region has experienced flooding and lots of rainfall this spring and it
has been very hot the past 10 days. Certainly not drought, but hot. The
pasture is 8 miles from the Manitoba border. I will let you know details
after I visit the farm.

[Speculation is easy in the absence of facts but it may be wiser to await
the latter. At the WHO Working Group meeting in Annapolis in early June,
Heidi Kassenborg made the suggestion that insurance companies should
consider demanding negative anthrax and _Clostridium_ diagnoses before
paying out on "lightening" cases. While this makes sense to me and would
certainly encourage the finding and reporting of anthrax cases, especially
of the sporadic background variety that keep the pathogen ticking over, do
we have any members involved in livestock insurance who would care to
comment? - Mod.MHJ
