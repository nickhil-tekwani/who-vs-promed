A rash of seriously ill children in Augusta [Georgia] is likely part of a national outbreak of an uncommon strain of a summer virus, though it has not been confirmed by specific testing, a physician with Children's Hospital of Georgia said. "Since the rest of the nation is having a problem, probably we do have the same virus going around here but we haven't as yet typed it to confirm the specific outbreak strain", said Dr Chitra Mani, a pediatric infectious disease physician. "As of yet we don't know, but we are suspecting we are also in this outbreak."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday [8 Sep 2014] it is investigating 2 known clusters in Kansas City [Missouri] and Chicago [Illinois] of children hospitalized with severe respiratory infections from a virus called [human] enterovirus D68. The virus was confirmed by laboratory testing in 19 of 22 patients in Kansas City and 11 of 14 in Chicago, said Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC. In more than half of those cases the children previously had asthma or wheezing. None of the children have died, she said. The CDC has been contacted by a dozen other states, including Georgia, who are investigating suspected clusters of infections from the virus, Schuchat said.

Enteroviruses -- there are more than 100 known strains [viral species] -- are a common cause of summer and fall illness and are usually not serious, Mani said. "They usually present with very mild infections, sometimes no symptoms," she said. "But this year [2014] we've had a number of respiratory illnesses that have been pretty severe, presenting mostly like asthma or asthma exacerbations." Enteroviruses cause 10-15 million infections in the US each year, mostly in children, Schuchat said. This particular strain has been known but it is not often seen, Schuchat said.

It would not be unusual to see the infection spread to other areas, but people can do their part to prevent the spread by practicing good hand hygiene. If a child is sick, frequent disinfection of commonly touched surfaces such as doorknobs and toys can help prevent the spread, they said.

The CDC said [Mon 9 Sep 2014], 11 children in Chicago tested positive for a rare respiratory illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating whether the virus, human enterovirus 68, or EV-D68 -- that has been reported in clusters in Illinois and Missouri -- is also making children sick in other states. EV-D68, a contagious virus that appears spread through close contact with infected people, causes mild to severe respiratory illness. There is no known treatment for [this virus infection]. In Chicago, 11 of 14 children who were tested had the illness [virus infection] but none of them died, the CDC said. On [23 Aug 2014], the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital reported to the CDC that it was seeing an increase in patients with severe respiratory illnesses, similar to what was reported in Kansas City.

When samples of patients from both Illinois and Missouri were taken by the CDC to further analyze them, 8 of the 11 Chicago patients confirmed to have EV-D68 also had a history of asthma or wheezing. 10 of 11 patients were hospitalised. 2 patients required ventilation for their respiratory distress. 9 were female, whose ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years old, the CDC reported in their Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released on Monday [8 Sep 2014; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm63e0908a1.htm?s_cid=mm63e0908a1_w ].

Loyola University Medical Center, Rush University Medical Center, and Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital said some patients have tested positive for enterovirus at their hospitals, but CDC has not yet confirmed whether they are enterovirus 68. While there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses, which are fairly common viruses of respiratory illness, EV-D68 is less common, the Illinois Department of Public Health said.

Meanwhile, a hospital in Quincy [southwest Illinois] stopped children under age 12 from entering its buildings after 70 children were found to be affected by an unknown virus during the Labor Day weekend [30 Aug-1 Sep 2014] in the area. The CDC could not be reached to confirm whether Quincy is one of the suspected clusters that CDC is investigating.

[3] Treatment possibility?
Sate: Tue 9 Sep 2014
From: Jay Tureen <TureenJ@peds.ucsf.edu> [edited]


In the 1990s, pleconaril had demonstrated activity in enteroviral aseptic meningitis, with broad activity against a wide range of enteroviral isolates (reduced duration of [symptoms] by 1-2 days), but failed FDA approval because the clinical benefit was judged to be insufficient. My understanding is that it is currently in a phase 3 trial for enteroviral sepsis in neonates.

Is the current outbreak sufficiently severe to justify compassionate use requests for selected patients or, better yet, a hurry-up multi center rct [randomized controlled trial]? As we are early in this outbreak, this is the time to try what seems like a heavy lift.

[Can any reader respond to this comment? - Mod.CP

Human enterovirus D68 is a unique species of enterovirus that shares epidemiologic and biologic features with human rhinoviruses. It was first isolated in California in 1962 from 4 children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, human enterovirus D68 has been reported rarely since that time and the full spectrum of illness that it can cause is unknown. The clusters of severe respiratory illness associated with human enterovirus D68 now observed in the USA previously occurred in Asia, Europe, and the United States during the period 2008-2010. Human enterovirus D68 infection was associated with respiratory illness.

It seems likely now that the severe respiratory infections in children are not restricted to the Midwest, but probably are occurring throughout the USA. So far human enterovirus D68 infections have been restricted to infants and young children. Further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
