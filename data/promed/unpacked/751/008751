Hand-foot-mouth disease has reoccurred in 61 cities and provinces across the country, although the number of cases declined by 23.2 percent compared to the same period last year [2015]. There has been no vaccine or medication available at peak season for the disease.

The Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health on 12 May [2016] warned parents of an outbreak of the disease during the hot weather.

Hand, foot and mouth disease, or HFMD, is a contagious illness that is caused by different viruses. Infants and children younger than 5 years old are more likely to get this disease. Symptoms usually begin with a fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell. A day or 2 after the fever starts, painful sores can develop in the mouth. A skin rash with flat red spots may also develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Sometimes, a rash also occurs on the knees, elbows, and buttocks. This rash may blister but won't itch.

HFMD infection cases are recorded year round, yet it escalates in March to May and September to October.

The Ministry of Health said that although since the beginning of the year [2016] cases of HFMD have decreased by 23.2 percent compared to the same period last year, most cities and provinces in the country have reported cases. Meanwhile, there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, but people can take simple steps like washing hands often and practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.

To minimize HFMD cases amongst children, parents should keep personal hygiene by washing hands many times a day for kids; adults should wash their hands before cooking, carrying babies, after going to the toilet, and not let babies put their hands into mouths, and regularly disinfect house floors and toys. Preschools must clean floors and disinfect toys. Ill kids should be isolated at home to prevent transmission to others.

[In the past decade, HFMD has become more predominant in the Asia-Pacific region and has become a pressing problem for global public health.

In Viet Nam, HFMD circulates year-round in most provinces, with 2 associated peaks, from March to May and from September to December, as stated above. The southern region is the most affected area and accounted for over 60% of cases for the whole country.

In 2011 Viet Nam experienced a significant increase in HFMD activity with 112 370 cases and 169 deaths reported from 63/63 provinces.

The response of the Viet Nam Ministry of Health included: (1) strengthened surveillance, early detection and treatment; (2) enhanced communication on HFMD preventive measures, including a national campaign to prevent and control HFMD; (3) improved clinical management of cases and hospital infection control practices through training of hospital staff; and (4) training of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and public health staff to raise awareness and reduce morbidity and mortality.

WHO has developed and disseminated WPRO (Western Pacific region) guidelines on clinical management and a public health response to HFMD.

WHO has provided technical support to the Ministry of Health to:
- establish sentinel surveillance;
- improve clinical case management, particularly for severe cases requiring intensive care;
- improve laboratory diagnosis;
- identify risk factors for severe cases and deaths;
- evaluate control and prevention measures;
- support the conduct of research studies.
