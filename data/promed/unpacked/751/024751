Health authorities say they have detected another case of malaria in
the Torres Strait. Four people became ill on Saibai and Dauan islands
last month [March 2011], and authorities were optimistic the outbreak
had been contained. But a 5th case of malaria has now [been
detected].

[There is a continuous risk of malaria transmission on the Torres
Strait Islands because of their proximity to Papua New Guinea.

During the 1990s, 2 cases of _P. vivax_ were reported on Badu Island
in the Torres Strait (Merritt A et al. Malaria acquired in the Torres
Strait. Commun Dis Intell 1998;22:1-2).

A case of _P. falciparum_ was reported in 2001 on Darnley Island
(Harley D et al. Locally-acquired _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria on
Darnley Island in the Torres Strait. CDI 2001;25:151-3
http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-cdi2503-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi2503s.pdf).
This paper also contains a map of the Torres Strait Islands. See
HealthMap at: http://healthmap.org/r/0Fcg. - Mod.EP]

[It would be important to know whether these cases were vivax or
falciparum. - Mod.JW]
