Philippines: Department of Health Warns Of Possible Dengue Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A Department of Health (DOH) official is warning the public of a possible
outbreak of Dengue hemorraghic fever (DHF) with the coming of the rainy
season. Assistant Secretary Dr. Rolando Enrique Domingo said health
officials are now monitoring the whole country where flooding is prevalent.
Flooding usually brings about an increase in the incidence of Dengue.
Domingo said that as of the first week of June 2003, the DOH has recorded
more than 4000 dengue cases nationwide, a 61 percent increase compared to
the same period last year. There were 54 deaths recorded.
Dengue is an acute infectious viral disease, which usually affects infants
and young children. It is transmitted by a day-biting mosquito known as
_Aedes aegypti_. This mosquito lays eggs in clear water containers, such as
lower vases, cans, rain barrels, old rubber tires, etc. The adult
mosquitoes rest in dark places.
Dengue is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other
symptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain, muscle pain, and other
pain, followed by signs of bleeding such as petechiae (tiny red spots on
the skin), nose bleeding, and gum bleeding. If there is blood in the stool
or in vomit, accompanied by shock, this is called Dengue Shock Syndrome and
is often fatal, the DOH official added.
Domingo disclosed that this year's records show that the disease has
infected individuals with ages ranging from one month to 87 years. About 48
percent of the cases, Domingo added, belonged to the 1-9 years age group. A
case fatality ratio of 1 percent and above was noted among age groups under
one year and 1-9 years of age.
The regions with the highest number of cases were the National Capital
Region with 875 incidents, Central Visayas with 752 infected individuals,
and Northern Mindanao with 634. There were no hotspots or outbreaks
observed, he added. "However, clustering of cases was noted in
Pinagbuhatan, Pasig, Metro Manila."
