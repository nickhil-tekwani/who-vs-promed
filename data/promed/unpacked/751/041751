Cases of canine influenza (H3N2) have been diagnosed in over 30 states. Michigan has recently started seeing cases of this infectious disease. Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine has treated some of these ill dogs. Ingham County Animal Control and Shelter, and other rescues and shelters in the area, have started preventative protocols to help reduce the spread of this virus. H3N2 has similar signs to "kennel cough" and other upper respiratory illnesses. It typically presents with sneezing, nasal discharge, and frequent coughing that may persist for 2 weeks or more.

Because this is an infectious disease spread by an airborne virus, a shelter environment is highly susceptible to an outbreak. Ingham County Animal Control and Shelter is taking a proactive approach and is already administering vaccinations to dogs that are staying at the shelter. It is a 2- step vaccine, requiring a booster shot 3 weeks after the initial vaccine. Shelter dogs will receive both doses at the shelter if they are still in the shelters care. Pet owners will be advised when the vaccination was given (or vaccinations) and are encouraged to speak with their personal veterinarians about additional follow up care and vaccines.

According to the University of Florida Shelter Medicine Program, most dogs recover in about 2 weeks without complications, however about 20 percent of infected dogs progress the pneumonia within the 1st week of the illness. The pneumonia can be life-threatening without proper veterinary care. Ingham County Animal Control & Shelter advises all pet owners to speak with their veterinarian about their pets risk for contracting the virus and further vaccination recommendations.

For more information on other programs, and discounted adoption specials at Ingham County Animal Control [ICAC] & Shelter, visit the ICAC website at http://www.ac.ingham.org, or visit the shelter at 600 Curtis St in Mason. Ingham County Animal Control is open Tuesday 12-6 pm, Wednesday 12-7 pm, and Thursday-Monday 11-4 pm.

["Canine influenza [CI] or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the United States, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the United States, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.

"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the US." (https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx).

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm). - Mod.TG
