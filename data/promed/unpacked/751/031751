Egypt uncovered new cases of bird flu in domestic fowl, the health
ministry said on Thursday. Birds tested positive for the lethal H5N1
strain in locations in the southern province of Sohag and the
Mediterranean coastal province of Damietta, the ministry said.
"Teams were culling the infected birds in both locations," it said in
a statement on the state news agency MENA. The ministry on Tuesday
announced Egypt's 1st discovery of infected birds in months, raising
concerns over a return of the virus with the start of the migration
season.
Since the disease broke out in the country in early March 2006, 6
people died of bird flu in Egypt. sparking a massive cull of poultry
across the country.

[It is unclear from this article whether there are new cases in Sohag
or the culling there is due to the infection found on 3 Sept - see
Avian influenza (190) - Egypt (Sohag) 20060903.2510.
It is clear however, that in a very different part of the country,
another infection has been identified in Damietta. For locations of
these two outbreaks, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhaj_Governorate> in the south and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimyat_Governorate> some 200 kilometers
north of Cairo.
It is ironic but certainly not unprecedented that the ministry had
just declared Egypt free of Avian Influenza a few days ago. - Mod.PC]
