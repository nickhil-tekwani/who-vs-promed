India
- Karnataka.15 Feb 2018. Dengue cases in Karnataka have tripled in the last 3 years with the number of dengue patients in the state the 3rd highest in the country. The number of patients suffering from dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has surpassed the number of patients suffering from malaria. The state fares worse than Bihar and Uttar Pradesh when it comes to dengue outbreaks. If we look at the data since 2015, the number of dengue cases in the state has gone up from 5077 in 2015 to 17 265 in the year 2017, as per the data from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. For the year 2017, Karnataka is only behind Kerala and Tamil Nadu with 19 973 and 23 294 dengue cases, respectively.

[2] Vaccination
Date: 8 Feb 2018

https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/online/%7B99afa5ba-61ac-482f-b095-22931f9683b1%7D/3-deaths-in-philippines-linked-to-dengvaxia-vaccine


The Philippines Department of Health announced that a "causal association" has been found between 3 pediatric deaths and the dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. Two of these deaths may have been caused by vaccine failure, according to a Department of Health (DOH) press release. The deaths were investigated by members of a Dengue Investigative Task Force (DITF) that was created by the Philippine General Hospital (PHG) in response to concerns over the safety of Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur), the only licensed dengue vaccine approved for use by 19 regulatory authorities in endemic areas. Concerns arose in December 2017 after Sanofi Pasteur released data showing Dengvaxia is effective in patients who had a prior dengue infection but may cause more severe disease in nonimmune patients who become infected after vaccination. In light of these data, the Philippines DOH suspended an immunization program that used the vaccine to prevent dengue virus infection, which is endemic in the country. During the immunization program, more than 830 000 children received at least one dose of Dengvaxia, according to the DOH.

Scott B. Halstead, MD, an adjunct professor in the department of preventive medicine and biometrics, Uniformed Services of the University of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, previously told Infectious Disease News that the live, recombinant vaccine may have triggered antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in vaccine recipients with no prior infection. ADE, he said, occurs when a patient who has recovered from infection with one type of dengue virus develops antibodies that can react with other dengue viruses, making subsequent infections with dengue more severe and potentially fatal.

In addition to the 3 deaths with "casual association," the PHG DITF report included information on 11 other children who died after Dengvaxia vaccination. Three of these deaths were considered "coincidental," and 2 had inadequate information. A temporal association was established in the remaining 6 children, all of whom died within 30 days of receiving the vaccine.

"These results strengthen our decision to suspend the Dengue Immunization Program as Dengvaxia is not fit for a mass immunization program that does not screen for prior dengue infection and comorbidities of children before the administration of the vaccine," the release said. "In this light, the DOH will now hand over the PGH DITF report and the National Expert Panel reports to the Department of Justice so that they may use them in the fulfillment of their mandate to investigate and prosecute those who are possibly accountable."

A spokesperson for Sanofi Pasteur told Infectious Disease News, "there are no safety or quality concerns about the Dengvaxia vaccine," and the report shows "no evidence directly linking the Dengvaxia vaccine to any of the 14 deaths. Sanofi Pasteur has always followed the highest ethical standards, and, should there be any case of injury due to dengue that has been demonstrated by credible scientific evidence to be causally related to vaccination, we will assume responsibility," the company spokesperson said.

Sanofi Pasteur had previously agreed to refund the Philippines for unused doses of the vaccine. However, it recently declined the DOH's request to refund the government for used doses and to financially support an indemnification fund.

Agreeing to refund the used doses of Dengvaxia would imply that the vaccine is ineffective, which is not the case. The data remain quite clear that, in absolute terms, dengue vaccination in the Philippines will provide a net reduction in dengue disease, including severe dengue and, thereby, reduce the overall public health burden associated with this disease.

If the DOH decides to reinstate the immunization program with Dengvaxia after a complete review of data, Sanofi Pasteur said it would be willing to provide new doses free of charge so that people can complete the 3-dose series.

https://www.untvweb.com/news/doh-distributes-dengue-kits-parents-children-vaccinated-dengvaxia/


Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III on Wednesday [14 Feb 2018], met with some parents of the children who were vaccinated with Dengvaxia regarding the health condition of their children. After the meeting, the health secretary once again announced the medical assistance that the agency has prepared for the children who were vaccinated with Dengvaxia.

Duque reiterated that, in case Dengvaxia vaccinees need medical treatment, they can avail of it for free and will not be charged in case they have fully consumed the PhilHealth dengue coverage. This is because the DOH medical assistance fund will shoulder the rest of the hospital expense of the vaccinees. The DOH also distributed dengue kits to the said group of parents, for their children's 2- to 3-month supply.

And to give them more means to provide dengue kits to more than 800 000 vaccinees, the department will request the president and the Congress to allow them to use P 600 million [USD 11.6 million] of the P 1.2 billion [USD 23 million] that Sanofi Pasteur has refunded.

The department has also written Sanofi anew after it refused to refund the Philippines for used Dengvaxia vaccines. The DOH also plans to file charges against Sanofi if it will once again refuse to take responsibility regarding the controversial anti-dengue vaccine

https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/mosquito-gut-holds-key-to-preventing-dengue-zika-researchers/story-IXk1AyJKpM2z9to0FgNhsK.html


The midgut of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits viruses that cause dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever to humans, holds the key to stopping these diseases that affect billions of people across the world every year, researchers have said.

The midgut is the primary site of infection, and the metabolic environment of tissues within the gut determines the mosquito's ability to replicate and transmit a virus. The scientists from Colorado State University and Purdue Institute found that there was a change in the metabolites -- lipids, fats, sugars, vitamins, and hormones -- when the mosquito was infected. These metabolites are essential for the survival of the virus within the mosquito.

Their study was published recently in the journal PLOS Pathogens. "It's like a bunch of people invading a house and reorganising it to support mischievous activity they want to do in there," Richard Kuhn, director of Purdue's Institute of Inflammation, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, said.

The infection can essentially be stopped inside the mosquito by exhausting the resource within the mosquito cells or making the metabolites trigger an immune response to the virus. "The strategies that are being used right now often involve sterilizing mosquitoes or eradicating them, and those might work, but a subtler way would be simply changing the ability of the virus to exploit a pathway and let the mosquito continue on like nothing happened," he said.

For dengue virus, the scientists targeted the sphingolipid pathway, which links together several pathways important for cell signaling and subcellular structure. They also found biological "choke-points" that can be manipulated to prevent viruses from spreading. Every [year], 390 million dengue infections happen across the world, of which 96 million show clinical symptoms, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
