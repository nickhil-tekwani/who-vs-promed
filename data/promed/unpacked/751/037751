Severe case of BVDV type II in veal calves
------------------------------------------
We wish to report the 1st outbreak of BVDV type II in a veal calf herd in the Netherlands.

BVDV type IIc was identified (FLI lab, Germany) in a veal calf herd in the province of Gelderland. In 3 other veal herds similar symptoms and mortality figures are observed, diagnosis is pending.

All 3 age groups housed on the farm were born in Germany. Calves housed at the end of January 2013 were affected with more than 40 percent dead to date. Some 25 percent of this group of veal calves came from Nord Rhein-Westfalen. The identification of BVDV type IIc follows the identification of an outbreak of BVDV type IIc strain on 6 dairy farms in NRW in Germany 2 weeks ago.

Symptoms commenced 2 weeks after the arrival of the calves. Infected animals showed mild signs of respiratory distress (coughing and increased respiratory rate) with temperatures exceeding 40.5 C [104.9 F] in most cases. Medication was unsuccessful. Animals became depressed and recumbent, with severe and sometimes hemorrhagic diarrhoea. In some cases hemorrhagic diathesis was observed (prolonged bleeding from injection site). 90 percent of the affected calves died within 2 or 3 days of onset of symptoms. At necropsy mild to severe lung tissue damages were found and in some cases petechiae and multiple haemorrhages throughout the body. Less than 10 percent of the calves showed signs of recovery but these go on to developed secondary infections.

The infection spread slowly within the herd. Of the 2 other age groups housed at the same location the oldest group was slaughtered last week, as intended, at 26 weeks of age without being affected. The group of calves aged 15 weeks is showing signs of BVDV type II infection now and mortality is on the rise.

So far another 3 veal herds with similar symptoms and mortality figures have been identified. All 3 herds are housing calves originating from Germany. Samples for viral typing and/or sequencing are currently being investigated. At the moment the BVDV type II infections in the Netherlands seem to be restricted to veal farms.

[BVDV is a pestivirus in the Flaviviridae family and is closely related to classical swine fever and ovine Border disease viruses. BVDV occurs in 2 forms: noncytopathogenic and cytopathogenic. There are 2 antigenically distinct genotypes (types I and II), and virus isolates within these groups exhibit considerable biological and antigenic diversity.

Persistently viraemic healthy animals resulting from congenital infection can be readily identified by isolation of noncytopathogenic virus in cell cultures from blood or serum. It is necessary to use an immune-labelling method to detect the growth of virus in the cultures. Alternative methods based on direct detection of viral antigen or viral RNA in leukocytes are also available. Persistence of virus should be confirmed by resampling after an interval of at least 3 weeks. These animals will usually have no or low levels of antibodies to BVDV. Viraemia in acute cases is transient and can be difficult to detect. In fatal cases of haemorrhagic disease, virus can be isolated from tissues post-mortem. Confirmation of mucosal disease can be made by isolation of the cytopathogenic biotype of BVDV, particularly from intestinal tissues. Noncytopathogenic virus may also be detected, especially in blood.

The distribution of type I and type II BVDV appears to be worldwide; however, the prevalence of each type of virus varies considerably among regions. The distribution of viral subgenotypes is more restricted, with many viral subgenotypes being found only in certain regions of the world and, in some cases, only certain regions of a country. Reviews on BVDV are available in the Merck Veterinary Manual

In the 1st descriptions of BVDV type II infections in North America, these newly emerging BVDV were associated with severe clinical symptoms and a mortality of up to 25 percent. The most noticeable form of the disease was the so-called 'haemorrhagic syndrome.' In addition, it could be demonstrated that only certain BVDV type II strains have the ability to induce 'haemorrhagic syndrome.' On the basis of genetic comparison, BVDV type II isolates were classified to the subtypes IIa, IIb and IIc.(Additional details, pertaining to BVDV II in Germany, in Ref 1).

The introduction of BVDV from north America into Europe was attributed, among other routes, to contaminated fetal calf serum used for the production of live bovine vaccines. One of such events, occurring in the Netherlands following the use of modified live BHV1 marker vaccine (against Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis) was found to be caused by BVDV type II which contaminated the vaccine batch. The event involved multiple herds and was described in Ref 2. It caused high morbidity while mortality varied among herds.
