https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10879423/Another-11-people-diagnosed-monkeypox-UK-bringing-total-207.html


In England, 11 more people have been diagnosed with monkeypox, bringing the cumulative number of UK cases to 207.

Announcing the new patients today [2 Jun 2022], the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reiterated that most cases have been in gay and bisexual men. Officials said it was "particularly important" these men are aware of new lesions, rashes or scabs and get in contact with a sexual health clinic.

The new cases bring the total number confirmed in England to 199, while there have been 5 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Scientists are still unsure what is driving the current outbreak, now spotted in 2 dozen countries, given the virus is normally confined to people returning from Africa.

In a report published last night [1 Jun 2022], the UKHSA revealed the UK's cluster of cases are linked to gay bars, saunas and dating apps. More than 60% of domestic infections have been among gay and bisexual men, with more than 86% based in the epicentre London. Only 2 cases have been women.

Most of the UK's infections -- 87% -- were among people aged 20 to 49. And 111 cases are known to be men who have sex with men. And the majority UK patients caught the virus in the UK rather than abroad.

Officials said that contact tracing teams had linked the outbreak back to "gay bars, saunas and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad." MailOnline revealed last week the world's biggest gay dating app Grindr had alerted to users of monkeypox symptoms.

In a report released on Wednesday night [1 Jun 2022], the UKHSA released its 1st analysis, covering the country's first 153 cases. By 31 May [2022], 132 of the 153 cases in England were among London residents (86%). Only one-fifth of cases had travelled from a European country in the past 3 weeks, suggesting the vast majority picked up the virus in the UK.

"Investigations continue but currently no single factor or exposure that links the cases has been identified."

MailOnline revealed that Grindr issued a warning to its users across Europe last Monday [30 May 2022], advising them to contact their sexual health provider if they or any recent sexual partners have unusual sores or rashes. UKHSA is working with the app as well as the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) and the British HIV Association to communicate health risks to gay and bisexual men.

The current outbreak has been linked to several super-spreader events, including a gay pride festival in Gran Canaria on 5-15 May [2022], a fetish festival in Belgium on 5-8 May [2022] and a "sauna" in Spain.

It comes as amid concern among health experts that monkeypox could be transmitted to animals via human medical waste. As the virus circulates outside of Africa, there is an opportunity for spill back into animal populations, which could potentially make the virus endemic in countries beyond Africa.

Dr William Karesh, president of the World Organization for Animal Health told a conference today [2 Jun 2022]: "As we've seen with COVID-19, one thing that comes up is...disposable human medical waste because we are concerned about rodents picking this up. Like a rural local clinic that's putting their waste outside until it's disposed of properly later in the week," he added.

The virus was discovered in laboratory monkeys in 1958, and since then various animal species including squirrels and rats have been identified as susceptible to it. It is understood to have jumped to humans from the animals which it circulates, but which species are implicated in the spillover remains unclear, Dr Karesh said.

In the UK, pet rodents of people infected with monkeypox are being isolated as part of efforts to contain the disease. These include pet hamsters, rats and rabbits.

Teams from the UKHSA are also contacting high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and advising them to self-isolate at home for 3 weeks and avoid contact with children.

Both confirmed cases and close contacts are being offered the Imvanex vaccine to form a buffer of immune people around a confirmed case to limit the spread of the disease. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in previous monkeypox outbreaks and is also being carried out in some EU countries.

Professor Kevin Fenton, London regional director for public health, said: "Monkeypox can affect anyone but we know that many of the most recent diagnoses are in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, many of whom live in, or have links to London.

"We're reminding everyone of the symptoms of monkeypox, and especially gay and bisexual men in particular, to be especially aware and seek advice immediately by calling NHS 111 or their local sexual health clinic if they have concerns.

"As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great. This is why we're working side by side with the NHS, sexual health, voluntary and community sector organisations in London to share accurate information about monkeypox especially to people and groups at increased risk through representative voices."

https://www.hpsc.ie/news/title-22106-en.html


HPSC has now been notified of 6 confirmed cases of monkeypox in Ireland. This was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases in the UK and many European countries.

For each case, Public Health is following up those who had close contact with the case while they were infectious. In order to maintain patient confidentiality, no further information about the cases will be provided. Public health risk assessments have been undertaken, and those who were in contact with the cases are being advised on what to do in the event that they become ill.

The cases in Ireland come after the reporting of more than 500 other confirmed cases of monkeypox in Europe, North America and many other countries worldwide over recent weeks (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/epidemiological-update-monkeypox-multi-country-outbreak-0). The vast majority of these cases do not have a travel link to a country where monkeypox is endemic. Many countries have reported that the cases are predominantly, but not exclusively, in men who self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men (gbMSM).

A multidisciplinary Incident Management Team (IMT) was established by the HSE when the international alert was first raised and commenced activities to prepare for cases in Ireland. The IMT will continue to actively monitor this evolving international situation. To assist in Ireland's response, monkeypox has been made a notifiable disease. This means that medical practitioners (and laboratories) are required to notify the local Medical Officer of Health/Director of Public Health of monkeypox cases in Ireland.

HPSC will continue to closely monitor this situation and provide relevant updates to the public as appropriate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Selected parts of this report follow.]

Outbreak detection
------------------
On 3 May 2022, 5 males with atypical skin ulcerative lesions with similar body distribution presented at Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central sexually transmitted infections (STI) outpatient clinic and at the GAT-CheckpointLX, a community based STI clinic for men who have sex with men (MSM). The lesions appeared predominantly in the genital area (perianal, scrotum and lining of the penis) as whitish-coloured lesions, which evolved with the formation of a central crust. All lesions were at the same clinical stage. There were 2 cases that had papules with similar characteristics on the trunk and limbs, but not more than 20 papules in total. The lesions in the intertriginous areas were sometimes ulcerated, which were the most painful according to the cases.

Timeline and descriptive epidemiology
-------------------------------------
Up to 27 May 2022, 96 cases of MPX have been confirmed in Portugal, accordingly to our case definition. Of these, 41 cases had data on date of symptom onset and exposure. An epidemic curve shows the 1st cases in Portugal had symptom onset as early as 29 Apr [2022]; cases continued to be diagnosed throughout the analysis period (29 Apr-23 May 2022). The epidemic curve also shows different exposure routes, including attendance at specific venues, i.e., saunas used for sexual encounters, travel abroad (Spain, UK and Brazl) during the incubation period and contact with non-Portuguese nationals. Only one case was a contact of another confirmed case.

Cases resided mainly in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) health region (n = 25), with one also occurring in North Region and one in Algarve. Ages ranged from 22 to 51 years (median: 33 years) with the majority aged 30-39 years (n = 13). All cases were male. Considering exposure in the 21 days preceding symptom onset, very few cases (1 of 10) reported contact with people presenting similar symptoms or history of travel abroad (4 of 27). Where data were available, almost all cases identified themselves as men who have sex with men (MSM) (18 of 19) whereas one case reported having sex with only women.

During the 21-day period before the onset of symptoms, most cases (14 of 16 with available data) reported having had sex with multiple partners. Of the 27 cases, 6 cases reported attendance at a sauna in the LVT health region, one case reported frequenting a sauna in the UK and 4 cases reported travelling abroad. Of these, 3 had contact with animals (2 cases with cats and one case with pigs).

The most common symptoms were exanthema (n = 14), inguinal lymphadenopathy (n = 14), fever (n = 13), genital ulcers (n = 6). A total of 14 cases had an HIV infection. Of the cases, 3 required hospitalisation because of their clinical condition, of which 2 have since been discharged. No deaths have been registered up to 27 May 2022. One middle-aged case reported prior vaccination against smallpox.

Discussion
----------
We hypothesised that MPX has been circulating below the detection of the surveillance systems. Although some cases have a clear epidemiological link, the lack of an identified exposure in others raises unanswered questions. Prior studies have suggested a potential role of HIV coinfection. Our study has some limitations, such as completeness of data and sample size, but individual determinants of transmissibility and infection susceptibility are still under investigation.

Some 26 residents of the Netherlands have now tested positive for monkeypox, said Dutch public health institute RIVM. The announcement on Monday [30 May 2022] was more than double the total revealed in the last update 5 days earlier, when 12 people were known to be infected with the virus. The 1st case diagnosed in the Netherlands was announced on 20 May [2022].

Several of those who tested positive in the Netherlands visited the Darklands Festival, a leather and fetish event in Belgium. It is not known how many of the Dutch infections are linked directly to that festival, or how many close contacts of attendees were later infected. The RIVM previously said that infections that occurred at Darklands might not be diagnosed until the end of May [2022], due to the incubation period of the virus.

A 3rd "probable" case of monkeypox has been detected in Sacramento County, health officials said Tuesday [31 May 2022], one week after announcing the discovery of the 1st local case. The 3rd case is a person who had close contact with the 1st local resident who tested positive, county health spokeswoman Samantha Mott confirmed in an emailed response.

The county identified the case through contact tracing, Mott said. County health officials are awaiting confirmation of the 3rd case from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), she said.

The 1st case, disclosed by county health officials on 24 May [2022] as a suspected case and lab-confirmed as monkeypox by the CDC last Thursday [26 May 2022], had recently returned from travel to Europe, county health officer Dr. Olivia Kasirye said in a statement. The 2nd suspected case, announced by county health officials Friday [27 May 2022], also had close contact with the 1st patient.

Nationwide, 15 monkeypox cases had been confirmed as of Monday evening [30 May 2022], according to the CDC: 3 in California; 3 in Florida; 2 in each of Colorado, New York and Utah; and one in each of Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday [1 Jun 2022] that hundreds of monkeypox cases have surfaced beyond the African countries where the disease is typically found, warning the virus has likely been spreading under the radar.

"Investigations are ongoing, but the sudden appearance of monkeypox in many countries at the same time suggests there may have been undetected transmission for some time," World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.

Since Britain first reported a confirmed monkeypox case on 7 May [2022], more than 550 confirmed cases of the disease have been verified in 30 countries outside of the west and central African nations where it is endemic, the WHO said.

The UN health agency's top monkeypox expert Rosamund Lewis said that the appearance of so many cases across much of Europe and other countries where it has not been seen before "is clearly a cause for concern, and it does suggest undetected transmission for a while. We don't know if it is weeks, months or possibly a couple of years," she said, adding that "we don't really know if it is too late to contain it."

Monkeypox is related to smallpox, which killed millions around the world every year before it was eradicated in 1980.

[A Wednesday (1 Jun 2022) report cites the WHO as indicating that there may be a possible summer increase in monkeypox cases in Europe. The WHO has said that it aimed to contain the monkeypox outbreak by stopping human transmission to the maximum extent possible, warning that the potential for further transmission in Europe and elsewhere this summer is high (https://www.onmanorama.com/lifestyle/health/2022/06/01/who-warns-further-transmission-monkeypox-over-summer.html). - Mod.TY]
