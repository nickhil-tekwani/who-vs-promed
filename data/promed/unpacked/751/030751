2014 ALERT #37
Patient Tests Presumptively Positive for Ebola Virus Disease in New York City; CDC Confirmation Expected Tomorrow
---------------------------
- A medical volunteer with an international medical relief organization was presumptively diagnosed with Ebola Virus Disease in NYC following his return from Guinea.
- Three contacts are being quarantined

Dear Colleagues,
The Health Department has presumptively confirmed a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) today in a healthcare worker who treated EVD patients in Guinea. He returned to New York City on [17 Oct 2014] and had been self-monitoring for fever and illness symptoms. He reported a 2 day history of fatigue, and this morning he developed a low grade fever (100.3 F). He was transported immediately to
Bellevue Hospital for evaluation. This evening, PCR testing for Ebola was presumptively positive at the Health Department's Public Health Laboratory; specimens are being flown down to CDC tonight for final confirmation.

The Health Department has interviewed the patient and his close contacts to identify those at risk and to implement quarantine with active monitoring for fever and other symptoms for a 21 day period after their last exposure to the patient. Updates will be provided to the NYC healthcare community as more is learned.

Reporting suspect cases of EVD to the New York City (NYC) Health Department:
The Health Department reminds all healthcare providers in NYC hospitals and outpatient settings to rapidly identify, isolate, evaluate, and report potential EVD cases.

1. Collect a travel history in all patients presenting with fever OR with other signs or symptoms compatible with EVD (e.g., headache, myalgias, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage). Asking about travel is particularly important in acute care
settings to rapidly recognize any communicable disease potentially associated with an overseas outbreak.

2. Immediately isolate patients who meet the following criteria:
a. Travel within 21 days of illness onset to Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia (For a current list of affected countries, see http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/case-definition.html)
AND
b. Subjective or measured fever OR compatible symptoms (headache, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or unexplained bleeding)

3. Ask patients meeting the criteria above whether they had any of the following exposures when in the Ebola outbreak country:
a. Percutaneous, mucous membrane or direct skin contact with body fluids from a confirmed or suspected EVD patient without appropriate personal protective equipment.
b. Laboratory handling of body fluids from a confirmed or suspected EVD patient without appropriate personal protective equipment or biosafety precautions.
c. Participation in funeral rites which include direct exposure to human remains in the geographic area where outbreak is occurring without appropriate personal protective equipment.
d. Healthcare workers in facilities that have treated confirmed or suspected EVD patients, even if they used personal protective equipment.
e. Household member to confirmed or suspected EVD patient.
f. Any person who reports having been within approximately 3 feet of an EVD patient or brief physical contact with an EVD patient (e.g., shaking hands) when not wearing personal protective equipment.

4. Immediately call the Health Department's Provider Access Line at 1-866-692-3641 to report any patient who meets the reporting criteria outlined above (See #2). Be prepared to discuss clinical information, travel history, and above exposures so that decisions can be made on whether to test for Ebola virus and how to safely manage the patient (See algorithm at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/ebola-eval-algorithm.pdf).

If the patient reports any exposures (from #3 above), the Health Department will facilitate Ebola virus testing and recommend admitting and isolating the patient using strict adherence to standard, droplet and contact precautions unless EVD is ruled out.

If the patient has no exposures (from #3) and no concerning clinical manifestations of EVD, the Health Department will recommend evaluation for other causes of illness first and close monitoring of the patient for several days. Patients with no known risk exposures who remain hospitalized should be kept in isolation using standard, droplet, and contact precautions until the Health Department determines that EVD is unlikely. If the patient does not need to be hospitalized, the Health Department will recommend voluntary isolation at home for at least 48 hours or until the Health Department determines that EVD is unlikely. During this time, the Health Department will monitor the patient's status daily.

Ebola test positive for New York doctor who treated patients in Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A physician with Doctors Without Borders [MSF] who returned to New York City after treating Ebola victims in West Africa tested positive for the virus, setting off fresh fears about the spread of the disease. Dr. CS, 33, is in isolation at Bellevue Hospital and officials sought to reassure the public that they are safe from Ebola, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. CS developed a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms after working for the humanitarian organization in Guinea, one of 3 West African nations hardest hit by Ebola.

A specially trained team wearing protective gear transported him to Bellevue Hospital from his Manhattan apartment earlier on Thu [23 Oct 2014], the city said in a statement. Governor Andrew Cuomo said CG had been in direct contact with 4 people, and health authorities had quarantined 3 friends [including his fiancee, in hospital]. The 4th person, a taxi driver, was determined not to be at risk of Ebola.

There have been 9 cases of Ebola seen in the United States since the beginning of August [2014].

CS's Facebook page, which included a photo of him clad in protective gear, said he went to Guinea around 18 Sep [2014] and then flew to Brussels on 16 Oct [2014]. He has specialized in international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City since 2011. Columbia in a statement said he has not been to work nor seen any patients... [His] apartment in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood was sealed off on Thursday [23 Oct 2014] but the rest of the 6-story brick building had remained open to residents, health officials said... - more

Doctor in New York City Tests Positive for Ebola
--------------------
A doctor in New York City who recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea tested positive for the Ebola virus Thursday [23 Oct 2014], becoming the city's 1st diagnosed case. The doctor, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center on Thursday [23 Oct 2014] and placed in isolation while health care workers spread out across the city to trace anyone he might have come into contact with in recent days. A further test will be conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to confirm the initial test.

While officials have said they expected isolated cases of the disease to arrive in New York eventually, and had been preparing for this moment for months, the 1st case highlighted the challenges surrounding containment of the virus, especially in a crowded metropolis. Even as the authorities worked to confirm that [Dr. S] was infected with Ebola, it emerged that he traveled from Manhattan to Brooklyn on the subway on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014] night, when he went to a bowling alley, and then took a taxi home.

The next morning, he reported having a temperature of 103 degrees [according to the NY Department of Health alert his temperature was 100.3 - Mod.MPP], raising questions about his health while he was out in public. People infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they begin to display symptoms, and it cannot be spread through the air. As people become sicker, the viral load in the body builds, and they become more and more contagious. [This patient's] travel history and the timing of the onset of his symptoms led health officials to dispatch disease detectives, who "immediately began to actively trace all of the patient's contacts to identify anyone who may be at potential risk," according to a statement released by the department. It was unclear if the city was trying to find people who might have come into contact with [him] on the subway. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority directed all questions to the health department, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue.

At [his] apartment in Harlem, his home was sealed off and workers distributed informational fliers about the disease. It was not clear if anyone was being quarantined. Health authorities declined to say how many people in total might have come into contact with [him] while he was symptomatic.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a news conference Thursday [23 Oct 2014] evening before the diagnosis, said [Dr.S] has given health workers a detailed accounting of his activities over the last few days. "Our understanding is that very few people were in direct contact with him," Mr. de Blasio said.

Dr. S's fiancée has also been quarantined at Bellevue. Two other friends, who had contact with him on Tuesday [21 Oct 2014] and Wednesday [22 Oct 2014], have been told by the authorities that they too will be quarantined but whether they will isolate themselves in their homes or be relocated was still under discussion, according to a person briefed on the investigation. None of the 3 were showing signs of illness.

The driver of the taxi, arranged through the online service Uber, did not have direct contact with Dr. S and was not considered to be at risk, officials said. Speaking at the news conference, city officials said that while they were still investigating, they did not believe Dr. S was symptomatic while he traveled around the city on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014] and therefore had not posed a risk to the public. "He did not have a stage of disease that creates a risk of contagiousness on the subway," Dr. Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said. "We consider it extremely unlikely, the probability being close to nil, that there will be any problem related to his taking the subway system."

Still, out of an abundance of caution, officials said, the bowling alley in Williamsburg that he visited, the Gutter, was closed on Thursday [23 Oct 2014] night, and a scheduled concert there, part of the CMJ music festival, was canceled. Health workers were scheduled to visit the alley on Friday [24 Oct 2014]. At Dr. S's apartment building, his home was sealed off and workers distributed informational fliers about the disease.

Dr. S had been working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, treating Ebola patients, before returning to New York City on [14 Oct 2014] [note that the Department of Health Alert stated he returned to NY on 17 Oct 2014] according to a city official. He told the authorities that he did not believe the protective gear he wore while working with Ebola patients had been breached but had been monitoring his own health. Doctors Without Borders, in a statement, said it provides guidelines for its staff members on their return from Ebola assignments, but did not elaborate on those protocols. "The individual engaged in regular health monitoring and reported this development immediately," the group said in a statement.

Dr. S began to feel sluggish on Tuesday [21 Oct 2014] but did not develop a fever until Thursday [23 Oct 2014] morning, he told the authorities. At 11 a.m., the doctor found that he had a 103-degree temperature and alerted the staff of Doctors Without Borders, according to the official. The staff of Doctors Without Borders called the city's health department, which in turn called the Fire Department. Emergency medical workers, wearing full personal protective gear, rushed to Dr. Spencer's apartment, on West 147th Street. He was transported to Bellevue and arrived shortly after 1 p.m. He was placed in a special isolation unit and is being seen by the pre-designated medical critical care team. They are in personal protective equipment with undergarment air ventilation systems.

Bellevue Hospital has been designated the center for treatment of the Ebola virus in New York City. Bellevue doctors have prepared for an Ebola patient with numerous drills and tests using "test patients" as well as actual treatment of suspected cases that turned out to be false alarms.

A health care worker at the hospital said that Dr. S seemed very sick, and it was unclear to the medical staff why he had not gone to the hospital earlier, since his fever was high. Dr. S is a fellow of international emergency medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, and an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University. "He is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients 1st," the hospital said in a statement. "He has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas."

Even before the diagnosis, the Centers for Disease Control dispatched a team of experts to assist in the case, before the test results were even known. More than 30 people have gone to city hospitals and raised suspicions of Ebola, but in all those cases, health workers were able to rule it out without a blood test.

While the city stepped up its laboratory capacity so it can get test results within 4 to 6 hours, because of the precautions that need to be taken when drawing blood and treating a person possibly sick with Ebola, it took until late in the evening to confirm the diagnosis. But doctors said that even before the results came in, it seemed likely that he was infected. Symptoms usually occur within 8 to 10 days of infection and Dr. S was home 9 days when he reported feeling ill.

Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids and secretions, including blood, mucus, feces and vomit.

In the New York City region, hospitals and emergency workers have been preparing for the appearance of the virus for months.

[I watched the New York City press conference from Bellevue hospital on CNN TV tonight. The speakers, who included CDC Director Tom Frieden by telephone link from Atlanta, emphasized that he only developed fever after a 3-mile jog this morning, 23 Oct 2014. Since Ebola is not airborne and only spread by contact with the body fluids of a patient with symptoms, so that there is no need for people to be alarmed who visited the restaurant or bowling alley that he went to yesterday, or traveled on the city taxi or subway he traveled on yesterday. - Mod.JW
