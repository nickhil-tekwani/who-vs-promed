A 30-year-old man died in Bariloche [Rio Negro province] with a clinical picture compatible with this disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. He came to this city from Chubut [province], where he also received medical attention because of the incipient illness. The Instituto Malbran will have results of [laboratory] studies in coming hours.

This past Tuesday [25 Jun 2013] a young man from Chubut province died of an illness compatible with hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] in a private health institution in Bariloche. The Director of the Area Hospital, Victor Parodi, confirmed that with the diagnosis made in the Private Regional Hospital (HPR), corresponding samples were taken that were sent to the Instituto Malbran, where the type of virus that affected the young man will be determined.

The man arrived in Bariloche from El Bolson [Rio Negro province], after having been previously in the Las Golondrinas area, next to the Lago Puelo municipality [Chubut province].

The young man received medical attention on at least 2 occasions before he was admitted to the HPR. Parodi explained that the symptoms that he presented with are "compatible" with those produced by [a] hantavirus [infection], and the presumptive diagnosis corresponds to that of this virus [infection]. However, the tests done by the Malbran [Institute] will confirm this presumptive diagnosis or not.

The Hospital Director stated that up to now there have been no cases of hantavirus [infection] during 2013 in Health Zone IV, which includes Bariloche, El Bolson, El Manso and Pilcaniyeu.

[This report does not state which hantavirus is responsible for this case, because laboratory confirmation is not yet available. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); and related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (in western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Until there is laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Because the area where the man likely acquired his infection is in the far western part of Chubut province, very near the Chilean border, Andes virus seems the likely virus involved in this case. ProMED will be interested in receiving information concerning the results of the laboratory tests.
