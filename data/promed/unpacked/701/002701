- 11:28 GMT -- Turkey
Turkey rolled out new inspection and enforcement rules after coronavirus cases jumped above 1000 for the 1st time in 3 weeks, in what the government called a grave rise during the peak holiday season. Top doctors have warned about insufficient testing and urged a tougher message from Ankara, which lifted a partial lockdown in June [2020] and has since lobbied hard for countries to allow tourists to visit to help get the economy back on its feet.

[A common occurrence in many countries. A repetitive comment on my part... lifting of restrictions has led to increases in transmission. Perhaps it is time to have major messaging aimed at continuance of use of face masks, social distancing, and handwashing leading up to lifting of restrictions. Of interest is, using the Worldometer data we have collected, a comparative 7-day average shows an increase of 6.0% for this past week compared to the prior week. A very early subtle rise. - Mod.MPP]

- 11:18 GMT -- US Tennis Open
Reigning champion Rafael Nadal will skip the US Open because of the coronavirus pandemic, putting on hold his bid to equal Roger Federer's men's record for Grand Slam titles. Nadal explained his decision in a series of tweets sent in Spanish and English. "The situation is very complicated worldwide, the COVID-19 cases are increasing, it looks like we still don't have control of it," Nadal wrote.

[I wonder how many other international tennis stars will forgo the US Open this year? - Mod.MPP]

- 19:18 GMT -- Bulgaria football stadiums
Bulgarian football stadiums can welcome supporters at matches when the Balkan country's league season starts on Friday [7 Aug 2020], the health ministry announced. According to an order issued after talks between Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, Sports Minister Krasen Kralev and Health Minister Kostadin Angelov, fans will be allowed at stadiums if they take up no more than 50 percent of a venue's capacity.

[Good luck enforcing 50% capacity; and are masks mandatory? - Mod.MPP]

- 18:35 GMT -- Venezuela (Caracas)
Venezuela capital Caracas's largest produce market is at the centre of a worsening COVID-19 outbreak, but cash-strapped merchants refuse to stop hawking food there for the city's 5 million residents, many of whom are starving. 3 days a week -- down from 6 before the pandemic -- some 10 000 people, including retailers and consumers, pack into the state-run Coche Wholesale Market. The produce is trucked out to the city's supermarkets, providing a lifeline amid Venezuela's 6-year economic crisis.

[Unfortunately, markets have proven to be efficient incubators for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and most likely superspreading events. The 1st recognized outbreak was in the Wuhan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei, China, now recognized as an amplifying location. More recently there was the seafood market in Beijing, China, and the seafood processing plant in Liaoning, China. Markets are crowded locations, social distancing next to impossible, and hard to enforce wearing of masks. - Mod.MPP]

- 18:18 GMT -- Ireland
Ireland announced a fresh delay to the full reopening of bars, putting off a move to the final stage out of lockdown by 3 weeks while also tightening travel restrictions after new COVID-19 infections more than doubled in a week. "I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know I have enormous sympathy for their plight. This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living, to provide a key service in the heart of many communities," Prime Minister Michael Martin told a news conference.

[Pubs are an integral part of daily life in Ireland and the UK, where food, as well as ales, are available. As has been seen in many countries, the addition of alcohol to the mix assists in reducing adherence to common sense (and scientifically confirmed) non-pharmaceutical interventions of social distancing and use of face masks (yes I know it's impossible to drink one's ale and eat one's food while wearing a face mask...), but it's not impossible to social distance while eating and drinking.... - Mod.MPP]

- 18:08 GMT -- WHO: youth with COVID-19
Young people who are hitting nightclubs and beaches are leading a rise in fresh coronavirus cases across the world, with the proportion of those aged 15 to 24 who are infected rising 3-fold in about 5 months, the World Health Organization said. An analysis by the WHO of 6 million infections between [24 Feb 2020] and [12 Jul 2020] found that the share of people aged 15-24 years rose to 15 percent from 4.5 percent.

[Why is this not surprising? Youths are invincible, and teens to mid-20s (actually to late 20s) are the age when partying abounds, in search of life partners or just short term partners in many cultures. They may have a higher incidence of asymptomatic and mild infections (but not 100%), but their parents, grandparents, and co-workers (for those who are out in the workforce) do not. - Mod.MPP]

- 16:59 GMT -- USA cancer diagnoses
The number of cancers diagnosed weekly in the United States fell by almost 50% during March and April [2020] compared to the recent average, a study said, the latest to examine the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns. Emergency room visits additionally appear to have dropped for heart attacks, strokes, and even appendicitis -- trends that are being confirmed through ongoing studies. Child vaccinations have also stalled globally, according to the UN, and world health bodies are alarmed by the impact on the fight against HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis as screening campaigns, logistics, and access to health care have been disrupted.

[Collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic is the reduction in routine, and not so routine health care seeking behavior on the part of the population for non-COVID-19 related health issues. Hospitals and healthcare facilities have been equated to high risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP]

- 16:39 GMT -- Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe's vice president Constantino Chiwenga was appointed health minister, the presidency said, one month after his predecessor was sacked over corruption allegations related to coronavirus testing kits. Former health minister Obadiah Moyo is suspected of illegally awarding a USD 20 million contract for coronavirus testing.

[Collateral damage is corruption at the highest levels within countries when monies become available. - Mod.MPP]

- 16:20 GMT -- Greece
Greece's top scientific adviser warned against complacency on Tuesday [4 Aug 2020] over risks lurking from the coronavirus after the country reported its highest single-day increase in infections in weeks. Authorities reported 121 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday [4 Aug 2020] after a steady rise over the past 10 days. Tuesday's tally was the highest since [22 Apr 2020], bringing the total number of infections in the country to 4855 since the start of the outbreak in late February [2020].

[A comparative 7-day average on data we have collected from Worldometer, shows a 137% increase in daily reported cases for the past 7 days compared with the preceding 7 days. While average daily reports are less than 100, the increase is notable and cause for serious concern. Greece has many beautiful islands and beaches and is a holiday location for Europeans... and the August holidays have begun... - Mod.MPP]

- 14:37 GMT -- France (Paris)
Paris wants to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in certain outdoor areas in order to prevent a new spike of coronavirus infections, French daily Le Monde reported. The paper said that mayor Anne Hidalgo would put in a formal request with the Paris prefecture about ordering the use of face coverings in specific areas, after the government on Friday [31 Jul 2020] gave local authorities the power to order the wearing of masks in outdoor public spaces.

[Again, a comparative 7-day average daily case reports using the Worldometer data, shows a 29.9% increase in average daily reports in France in the previous 7 days, compared with the preceding 7 days. A sign that transmission is increasing in the country. Given what is known about transmission of this virus, mandating the use of face masks in public locations does not seem unreasonable from a public health perspective. But in the context of a purely "public perspective", such a mandate may be viewed as unreasonable. See the responses on the other side of the pond (Atlantic Ocean)... personal freedoms are being encroached..... - Mod.MPP]

- 14:10 GMT -- Nigerian airline sacks pilots, cuts pay over virus hit
Nigeria's largest airline Air Peace said it had laid off a number of pilots and cut salaries in order to cope with the impact of the coronavirus on its operations. The private carrier did not disclose the number of pilots affected, but industry sources put the figure at around 70. Air Peace serves cities in Nigeria as well as elsewhere in West Africa and in the Middle East.

[The travel industry has been hit very hard by the ongoing pandemic. Significant collateral damages. - Mod.MPP]

- 13:45 GMT -- Italy
According to a study published by the government, 6 times as many people as officially recorded could have been infected with the coronavirus in Italy. The study, which was conducted by health authorities and the statistics bureau Istat, found that 1.5 million people, or 2.5 percent, of Italy's population could have developed coronavirus antibodies.

[Add this to the growing body of data supporting a significant "underreporting" (non-intentional) of infections in another country. In this case, Italy estimates the true numbers are likely to be 6 times higher than have been reported. For more information on the serosurvey, see http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioNotizieNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=4998. - Mod MPP]

- 13:15 GMT -- Viet Nam
Viet Nam's recent coronavirus outbreak in the central city of Danang, which led to over 200 cases and 8 deaths, appears to have started early in July [2020], the government said, amid concern the virus may have been spreading undetected earlier. "After having conducted antibody tests on 5000 samples collected from infected patients and their relatives, it can be concluded that the outbreak appears to have started in early July [2020]," Dang Duc Anh, Director of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology said in a government statement. Viet Nam has registered 670 COVID-19 cases with 8 deaths.

[The ministry of Public Health update: "From [25 Jul 2020] up to now [4 Aug 2020] there have been recorded 255 cases, including 33 cases of immigration from abroad and 222 cases of domestic infection in 9 provinces and cities (newly discovered cases These have epidemiological factors related to the outbreak in Da Nang) including Da Nang (159), Quang Nam (43), Dak Lak (3), TP Ho Chi Minh (8), Quang Ngai (3), Hanoi (2), Thai Binh (1), Dong Nai (2), Ha Nam (1). There were 8 deaths, of which Da Nang had 7 cases, Quang Nam had 1 case; these were elderly patients. There are many serious underlying diseases.

On [4 Aug 2020], 28 new cases were recorded, including 27 domestic cases related to the outbreak in Da Nang, including Da Nang (23), Quang Nam (3), Dong Nai (1); and 1 case returned from Equatorial Guinea (bringing the total number of positives returning from that country to 21 cases, which were isolated and treated immediately after entry). Number of deaths per day: 2 cases in Da Nang (http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14006/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-4-8-2020; in Vietnamese). - Mod.MPP]

- 12:30 GMT -- France
French President Emmanuel Macron said the country's 320 000 home care workers would each be granted a COVID-19 bonus of 500 euros (USD 587), a package worth 160 million euros (USD 188 m). "These men and women were the forgotten ones of the COVID bonus," Macron said during a news conference in the southern city of Toulon, adding the French state would put up 80 million euros (USD 94 m) and the local governments the other half of the package.

[Home healthcare workers are critical silent support staff globally and merit help during this crisis. France is doing the right thing. - Mod.MPP]

- 11:46 GMT -- Netherlands
New confirmed coronavirus cases nearly doubled in the Netherlands over the past week to 2588, health authorities said, continuing a steady surge continuing since lockdown measures were eased at the start of July [2020]. The new cases registered in the week through [4 Aug 2020] were up 95 percent from 1329 in the week through [28 Jul 2020], the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said in its weekly report.

[My calculations show an 86.9% increase in average daily case reports for this past week compared with the week before. In either case, a clear indication of increased transmission ongoing in the Netherlands, and like in other countries, temporally relating to lifting of restrictions. - Mod.MPP

- 11:09 GMT -- Indonesia
Indonesia has recorded 1922 new coronavirus infections, bringing the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 115 056, official data by the country's COVID-19 task force showed. The data also showed there were 86 additional deaths, taking the overall number of fatalities to 5388.

[While the number of daily reported cases is greater than 1000, looking at the comparative 7-day daily case reports averages the difference is only 6.1% higher this past week than the preceding week, suggesting that Indonesia may be slowly reaching a plateau. - Mod.MPP]

- 10:07 GMT -- Poland
Poland has reported its 4th record daily increase in coronavirus cases in a week, with more than 30 percent of cases coming from the Silesia region in the south, which has been grappling with another outbreak among coal miners. The daily record, with 680 new infections and 6 deaths, comes as Poland considers introducing stricter restrictions, including mandatory testing for travellers returning to Poland and quarantine for those coming from certain countries.

[In following the Worldometer and WHO reports, (sections [3] and [4] below) Poland has been showing signs of increased case reporting over the past 2 weeks. Using the 7-day comparative averages, there has been a 34.7% increase in average daily case count in this past week compared with the week before, supporting the observation of increased transmission in the country. Coal miners are challenged wearing masks while working in the mines and in maintaining social distancing when down in the mines -- a relatively high risk work environment. - Mod.MPP]

- 09:46 GMT -- France
A 2nd wave of the novel coronavirus is "highly likely" to hit France in the autumn or winter [2020] seasons, the government's top scientific body warned, as authorities seek to contain an increase in new cases over the past 2 weeks. After strict lockdown measures pushed down infection rates, many European countries are now watching numbers creep back up, a consequence of easing curbs to try to limit economic damage and greater social mixing in the holiday season. "The situation is precarious and we could at any moment tip into a scenario that is less under control, like in Spain," the French scientific committee said in a statement published by the health ministry.

[Based on observations in other countries around the world, increased transmission has occurred with the lifting of restrictions. As mentioned below, there are signs of increased transmission ongoing in France -- the comparative 7-day averages for newly reported cases shows a 29.9% increase in the past 7 days compared to the preceding 7 days. - Mod.MPP]

09:04 GMT - Taiwan
Taiwan has provisionally approved the use of dexamethasone, a cheap and widely-used steroid, to treat the new coronavirus, as the island faces a shortfall of the antiviral drug remdesivir after the United States bought nearly all global supplies. Taiwan Centres for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang told reporters that medical experts had decided to provisionally allow dexamethasone to be listed as a COVID-19 treatment but that procedures still needed to be completed before it could be given to any patients. Taiwan has reported 476 cases of the new coronavirus, including 7 deaths. Most of the cases are imported and almost all have recovered. It has kept numbers low thanks to early and effective prevention work.

[Taiwan has been a success story up to this date, but when speaking to colleagues there, there is the overriding fear that this will change, as seen in other countries. As for the USA buying out global supplies of remdesivir, I'm at a loss to comment. - Mod.MPP]

- 08:10 GMT -- UK
The UK will face a 2nd wave of COVID-19 this winter [2020-21] twice as widespread as the initial outbreak if it reopens schools without a more effective test-and-trace system in place, according to a study published. Researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of reopening schools either on a full- or part-time basis, thus allowing parents to return to work, on the potential spread of the virus. They concluded a 2nd wave could be prevented if 75 percent of those with symptoms were found and tested and 68 percent of their contacts were traced, or if 87 percent of people with symptoms were found and 40 percent of their contacts tested.

[Interesting data. The study is Panovska-Griffiths J, Kerr CC, Stuart RM, et. Al. Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, the impact of test and trace interventions, and the risk of occurrence of a second COVID-19 epidemic wave in the UK: a modelling study. Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2020; published: 3 Aug 2020; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30250-9/fulltext
Can the proposed level of testing and contact tracing be achieved? - Mod.MPP]

- 07:36 GMT -- Russia
Russia has reported 5159 new cases of the coronavirus, pushing its national tally to 861 423, the 4th largest in the world. The country's coronavirus crisis response centre said 144 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 14 351.

[The daily numbers of newly reported cases has been decreasing in Russia, with the comparative 7-day averages decreasing by 6.1% in the past 7 days compared with the 7 preceding days. - Mod.MPP]

- 06:54 GMT -- Spain
A restaurant on Spain's northeastern Mediterranean coast is pioneering a dining experience that allows customers to avoid most face-to-face contact with staff and minimise the risk of coronavirus contagion. Customers at Funky Pizza, in Palafrugell on the Costa Brava popular with tourists, can browse the menu, order and pay via the "Funky Pay" app on their phones -- the 1st time a purpose-designed app has been integrated into a restaurant's ordering system in Spain. A waiter does bring the order to the table. Staff manage the orders from screens behind the bar. "Through this system, we have tried to keep physical distance with our clients, which is what people are looking for during COVID," said restaurant owner Carlos Manich.

[Spain is undergoing a resurgence of the pandemic (see section [2][F] below). The implementation of relative contactless restaurant ordering in areas catering to tourists, many of whom are known for partying while at beach resort areas is a clever way to protect staff from these individuals as well as protect customers from potentially infected staff members. As one of the current hotspots of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is in Catalonia, which is where Palafrugell is located (in the province of Gerona), this is potentially a win-win for all involved. - Mod.MPP]

- 06:20 GMT - Australia
Australia has closed the national park, home to its revered indigenous site of Uluru, after some in the community blocked an access route for fear that visitors could carry in coronavirus infections. The country is battling a new wave of the deadly virus, with southeastern Victoria state reeling from hundreds of infections, while Indigenous Australians are seen at greater risk as they suffer a higher incidence of other health woes. "It's up to tourists to stay away if they come from hotspots or are sick," Thalia Bohl-Van Den Boogaard, the representative of a group of Indigenous Australians protesting against the visits, told Reuters by telephone.

[As seen in the other snippet from Victoria, Australia, below, there is a lack of adherence to isolation and quarantine protocols in the ongoing hotspot of transmission in Australia. The Indigenous population is a high risk population for complications and death from COVID-19, and closing the national park seems a sound protective measure for this community. - Mod.MPP]

05:52 GMT - Philippines
More than 27 million people on the main island of Luzon, including the capital Manila, went back into a partial lockdown for the next few weeks. People have been told to stay home unless they need to go out to buy essential goods, for exercise or for work after the number of recorded infections surged past 100 000. With only 24 hours' notice of the shutdown, many found themselves stranded in Manila and unable to get back to their hometowns after public transport and domestic flights were halted.

[Limited lockdowns have been a strategy to flatten the curve in many countries. Looking at the comparative 7 confirmed case averages for the Philippines, the increase in the 7-day average of daily reported cases for the past week is 84.8% compared with the 7-day average the week before. An alarming increase in ongoing transmission of the virus. - Mod.MPP]

- 05:21 GMT -- South Korea
South Korea has reported 34 more cases of the coronavirus, with the number of imported cases almost twice that of local infections, Yonhap news agency reported on Tuesday [4 Aug 2020]. The 21 imported cases and 13 local infections raised country's total COVID-19 infections to 14 423, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The accumulated number of imported cases reached 2482 in South Korea. But the country reported no additional deaths, with the death toll remaining at 301, while the number of patients fully cured of the virus reached 13 352, up 72 from the previous day.

[South Korea's pattern has been to have clusters erupt with ongoing local transmission, containment on short term restrictions have interrupted transmission in these clusters followed by increases in imported cases until the next outbreaks of clusters associated with high risk activities such as clubs, karaoke bars, faith based gatherings. See today's updated numbers in Section [2][B] below.- Mod.MPP]

- 05:00 GMT -- USA
The Trump administration's plan to provide every nursing home with a fast COVID-19 testing machine comes with an asterisk: The government will not supply enough test kits to check staff and residents beyond an initial couple of rounds. A programme that sounded like a game changer when it was announced last month [July 2020] at the White House is now prompting concerns that it could turn into another unfulfilled promise for nursing homes, whose residents and staff represent a tiny share of the US population but account for as many as 4 in 10 coronavirus deaths, according to some estimates. "I think the biggest fear is that the instruments may be delivered but it won't do any good if you don't have the test kits," said George Linial, president of Leading Age of Texas, a group that represents nursing homes. The weekly cost of testing employees could range from more than USD 19 000 to nearly USD 38 000, according to estimates by the national organisation. The Trump administration said nursing homes could cover the cost of ongoing testing from a USD 5 billion pot provided by Congress, and allocated to the facilities by the White House.

[Media reports have cited more than 40% of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA are linked to nursing homes (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html and https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/06/nursing-homes-site-40-us-covid-19-deaths). Protection of residents and employees should be a primary focus to impact mortality due to COVID-19 in the USA. - Mod.MPP]

- 04:30 GMT -- UN chief: 'generational catastrophe'
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces a "generational catastrophe" because of school closures amid the coronavirus pandemic and said that getting students safely back to the classroom must be "a top priority", according to Reuters news agency. Guterres said that as of mid-July [2020] schools were closed in some 160 countries, affecting more than 1 billion students, while at least 40 million children have missed out on pre-school. This came on top of more than 250 million children already being out of school before the pandemic and only a quarter of secondary school students in developing countries leaving with basic skills, he said in a video statement. "Now we face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities," said Guterres as he launched a UN "Save our Future" campaign.

[The pros and cons of opening up schools continue to be debated. There's no easy answer. The teachers and school staff are at risk of transmission from the students, and at risk of transmitting to the students. And then the households these children return to. The very high at risk children are the same ones coming from families at high risk of adverse events accompanying infection with the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP]

- 03:35 GMT -- USA
The United States has added 48 395 new coronavirus cases pushing the total number to 4.73 million, according to a Reuters news agency tally. Reuters also reported another 582 deaths, adding to the total of almost 156 000.

[See section [2][E] below for the latest case count in the USA from today's Worldometer.com data. - Mod.MPP]

- 03:20 GMT -- Germany
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 879 to 211 281, Reuters reported on Tuesday [4 Aug 2020] quoting data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The reported death toll rose by 8 to 9156, the tally showed.

[Looking at comparative 7-day averages of daily newly confirmed cases in Germany, the past 7 days had an increase of 27.0% reported cases compared with the preceding 7 days (using our spreadsheet from Worldometer data). A sign of increasing transmission in Germany. - Mod.MPP]

- 02:45 GMT -- Australia (Victoria)
Australia's 2nd-most populous state Victoria said on Tuesday [4 Aug 2020] that it will deploy its military and that anyone who has contracted COVID-19 and caught outside their home in breach of isolation orders will face fines of as much as AUD 20 000 (USD 14 250), according to the Reuters news agency. Victoria state earlier this week imposed a nightly curfew, tightened restrictions on people's movement, and ordered large parts of the local economy to close to slow the spread of coronavirus. But state Premier Daniel Andrews said nearly 1/3 of those who had contracted COVID-19 were not home when checked on by officials, requiring tough new penalties to stop community transmission. Andrews also said 500 military personnel will this week deploy to Victoria to bolster enforcement of self-isolation orders.

[Perhaps the only way to communicate the need to adhere to restrictions is through imposing fines. Do "personal freedoms" allow for freedom to injure others? The lack of adherence to home isolation, when confirmed to be infected, is exercising one's right to injure others through transmitting the virus to others knowingly. - Mod.MPP]

- 01:50 GMT -- Italy
The number of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Italy has fallen below 200 for the 1st time in a week, with 159 new cases registered, according to AP news agency quoting the health ministry. That brings the total number of cases in Italy to 248 229 and deaths to 35 166 as of the end of Monday [3 Aug 2020]. Lazio, the central region that includes Rome, now has the highest number of patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Italy's 20 regions. Health officials said 9 of the region's new cases were brought by travelers from abroad. 2 clusters of infections have also been traced to popular seaside areas near Rome. Monday [3 Aug 2020] figures tend to be lower since they often don't include tallies from the weekend.

[Imported cases are the re-introducers of the virus in areas that have interrupted transmission; but seaside resorts/beaches where vacationers go are also hot spots for transmission of the virus. As mentioned in today's brief selected countries in Italy (section [2][C] below] there is evidence of increased transmission in the country in the past 2 weeks. - Mod.MPP]

- 01:00 GMT -- Mexico
Mexico's health ministry has reported 4767 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 266 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 443 813 cases and 48 012 deaths, according to Reuters news agency. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.

[See today's update from the Worldometer data in section [4] below. As for the comment that the real number of infected individuals is most likely significantly higher is a very true statement. Remember results of serosurveys in different locations have come up with as much as 10- and 20- fold increased previously infected individuals than reported cases. - Mod.MPP]

- 00:31 GMT -- Hong Kong
The South China Morning Post has reported that Hong Kong is planning to build at least 2 temporary hospitals as part of its response to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The report said that the temporary hospitals could accommodate as many as 2400 beds. The latest development comes as cases continue to rise over the last few days. The city has reported at least 3589 cases, with 38 related deaths. However, the latest number of cases reported was much lower than previous days, when reported new infections hit over 100 daily.

[Mainland China built 2 hospitals providing over 2000 beds in Wuhan when they were overwhelmed with the early COVID-19 epidemic. For the past 2 days, the number of newly confirmed cases in Hong Kong has been below 100. Hoping this is a sign that transmission is slowing down. - Mod.MPP]

- 00:01 GMT -- Latin America
Latin America has broken through 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, a Reuters tally showed, underscoring the region's position as the area of the world hardest hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The more than 10 000 new cases Colombia's health ministry reported on Monday [3 Aug 2020] pushed the region past the 5 million mark, a day after the Andean nation reported a record 11 470 cases. Mexico has also racked up record numbers of new confirmed infections in recent days, registering more than 9000 daily cases for the 1st time on Saturday [1 Aug 2020], a day after Mexico overtook the UK as the country with the 3rd-highest number of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The region, which has now topped 200 000 deaths, is struggling to stall the spread of the virus, with infections picking up pace in many countries even as governments look to ease lockdowns and revive economic growth.

[Byline: Ted Regencia, Arwa Ibrahim, Usaid Siddiqui]

[Latin America has been very seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as mentioned in the snippet above. Brazil is the outstanding country with over 2.8 million confirmed cases and over 96 000 deaths reported.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

[3] WHO situation report 197 (as of 4 Aug 2020)
Date: Tue 4 Aug 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200804-covid-19-sitrep-197.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 4 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- With over 18 million cases reported today, and new cases rising by around 250 000 each day, now is not the time to be complacent. As some economies and societies open up, WHO continues to urge the public to remain vigilant and take precautions to avoid getting COVID-19; while urging countries to increase testing and contact tracing to ensure no cases are missed and ensure appropriate treatment is available.

- In his regular media briefing yesterday, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros reiterated that "We have seen around the world, that it's never too late to turn this pandemic around. If we act together today, we can save lives, we can save livelihoods if we do it all together."

- WHO has published a scientific brief on estimating mortality from COVID-19. The brief discusses the limitations and difficulties in interpreting the case fatality ratio of COVID-19, and potential biases that could arise in ascertaining mortality.

- Today's [4 Aug 2020] 'Subject in Focus' summarises the work being done by the WHO Regional Office for Africa and partners to respond to the COVID-19 Infodemic

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 50.5% of the global newly reported cases and 50.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 9.7 million cases. The USA reported 42.5% of cases (47 183), followed by Brazil 23.2% (25 800), Colombia 10.3% (11 470), Peru 6.0% (6667), Argentina 4.8% (5376), Mexico 4.4% (4853), and Chile 1.6% (1762).

- The European region reported 13.2% of the global newly reported cases and 15.1% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Spain reported 29.5% (8532) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Russia 17.8% (5159), France 10.9% (3152), Kazakhstan 4.0% (1158), Ukraine 3.7% (1061), Turkey 3.4% (995), the UK 3.2% (928), Germany 3.0% (879), Romania 2.8% (823), and Israel 2.5% (711). While the proportions have decreased, the absolute numbers in a number of countries have not. The re-entry of Spain and France with increased reporting compensating for the weekend without reports.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.8% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 28.2 % (2735) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 26.7% (2598), Saudi Arabia 12.9% (1258), Morocco 6.8% (659), Pakistan 4.4% (432), Kuwait 4.0% (388), Bahrain 3.1% (299), (Oman 0% (0)), and Palestinian Authority 2.5% (244). Oman did not report any cases in the past 72 hours. Cases are increasing in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 4.2% of the global newly reported cases and 1.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 58.0% (5377) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by, Ethiopia 6.3% (583), Kenya 5.9% (544), Algeria 5.5% (507), Cameroon 5.0% (463), and Nigeria 3.1% (288). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past few days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of the global newly reported cases and 1.5% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 61.2% (3145) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 22.8% (1171), Australia 7.7% (395), Singapore 4.4% (226), China 2.2% (114), Viet Nam 0.60% (31), and South Korea 0.66% (34). Japan and Australia continue an increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 25.3% of the global newly reported cases and 21.0% of global deaths. India reported 93.5% (52 050) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Indonesia 3.0% (1679), and Bangladesh 2.4% (1356). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (3 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with a daily case count today [4 Aug 2020] above 51 000.

In the past 24 hours, Brazil reported 56 411 cases followed by the USA (56 246) and India (51 282). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.5%). There were 7149 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, Brazil is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Philippines, Mexico, Spain and Russia, all known global hotspots and all mentioned in section [1] above. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 5159 to 56 411. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: South Africa, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Israel, Bolivia, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and Romania, and their range of reported new cases is 1232 to 4456.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 0.34%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 7.0%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances.

After reading a media report mentioning that the state of Texas was not counting cases confirmed by the antigen test, this may well reflect a pattern in many countries where only PCR confirmed cases are reported as newly confirmed cases (https://abc13.com/texas-covid-19-tests-rapid-antigen-testing-excludes-from-reports-coronasvirus-case-counts/6350981/).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases, albeit I wonder if this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [2][E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has increased from 9% to 10%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.) The most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
