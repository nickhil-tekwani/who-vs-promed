MYCOPLASMA GALLISEPTICUM - SPREADING IN USA: REQUEST FOR INFO
=============================================================

Can anyone confirm the reports of _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ [MG] jumping
species
in the USA per the following report?

"This past winter I had seen five or six swollen-eyed goldfinches at my
feeders (I had seen one the previous winter as well). I managed to trap one
of them, which was sent by my vet down to the Southeastern Cooperative
Wildlife Disease Study at the Univ. of Georgia for testing. I recently
learned that it (along with one of four other goldfinch specimens they
received about the same time from 3 other southern states) had indeed tested
positive for MG.
Specifically, the report stated:
TEST RESULTS: Results of culture for _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ were negative.
Results of the polymerase chain reaction test for MG were POSITIVE.
Rapid plate agglutination testing of the
provided serum sample was POSITIVE for antibodies against MG.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Mycoplasmal conjunctivitis.
COMMENTS: Although MG was not isolated from this bird, the presence of
lesions and antibodies, as well as the positive PCR result for MG indicate
_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ was the cause of the eye lesions in this bird.
As such, these two goldfinches - as far as I know - became the first
diagnosed cases of MG in songbirds in the wild beyond house finches (there
was a previous case of a captured Blue Jay having contracted it in a lab
accidently). But even that has also apparently changed very recently.
I just learned this past Tuesday from another source (which I haven't
confirmed but have no reason to doubt) that a wild Downy Woodpecker had also
recently tested positive for MG at Michigan State University's disease
center. It seems MG's long-feared jumping to other species is apparently
being realized." --- Jim Cook (CmdrJaycee@aol.com)
