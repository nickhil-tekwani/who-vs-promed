[1] UK: spread of new strain

New blight strain demands extra vigilance
-----------------------------------------
With aggressive potato blight strain A2-Blue13 now dominant, skill is
again needed to strike the right balance between effective control
and acceptable fungicide use. The new strain first showed up near
Ipswich in 2005 and has rocketed in prevalence from 38 percent that
year to almost 80 percent now leading to some of the worst potato
blight on record. "We are dealing with a different type of blight,"
advises Potato Council [PC] blight specialist Gary Collins. "It is
more aggressive, fitter and will come into crops earlier."

That A2-Blue13 is more damaging is not disputed. PC-funded glasshouse
trials show it is the most aggressive strain, creating larger blight
lesions and producing spores more rapidly than other strains.
Significantly it can produce spores at less than 10 deg C (50 deg F)
and the period between infection and sporulation is far shorter --
typically 4.5 days for the new A2 blight, compared to 6 or 7 days for
conventional blight.

SCRI [Scottish Crop Research Institute] Dave Cooke confirms the rise
of A2-Blue13. "The onward march of the Blue A2 blight strain is
really quite clear. Genotype testing of more than 1600 samples in
2008 has revealed it now represents 79 percent of the blight
population and is now dominant across the whole of Great Britain."

So does that render Smith Periods obsolete? Not at all, insists Mr
Collins. "Smith periods are still a very good indication of blight
risk. It's now more important than ever to build well-timed
[fungicide] applications around a realistic threat-based blight
control strategy."

Ensuring decision support systems keep pace with the new blight
strains is a key focus of a new PC-funded research programme, which
aims to improve understanding of how new populations respond to
temperature and humidity. The PC is also commissioning blight scouts
to undertake intensive crop monitoring and sampling again this year,
to aid ongoing blight population research.

Potato farmers in Rangpur concerned
-----------------------------------
This season [2008/09] farmers cultivated potato on 54 000 hectares
[133 500 acres] against the 50 000 hectares [123 500 acres] in the
last season [2007/08] with a view to earn a windfall profit.

But the farmers expressed apprehension that the production may fall
by 30 to 40 percent from the target of 1.134 million metric tons due
to the outbreak of the 'late blight' disease that damaged potato
plants in many fields.

Many educated unemployed youths engaged themselves in potato
cultivation by borrowing money and taking land on lease but their
hopes have been shattered by the late blight disease and low price in
the market.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop losses in
potato and tomato. The pathogen is spread by plant material
(including seed tubers), wind, and water. PLB disease management
generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed tubers and crops.
Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different isolates
of _P. infestans_ has been observed. For more information on PLB see
links and previous ProMED-mail posts below.

Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present,
reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually increasing the
chances of strains with higher fungicide resistance and increased
yield losses to develop. A1 is present worldwide, A2 occurs now in
northern Europe, northern and central America, and parts of Asia.
Within each mating type there are a number of genotypes (strains). In
western Europe, a dramatic increase in the frequency of the A2 mating
type is being recorded at present, with a single lineage apparently
accounting for much of the change in the UK population of strains
(see also ProMED-mail posts no. 20071207.3939 and 20090109.0083).

In Bangladesh, PLB outbreaks have also been reported recently from
other areas (ProMED-mail posts no. 20090310.0989 and 20090121.0255).
While PLB often causes problems in the region, the disease has been
extraordinarily rampant this planting season (2008-2009), and
emergence of new strains with increased fungicide resistances can
also not be excluded.

Smith periods are used as a guide to PLB risk and are defined as 2
consecutive days over 10 deg C (50 deg F) with at least 11 hours a
day above 90 percent relative humidity. These conditions are
conducive for sporulation. If they occur at intervals equal to the
generation time of the pathogen there is a greater risk of disease
development.
