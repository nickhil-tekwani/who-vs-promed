A young man of 25 years died in hospital last night [9 Oct 2011] in
Tulcea. He was hospitalized Friday [7 Oct 2011] in the Emergency
County Hospital (SJU) of Tulcea on suspicion of anthrax infection. He
had consumed the flesh of a slaughtered animal almost a week before in
the courtyard of a friend in the same locality.

Doctors now await analysis results from the Institute Cantacuzino.

"Unfortunately, many people in rural areas slaughter animals without
veterinary guidance, thereby exposing themselves to risks. This time,
however, bovine ear tags of the farm animals that were killed last
week indicate that in the spring [2011], they had been vaccinated
against anthrax. We have seized today [10 Oct 2011] [the remaining
meat] and await the results of tests to be carried out in our
laboratory to confirm or rule out suspicion," said the director of the
veterinary department, Marilena Tertis, according to Antena3
[presumably a radio station].

The last cases of this kind were reported in Tulcea county about 11
years ago.

Anthrax is sporadic in Romania and is reported in the lower altitude
riverine regions. Latterly, they have reported 1-6 outbreaks each year
in cattle and infrequently in sheep, but in 2009, there was an
outbreak in some pigs in Tulcea, with 3 dead. The low level but
consistent reporting of human cases indicates that the disease in
livestock is largely going unreported. - Mod.MHJ]
