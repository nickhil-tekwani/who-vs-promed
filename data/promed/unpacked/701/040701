A Quebec resident has contracted botulism after drinking carrot juice,
public health officials said in a news release yesterday, 20 Oct 2006. The
provincial Agriculture and Health departments urged the public not to drink
certain brands of the juice they may have in their homes.
Two cases of botulism associated with carrot juice have been identified in
Ontario; 4 others have taken place in the USA.
The products subject to the Quebec notice that are sold in 1 liter and 450
mL bottles are: Bolthouse Farms 100 percent Carrot Juice; Earthbound Farm
Organic Carrot Juice; President's Choice Organics 100 percent Carrot Juice.
All of the products have already been removed from store shelves, the
government said after consulting 6 distribution centers and 150 retail
stores. Consumers who have these products should throw away the bottles.

[This is the 7th case of botulism associated with this carrot juice. The
previous 6 cases were shown to be due to botulinum toxin type A.
The cases in the USA were reported to be associated with a nonrefrigerated
product, and the previous 2 cases from Ontario, Canada were alleged to be
linked to juice that was properly refrigerated (at least in the home). No
information was given regarding the product's cold chain in this case. -
