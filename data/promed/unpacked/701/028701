[1] ECDC update
Date: Mon 13 Jun 2011

Since 2 May 2011, 817 cases of HUS and 2508 non-HUS STEC cases have
been reported from European Union Member States, including 781 HUS
cases and 2447 non-HUS STEC cases in Germany. 23 of the HUS cases and
13 of the non-HUS STEC cases in EU Member states have died. While HUS,
caused by STEC infections, is usually observed in children under 5
years of age, in this outbreak the great majority of cases are adults,
with around 2/3 being women.

Most cases are from, or have a history of travel to the North of
Germany (mainly Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony,
North-Rhine-Westphalia, and Hamburg). In the EU/EEA, Austria, Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK have
reported cases of HUS, while 5 other Member States have reported only
non-HUS STEC cases.

Laboratory results indicate that STEC serogroup O104:H4
(Stx2-positive, eae-negative, hly-negative, ESBL, aat, aggR, aap) is
the causative agent. PFGE results shows indistinguishable pattern of 7
human O104:H4 outbreak strains in Germany and 2 strains of O104:H4 in
Denmark. STEC is a group of pathogenic _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_)
strains capable of producing Shiga toxins, with the potential to cause
severe enteric and systemic disease in humans.

[By noting the EU number of cumulative cases of HUS and non-HUS cases
and their total as well as deaths, the daily rise of the numbers can
be looked at:

Date: New HUS / New non-HUS / New Total / Overall Total Deaths
Mon 6 Jun: 3 / 67 / 70 / 22
Tue 7 Jun: 13 / 83 / 96 / 23
Wed 8 Jun: 48 / 266 / 314 / 25
Thu 9 Jun: 35 / 121 / 156 / 27
Fri 10 Jun: 38 / 115 / 153 / 31
Sat 11 Jun: 14 / 177 / 191 / 35
Sun 12 Jun: 0 / 40 / 40 / 35
Mon 13 Jun: 8 / 34 / 42 / 36

Since there are likely less cases reported from weekend days
(corresponding to Sun and Mon on this chart, ProMED-mail awaits
numbers from the next few days. These are not date of onset of
symptoms but rather date of report. - Mod.LL]

[2] Antimicrobial use in EHEC

[re: ProMED-mail E. coli O104 - EU (14): case update, neurological
symptoms 20110609.1747]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is in response to the posting about antibiotic resistance in the
German _E. coli_ O1O4:H4 strain and the general issue of precipitating
HUS with antibiotics. The toxin is encoded on a phage and if that
latent phage is activated it will lyse bacteria releasing toxin.

Phage reactivation is part of the SOS response, when phage sense DNA
damage or inability to replicate. The study that showed worse HUS in
treated children used ciprofloxacin. All quinolones directly inhibit
DNA replication and are notorious for inducing the SOS response. There
have been studies showing that beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones,
but not protein synthesis inhibitors precipitate the SOS response.
Therefore, if someone had to be treated the least damaging choice is
likely to be chloramphenicol (the organism is reportedly susceptible),
not a carbapenem (See Kimmitt PT, Harwood CR, Barer MR: Toxin gene
expression by Shiga toxin-producing _Esherichia coli_: the role of
antibiotics and the bacterial SOS response. Emerg Infect Dis. 2000;
6(5): 458-65).

[3] Antimicrobial use in EHEC
Date: Sun 5 Jun 2011
From: Allen Lenoir <alenoir@bioterrorism-vaccines.com> [edited]


Lee and Stein published a study (Lee JH, Stein BD: Antimicrobials
effective for inhibition of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strains O26,
O111, and O157 and their effects on Shiga toxin releases. J Microbiol
Biotechnol 2009; 19(10): 1238-43) suggesting imipenem decreased Shiga
toxin release in vitro (compared to untreated control cultures and to
amikacin, norfloxicin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which all
caused increased toxin release).

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Fierer and Lenoir for their comments
regarding the use of antimicrobials in EHEC infection. The citations
that each included are 2 of the most commonly mentioned in discussions
regarding the topic.

Since Wong, et al (1) reported a relative risk of the development of
HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence
interval 2.2 to 137), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial
agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other
antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, if the same
effect would occur in adults, if non-O157 strains would behave
similarly and what the mechanism of the effect were not clearly known.
Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as
cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders,
both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial
enteritis.

As noted by Dr Fierer and discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging
Infectious Diseases (2), the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like
bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome.
Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages
displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In
particular, fluoroquinolones induce high level expression of
previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin
genes.

A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and or
release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory
and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for
toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity
assays and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and
rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell
lysis suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS
and might be useful in management. Ochoa, et al (5) found that
fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in
O157 as compared to non-O157 strains but Lee and Stein (6) did not.

It seems logical that certain antimicrobials such as imipenem, a
broad spectrum carbapenem which has activity against the current
outbreak strain of EaggEC VTEC O104:H4, or rifaximin, a non-absorbable
rifamycin, may be useful in management. The translation, however, of
all these in vitro observations to this unusual, non-O157 isolate with
many characteristics of enteroaggregative _E. coli_ in adults rather
than a pediatric population is yet to be determined and should be
considered pure speculation.

This human experiment is currently underway in the midst of this
dramatic outbreak. The efficacy of the use of a humanized monoclonal
antibody directed against a complement component is being studied as
well. It is hoped that positive effects are found that may also be
found with the more common O157 EHEC.
