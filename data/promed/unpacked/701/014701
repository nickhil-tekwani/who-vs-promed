[Reply from Pamela Boppel:]
Unfortunately, two people I had hoped to speak with were unavailable. One
professor sadly died of a brain tumor recently and the other expert is away
on sabatical. But, I did speak to a water specialist although not in the
field of waste water treatment. We discussed treatment options and the
secondary treatment that is currently being used as you described is very
common and effective. A longer aeration period may be the simplest solution
for cleaner water as far as mycobacteria. Minimum aeration time being four
to six hours perhaps increasing to eight. Aeration allows the natural
microbes already present to break down waste material, apparently, no
additional microbes are added except for an occasional innoculation from a
previous batch to speed up the process. Tertiary treatment is expensive and
time consuming so mainly used in areas where treated water must be used
immediately as potable water.
Dr. Earl Spangenberg is the water specialist I spoke with at the College of
Natural Resources in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. He is aware of people using
discharge water directly from the treatment plant in California and
Colorado. Not many places use it, and none that he knows of for areas with
direct human contact such as the golf course, but rather irrigating animal
food crops etc. The flow chart is out of date and would not be of any help
as it is quite similar to the process you already described. This local
plant has now changed to u.v. light treatment, however, instead of chlorine
to eliminate the environmental problems associated with continued discharge
of that chemical. That may be the second, more expensive option to deal
with mycobacteria.
If you'd like more information, Dr. Aga Razvi is the waste water specialist
to contact. His e-mail is arazvi@uwspmail.uwsp.edu (if it doesn't work, try
putting ! in front... !arazvi@ ). As mentioned, he is not in his usual
place right now, but I'm assuming he still checks his e-mail, I have not yet
received a reply. Busy guy but he REALLY knows waste!!
