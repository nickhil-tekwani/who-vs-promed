Azerbaijan: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 3
----------------------------------------------------
As of 11 Apr 2006, tests conducted at a WHO collaborating laboratory
in the United Kingdom have retrospectively identified an additional
human case of H5N1 infection. The case is a 17-year-old girl who
developed symptoms on 11 Mar 2006. She was seriously ill with
bilateral pneumonia but has since fully recovered and been discharged
from hospital. Early in her course of illness, a diagnosis of H5N1
infection was presumed based on her clinical symptoms and preliminary
laboratory results, and she was treated accordingly.
Her 15-year-old cousin, previously confirmed by WHO, developed
symptoms on the same day and was hospitalized in critical condition.
She has also fully recovered and been discharged from hospital. Both
girls, who are neighbours, reside in the small Daikyand settlement in
Salyan rayon, where 7 of the 8 cases in Azerbaijan occurred. Active
house-to-house surveillance in the settlement has failed to detect
any further cases.
Retrospective confirmation of this case brings the total in
Azerbaijan to 8, 5 of which were fatal.

A 41-year-old woman in southern China was being tested to see if she
has H5N1 avian influenza virus infection after falling sick with
pneumonia-like symptoms, the World Health Organization stated on Tue
11 Apr 2006. The case was reported on 30 Mar 2006 to the WHO's
Beijing office, spokeswoman Aphaluck Bhatiasevi said.
The woman, a vegetable-seller at a market in Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong province, was hospitalized with a cough, fever and
headache, Bhatiasevi said. The woman worked in an area close to where
live poultry were sold, so "she's being treated with caution," she
said. "She has been given a preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia,"
Bhatiasevi said. "The symptoms of bird flu are similar to pneumonia
so they are testing her for that as well." The woman was in stable
condition and tests results could be released up to 5 weeks later,
she said.
The H5N1 virus has killed 109 people in 9 countries, mostly in Asia,
according to WHO, and has killed or prompted authorities to destroy
200 million birds. In mainland China, there have been 16 reported
cases of bird flu since November 2005 and 11 have died. A number of
people around the Guangzhou woman were being monitored, but so far
none have become ill, Bhatiasevi said.

[If this case is confirmed, the number of cases reported from China
will become 17. The confirmed cases have occurred in the provinces of
Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Sichuan, and
Guangdong. A decision on a case in Shanghai is pending. A map of the
provinces of China can be accessed at

A 23-year-old man undergoing treatment in Sumatra has been confirmed
to have bird flu, an Indonesian Health Ministry official said on Tue
11 Apr 2006, citing results from a World Health
Organisation-affiliated laboratory in Hong Kong. Indonesia has had 23
internationally confirmed deaths from avian influenza since 2003, the
2nd highest of any country. Indonesia has had the most human bird flu
deaths of any country so far in 2006, killing at least 12 people.
"This morning we got a confirmation from the Hong Kong laboratory
that the result on samples from a 23-year-old male was positive. He
is still hospitalised at Jamil hospital in Padang, West Sumatra,"
Hariadi Wibisono, director-general of animal-borne disease control at
the health ministry, told Reuters. The man had been working at a
chicken farm in West Java before he became sick. Most human cases of
the virus stem from contact with birds that have avian influenza.
The highly pathogenic strain has affected birds in about 2/3 of the
country's provinces. Stamping out the virus is a huge, if not
impossible, task in the sprawling archipelago of about 17 000 islands
and 220 million people. The government has resisted the mass culling
of fowl seen in some other nations, citing the expense and the
impracticality in a country where the keeping of a few chickens or
ducks in the backyards of homes is common in cities and on farms.
Agencies have concentrated instead on selective culling and on public
education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention. Agriculture
officials estimate that Jakarta alone has some 500 000 fowl. Efforts
elsewhere in the country have hit shortages of needed equipment,
funds and infrastructure.

[As of Tue 11 Apr 2006, the "Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human
Cases of Avian Influenza (A/H5N1)" reported to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) covers 9 countries. (WHO reports only
laboratory-confirmed cases, and the case totals include the number of
deaths).
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_04_11/en/print.html>
The global total of confirmed human cases of avian influenza is now
193, which includes 109 deaths. The countries affected are listed
below according to most recent date of onset of cases.
Country / Cases / Deaths / Most Recent Date of Onset (Confirmed Cases only)
--------------------------------------------------

Indonesia / 30 / 23 / 17 Mar 2006
China/ 16 / 11 / 15 Mar 2006

Viet Nam 93 / 42 / 9 Nov 2005
Thailand / 22 / 14 / 24 Oct 2005
Total 193 / 109
Notable features are:
(1) the decline in cases in the earliest affected countries (Thailand
and Viet Nam);
(2) the variable mortality (33 percent in Turkey, 100 percent in
Cambodia and Iraq, 57 percent overall); and not shown above
(3) the predominance of deaths in younger age groups; and
(4) absence of unequivocal evidence of direct person-to-person
transmission of infection.
