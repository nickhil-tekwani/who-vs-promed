SORGHUM ERGOT (04)
==================
Date: Wed, 30 Apr 1997
From: Ranajit Bandyopadhyay <r.bandyopadhyay@cgnet.com>

The material on sorghum ergot (Sorghum ergot 03) was written in
September 1996. Since then the distribution of sorghum ergot has
changed dramatically.
In the Americas, the disease was first noticed in Brazil in 1995
which was the first record outside Asia and Africa. By mid-1996,
the disease had been recorded in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay,
and Bolivia; by the end of 1996 in Colombia, Venezuela and
Honduras; and during the first quarter of 1997 in Puerto Rico,
Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and northern Mexico. On
26 March 1997, Dr. Tom Isakeit (Extension Plant Pathologist at
the Texas A&M Research & Extension Center in Welasco, TX)
observed ergot on ratoon tillers in an old, frost-escaped sorghum
field just north of the Rio Grande River near Progresso, TX.
The text in the above-mentioned posting (see subject) along with
colored photographs is also available on the World Wide Web at
the following site: http://www.cgiar.org/icrisat
Also on the Web, further information on ergot is available at:

I hope you will find the additional information useful.
