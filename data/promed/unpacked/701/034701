Gardeners are being urged to take extra care following 10 people in Christchurch [Canterbury] contracting legionnaires' disease. 10 people are in hospital with the disease, suspected to be from potting mix; 2 of those hospitalised are said to be fighting for their lives. Canterbury District Health Board has confirmed that all 10 cases were reported in the last week.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by a bacterium [_Legionella_ species] and is a severe form of pneumonia, which can often make the disease difficult to detect. Gardeners are being advised to wash their hands regularly, wear gloves and be careful when opening new bags of potting mix.

[More than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4 percent are _L. longbeachae_ (Yu VL, et al. Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during use of non-sterilized potting soil and compost, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Matching the genotypes of the clinical with environmental isolates establishes the transmission pathway.
