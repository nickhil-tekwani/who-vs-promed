Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: suspected human transmission
Epidemiological comments:
Texas (TX): A domestic cat from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The cat showed no clinical signs and continues to be asymptomatic. Samples for this case were collected as part of planned and targeted active surveillance of a specific animal, with known or suspected exposures to a person with COVID-19 or other exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to better understand risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Texas (TX): Two domestic cats sharing a known positive COVID-19 household were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the NVSL based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The 1st cat showed clinical signs of sneezing and coughing. The 2nd cat was asymptomatic. Samples for these cases were collected as part of planned and targeted active surveillance of a specific animal, with known or suspected exposures to a person with COVID-19 or other exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to better understand risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Texas (TX): A domestic cat from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the NVSL based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The cat, who showed clinical signs of tremors, vomiting, and sneezing, has reportedly recovered.
Florida (FL): A domestic dog from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The dog, who had a recent history of respiratory issues with antibiotic and steroid treatment, has reportedly recovered. A 2nd dog in the household has remained asymptomatic.
Pennsylvania (PA): A domestic dog from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The dog, who has a chronic history of respiratory issues, was diagnosed in late summer 2020 with pneumonia, which reportedly improved with treatment. Recently, the dog was presented to the veterinarian for a recurrence of respiratory clinical signs that did not show improvement with treatment. Testing for comorbidities, including breed-associated autoimmune disease, is in progress.
Kentucky (KY): One snow leopard at a zoo was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The affected snow leopard exhibited mild respiratory clinical signs, including an occasional dry cough or wheeze. Two additional snow leopards, who were also showing clinical signs, were sampled, and results are pending. It is likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted to the snow leopards by an infected human. All snow leopards are progressively recovering and were removed from public exhibition at the onset of clinical signs. There are no other suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 in any animals from the zoo at this time.
Wisconsin (WI): A domestic cat from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The cat, who showed clinical signs of lethargy, sinus congestion, wheezing, sneezing, and nasal discharge, has reportedly recovered.
Kansas (KS): A domestic dog from a known positive COVID-19 household was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing). The dog, who was scheduled for a surgical procedure, displayed nasal discharge on pre-surgical examination and was sampled as a precautionary measure. There is a single SARS-CoV-2 event occurrence in the United States of America; however, for WAHIS technical reasons, any new outbreak in the country will be reported from now on in this new event and not in the one first reported in April 2020.
