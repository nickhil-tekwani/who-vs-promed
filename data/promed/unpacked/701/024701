The Head of Criminal Investigation Unit of Bogor City Police Commissioner Didik Purwanto said the police have set 3 suspects of the food poisoning case that hit residents in Kampung Sawah RT 01, RW 07, Tanah Baru Village, North Bogor, Bogor City, West Java. The number of victims continues to grow and are related to ingestion of tutut, or freshwater snails, which were sold in the stalls when breaking the [Ramadan] fast, [Fri 25 May 2018] night. The declaration on the results of the investigation of the food poisoning case was made after information from a number of witnesses and from the report of the lab test from samples of tutut, were available.

The 3 suspects are vendors of freshwater snails.

[_Pila ampullaceal_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pila_ampullacea) together with _Pila pesmei_, are indigenous rice field snail species traditionally eaten in Thailand. In Indonesia, it is famous as "keong sawah" or "tutut" as traditional cuisine which is often boiled or grilled as satay.

The symptoms of those affected are not stated but it seems to be the case that a bacterium is suspected. More information is required in this regard. Bacteria would be killed in cooking so if the cause of what symptoms occurred is a bacterial toxin, the snails would have to have been undercooked or contaminated after cooking if they are the cause of the illnesses. These snails are not the same as those eaten in France, the USA and elsewhere as escargot, which are land snails.

The following is a discussion and recipe regarding this part of Indonesian cuisine https://thedailyroar.com/food/kulnenek-the-indonesian-escargot/:

"I believe everyone knows what an escargot is, a France exotic delicacy that is also known to be an aphrodisiac. Some people say it tastes like chicken with a clam texture, a little chewy and a slimy sensation that leaves a sensual feeling on your tongue.

"In Indonesia we have a similar dish. The difference is we are having water snails. In Indonesia, water snails has various names such as kulnenek, kol nenek, tutut, kreco, but commonly it is also known as keong sawah or siput. You can find water snails in rice fields, rivers, lakes, or any other calm body of freshwater. They is only 40 mm long with 15--25mm diameter with greenish brown shell color. Even though they are small, water snails are packed with nutrition and are a great protein source, low on fat, also high on vitamin A, vitamin E, and folic acid. Some urban legend says that water snails also have medical benefits from healing skin infections up to relieving hemorrhoid pain.

"There are many kind of dishes that you can make from water snails, from just simply boil it and enjoy them with tomato or chili sauce, saut√© them, or braise them with any kind of spices. Here is my favorite recipe for cooking water snail.

"First, you need 300 gram of water snails. Wash and scrub them several times until they are clean. Crash the tip of the water snails for faster cooking and to ease you when you eat them. Put 1 tablespoon of minced ginger, one stick of lemongrass, and the water snails into 500 mL boiling water. Cook them until the water snails are softened. Then drain them and put them aside for a while. Heat the pan to medium heat then add some oil. Add 2 tablespoons of minced shallot and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and cook until tender. Add the water snails along with the water. Braise with small fire. Add salt, sugar, and chili according to your desire. Cook until the water is reduced to half.

"There are some tips you need to know to enjoy the chewy slimy head and some creamy soft spot at the end of the water snails:

- Use your fingers. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty to eat them because they are so small, it will be hard if you try to eat them with any utensil.
- Suck them out. Okay, it might sound kinky, but it is the most fun way to eat them. Suck the tip out of their shell.
- Flick it till you get it. It is the least fun way to eat them. Sometimes water snails can be so stubborn and won't leave their shell no matter how you suck them. You will need toothpick to flick and pick them out."
