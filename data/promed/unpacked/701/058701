Ebola virus [more precisely Zaire ebola virus, a member of the genus
_Ebolavirus_ of the family _Filoviridae_] may have killed more than
5000 gorillas in West Africa -- enough to send them into extinction
if people continue to hunt them, too, researchers said on Thu 7 Dec
2006. The virus is spreading from one group of the already endangered
animals to another, the international team of experts report in this
week's issue of the journal Science [Science 8 Dec 2006: Vol. 314.
no. 5805, pp. 1564;
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5805/1564>; see
below]. And it appears to be spreading faster than it is among humans.
"The Zaire strain of Ebola virus [Zaire ebola virus] killed about
5000 gorillas in our study area alone," primatologist Magdalena
Bermejo of the University of Barcelona in Spain and at the Programme
for Conservation and Rational Utilization of Forest Ecosystems in
Central Africa and colleagues wrote. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is one
of the most virulent virus diseases ever seen, killing between 50
percent and 90 percent of victims. The World Health Organization says
that it killed 1200 people infected between its discovery in 1976 and 2004.
The virus is transmitted by direct contact with blood, organs or
other bodily fluids. There is no cure or good treatment, although
several groups are working on vaccines. Several experts have noted
that chimpanzees and gorillas are also killed by the virus, and
suspect that people may have caught it from infected apes -- perhaps
when hunting them. But it was not clear whether the gorillas were
infecting one another, or being repeatedly infected and re-infected
by another species of animal, perhaps a bat.
Bermejo's team had been studying a group of western gorillas in the
Lossi Sanctuary in northwest of the [Democratic] Republic of Congo.
"By 2002 we had identified 10 social groups with 143 individuals,"
they wrote. In 2001 and 2002, several outbreaks of Ebola had begun
killing people along the Gabon-Congo border. By October 2002, the
researchers had found 32 dead gorillas, and of the 12 they tested for
Ebola, 9 were positive. "She knew these animals individually, and in
the course of 3 months they all died," said Peter Walsh, an ecologist
at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,
Germany, who worked on the study.
Eventually the researchers counted 221 dead gorillas. Based on what
they and other experts knew, Walsh extrapolated what the total impact
must be to come up with the estimate of 5500 gorillas killed by Ebola
in that area. He said no one knows precisely how many gorillas there
are in the world and how many have died. "But I know what's the
typical mortality rate in those areas that are affected. It's an
educated guess. A quarter of the gorillas in the world have died from
Ebola in the last 12 years. It's huge," Walsh said in a telephone
interview. "Add commercial hunting to the mix, and we have a recipe
for rapid ecological extinction," the researchers wrote.
Their report supports a study published in July that showed gorillas
were spreading the virus within their social groups. "Our work is
complementary to that -- we have shown it is spreading between
groups," Walsh said. Walsh said gorilla groups share territories,
often eating fruit from the same tree, although at different times.
Feces from a sick gorilla could easily infect other gorillas.
Gorillas and chimpanzees also touch and handle the bodies of other
apes when they find them -- something known to transmit Ebola between humans.
"The issue here is that there is a certain amount of work that needs
to be done to take these vaccines that already exist and put them
into gorillas," Walsh said. "That is a couple of million bucks." He
hopes a rich donor will take up the cause.

[This research suggests that Ebola virus (more precisely Zaire ebola
virus) has wiped out one quarter of the global population of
gorillas. These animals inhabit a region surrounding the Lossi
Sanctuary in Africa. It is also suggested that ape-to-ape
transmission is a major factor in the spread of the disease. The
brief reporting in Science (8 Dec 2006: Vol. 314. no. 5805, p. 1564)
is entitled: "Ebola Outbreak Killed 5000 Gorillas", and authored by
Magdalena Bermejo,1,2 Jose Domingo Rodriguez-Teijeiro,2 German
Illera,1 Alex Barroso,2 Carles Vila,3 Peter D. Walsh4; at 1
Ecosystemes Forestiers d'Afrique Centrale (ECOFAC), Box Postale 15115

Barcelona, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain, 3 Department of Evolutionary
Biology, Uppsala University, SE-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden, and 4 Max
Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.
The abstract reads: "Over the past decade, the Zaire strain of Ebola
virus (ZEBOV) has repeatedly emerged in Gabon and Congo. Each human
outbreak has been accompanied by reports of gorilla and chimpanzee
carcasses in neighboring forests, but both the extent of ape
mortality and the causal role of ZEBOV have been hotly debated. Here,
we present data suggesting that in 2002 and 2003 ZEBOV killed about
5000 gorillas in our study area. The lag between neighboring gorilla
groups in mortality onset was close to the ZEBOV disease cycle
length, evidence that group-to-group transmission has amplified
gorilla die-offs."
This report contains a good deal of extrapolated. It is unclear
whether non-human primates are infected from humans, or vice versa,
or whether a different non-primate species is the source of the virus.
One quarter of the animals tested were negative for Ebola infection. - Mod.CP]
