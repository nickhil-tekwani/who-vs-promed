---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus canker, caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ pv. _citri_, is a
bacterial disease of economic importance in tropical and subtropical
citrus-producing areas. _X. c._ pv. _citri_ can cause severe
infection in a wide range of citrus species and induces erumpent,
callus-like lesions with water-soaked margins leading to premature
fruit drop and twig dieback. It has consequently been subjected to
eradication efforts and international regulations. Citrus canker
occurs in Asia, South America, the United States, parts of Oceania,
and some islands off the African continent (Comoros, Mauritius,
Reunion, and Seychelles islands). It was described on the African
continent, but in some cases, diagnosis errors might have occurred.
The only well-documented outbreak occurred in South Africa where it
was eradicated at the beginning of the 20th century.

In 2004, citrus canker symptoms on limes, sweet oranges, tangerines,
and sour oranges were reported from different orchards around Bamako
and in the Koulikoro Province of Mali. Isolations were performed and
PCR [polymerase chain reaction] was used to check the identity of the
pathogen, testing 21 _Xanthomonas_-like strains collected from citrus
in the epidemic area. _X. c._ pv. _citri_ strain CFBP [collection of
plant pathogenic bacteria] 2525 from New Zealand was used as the
positive control, and the expected DNA fragment was obtained from all
the isolates, whereas no fragment was observed for negative controls.
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of these _X.
c._ pv. _citri_ strains from Mali and other reference strains showed
that the strains were closely related to _X. c._ pv. _citri_-A
strains with a wide host range. On the basis of AFLP [amplified
fragment length polymorphism], the Mali strains were not closely
related to _X. axonopodis_ pv. _aurantifolii_.

One week after inoculation, Duncan grapefruit and alemow citrus
leaves inoculated with all strains from Mali by a detached leaf assay
developed erumpent, callus-like tissue at wound sites, similar to the
reaction produced by strain CFBP 2525 (positive control). A survey
conducted in 2006 in 9 orchards revealed disease incidences of 50,
15, 24, and 25 percent for lime, sweet orange, sour orange, and
tangor groves, respectively. As of this report, citrus canker has
spread to new citrus orchards and this might be due to the
propagation and dissemination of infected material from small
nurseries.

To our knowledge, this represents the 1st outbreak of citrus canker
in West Africa. Spread of the pathogen in Mali and neighboring
countries should be monitored and a drastic surveillance of citrus
nurseries in the region should be performed.

[2] Somalia: 1st report
Date: June 2008

92(6): 981 [edited]
<http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PDIS-92-6-0981C>


[Ref: GM Balestra et al: First report of citrus canker caused by
_Xanthomonas citri_ in Somalia. Plant Dis 2008; 92(6): 981; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-92-6-0981C
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Xanthomonas citri_ (synonym _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_)
has been reported in several countries in Africa but not Somalia.
During 2006 and 2007, hyperplasia-type lesions, often surrounded by a
water-soaked margin and yellow halo, typical of citrus canker caused
by _X. citri_ were found on 8- to 10-year-old lime (_Citrus limetta_)
and grapefruit (_Citrus_ x paradisi Macfed.) trees in northern and
southern Somalia, respectively.

Ten leaf samples diagnosed presumptively as citrus canker by test
kits were mailed to the USDA (US Department of Agriculture) Foreign
Disease-Weed Science Research Unit. To confirm the identification of
_X. citri_, isolations were made from several lesions from each
sample. Yellow, xanthomonad-like mucoid, convex colonies were
purified and stored. Phenotypic tests and real-time PCR assays were
done. For pathogenicity tests, cultures were inoculated into leaves
of lime seedlings. After 21 to 30 days, symptoms were recorded.
Cultures of sample S-1 (northern Somalia) from lime were
phenotypically atypical of _X. citri_, PCR negative, and
nonpathogenic. However, cultures of samples 3 to 7 (southern Somalia)
from grapefruit were typical of _X. citri_ and PCR positive; cultures
3 and 4 were tested for pathogenicity and produced erumpent lesions
on lime. Isolations resulted in typical mucoid, convex, yellow,
PCR-positive colonies.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _X. citri_ on citrus
plants in Somalia. Strains S3 and S4 have been deposited in ICPB
[International Collection of Phytopathogenic Bacteria] at Ft.
Detrick, MD as ICPB 11650 and 11651, respectively.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (previously _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_
as well as several synonyms -- see above). Symptoms include cankers
(small, round blister-like formations) on fruit, leaves, and branches
leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig
dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is
not affected it cannot be sold or processed. The disease occurs
worldwide. It can be transmitted by mechanical means, water, or
insects within groves while long-distance spread is mostly by
infected plant material. CC affects most commercial citrus varieties
as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_ posing a serious
economic threat to citrus industries.

_X. axonopodis_ includes a number of different strains specialising
to affect different hosts. The group of _X. a._ pv. _citri_ strains
causes the disease most referred to as Asiatic CC, which was
originally found in Asia and is by far the most widespread and severe
form of the disease. Other forms of CC are caused by a group of _X.
a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ strains originating in South America and some
other locations.
