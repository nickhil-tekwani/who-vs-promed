A Brandon-area (Florida) infant has died from a rare and devastating
disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes inflammation of the
brain, health officials said Thursday [29 Jul 2010]. It was the 2nd
death in Hillsborough County this month [July 2010] from eastern
equine encephalitis [EEE] -- see ProMED ref. below, prompting
officials to issue a public health alert and step up mosquito spraying
around the Tampa Bay area.

Since no more than 5-10 cases of EEE are typically reported nationwide
each year, and Florida's last reported death was in 2008, these
back-to-back fatalities are highly unusual. The state recorded a 3rd
EEE fatality this month, in the Panhandle's Wakulla County.

There is no vaccine for the disease, which kills about 1/3 of those
infected and disables others, so officials are urging people to
protect themselves from mosquito bites. This summer could be the worst
in years for the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses. There aren't more
mosquitoes here than usual, officials say, but more of them are
carrying diseases, posing greater health risks to the people they
bite. Due to factors such as water levels and animal breeding
patterns, mosquito-borne illnesses tend to rise and fall over time.
After several quiet years, health experts are concerned that people
have forgotten that these insects are not just a backyard nuisance.
While mosquito-borne disease is generally rare in the United States,
mosquitoes are the world's most dangerous animal, responsible for
millions of cases of [arthropod-borne pathogens] worldwide.

In response to the increased threats, Hillsborough's health department
on Thursday placed the county under a "mosquito-borne illness alert."
"You have to protect yourself," said Warren McDougle, manager of the
Hillsborough Health Department's epidemiology program. "Every effort
is being taken by mosquito control and all of the public health
entities to do the surveillance on the disease, but individuals have
to protect themselves against mosquitoes." It takes just one bite to
get sick, he noted, though your chances of getting sick increase the
more you are bitten.

Last week, officials reported that a woman who lived in northern
Hillsborough died on 1 Jul 2010 from an EEE [virus] infection. She
likely was infected while sitting outside her apartment building,
officials say. The Brandon-area infant's cause of death was reported
to the health department Wednesday 28 Jul [2010]; officials declined
to share more information about the victims.

People who spend a lot of time outdoors are at greater risk for EEE
because they are exposed to more mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted
to horses and humans by mosquitoes, which pick it up from birds.
People can't infect each other, nor can they be infected by horses,
which is where the virus was 1st detected. Because the disease is so
rare in people, experts look to equine cases to help monitor the risk.

Horse cases
-----------
The Pasco County Health Department, for example, reported on Thursday
that county's 2nd case this summer of EEE in a horse.

Yet people living far away from these reports are not immune, experts
caution, since birds can spread the virus some distance. The disease
is reported in many Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, though hot, wet
Florida is the most affected. "Anywhere where you are in the state,
right now this year, you do need to be concerned about it," said
Roxanne Connelly, a University of Florida associate professor at the
Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory.

She noted that EEE is the most serious of the mosquito-borne illnesses
seen in Florida. It can cause flulike symptoms that begin 4-10 days
after the bite of an infected mosquito. The disease can progress to
disorientation, seizures and coma. The fatality rate is high, and many
of those who survive are brain damaged. In the last decade, most of
the deaths in Florida have involved young people. There is no
treatment specifically for an EEE infection. Horses can be immunized
against the virus, but there isn't a vaccine to protect people.

Last week, Hillsborough County sprayed extensively by air in the
suburbs. "We are taking all the actions that we are supposed to, but
the population also needs to be aware and help us out," said Carlos
Fernandes, director of mosquito control in Hillsborough. He urged
people to stay inside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most
active. Pinellas also plans to dispatch trucks early today to fog
along the Hillsborough and Pasco county lines. Nancy Iannotti,
operations manager for Pinellas mosquito control, said the
mosquito-borne diseases are rare, but sensible precautions still
should be taken.

[Unfortunately, this fatal human case comes just 10 days after the
previous one in Hillsborough county, Florida. This state is endemic
for EEE virus. There have been a number of equine cases of EEE virus
infection this year (2010). This is the 2nd human case in 2010 in
Hillsborough County and the 3rd this year in Florida. There is no
vaccine available for human use, although EEE vaccinations are
available and recommended for equine animals.
