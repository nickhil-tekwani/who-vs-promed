Sudden death syndrome (SDS) has infected Iowa soybean fields and is
quickly robbing producers of profit potential, according to a report
from the Iowa Soybean Association (ISA).

SDS, though not a new pest to Iowa, is expanding into areas where it
has never been seen before. This year [2008] it seems to be appearing
in fields planted through late May, crop-watchers say. The disease
tends to be most severe on well-managed soybeans with high yield
potential. It can also be found in fields known to be infested with
the soybean cyst nematode (SCN); research has shown that SCN cysts
can carry the SDS pathogen.

Sudden death syndrome is caused by a fungal pathogen that enters the
root within 4 days of germination. It is believed the pathogen
remains in the root and crown area until the soybean plant enters the
reproductive stage when it releases a toxin that moves throughout the
plant, quickly killing the leaf tissue. Management options include
planting varieties highly resistant to SCN and with greater
resistance to SDS. The disease cannot be managed with fungicides.

Sudden death syndrome has been found in Minnesota soybean fields and
farmers are asked to submit suspicious plants to the University of
Minnesota for testing. SDS began showing up in southern Minnesota
fields 3 weeks ago. It has been confirmed in fields near Waseca,
Mankato, New Ulm, and Lamberton so far this season [2008].

SDS typically appears when pods start filling, extension plant
pathologist specialist Dean Malvick said. He said the disease will
probably show up in fields for the next week or so. The odds of it
appearing in the areas of central Minnesota where it has been dry are
pretty low. Malvick suspects the disease may be more widespread. He
needs help from producers to determine the disease's spread
throughout the state.

SDS is found in the soil and it moves in much the same way as soybean
cyst nematode. Farmers should clean their equipment between fields to
avoid spreading the disease. Yield losses associated with SDS vary,
but can be significant, Malvick said. Unfortunately, there's not much
farmers can do at this point in the season to protect yield.

[The fungus _Fusarium virguliforme_ has been described as the causal
pathogen of SDS in North America and _F. tucumaniae_ in South
America. Any stress factor, but in particular soybean cyst nematode
(SCN; _Heterodera glycines_), is reported to exacerbate symptoms.
Yield losses may be more than 80 percent, depending on variety and
timing of infection. For more information on SDS please see previous
ProMED-mail report no. 20070904.2909 and links below.
