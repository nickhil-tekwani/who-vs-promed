AFP means acute flaccid paralysis. [It is the general term used in polio
surveillance for any case of acute flaccid paralysis, regardless of cause.
Surveillance for purposes of determining status polio control/eradication
aims at children <15 years of age. In the absence of poliovirus, more than
80% of cases of AFP in children <15 are Guillain--BarrÃ© syndrome. The
incidence of AFP in absence of paralytic polio is 1 per 100,000 children,
<15 per year.

you all. - Mod.CHC
