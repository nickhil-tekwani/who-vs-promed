Pig Ebola may lead scientists to elusive reservoir of virus
-----------------------------------------------------------
The first known Ebola infections in pigs may help researchers answer a
question that's confounded them since the deadly virus was first discovered
more than 30 years ago: where it comes from. International scientists will
converge on farms in the Philippines to help local authorities discover how
pigs contracted Ebola-Reston, a monkey-killing strain not known to harm
people. The findings may help identify which species carries the virus in
the wild without getting sick, enabling the pathogen to persist undetected
in the environment, said Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the
animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.

Knowing the natural host of Ebola will help people better protect
themselves against one of the most-feared infectious diseases. African
strains usually kill 50 per cent to 90 per cent of those infected through
lethal bleeding and organ failure, according to the World Health Organization.

"Since the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists, and
physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can
find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty- handed,"
Lubroth said in a telephone interview today. "This opens up avenues to
delve into the ecology and do more searching."

Ebola was first recognized in 1976 after an outbreak near the Ebola River
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire.

Thirteen years later, Ebola-Reston was discovered in the United States in
association with an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever among monkeys
imported from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia. The virus was found
among Philippine monkeys in the US again in 1990 and 1996, and in Italy in
1992. In October [2008], for the first time, the strain was found in
Philippine pigs.

"What is the connection between the natural habitat of Ebola-Reston and
swine production? That needs to be teased out in the Philippines," Lubroth
said. Ebola-Reston turned up in 6 of 28 swine samples tested at a US
Department of Agriculture laboratory in New York, said Davinio P Catbagan,
the Philippines' chief veterinary officer. The infected pigs were traced to
2 commercial and 2 backyard farms in 3 provinces north of Manila, he said.
Further testing found no new cases, including among 42 people involved in
caring for the animals. "We're still trying to find out how it came to the
pigs," Catbagan said in a telephone interview today.

Both Ebola, and a related virus known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever [virus],
are thought to infect humans via primates. Disease trackers have tested
everything from snakes to guinea pigs in the search for an animal reservoir
and have been repeatedly led back to caves, mines, and bats. A 2005 study
published in the journal Nature found evidence of symptomless infection by
Ebola in 3 species of fruit bat in West Africa, indicating that these
animals may be acting as a reservoir for the virus. "It would merit looking
at it in the natural habitat in the Western Pacific further," Lubroth said.
"We are only scratching the surface."

The Philippines government said yesterday it would like technical
assistance from the WHO, FAO, and the World Organization for Animal Health
[OIE] in studying the disease and assessing what potential health risks it
may pose. "At the moment, it's not a dangerous pathogen [for humans], but
we cannot be sure it will remain like this," said Soe Nyunt-U, WHO's
representative in the Philippines. "We have to make sure we understand the
ecology of the virus really well."

[Ebola-Reston virus was introduced into quarantine facilities in Virginia,
Texas, and Pennsylvania by monkeys imported from the Philippines. Four
humans developed antibodies to Ebola-Reston virus but did not become ill.
Ebola-Reston virus has remained an enigma ever since. The discovery of
Ebola-Reston virus in pigs in the Philippines opens up new approaches to
investigation of the ecology of Ebola-Reston virus and the related
filoviruses responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Marburg hemorrhagic
fever in the human population. Details of the clinical features of the
disease in pigs is awaited.
