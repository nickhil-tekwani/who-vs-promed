Investigation details
-----------------
The CDC, several states, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the US Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O103 infections. This investigation includes _E. coli_ O103 infections recently reported by the Kentucky Department of Public Health.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _E. coli_ from ill people in this outbreak showed that they are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 4 Apr 2019, 72 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 have been reported from 5 states. The CDC is reporting the 72 illnesses that PulseNet has confirmed are part of this outbreak. States are investigating additional illnesses that might be a part of this outbreak.

State / Number of cases
-------------
Georgia / 8
Kentucky / 36
Ohio / 5
Tennessee / 21
Virginia / 2
-------------
Total / 72

Illnesses started on dates from 2 Mar 2019 to 29 Mar 2019. Ill people range in age from 1 to 74 years, with a median age of 17 years. In addition, 55% are female. Of 47 people with information available, 8 (17%) have been hospitalized. No deaths and no cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) have been reported.

This investigation is still ongoing, and a specific food item, grocery store, or restaurant chain has not been identified as the source of infections. State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to determine what they ate and other exposures in the week before their illness started.

The CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding this seemingly rapidly expanding outbreak.

The following was submitted to ProMED regarding past _E. coli_ O103 outbreaks in Norway. ProMED thanks Dr. Eckner for the communication. - Mod.LL

"Norway has had a couple (all the references were to outbreaks in the US). There was an outbreak of _E. coli_ O103 involving 17 people in 2006 (unfortunately the report is all in Norwegian)

"There was also a smaller one in 2009 with 7 people, if I recall correctly."
