Weekly Summary
--------------
-- In the Southern Cone, RSV was the predominant virus circulating;
however, influenza B and influenza A/H3 virus have also been
detected. Paraguay reported high influenza-like illness (ILI)
activity in 3 of 5 regions.

-- In the Andean sub-region, Peru reported an increasing trend in
acute respiratory disease. Bolivia reported a steady increase of
pandemic influenza A H1N1 cases in epidemiological week (EW) 26-31.

-- Circulation of respiratory viruses was variable in Central
America. Influenza A/H3 virus was predominant in Panama, Honduras and
Costa Rica. Influenza B was predominant in Nicaragua. El Salvador
reported high intensity of acute respiratory disease and moderate
impact of acute respiratory disease on the health care services.

-- The Caribbean reported low influenza activity, but increased
circulation of influenza A/H3 virus in some countries (Cuba,
Dominican Republic).

-- In North America, influenza activity remained low; mostly
influenza A/H3 virus (United States) was detected.

I - Influenza surveillance
--------------------------
South America - Southern Cone
------------------------------
Influenza activity was reported as regional in Brazil and Chile. The
trends in acute respiratory disease were reported as unchanged in
both countries.

In Chile, in epidemiological week (EW) 31, nationally, influenza-like
illness (ILI) activity continued to be low, and was similar to the
previous week, remaining in the security zone of the endemic channel.
At the regional level, the highest rates of ILI activity were in the
regions of Tarapaca, Los Rios and Los Lagos. The proportion of
consultations in emergency services for respiratory illness of the
total number of consultations remained similar to the previous week,
after 2 prior consecutive EW of decreasing trends.

In EW 31, Paraguay, nationally, reported a decrease of 6.2% percent
in ILI outpatient consultations as compared to the previous EW. At
the regional level, in 3 regions (North, Oriental Center and Chaco)
the ILI activity was above their epidemic threshold, while in the
remaining 2 regions, activity was within the epidemiological alert
zone of the endemic channel. Severe acute respiratory infection
(SARI) activity in children under 5 years of age remained lower as
compared to the same week of 2009 and 2008.

Viral circulation: In EW 31 in Chile, 73 percent of positive
specimens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 12 percent were
parainfluenza virus. In Chile, influenza B (recently increasing),
pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 and seasonal influenza A/H3 were also
identified. During EW 30-31 Paraguay reported circulation of
influenza B, RSV, parainfluenza virus and the new circulation of
seasonal influenza A/H3, which had not previously been identified during 2010.

South America - Andean
----------------------
In EW 31, influenza activity was reported as widespread in Bolivia (6
of 9 departments reported positive influenza cases) and regional in
Colombia and Peru. Peru reported increasing trends of acute
respiratory disease, while Bolivia and Colombia reported decreasing
and unchanged trends, respectively.

In EW 31, Bolivia3 reported, at the national level, a slight decrease
in the number of acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases as compared to
the previous week, remaining below the epidemic threshold.
Regionally, in EWs 30-31, no departments were above their epidemic
thresholds for ARI, while in EW 29, 2 departments were above the
epidemic threshold.

Bolivia reported a steady increase in the number of pandemic
influenza A H1N1 2009 cases between EWs 26-31; circulation of
influenza B during the year 2010 has also been reported. Colombia
continues to report a predominance of pandemic influenza and some
seasonal influenza A/H3 activity.

Central America
---------------
Influenza activity was reported as regional in Panama, localized in
El Salvador, and with no activity in Honduras. Honduras reported an
unchanged trend in acute respiratory disease, while El Salvador and
Panama reported decreasing trends this week. El Salvador reported
high intensity of acute respiratory disease and moderate impact of
acute respiratory disease on health care services.

In EW 31, Panama reported a decreasing trend of ILI activity in the
national level.

Circulation of respiratory viruses is variable in Central America. In
Costa Rica, in 2010, a mix of parainfluenza, adenovirus, RSV, and
influenza have circulated. Until EW 28, in Costa Rica, the
predominant influenza virus was the pandemic virus, however since
then, it has been predominantly H3N2. In Honduras, in 2010, a mix of
parainfluenza, adenovirus, RSV, and influenza have circulated. Until
EW 26, in Honduras, among influenza viruses, a combination of
influenza B and pandemic virus were circulating, since then, however,
it has been predominantly H3N2. In Panama, until EW 22, very few
respiratory viruses were detected. Since then, however, the
predominant virus circulating has been influenza A/H3N2.

Caribbean
---------
Influenza activity was reported as widespread in Jamaica, regional in
Barbados and with no activity in Dominica and Dominican Republic.
Trends of acute respiratory disease were reported as unchanged in all
these countries. These countries reported low/moderate intensity of
acute respiratory disease, and low impact of acute respiratory
disease on health care services.

CAREC [Participating CAREC member countries, which include, Barbados,
Dominica, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and
Tobago, were assessed together], from EW 25-31, reported a continued
decreasing trend in the proportion of admissions for SARI out of the
total hospitalizations (59 and 11.5 SARI admissions per 1000
admissions, in EW 25 and 31, respectively).

The circulation of respiratory viruses is variable in the Caribbean.
CAREC reported the predominance of influenza B virus since EW 18, but
RSV and pandemic influenza have also been reported. In Cuba, in 2010,
the predominant respiratory virus in circulation has been pandemic
influenza. Since EW 30, some cases of influenza A/H3N2 have also been
reported in Cuba. In Dominican Republic, in 2010, many respiratory
viruses have co-circulated (adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, and
influenza B), but since EW 27, influenza A/H3N2 has also been detected.

North America
-------------
Influenza activity remains low in this region. The trends in acute
respiratory disease were reported as unchanged in the United States.

In the United States in epidemiologic week (EW) 31, the proportion of
outpatient consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) continued
to remain below the national baseline. All the sub-national
surveillance regions reported the proportion of ILI to be below their
region-specific baselines. The proportion of deaths attributed to
pneumonia and influenza was below the epidemic threshold. No
influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week.

The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in Mexico
and the United States remained low. Seasonal influenza A/H3 was
isolated in the United States. In Mexico, in 2010, until EW 13, the
primary respiratory virus circulating was the pandemic virus. Since
then, however, there has been little respiratory virus detection.

Now that the WHO has declared the 2009 Pandemic (H1N1) over,
'pandemic' has been dropped from the title of this thread, but
continuity is maintained. - Mod.CP]
