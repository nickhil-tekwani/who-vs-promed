A tick (_Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus_) fever outbreak recently threatened cattle herds at Kendall. The outbreak has been managed by the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and North Coast Local Land Services.

A spokesperson from NSW DPI said that since the outbreak was detected, an infringement notice has been issued to a Victorian livestock transporter for failing to provide evidence of completing mandatory cattle tick requirements prior to bringing a bull from a tick zone to a mid-north coast property.

NSW DPI Cattle Tick operations leader Larry Falls said the notice was issued following departmental investigations of the tick fever outbreak on 3 properties, which led to the deaths of more than 60 cattle in the region.

"Our regulatory officers found no evidence a bull moved from Queensland to a Kendall property had undergone the mandatory tick inspection and treatment requirements before entering NSW," Mr Falls said.

"It's a reminder to anyone transporting cattle into NSW from tick infested areas that they must follow proper procedures."

Local landholders have worked with NSW DPI and North Coast Local Land Services staff to help manage and contain the tick threat.

Once tick fever -- a blood parasite spread by cattle ticks -- was confirmed, surviving cattle were treated with an antidote, and there have been no further incidences of tick fever in the area.

Mr Falls said that an eradication program is well underway to successfully rid mid-north coast herds of cattle ticks and tick fever.

"NSW DPI Cattle Tick Program staff traced cattle tick infestations from the 3 properties with tick fever to 8 other local herds and conducted herd inspections on another 70 linked properties," he said.

"Staff are currently carrying out eradication treatment programs on the 11 properties where cattle tick infestations were found and monitoring cattle on adjoining properties."

The Cattle Tick Program works to keep NSW tick-free through movement controls on animals from tick infested areas, implementing strategies to eradicate outbreaks of ticks and tick fever, and updating industry on developments in cattle tick control.

Cattle tick is the most serious external parasite of cattle in Australia, with an estimated annual cost to the industry of more than USD 160 million.

Cattle tick is a notifiable disease under the NSW Biosecurity Regulation 2015, and more information about cattle tick and tick fever is available from NSW DPI.

[Tick fever is a cattle disease caused by any one of the following blood parasites:
- _Babesia bovis_
- _Babesia bigemina_
- _Anaplasma marginale_.

These parasites are all transmitted by the cattle tick (_Boophilus microplus_). Disease caused by _Babesia bovis_ or _B. bigemina_ is called babesiosis, often referred to as "red water." Disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_ is called anaplasmosis.

_B. bovis_ is the most important parasite, causing more than 80 percent of outbreaks of tick fever in Queensland each year.

Clinical signs of tick fever include weakness, depression, and loss of appetite. These signs are mainly due to the associated fever and red blood cell destruction (causing anaemia).

Despite the common name red water, red urine is only occasionally present and late in the course of the disease. Other clinical signs may include jaundice and neurological signs.

Cattle with _B. bovis_ infections may be quite sick even in the absence of anaemia and red urine.

It is difficult to diagnose tick fever based on clinical signs alone. The best way to diagnose tick fever is to send blood smears to a laboratory for examination.

Risk factors for tick fever:
- Breed. British, European, and other _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds are more susceptible to tick fever caused by _Babesia_ organisms than Brahman and _Bos indicus_ breeds. Cross breeds (_B. taurus_ x _B. indicus_) have intermediate susceptibility determined by the percentage of each breed type. All breeds, including _B. indicus_ breeds, are highly susceptible to disease caused by _A. marginale_.
- Age. There is a strong link between age and resistance. Most outbreaks occur in animals 18 to 36 months of age. Calves exposed to tick fever organisms between 3 to 9 months of age rarely show clinical signs and develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.
- Exposure. Cattle born and raised in areas where cattle ticks are endemic can develop natural immunity through exposure to ticks infected with tick fever. However, exposure of calves to ticks infected with tick fever (and subsequent development of protective immunity) can be highly unpredictable. Exposure is influenced by factors such as breed, season, and tick-control strategies.

All cattle raised in areas free from cattle ticks are at risk of tick fever if introduced into areas where ticks are present.

The most likely tick fever here is caused by the organism _Babesia bigemina_.

Tick fever should be suspected in animals showing haemoglobinuria, elevated temperature, jaundice and anaemia. _Babesia bovis_ (Argentina) infections often cause nervous symptoms, followed by coma and death. Splenomegaly at necropsy is characteristic. The animal and its herd mates should be examined for ticks https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/about-us/services/laboratory-services/veterinary/tick-fever-of-cattle.

The 1st signs of illness usually occur 8-10 days after tick attachment for _B. bovis_ and 14-20 days for _B. bigemina_. The severity of the illness can range from a mild fever to one which is rapidly fatal. Clinical illness is rarely seen in animals less than 9 months of age

- At 1st, the membranes around the eye are bright red but over a few days turn pale, or even white, as anaemia develops.
- The animal's appetite is depressed, and there is a rapid loss in condition. In dairy cows, a drop in milk production occurs at the same time as the fever develops.
- Nervous signs are a feature of infection with _B. bovis_. Circling and personality changes such as aggression are often seen.
- The urine is often red or brown to almost black, hence tick fever is sometimes referred to as "red water."
- Pregnant cows may abort.
- Infected bulls may be temporarily infertile for 6-8 weeks

An animal may die at any time from about 3 days to 4 weeks after the onset of the illness. The fever usually lasts for about a week, and the course of the disease is about 3 weeks. In animals that survive, the appetite gradually returns to normal, but recovery is slow and may take weeks or even months. Treatment with specific drugs usually results in rapid recovery if given early, but animals showing clinical signs and left untreated frequently die.

In cattle-tick endemic areas in northern Australia, tick fever vaccine is regularly used to protect cattle. The vaccine has a short shelf life as it contains living organisms so must be used straight away. It is available from the Tick Fever Centre at Wacol Qld. https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/58289/Tick-fever.pdf.

I have included some information about the disease these ticks carry. This becomes a huge cost to the producer, is very hard on the animals, and so much easier to prevent than the treat. It is critical to follow the regulations and not spread the tick or any diseases it may likely carry. - Mod.TG
