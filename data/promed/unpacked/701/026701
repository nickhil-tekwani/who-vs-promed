41 deaths in Rayagada district and 8 deaths in Kalahandi district due to
acute diarrheal diseases have been reported in recent months in Orissa.

A Central team comprising experts from National Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC) Delhi and National Institute of Cholera & Enteric Diseases (NICED),
Kolkata was deputed by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to assist the
state/district health authorities in the investigation and control of
outbreaks. The team visited the affected areas of Rayagada and Kalahandi
districts during the period 17-21 Sep 2010.

The recommendations made to the State Government in order to minimize the
risk of further outbreaks of cholera include provision of safe water,
adopting safe practices in food handling, sanitary disposal of human waste,
personal and domestic hygienic practices, availability of ORS in all the
habitations, making all tube wells functional to ensure that people use
safe water for drinking and domestic purposes, and promoting hand washing
with soap and water (with earth and water, if soap is not available) after
defecation and before preparing and eating meals.

The cases and deaths declined in the 2nd half of September 2010.
