Zika virus has also been identified molecularly in Indonesia just recently for the 1st time by the Emerging Virus Research Unit in our institute. Presence of antibody to the virus has been reported before. This finding will certainly influence the surveillance program.

[ProMED-mail thanks Amin Soebandrio for sending in this report. This is the 1st report of Zika virus infections in Indonesia that ProMED-mail has posted. Its occurrence in Indonesia is not surprising, since it has occurred in other areas of South East Asia. In a subsequent communication Amin Soebandrio reported that information on Zika virus in Indonesia will be reported soon in JITMM (Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting) organized by Mahidol University, Thailand, on 2-4 Dec 2015 (http://www.jitmm.com). Further information on the finding could be accessed from the abstract of the presentation, including accession number to its sequence at GenBank. A full paper has also been prepared for submission to an international journal. ProMED-mail looks forward to the availability of additional information including the number of cases, their location, dates of infection and diagnosis and comparison of the virus genome with other Zika virus isolates.
