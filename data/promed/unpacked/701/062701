So far in the governorate of Kebili, 11 cases of the West Nile virus (WNV) [infections] have been recorded, including one death -- that of an elderly woman suffering from diabetes.

Regional Health Director Mustapha Harrabi explained to TAP news agency correspondent in the region, that all the persons who had contracted this disease had left the regional hospital after having been treated.

He added that there are no specific medicines for this viral disease whose symptoms are those of a simple flu, accompanied by a high fever which might in some cases cause brain inflammations and lead to death.

Besides, he asserted that this disease is not contagious but is transmitted by mosquitos or blood transfusion.

However, the official minimised the seriousness of this disease that had been discovered in Tunisia a few years ago, and which is cured [treated] by medicines prescribed for a simple flu or a fever, calling for the combination of efforts to treat the mosquito-breeding waters.

[The number of human West Nile virus infections in Kebili governorate has increased from 5 as of 18 Oct 2012 (see the ECDC source cited in ProMED-mail archive no. 20121025.1364837), to 11 in the report above.

WNV has caused human cases in Tunisia in recent years: in 2010, 3 cases (Jendouba and Tataouine governorates); in 2011, 3 cases (Kebili governorate); and to date in 2012, 28 cases (Gabes, Jendouba, Kebili, Mahdia, and Monastir governorates).

It is very likely that WNV is endemic in Tunisia. Although equine animals can be vaccinated against WNV infection, there is no commercially available vaccine for human use, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available.
