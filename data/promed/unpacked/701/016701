Melitensis_ and _B. Suis_) (Infection with (_Brucella abortus_, _B. Melitensis_ and _B. Suis_) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

" Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by _B. abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. _Brucella melitensis_ is the main causative agent of infection with _Brucella_ in sheep and goats. Infection with _Brucella_ in pigs is due to _B. suis_ biovars 1-3, but the disease caused by biovar 2 differs in its host range, its limited geographical distribution and its pathogenicity. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild pigs. Clinically, infection with _Brucella_ in animals is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions.

Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _B. abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals.

Infection caused by _B. suis_ bv. 2 differs from infection caused by bv. 1 and bv. 3 in its host range, distribution, and in pathogenicity. Historically, the geographical distribution of _B. suis_ bv. 2 has been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars [_Sus scrofa_] appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In outbreaks in Europe, wild boars were implicated as the source of transmission of bv. 2 to outdoor reared pigs, and are considered as the main wild reservoir of this infection. _B. suis_ bv. 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, bv. 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, bv. 2 infections have been reported in immunocompromised hunters, who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares. Moreover, rare cases of _B. suis_ bv. 2 infection without clinical signs have been reported in Europe in cattle or sheep exposed to infected wild boars.

In addition to wild boar, the European hare (_Lepus europaeus_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ bv. 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. The disease in the European hare is characterised by the formation of nodules, varying in size from that of a millet seed to a cherry or even larger; these often become purulent. Such nodules may occur in almost any location, sometimes subcutaneously or intramuscularly, in the spleen, liver, or lung and in the reproductive organs of either sex. The bodily condition of the hare may be surprisingly unaffected. Other species may also become infected by cohabitation with _B. suis_ bv. 2 infected swine, wild boars, or hares. Gutting or skinning wild boars in cattle sheds could be a route of transmission to cattle." - Mod.CRD
