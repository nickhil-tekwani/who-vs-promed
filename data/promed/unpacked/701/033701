[2] Indonesia: 3-year plan

Indonesia on Wednesday [30 Jan 2008] launched a new 3-year plan to fight
bird flu, just days after the confirmed death toll topped 100 in the
country hardest hit by the H5N1 virus. The plan will be funded by a USD 20
million European Union (EU) grant channeled through the World Health
Organization (WHO), the health ministry's disease control director Nyoman
Kandun told reporters here. Indonesia accounts for just under half of the
224 human bird flu deaths worldwide, according to WHO figures. The 100th
victim died on Sunday [27 Jan 2008], and the 101st fatality was recorded on
Tuesday [29 Jan 2008].

Kandun said Indonesia would need to meet with EU and WHO officials on a
"routine basis" in order for the plan to work. WHO's Indonesia
representative Subhash Salunke said the strategy would focus on preventing
new infections, better monitoring of the spread of the virus and continued
scientific research.

"Prevention of new cases remains an urgent priority, while improving
survival [rates] of those infected is another major priority," he said. The
prevention campaign would include ramped up efforts to improve hygiene in
the country's wet markets and public awareness initiatives.

"The persistence of H5N1 in Indonesia has serious (global) consequences for
health, economies and food security," Salunke said. "Out of 33 provinces,
in 31 provinces this is an endemic virus ... because it is present in such
a vast area, the opportunity for virus and human being contact is immense,"
Salunke said.

The H5N1 virus is typically spread by direct contact between poultry and
humans, but there are fears among scientists that the virus could mutate
into a form easily transmissible between humans, setting off a worldwide
pandemic. The concern stems from past influenza pandemics. A pandemic in
1918, just after the end of World War I, killed 20 million people worldwide.

[It might be relevant in developing a new containment strategy to consider
what factors (such as population density, agricultural practices, animal
health services) have apparently enabled 2 of the 33 provinces of Indonesia
to be free of endemic H5N1 avian influenza.
