---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In 2009, the WHO proposed Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, a document to implement use of 2 alcohol-based hand rubs (formulation I and II) for surgical and hygiene hand disinfection in healthcare settings and to reduce transmission of pathogens. However, inactivation efficacies of these products against MPVX [monkeypox virus] have not been determined. We evaluated the WHO-recommended alcohol-based formulations against MPXV and performed a comparative inactivation analysis with other (re)emerging enveloped and reference viruses, including Zika virus, influenza A(H1N1) virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

The study
--------
Overall, both WHO formulations efficiently inactivated MPXV, but the 2-propanol-based WHO formulation II showed a slightly greater virucidal activity than the ethanol-based WHO formulation I. Nonetheless, MPXV showed the greatest stability to both formulations compared with other (re)emerging enveloped or reference viruses.

Conclusions
------------
The WHO recommends 2 inexpensive alcohol-based hand-rub formulations to reduce the transmission of pathogens. We found that MPXV was efficiently inactivated by both formulations, supporting their use in healthcare systems and during MPXV outbreaks.

In addition, ethanol and 2-propanol inactivated the virus during a 30-s exposure at a concentration of >30% (vol/vol). A comparative inactivation analyses with different (re)emerging enveloped or reference viruses showed that MPXV had the highest stability against both WHO formulations compared with other enveloped viruses. The susceptibility of the different viruses to the WHO formulations probably depends on virus-specific surface properties of their lipophilic envelope. Nonetheless, our results confirm modified vaccinia Ankara as a suitable model surrogate for MPXV to evaluate chemical disinfectants and antiseptics. WHO formulation II and 2-propanol were slightly more efficient in inactivating MPXV compared with WHO formulation I and ethanol. This difference can probably be explained by the additional carbon of 2-propanol, resulting in an enhanced lipophilicity against the viral membranes compared with ethanol. Our findings underscore the need and timely application of alcohol-based disinfectants as an effective measure for minimizing viral transmission and maximizing viral inactivation during the ongoing MPVX outbreak.

ref: de Vries H J, Gotz H M, Bruisten S, et al. Human monkeypox virus outbreak among men who have sex with men in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the Netherlands: no evidence for undetected transmission prior to May 2022 in a retrospective study. medRxiv; 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.19.22282179.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Background
-----------
Since May 2022 after initial detection in the United Kingdom (UK), a global outbreak has evolved primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). The transmission has mainly occurred among men with frequent sexual and direct skin contact with multiple partners. Genome sequencing showed that viruses from clade IIb caused the vast majority of cases. The 1st hMPXV cases in the Netherlands were identified in retrospect on 20 May 2022 in 2 Centers for Sexual health (CSH) based on hMPXV suspected symptoms, previously collected 10 May 2022 in Amsterdam and 19 May [2022] in Rotterdam. By October 2022, 20.675 confirmed cases of MPX have been reported from 29 EU/EEA countries. In the Netherlands, more than 1200 cases were diagnosed, of which >50% in Amsterdam and about 7% in Rotterdam.

The exact moment of introduction and subsequent spread of sexually transmitted hMPXV among MSM is unknown. Insight into prolonged undetected transmission can help to understand the current outbreak dynamics and aid future public health interventions. Here, we tested a convenience collection of stored anorectal and ulcer samples from MSM visiting the CSH from Amsterdam and Rotterdam on hMPXV. As cut-off point, we used in retrospect the day before the 1st presentation of an identified case in each city, respectively 9 May and 18 May [2022], respectively.

Discussion
----------
We identified 2 symptomatic cases of hMPXV in the 1st week of May (week 18) 2022 that preceded the previously 1st-identified case in the Netherlands. We found no hMPXV in 399 samples predating the 1st cases. Our study included samples from 208 MSM with complaints suspected of hMPXV infection according to the current WHO suspected case definition criteria, such as anogenital ulcers (n=138) and proctitis (n=70). We therefore assume that it seems unlikely that substantial undetected transmission of hMPXV occurred in the Netherlands before the 1st week of May (week 18) 2022. The mean incubation period for cases identified in the Netherlands was 8.5 days [4.2-17.3]. These findings suggest that the introduction of hMPXV in Dutch sexual networks of MSM started somewhere at the end of April 2022. This coincides with the earliest symptom onset of hMPXV cases in the UK on 21 Apr [2022], in Spain on 26 Apr [2022], and in Portugal on 29 Apr [2022]. In combination with the phylogenetic analysis of hMPXV genome sequences, showing that the initial cases across Europe are clonal, it is likely that the hMPXV outbreak expanded internationally within a short period (weeks) in the spring of 2022 in an international highly intertwined network of sexually active MSM. The outbreak also coincided with international relaxation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevention measures and resumption of global travel. Both cases had characteristics that are associated with increased risk of spread of sexually transmitted infections [STI] such as multiple previous STI, multiple sex partners, condomless (anal) sex, either HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis use or living with HIV and substance use. These characteristics predispose for sexually transmitted infections and for hMPXV.

In the current outbreak in MSM, it remains unclear how hMPXV was introduced. Apart from network effects, the currently circulating strains differ from previous hMPXV strains by over 50 nucleotides. It remains unclear whether such changes led to increased (sexual) transmission. Further viral characterization is needed as well as continued genomic surveillance on circulating hMPXV strains. In conclusion, we found no indication of extensive undetected transmission of hMPXV among MSM in Amsterdam or Rotterdam before May 2022. This is in accordance with findings from other European cities and in support of a clonal international outbreak in the spring of 2022.

[4] Rates of monkeypox transmission in women and non-binary individuals
Date: Thu 17 Nov 2022
Source: The Lancet [abridged, edited]
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02187-0/fulltext


Summary
-----------
Methods: International collaborators in geographical locations with high numbers of diagnoses of monkeypox virus infection were approached and invited to contribute data on women and non-binary individuals with confirmed monkeypox virus infection. Contributing centres completed deidentified structured case-report spreadsheets, adapted and developed by participating clinicians, to include variables of interest relevant to women and non-binary individuals assigned female at birth.

Findings: Collaborators reported data for a total of 136 individuals with monkeypox virus infection who presented between 11 May and 4 Oct 2022, across 15 countries. Overall median age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR] 28-40; range 19-84). The cohort comprised 62 trans women, 69 cis women, and 5 non-binary individuals (who were, because of small numbers, grouped with cis women to form a category of people assigned female at birth for the purpose of comparison). 121 (89%) of 136 individuals reported sex with men. 37 (27%) of all individuals were living with HIV, with a higher proportion among trans women (31 [50%] of 62) than among cis women and non-binary individuals (6 [8%] of 74). Sexual transmission was suspected in 55 (89%) trans women (with the remainder having an unknown route of transmission) and 45 (61%) cis women and non-binary individuals; non-sexual routes of transmission (including household and occupational exposures) were reported only in cis women and non-binary individuals. 25 (34%) of 74 cis women and non-binary individuals submitted to the case series were initially misdiagnosed. Overall, among individuals with available data, rash was described in 124 (93%) of 134 individuals and described as anogenital in 95 (74%) of 129 and as vesiculopustular in 105 (87%) of 121. Median number of lesions was 10 (IQR 5-24; range 1-200). Mucosal lesions involving the vagina, anus, or oropharynx or eye occurred in 65 (55%) of 119 individuals with available data. Vaginal and anal sex were associated with lesions at those sites. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected by PCR from vaginal swab samples in all 14 samples tested. 17 (13%) individuals were hospitalized, predominantly for bacterial superinfection of lesions and pain management. 33 (24%) individuals were treated with tecovirimat, and 6 (4%) received post-exposure vaccinations. No deaths were reported.

Interpretation: The clinical features of monkeypox in women and non-binary individuals were similar to those described in men, including the presence of anal and genital lesions with prominent mucosal involvement. Anatomically, anogenital lesions were reflective of sexual practices: vulvovaginal lesions predominated in cis women and non-binary individuals, and anorectal features predominated in trans women. The prevalence of HIV co-infection in the cohort was high.
