The Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan on Thursday [30 Aug 2012] reported an outbreak of anthrax in the republic. "Nine people have been hospitalized in the last month in Kyrgyzstan with symptoms of anthrax; in 5 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed," said center director, Jalalidan Gaibulin.

Some outbreaks of the disease were detected in the northern and southern regions of the republic. One case occurred in Bishkek. A woman had been selling infected beef in the largest market in the capital.

Currently, inspections are carried out in all markets and shops in Bishkek where meat and other livestock products are sold. Epidemiologists performed additional vaccinations of animals. Also, immunoglobulin injections were given to people who were exposed.

According to the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health, there are 1219 natural anthrax foci in the republic [i.e. places where infected animals have been buried. - Mod.MHJ]

[Anthrax is commonly diagnosed in parts of northern Kyrgyzstan and also in Osh a Jalalabad in SE Kyrgyzstan when it overflows from Uzbekistan in the Fergana Valley.

The rapid field slaughter and butchering by stockmen overseeing village cattle on common grazing and then returning the hides, meat and viscera to the owner(s) is how this contaminated meat finds its way to local markets. It is a long tradition uninterrupted by science. Until the government puts a proactive control and surveillance programme in place, it will continue.
