Cote d'Ivoire: 8 people die of food poisoning
---------------------------------------------
Eight people, from 2 families, have died of poisoning linked to food contaminated with pesticides.

According to the Ministry of Solidarity and the Fight against Poverty, the tragedy occurred in the village of Mignore, in the sub-prefecture of Seitifla, department of Vavoua, on 23 and 24 Sep 2021.

The balance sheet shows 8 dead and announces a 9th victim is in a coma, and was admitted to a health center in the city of Daloa.

Among the deceased victims, 6 come from the same family. They all had abdominal pain. Medical analysis revealed organophosphorus food poisoning, linked to phytosanitary products.

[Our sympathies to the families involved.

It is unclear how the chemical, believed to be an organophosphate, would have been in the food. Perhaps it was on vegetables on which the chemical could have been used as an insecticide. Or was this chemical added to a dish as a mistaken seasoning?

"Organophosphates are a group of human-made chemicals that poison insects and mammals. Organophosphates are the most widely used insecticides today. They are used in agriculture, the home, gardens, and veterinary practice.

- Because organophosphates are often sprayed on crops and plants, small particles of the chemical may be carried away from the field or yard before falling to the ground.
- After organophosphates are applied, they may be present in the soil, surface waters, and on the surface of the plants. They can move through the soil and contaminate ground water.
- Rain can wash organophosphates on soil and plant surfaces into surface waters.
- Organophosphates are rapidly broken down into other chemicals so they do not build up in the environment.
- Organophosphates are not likely to build up to high or dangerous levels in animal or plant foods that you might eat.

"Organophosphate insecticides (such as diazinon) are one type of pesticide that works by damaging an enzyme in the body called acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is critical for controlling nerve signals in the body. The damage to this enzyme kills pests and may cause unwanted side effects in exposed humans. All organophosphates have a common mechanism of toxicity and can cause similar symptoms in humans who have too much exposure.

"Urine samples can be analyzed for organophosphate insecticides and their breakdown products (metabolites). The metabolites are not toxic, but show exposure to organophosphates occurred in the few days before testing. Linking some of these metabolites to a specific, original organophosphate compound is not possible without additional information. Even though an organophosphate or its metabolites in a person indicates exposure, it does not necessarily show the person will become sick.

"Symptoms of sudden poisoning by organophosphates start during or after exposure, depending on how the poison is contacted. Symptoms start fastest after organophosphates are breathed, and next by eating or drinking contaminated food or water or getting them on your skin. Some symptoms are headache, dizziness, weakness, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, salivation, watery eyes, and small pupils. Severe symptoms are seizures, slow pulse, difficulty breathing, and coma. Long after exposure, people also can develop nervous system problems such as muscle weakness and numbness and tingling of the hands and feet (neuropathy).

"Long-term exposure to organophosphates can cause confusion, anxiety, loss of memory, loss of appetite, disorientation, depression, and personality changes. Other symptoms such as weakness, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting also may occur."
