Malaysia's Ministry of Health reported an additional human rabies death in Sarawak state. The case was a 62-year-old man from Sibu who passed away on Tuesday [23 Jun 2020].

The deceased was bitten by a brother's dog in his right calf while visiting his relative's house on West Sentosa Road, Sibu, on 12 May 2020. He had washed the wound with water and soap for 15 minutes and had sought treatment at a health facility. However, he did not return to the facility for an injection of anti-rabies vaccine.

He started suffering from foot pain on 16 Jun 2020. On 19 Jun 2020, he was referred to Sibu Hospital, Sarawak, for further treatment and was admitted to the ward on the same day. The patient died on 23 Jun 2020 with the cause of death being rabies. He was diagnosed with rabies through a laboratory test conducted by the Institute of Medical Research (IMR) on 25 Jun 2020.

This is the 2nd human rabies death in Sarawak this year [2020] and the 23rd since the outbreak of the disease was declared on 1 Jul 2017, with 24 cases in total.

Officials in Bali are stepping up rabies vaccinations for dogs across the province following cases in Jembrana and Tabanan regencies, where about a dozen local residents were recently bitten by rabies-infected dogs.

Wanagiri and Berembeng, 2 villages in Tabanan regency, were declared red zones for rabies this week after local officials found at least 5 rabies-infected dogs.

"[We found] 3 Berembeng residents who were bitten by rabies-infected dogs. In June [2020] there's been 2 cases of rabies-infected dogs in 2 different villages," I Wayan Suamba, who heads the livestock department in Tabanan's Agriculture Agency, said.

Last week, at least 9 residents from Mendoyo Dauh Tukad village in Jembrana regency were bitten by a pet dog that was later confirmed to have been infected with rabies. The owner told a local media outlet that the domesticated dog had previously interacted with a stray dog before it began to exhibit unusual aggression and later bit members of the household.

As of Monday [22 Jun 2020], over 100 dogs had received vaccination in Mendoyo Dauh Tukad, while 6 stray dogs were sadly put down, local officials said. The people who had been bitten have also received anti-rabies vaccine (VAR), according to reports.

The Bali provincial government has distributed more than 532 000 rabies vaccines as a precaution, though the number is less than the estimated total dog population across the province, which officials put at around 647 000.

"Between January and June 2020, there are 54 cases of rabies-positive [dogs] in Bali. This showcases a decrease when compared to the same period last year [2019], when there were 126 cases," IB Wisnuardhana, who heads Bali's Agriculture and Food Security Agency, said.

The reduced number of cases, however, could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has limited outdoor activities for months as people are encouraged to stay home.

Toyohashi City, Aichi Prefecture, announced on 15 Jun 2020 that a male in his 30s of foreign nationality who had developed rabies after coming to Japan from the Philippines and was admitted to a hospital in the city died on 13 Jun 2020. He had been bitten by a dog in the Philippines around September last year [2019] and was supposed to have been infected.

The man came to Japan for work in February 2020. He complained of ankle and lower back pain as well as fear of water since mid-May 2020. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed rabies infection on 22 May 2020.

Two earlier cases in Japan involved Japanese men who had been bitten by a dog in the Philippines in 2006. They became ill after returning to Japan, and both died.
