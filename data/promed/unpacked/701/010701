The number of confirmed cryptosporidium cases reaches 62
-----------------------------------------------
6 children who had to be treated in the hospital are among those who have
fallen victim to the infection after visiting Auchingarrich Wildlife
Centre, near Comrie.

NHS Tayside confirmed yesterday [Tue 26 Apr 2005] that there have, so far,
been 49 cases reported in Tayside, 7 in Forth Valley, 2 in Greater Glasgow
and Fife and one each in Grampian and Lothian. However, these figures are
expected to rise throughout the course of the week. Some of those who have
become ill had visited the center as far back as 25 Mar 2005.

The bug is commonly found in animal intestines and can cause diarrhea,
vomiting, stomach cramps and a slight fever, although no one has yet been
reported as being seriously ill.

An outbreak control team, which comprises experts from NHS Tayside, NHS
Forth Valley, Perth and Kinross Council and Health Protection Scotland, is
continuing its investigations to find the source of the infection. The
wildlife center has suspended animal petting during this time.

Team chairman Dr. Christopher McGuigan, an NHS Tayside consultant, urged
the public to observe strict hygiene and to use thorough hand washing with
soap and water to protect against infection after contact with animals. He
said: "A large number of people appear to have visited the center over the
recent Easter holidays, and this is one of the reasons we believe the
numbers of confirmed cases may continue to rise in the course of this week.
Anyone who has become ill after visiting the center and who has concerns
about their health should consult their general practitioner or seek advice
via the NHS Helpline on 0800 22 44 88."

[It seems unlikely that so many people are infected from contact with
animals, and the source of infection is most likely from drinking water. -
