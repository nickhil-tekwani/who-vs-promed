The clinical features of Kyansanur Forest disease (KFD) resemble those of
the Saudi illness.
Kyasanur Forest disease is caused by an RNA virus (family Flaviviridae,
genus _Flavivirus_) found in rodents, shrews, monkeys and ticks
(_Haemaphylsalis spinigera_, _H. turturis_, _H. papuana kinneari_ [and
rarely _H. kasanurensis_, _H. minuta_, _H. wellingtoni_, _H. bispinosa_,
and _Ixodes_ sp. and _Ornithodoros_ sp. -- Mod CHC). Following an
incubation period of three to twelve days, the patient develops myalgia,
vomiting, conjunctivitis, relative bradycardia, generalized
lymphadenopathy, palatal
vesicles, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Encephalitis is occasionally
encountered.
The disease [KFD was first described in 1957. Most cases are reported
from Karnataka State, India in the vicinity of Mysore. Rates peak during
January to February. Epidemics were reported during 1982 to 1983, with 326
cases (29 fatal) in 1983. 88,152 persons in an endemic area were
vaccinated during 1990 to 1992.

[Thanks to Steve Berger and GIDEON for providing this information. Whether
it is relevant to the Saudi disease and virus is yet to be determined.
Molecular data accumulated thus far indicate that the Saudi virus is most
closely related to KFD virus but is not identical to it. A provisional
name, "Fakeeh virus", (Gubler DJ "The global resurgence of arboviral
diseases", Transactions Royal Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg., 90:449-451, 1996) is
being used in conversations about the Saudi virus but, as Duane Gubler has
said, there are insufficient serologic test results to allow formal naming.
