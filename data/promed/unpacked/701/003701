Togo: recent bird flu outbreak is deadly H5N1
---------------------------------------------
Togo state television says lab tests performed after a recent
outbreak of bird flu have confirmed the presence of the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus, which has the potential to infect humans.

No human cases have been detected so far in Togo, however.

State media reported Monday [15 Sep 2008] the lab tests were carried
out by experts in Ghana and Italy after the outbreak was discovered
last week [week of 8 Aug 2008] among several thousand birds in Agbata
outside the capital, Lome.

The Health Ministry says "precautionary measures have been taken to
contain the situation."

At least 235 people have died of bird flu worldwide since 2003,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
