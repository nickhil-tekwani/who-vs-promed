Peanut disease baffles scientists, frustrates West Texas farmers
---------------------
West Texas peanut farmers and agricultural scientists have been frustrated
and baffled this summer by a peanut disease that defied identification. "It
is Sclerotinia blight [Sb]," says Terry Wheeler, research plant pathologist
at the Texas A&M Research and Extension Center in Lubbock. Wheeler says
that it looks and acts like Sb in the field and when it is isolated in the
lab it is Sb.
Some farmers, mostly in Gaines County, expressed frustration at a recent
field day at the Western Peanut Growers Research Farm near Seminole. The
crux of their beef is a delay in identification of the organism. Peanut
specialists on hand at the field day explained that the pathogen that was
observed this year resembled another peanut disease organism, Botrytis
blight [Bb], caused by _Botrytis cinerea_.
The fungicide of choice for Bb, Topsin-M, costs considerably less than
Omega, the recommended treatment for Sb. Moreover, Topsin-M, which is not
labeled for Sb, "stopped the infection," Wheeler says. "It's not supposed
to, but it did."
According to Extension plant pathologist Chip Lee, samples from Gaines
County and those from Lee were the same organism. He says, "The samples do
not look like Sb, but in every sample, isolation showed it to be Sb. Every
one."
According to Wheeler, peanut specialists looked at the disease in the field
and agreed that it was not Sb. Using standard isolation techniques, she
could not identify the disease as Bb, which is easy to identify in the lab,
but not in the field.
Wheeler says the Gaines County farmers apparently have a new strain of the
fungus. "This is a clear change in a well-studied disease," she said. "And
it is a very aggressive form of the disease. It has been very severe in
Gaines County this year."
The outbreak runs from around Seminole north to Seagraves, near the Terry
County line. A sample from Yoakum County is also being analyzed.
According to Wheeler, the bad thing about Sb is that once it gets started
in a field, it remains for the life of that field.

[The most logical explanation for the current disease is that a mutation
has occurred or a new strain has evolved. Sclerotinia blight [Sb], caused
by the fungus _Sclerotinia minor_ [Sm], is a destructive mid-to late-season
disease of peanuts. 1st discovered on peanut in Virginia in 1971, it
subsequently spread to North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas. Sm survives in
soil as sclerotia (resistant seed-like structures) and attacks plants near
the soil line. Sm occurs worldwide, primarily in cool, moist regions. Its
host range includes canola, sunflower, bean, sweet potato, cole crops, and
soybean. In Oklahoma, yield losses in experimental plots infested with Sb
ranged from 7 percent to 80 percent.
Spread of the disease is limited because Sm does not Sm produce airborne
spores during the cropping season. Sclerotia are the major means of
long-distance movement. Sm is seedborne and is found as a contaminant in
soils cropped by peanut. Infection by Sb can be very damaging and is
difficult to control. Disease management basically depends upon preventing
movement of contaminated soil to clean areas. Farm implements coming off
contaminated soils should be washed thoroughly to remove soil and straw. A
combination of cultural and chemical management practices will usually
provide adequate control. New resistant cultivars have been developed
recently by USDA.
