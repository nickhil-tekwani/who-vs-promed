Summary Abstract:
We measured early 2016/17 season influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) in Europe using multicentre case control studies at primary care and hospital levels. IVE at primary care level was 44.1 percent, 46.9 percent and 23.4 percent among 0-14, 15-64 and 65 year-olds, and 25.7 percent in the influenza vaccination target group. At hospital level, IVE was 2.5 percent, 7.9 percent, and 2.4 percent among 65, 65-79, and 80 year-olds. As in previous seasons, we observed suboptimal IVE against influenza A(H3N2).

Influenza season 2016/17 in Europe was marked by the predominant circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses [http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Risk-assessment-seasonal-influenza-2016-2017-update.pdf], with significant pressure on hospitals, mostly due to patients aged 65 years and older developing severe disease. Many European countries reported excess all-cause mortality [http://www.euromomo.eu/]. Initial estimates based on Swedish and Finnish electronic databases suggest low influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) among older adults [http://www.vardgivarguiden.se/behandlingsstod/smittskydd/dokument/statistik/influensa/sasongen-2016-2017, https://www.thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit/taudit-ja-mikrobit/virustaudit/influenssa/ajantasainen-influenssakatsaus]. This study has evaluated early IVE at primary care and hospital levels against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) in Europe. - Mod.UBA]

Summary Abstract:
The 2016/17 mid-season vaccine effectiveness estimate against influenza A(H3N2) was 15 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 11 to 35) in Navarre. Comparing to individuals unvaccinated in the current and 4 prior seasons, effectiveness was 24 percent for current and 3-4 prior doses, 61 percent for current and 1-2 prior doses, 42 percent for only current vaccination, and 58 percent for 3-4 prior doses. This suggests moderate effectiveness for different combinations of vaccination in the current and prior seasons.

Combined effectiveness of prior and current season influenza vaccination in northern Spain: 2016/17 mid-season analysis. Euro Surveill. 2017;22(7):pii=30465. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.7.30465.

In the 2016/17 season, the A(H3N2) component recommended for the influenza vaccine in the northern hemisphere was A/HongKong/4801/2014-like virus (group 3C.2a) [Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season. Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2016;91(10):121-32.PMID: 26971356], in the 2015/16 season A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like (group 3C.3a) [PMID: 25771542], and in seasons 2012/13 to 2014/15, it was A/Texas/50/2012-like or A/Victoria/361/2011-like (group 3C.1) [PMID: 24707514].

This study stated that: "In conclusion, the results suggest that, overall, the different combinations of vaccination in the current and prior seasons were moderately effective against influenza A(H3N2) in the early 2016/17 season in northern Spain. In spite of the possible interferences between the effects of the current season vaccine and frequent prior vaccination, these findings highlight the net benefit of immunisation against influenza." - Mod.UBA
