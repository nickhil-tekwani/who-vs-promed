This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Verran, Tua, District office Innherred og Fosen, Region office Trondelag og More og Romdal, Nord-Trondelag
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 27 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The farm is a beef cattle farm with a herd of Scottish Highland cattle.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: Based on status on 29 Jan 2015: On 20 Jan 2015, the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported suspicion of BSE on a cow in Norway, based on initial test done on CNS material. Part of this material was sent to European Union Reference Laboratory in Weybridge (21 Jan 2015) for verification of diagnosis. The affected cow was a 15-year-old and born in Norway. The dam was imported from Sweden. The cow did not show clinical signs of neurological disease before she was killed (12 Jan 2015) due to old age and injuries. The BSE test was taken as part of the BSE surveillance program. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) has put restrictions on movement on the farm, and performed epidemiological investigations. The NFSA has identified 4 risk animals, according to relevant legislation. These animals are also placed under official movement restrictions. The 4 identified risk animals will be killed and disposed of by incineration according to European Union legislation. The epidemiological investigation including tracing of risk animals from the holding of origin as well as the present holding has identified 2 offspring borne within 2 years prior to the incident in addition to 2 cattle belonging either to (1) the cohort of animals born in the same herd as the affected animal within 12 months preceding or following the date of birth of the affected cow or (2) the cohort of animals which at any time during the 1st year of their lives were reared together with the affected cow during her 1st year of life. Progeny borne within 2 years prior to the incident and the cohort of risk animals are put under movement restrictions and the killing and destruction of these animals will be carried into effect as soon as possible. The affected cow's carcass has been completely destroyed. The NFSA ensures that the cow's carcass has been processed by pressure sterilisation in a Category 1 processing plant and that the resulting material has been sent for incineration/co-incineration in accordance with the By-Products Regulation.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: modified stamping out

[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a disease that affects primarily cattle. It belongs to a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. The diseases are characterised by a degeneration of brain tissue, giving it a sponge-like appearance.

BSE was 1st diagnosed in 1986. Since 1989, the European Commission and the EU Member States have put in place a comprehensive series of measures to manage the risk of BSE in the European Union (EU).

BSE can be divided into classical BSE and atypical BSE. At present, only the infectious agent causing classical BSE has been demonstrated to be transmissible to humans (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bovinespongiformencephalopathy.htm).

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has developed a laboratory protocol on how to conduct new studies for investigating the presence of the agent of atypical BSE in tissues of infected cattle.

We encourage the subscriber to read the EFSA scientific report published on 21 Jul 2014, entitled "Protocol for further laboratory investigations into the distribution of infectivity of Atypical BSE". According to this report (see epidemiology section): "The generally older age of the identified H-BSE and L-BSE cases, and their apparently low prevalence in the population, suggest that these Atypical BSE forms could be arising spontaneously." The complete report can be downloaded at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/3798.pdf.

Based on Resolution No. 18 (adopted at the 82nd General Session of the OIE, May 2014), Norway and Sweden are OIE Member countries recognized as having negligible BSE risk status in accordance with Chapter 11.5 of the Terrestrial Code. A complete list of the BSE Risk Status of Member Countries can be found at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/. - Mod.CRD
