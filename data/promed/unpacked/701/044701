Iraq reports first bird flu case
--------------------------------
Iraqi medical sources reported Saturday [29 Oct 2005] the 1st case of bird
flu found in the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Erbil.
The head of the central veterinary laboratory in Erbil, Ilham Butros, said
in a statement made available to United Press International that a chicken
was found to have been infected with the strain.
She said a sample was taken from a sick bird in a poultry farm in the city
and sent for tests in a reputable Cairo lab because Erbil has no advanced
laboratories to detect such viruses.
Butros said the tests in the Egyptian capital confirmed the chicken was
infected with the bird flu.
Iraqi medical and veterinary officials have repeatedly said Iraq was free
of bird flu and the government has taken strict measures to prevent the
entry and import of birds, live and slaughtered chicken and all poultry
products.
The report, which could not be confirmed from other sources, makes Iraq the
first country in the Middle East to report the strain.
It comes 2 weeks after Turkey, which borders northern Iraq, reported a case
of the pandemic.

This piece of information, lacking elementary clinical and epidemiological
data -- such as the number of dead birds -- should be viewed with caution.
Confirmation -- or otherwise -- directly from the Cairo laboratory and
urgent despatch of the sample to an international reference laboratory is
required the soonest.- Mod.AS].
