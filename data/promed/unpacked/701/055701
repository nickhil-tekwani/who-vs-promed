Stuart Renton, a vet for almost 30 years, who works out of the Newcastle
FMD centre in Kenton Bar, Newcastle, launched a scathing attack on his
employers, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).
He said he and many other vets working for MAFF believe Mr Waugh is
innocent after the Government's charge the epidemic "probably" started on
the Northumberland pig farm. And MAFF has steadfastly blamed Mr Waugh's pig
farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall as the "likely source" of the outbreak which
they say started between 15 Feb and 23 Feb 2001.
Renton blasted the Government for adopting the wrong policies to deal with
the outbreak. They have made our work extremely harrowing," he said.
The 50-year-old North East vet's contract with the Maff may now be on the
line for daring to tell what he believes is the truth. Throughout the
entire FMD epidemic MAFF vets have not been allowed to speak out about the
crisis.
Instead any official comment has only come from the MAFF press office in
London, its chief scientist Professor David King or Agriculture Minister
Nick Brown.
But today Mr Renton says he has seen enough evidence of "old" FMD sores on
infected sheep to convince him the disease was present in the UK long
before then.
Dr Renton said: "Long standing FMD lesions are being found in sheep
nationally, indicating the disease was probably present before the initial
outbreak in Heddon. We are still getting pockets of infection in sheep
which we cannot trace back to Heddon."
Dr Renton has been part of the MAFF team diagnosing and overseeing the
destruction of animals since taking on a case at Black Callerton,
Westerhope on 26 Feb 2001.
He said, "Along with a number of the veterinary surgeons involved, I have
serious doubts over the culling policies being adopted by Government, which
makes our work in this outbreak extremely harrowing," he said. "And from
day one MAFF has been terribly under-resourced to cope. I knew when I took
on case number 10 on February 26 that we were on the edge of a disaster and
it's being playing catch-up ever since."
MAFF said it was "unfortunate" one of its vets should choose to speak to
the press. "We will investigate this immediately," said a spokeswoman.
Although Mr Renton's contract with MAFF could be terminated by his decision
to speak out. Alternatively, it is unlikely he will lose his job because of
a shortage of replacement vets.
Until today MAFF has stuck to an official line issued by Agriculture
Minister Nick Brown that: "It is likely the outbreak originated at a pig
farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland."
But today a MAFF spokeswoman distanced the Government department from that
statement and claimed it had never said the outbreak "definitely started"
at Mr Waugh's pig farm.

UK winning animal virus fight -- Blair
--------------------------------------
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair says the program to eradicate foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) has "entered the home straight." Britain has culled more than
2 million animals in an attempt to rid itself of FMD and the average number
of new cases has dropped from 50 a day at the height of the epidemic to 8.
More than 1 500 cases in British livestock have been confirmed since it
first broke out in late February [2001, with 26 cases in the Netherlands,
2 in France and one in Ireland.
"We are getting the disease under control...but it is not over yet," Blair
told a news conference in his Downing Street office.
The government's chief scientific adviser, Professor David King, who for
some weeks has been predicting that the disease would be drawing to a close
by the summer, said he remained convinced the epidemic was "fully under
control." Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said evidence suggested the
disease peaked at the end of March. But the government was cautious. The
government had caught up with the backlog of dead animals awaiting disposal
in Devon, the county in southwestern England that was one of the
hardest-hit areas, Blair added.
Brown said the government expected to spend GBP 600 million (US $820
million) to compensate farmers for slaughtered animals. The Ministry of
Agriculture said 2.4 million animals had been slaughtered, with 59 000
still awaiting disposal. Another 100,000 animals were awaiting slaughter.
The number of animals culled represented 2.5 percent of the nation's herds,
Brown said.
Blair also praised the army which he mobilized to help dispose of the
carcasses. "It has probably been the biggest peacetime logistical challenge
that the army has faced," Blair said. "The scale of combating
foot-and-mouth disease has far exceeded, for example, the logistical
demands even of the Gulf War."

A fresh outbreak of foot and mouth in Somerset, an area declared free of
the disease 12 days ago, could be "very serious" and may spread to Exmoor,
a Ministry of Agriculture official warned yesterday.
Cattle at a farm in Wiveliscombe were confirmed as having the disease on
Wednesday. 2 other cases at nearby Shodden were confirmed in the past 2 days.
MAFF was trying to trace the movements of a self-employed agricultural
contractor, who has visited 15 farms in the area in the course of his work
in recent weeks, and may have unwittingly spread the disease.
Meanwhile, the local tourism industry was facing a bleak Bank Holiday
weekend. Plans to re-open some footpaths in Exmoor have been postponed as a
result of the outbreaks. All footpaths have already been closed for several
weeks.
Before the new outbreak Somerset had only had 1 previously confirmed case.
