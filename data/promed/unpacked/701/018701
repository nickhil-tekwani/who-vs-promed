With the investigation into an _E. coli_ outbreak at Cowans Gap State
Park apparently continuing, the Pennsylvania Department of Health had
no updates to report on Mon 15 Aug 2011.

At last count, there were 11 confirmed and 2 probable _E. coli_
O157:H7 infections linked to park's 42-acre lake, which has been
closed to recreational use since 9 Aug 2011. Thomas Hostetter, a press
aide with the department, said there were no new numbers to release
Monday [15 Aug 2011]. He said additional updates would be provided
whenever they are available.

Scott Gilbert, a spokesperson for Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,
said the hospital was treating 5 children for hemolytic uremic
syndrome Monday [15 Aug 2011]. A patient was discharged Friday [12 Aug
2011], and another came in the same day, he said.

The most recent case of HUS at the hospital is not being linked to
Cowans Gap, Gilbert said. There has been a total of 8 patients with
the syndrome since the outbreak was reported, with 5 reporting that
they swam in the lake.

[As pointed out by Dr. J. Richard Gould <RGould@avdha.nshealth.ca>, it
is indeed possible that the outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 associated with
the lake may not be related to swimming in the lake. At this point, of
8 patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome, only 5 swam in the lake.
Food eaten at the lake may also be the source.

With so many of the recognized cases having HUS, it is likely that
more cases just causing diarrhea or bloody diarrhea have occurred,
although a strain with more virulence could also do this. - Mod.LL]
