[1] Afghanistan (Uruzgan, Baghlan): 2 new cases

Officials in the Ministry of Public Health has said that 2 fresh positive cases of polio have been registered in southern Uruzgan [Oruzgan] and northern Baghlan provinces.

According to health officials, the families of the polio-affected children live in Dand-e-Ghori [Dahana-i-Ghori] and Khas Uruzgan districts, [respectively], and the areas were out of the government's control and deprived of medical facilities.

Dr. Abdul Qayum Khplwak, head of the medical institute for the southern part of Afghanistan, said that one of the 2 children has been deprived of polio vaccination in Khas Uruzgan district of the province. He said that despite tremendous efforts towards fighting polio, there are great obstacles against the implementation of the process.

"Until every child receives polio vaccination, our efforts would not reach a complete goal," he said, adding that "the fresh case in Uruzgan shows that southern provinces are facing serious polio threats."

Meanwhile, a local medical in charge for polio affairs in Baghlan, Marjan Rasikh, has put the age of the polio-affected child at 4 years old, saying that the case has marked the initial positive polio in the province.

Over 24 positive polio cases have been recorded from the beginning of 2019: more than 8 cases in Uruzgan, 5 in Helmand, 4 in Kandahar, 2 in Paktia, and 3 other cases in Badghis, Nangarhar, and Kunar provinces.

To prevent the positive cases of polio, the health officials said that anti-polio vaccination should be implemented across the country.

[The addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases will increase the total number of cases reported from Afghanistan with dates of onset during 2019 to 24. There was a newly confirmed case from Kandahar reported in last week's GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative) report with date of onset 10 Nov 2019.

Again, the common denominator in the occurrence of WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1)-associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases (presumed to be WPV cases) and in cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus)-associated cases is the presence of a significant susceptible population, or, in other words, areas with suboptimal vaccination coverages.

https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/unicef-who-philippines-polio-outbreak-situation-report-11-11-december-2019


Highlights
- 5 new human cases reported in the past week
- In response to 1st human vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) case from the island province of Basilan, in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), outbreak immunization was conducted in Maluso, Basilan, with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) against polio type 1, vaccinating 13 547 children under 10 years old (102% of the target).
- Currently 9 human cases confirmed with circulating VDPV type 2 (cVDPV2), 1 case with VDPV1, 1 case with cVDPV1, and 1 case with immunodeficiency-related VDPV type 2 (iVDPV2).
- A case with VDPV1 from Sultan Kudarat is pending genetic analysis; 1 case of cVDPV1 from Malaysia was confirmed as genetically linked to the Basilan case.
- Synchronized polio vaccination campaign conducted on [25 Nov 2019 - 10 Dec 2019] (including 2 days of extension) vaccinated 4 309 566 children under 5, which is 98% of the target total of 4.4 million children under 5. A total of 1 395 365 children under 5 were vaccinated in National Capital Region (NCR), which is 109% of the target, and 2 914 201 (94%) in Mindanao.
- DOH planning to conduct outbreak immunization with bOPV targeting 710 296 children under 10 in the Sulu Archipelago, Zamboanga City, and Lambayong, Sultan Kudarat, on [6-12 Jan 2020].
- Current polio outbreak resulting from persistently low routine immunization coverage, and poor sanitation and hygiene.
- Philippines is affected by both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. cVDPV is considered a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

cVDPV1
---------
- In response to the 1st human case confirmed with VDPV1 from Maluso, Basilan (BARMM), outbreak immunization was conducted in the area with bOPV for children under 10 years old, vaccinating 13 547 children under 10 years of age (102% of the target).
- A cVDPV1 case in Sabah state, Malaysia, was confirmed to be genetically linked to the Basilan case by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia. Since the 2 viruses are genetically linked, they are both classified as circulating.
- A new VDPV1 case from Sultan Kudarat (Region XII) was confirmed on [6 Dec 2019] and is pending further genetic analysis.
- All 13 cVDPV1 environmental samples found in Manila are genetically linked.

cVDPV2
---------
- All 9 human cases and 17 environmental samples confirmed with cVDPV2 are genetically linked. All human cases were reported from Mindanao (BARMM and Region XII), whereas environmental samples were found in NCR and Davao.
- All samples were tested by the National Polio Laboratory at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), whereas sequencing and genetic analysis is done at the NIID in Japan, and additional genetic characterization is provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

[Given the identification of the cVDPV1 case in Malaysia that is genetically related to the VDPV1 case in Basilan, it is now clear there are at least 2 separate cVDPV outbreaks in the Mindinao region of the Philippines: one of the outbreaks is associated with cVDPV2, and the other with cVDPV1 and one outbreak of cVDPV1 in the Manila Metropolitan area (although only environmental samples have been positive without AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases as yet.) What all these areas have in common is pockets of populations with suboptimal vaccination coverages. Clearly, we await further information on the genetic profiling of the newly identified VDPV1 case in Sultan Kudarat, also located in southern Philippines. Note that Basilan Island, Sultan Kudarat, and Sabah state in Malaysia, while all in the same general area, are not contiguous, each being on a different island. In. total, there are 11 cases of AFP in the Philippines that are attributable to infection with a VDPV.

[3] Pakistan: violence against vaccinators
Date: Tue 10 Dec 2019

https://menafn.com/1099397619/Pakistan-Female-polio-worker-among-two-shot-dead-in-Bannu


Two people, including a lady health worker (LHW), have been killed in a firing incident in Bannu, police said on Tuesday [10 Dec 2019].

According to police, the firing incident took place in Nazeem Bazaar in the limits of Basiakhel Police Station on Monday [9 Dec 2019] night. [The] health worker was travelling in a rickshaw when unknown armed men opened fire on her, leaving her and the rickshaw driver critically injured. Both were shifted to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital, where they succumbed to their injuries.

Police said the health worker was going for a polio vaccination campaign when she was targeted by unknown armed men. [She] was on duty at the camp for temporarily displaced persons (TDPs) in the Bakakhel area of Bannu.

The assailants escaped after committing the murder. Police cordoned off the entire area and launched a search operation. However, no arrest was made during the search operation.

A 3-day polio vaccination campaign kicked off in Bannu on [9 Dec 2019]. It was feared that the vaccination campaign may be affected due to the attack on the polio worker.

So far, 94 polio cases have surfaced in Pakistan this year [2019], out of which 22 cases have surfaced from Bannu. Nearby Lakki Marwat district stands 2nd with 19 reported polio cases, while Waziristan, in the similar region, has reported 8 cases. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has recorded 68 polio cases this year [2019]. In Sindh, 14 cases have been reported this year [2019]; 7 have been reported from Balochistan.

That figure depicts a sorry state of affairs as far as polio vaccination is concerned. Most of these cases have surfaced due to refusal of parents to administer polio vaccine to their children.

Currently, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries in the world that have not fully eradicated polio [wild poliovirus, WPV]. Vaccination efforts in these countries are often halted by refusing parents and security risks faced by polio workers. In Pakistan, the refusal issue was the main stumbling block in vaccination efforts, while attacks on polio workers and security personnel also happened in the past, but recently no such attacks were witnessed. Monday's [9 Dec 2019] attack on the LHW depicts the extremely difficult situation for the government, which has to ensure provision of polio vaccination to each and every child amid refusal of stubborn parents and security risks.

[What can one say . . . Unfortunately, it is a recurring cycle of violence against vaccinators in the more religiously strict areas where there are large amounts of rumors about the harm of the vaccines and periodic blocking of actual vaccination efforts. Killing a vaccinator is definitely one way of blocking the vaccination efforts. - Mod.MPP
