The war in Syria has forced many people to look for safety in Lebanon but there are now concerns about the farm animals the refugees brought with them. Since the conflict has disrupted the delivery of animal vaccinations in Syria, the risk of trans-boundary animal diseases across the border into Lebanon has increased dramatically.

Lebanon's agriculture ministry says large numbers of animals arrived from Syria without proper health checks and some Lebanese farmers have reported new diseases over the past 2 years. The most common disease is foot-and-mouth, which causes ulcers, but a new viral disease causing lumpy skin has also raised concern. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation says it has already killed several cattle.

It has been estimated that there has been a 60 percent increase in the quantity of livestock in Lebanon near the border with Syria.

There are more than 1.2 million registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

[FMD is in fact known to be circulating in Syria for years without being officially notified, as apparent from repeated introductions into neighbouring districts of northern Israel. LSD must have been present there at least since mid-2012, when it similarly penetrated the Golan and Zefat districts in northern Israel (and, most probably, Lebanon as well). The political situation in Syria, with mass movements of civilians and disruption of veterinary activities, are obviously behind the deterioration in animal (and public) health.

The Aljazeera video record included in the above report shows clinical cases of FMD and LSD in Lebanese cattle. The commentary mentions the risk to other regional parties, such as Iraq.

The most recent consignment of FMD samples was submitted from Lebanon to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright) in 2009 (serotyped A; see at <tp://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/leb.htm>). Sampling recent cases and submission of the samples to the WRLFMD, where serotyping and genotyping of the FMD virus involved are anticipated, is essential for the effectiveness of the Lebanese control activities (matching vaccines required) as well as for regional activities to prevent the spread of the disease. Results are requested. - Mod.AS
