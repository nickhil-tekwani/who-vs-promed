--------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to clarify a misunderstanding on the epidemiological description in the OIE report, which we will correct in the upcoming follow-ups and I beg pardon for this misleading info.

The 2nd dog was bitten on 2 Sep 2012; in the OIE report the date 17 Sep 2012 is misleading because this is the date when the farmer declared the case. The 2nd dog was euthanized on 17 Sep 2012 after the farmer notified the vet service.

Another misrepresentation in the report is that the 1st case apparently was not a common stray dog but a pedigree dog that most likely escaped from the original owner and wondered around. Up to now the original owner of this dog has not been found so it is impossible to get any clue on the exposure of the animal.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Mersini for the firsthand, transparent correction. The notification, now corrected, was included in ProMED-mail posting: Albania: canine, OIE 20121009.1331344.

It may be assumed that rabies circulates in wildlife in Albania; genotyping of the virus may be helpful in deciphering the epidemiological situation prevailing there. - Mod.AS]
