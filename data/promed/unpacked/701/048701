Grape mildew hits
---------------------
About 200 000 hectares [about 494 200 acres] of vineyards in Nashik and Sangli districts [Maharashtra] have been affected by the recent 'downy mildew' outbreak. Farmers have expressed grave concerns about the season ahead. The outbreak, say agriculture scientists and officials, took place due to the sudden fluctuation of temperature and humidity.

"It has affected the vegetative state. Growers would have to spend more money on pesticide to control the disease," said Dr SD Sawant, National Research Centre for Grapes (NRCG). However, things could have been much worse. "The NRCG has been issuing advisories about how to control the outbreak," he added.

"Grapes grown in Nashik are used widely in Netherlands and Britain. However, due to the inclement weather over the last few months, the grape exports have been hit," said the state agriculture department. Both grape farmers and wine industry have said the outbreak would affect table wines and grapes in the near future. "A large quantity of leaves have been affected, due to which the quality of fruit might be affected. It would also impact the size of the fruit," said the Maharashtra State Grape Growers Association (MSGGA).

Most growers have removed the infected leaves and sprayed pesticides.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Plasmopara viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become covered with white downy growth and turn necrotic. It can also affect flowers and fruits. Disease development is favoured by temperatures of 15 to 20 deg C (59-68 deg F) and moist conditions. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses. All commercial grape cultivars are susceptible, and the disease occurs irregularly in most grape growing regions worldwide.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications according to forecasting services. Systemic fungicides are also available.

Maharashtra produces most of the country's wine for export to Europe and the US. Serious outbreaks of grape downy mildew were reported previously in the state (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20121012.1338526 and 20090323.1138).
