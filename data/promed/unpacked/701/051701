[Since September 2009, when the current ASF epizootic started in
Russia, 76 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. Starting on the
border with Georgia, the virus has spread in a north-eastern
direction, eventually reaching the Rostovskaya oblast. All 36
follow-up reports, and a map showing all accumulated outbreaks, are
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462>.

Rostovskaya oblast borders Ukraine (see the map at the above URL);
all 9 outbreaks, reported above, are close to Ukrainian's Lugansk
oblast. It is fortunate but rather surprising that cases, in wild or
domestic swine, have remained, thus far, absent in Ukraine's
territories. Is surveillance applied? - Mod.AS]
