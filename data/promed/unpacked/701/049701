Anthrax is now a prime suspect behind a spate of heroin addict deaths in
Europe. Tests at Britain's lab for dangerous pathogens at Porton Down
have found signs of anthrax infection in the blood of two Scottish
victims. Nine more Scots are ill, and doctors fear that the disease --
which is hard to monitor among drug users -- may be far more=20
widespread.

"Heroin can contain almost anything, in small amounts," says Les King of
the Forensic Sciences Service, which analyses seized British heroin. But
no one checks it for infectious agents, he says. "There could be a long
history of this, and we just haven't observed it until now.

No one knew of a possible contaminant in heroin that could be to blame.
But now the spotlight is on anthrax, following the appearance of an
anthrax case history on ProMED, the Internet forum for emerging diseases.
Per Lausund of the Norwegian Army Medical School posted details of an
Oslo addict who died in April after injecting heroin into muscle. He
developed an abscess then fell into a coma 10 days [actually 3 days
later. After antibiotics failed to save him, tests showed anthrax bacilli
in his spinal fluid, which was confirmed by DNA analysis.

Now scientists at Porton Down have tested blood samples taken from five
Scottish victims. Two were positive for protective antigen, the main
anthrax toxin. "Nothing else would give that result," says Phil Hanna, an
anthrax expert at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, who says the
symptoms are also highly typical of anthrax. Chris McGuigan of the
Greater Glasgow Health Board adds that at least 1 apparent sufferer in
Scotland, who is still alive, has the black scab typical of localised
anthrax infection. Anthrax bacilli have not shown up in any of the
samples, but that does not rule out infection as antibiotics can wipe out
circulating anthrax bacilli, making diagnosis very difficult. Patients
can still die because of the circulating toxins.

As New Scientist went to press [Tuesday, the Glasgow Health Board was
still undecided. "We do not discount anthrax, but we have so far failed
to find the bacilli," cautions Dr. Syed Ahmed of the Health Board. They
are also considering necrotising fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease,
which has some similar symptoms [due to streptococcal toxins.

Anthrax is endemic in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, where most of
Europe's heroin originates. The National Institute of Public Health in
Oslo warns that further cases may occur elsewhere...

[The dead Norwegian addict's dealer is dead of as yet unrevealed causes,
and his brother, also an addict, is in hospital and helping the police in
their inquiries. Two addicts died in Malmo in the same time period; cause
of death is unknown. So far 2000 has been the worst year ever regarding
drug overdose-related deaths in Norway, with a total around 56 -- that is
11 or 12 above last year's total "to date". - Mod.MHJ

Dr Laurence Gruer, consultant in public health medicine at Greater
Glasgow Health Board, said: "We have been made aware of one intravenous
drug user in Norway who died in April from multi-organ failure caused by
anthrax infection. "As part of the investigations in Glasgow, we have
been pursuing this line of inquiry -- as well as other possibilities. To
date we have performed extensive blood and tissue microbiology testing on
all cases presented in Glasgow hospitals. All these tests have proved
entirely negative for anthrax infection." "We sent blood samples from
seven patients to the Centre for Applied Microbiology Research (CAMR) to
look for evidence of exposure to anthrax. Two of the samples gave a very
weak positive reaction. In the absence of any other positive results for
anthrax, the CAMR scientists concluded that these results are very
unlikely to be due to anthrax infection. In addition we have also been
testing for any microbiological or toxic substances in the heroin and
citric acid recovered by the police from various sources. All the test
results so far have been negative for traces of anthrax or any
significant toxin. When detailed analysis of this kind is undertaken, a
range of organisms can be found in heroin and further tests are ongoing
for conclusive results."

If a strange new epidemic is on the way, how will we know?

Anthrax and heroin. Could there be a more sensational mix of modern-day
nightmares? Yet there really are anthrax spores in some heroin in Norway.
They have killed at least one man and could be to blame for the worst
year the country's seen for deaths among addicts. Anthrax may also be
killing Scottish drug users. And, since virtually all Europe's supplies
come from Asian countries where anthrax is endemic, spore-laced heroin
might be scattered right along the drug's trade routes. And yet some will
say, so what? Junkies die young anyway. Anthrax is not communicable, so
the addicts are only harming themselves. All these deaths are personal
tragedies. But there is another reason to care about them: they tell us
whether we are alert to new diseases, and yes, even biological weapons.
So the news is not all bad. We caught this outbreak.

South-West Asia has been supplying Europe with heroin for more than a
decade. Why should anthrax only appear now? Most heroin comes from
Afghanistan, home to some of the Western world's arch-enemies. Maybe they
have suddenly started infecting their prime export, even if killing
addicts does seem a bizarre form of terrorism.

More likely, pure heroin was cut with a powder that included some
material from infected animals, which means this could have been
happening for years. But who bothers to autopsy dead addicts? Every few
months there is a surge in deaths which is blamed on overdosing with
unusually pure heroin, and no one looks further.

Except that this time someone did. Norwegian doctors decided to autopsy a
heroin addict who had died of a strange septicaemia, and were surprised
at what they found. Next came a series of events outside official
channels. In an informal Internet newsletter one doctor asked if anyone
else had found anthrax in heroin. At the same time, Glasgow hospitals
noticed more dead addicts than usual--with similarly strange symptoms.
The penny dropped. Otherwise, no one would have suspected anthrax.

So let us have more openness between people with information about
infectious diseases. True it's not always easy to share details when the
police call for silence while they track down suppliers and traffickers.
But as events over the past few weeks show, the more people talk, the
easier it is to spot patterns of disease.

Other European countries should check for infection. And let us continue
to investigate. Samples should be sent to American labs with the
wherewithal to tell us precisely where the anthrax strain came from.
Maybe it was an escapee from a weapons lab.

Paying more attention to what addicts die of will help to show which
pathogens are moving around the world, and how. Next time it might be
something even more malevolent.

[As drugs are adulterated at source, as well as throughout the
distribution chain, they certainly present a multidimensional danger. It
must be emphasised that whether the Scottish situation is due to their
heroin containing _B. anthracis_ is still unclear, though maybe less
likely. But now this genie is out of the bottle and we may well see one
drug lord spiking another's drugs to obtain a market advantage. Also, as
laboratory techniques now exist to determine the original growing area
for drugs as well as the specific pathogen strain or strains a comparison
between the two results will indicate whether the drug was spiked or
merely contaminated at source. - Mod.MHJ
