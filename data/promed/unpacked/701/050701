No. of outbreaks 3
Outbreaks:Location - region of Alentejo, Elvas district, Campo Maior

Outbreak no. / species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed /

* 101 sheep, 42 bovines and 19 goats
Diagnosis: the cases were laboratory confirmed on 23 or 24 Nov 2004 (the
virus genome was identified by RT-PCR(1)) and the infected farms were
informed on the same day.
Source of agent / origin of infection: epidemiological investigations are
being carried out to identify the source of contamination.
Control measures:
- quarantine;
- ban on the movements of animals of susceptible species in the area
surrounding the infected farms;
- protection and surveillance zones have been set up;
- insect traps are being used to monitor for the presence of vectors.
(1) RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction

[While we will have to wait to see whether this is same BT4 serotype
currently affecting Morocco and Spain, the geography argues strongly for
spread from the major outbreak in Spain. Whether this outbreak started in
Morocco is a very interesting question.
Nevertheless, the best guess is that this virus will act as it has in Spain,
and therefore Portuguese animal health officials will have their hands full.
In all probability, the outbreak, though serious, will be controlled more
effectively than the last Iberian outbreak in 1959, which resulted in
approximately 200 000 sheep deaths -- see references below, including
moderator comments. - Mod.PC]
