Where's the vaccine?
--------------------
The death of a 15 year old student brings to 9 the number of post-dog-bite fatalities since 1 Jan 2015. The Bali Provincial Health Service (Dinkes) has confirmed that a 15 year old junior high school student has died of rabies at the Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar. Quoted by the State News Agency, Antara, the chief of Dinkes, Ketut Suarjaya, said on Fri 5 Jun 2015, "I have received a report that a patient who has been bitten by a dog died in Sanglah on Thursday."

Against growing criticism over the depletion of VAR vaccine and the resulting inability to treat the large number of dog bite cases occurring each day in Bali, Suarjaya assured that steps are under way to quickly import the life-saving vaccine to prevent more deaths.

Official statistics kept by Dinkes now state 9 people have died after suffering dog bites during the period January to early June 2015.

[This statement communicates the alarm of the local Balinese population (and no doubt the tourist population) concerning the ineffective response of the local authorities to the increasing prevalence of rabies virus transmission from the animal population and an apparently inadequate vaccination response.

This report does not mention the concern expressed previously concerning the rapid death of one of several individuals bitten by a single dog. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
