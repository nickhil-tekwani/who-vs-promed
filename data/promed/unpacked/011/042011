Between 6 and 12 Sep 2019, 5 EU member states reported 9 West Nile fever [WNF] outbreaks among equids to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS): Germany (3), Austria (2), France (2), Hungary (1), and Italy (1).

Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of 12 Sep 2019, 6 EU member states reported 26 WNF outbreaks among equids: Greece (12), Germany (4), Italy (4), Hungary (2), France (2), and Austria (2). In addition, Germany reported 26 outbreaks among birds to ADNS.

[The above animal health-related information has been selected from a full WNF report published by ECDC, which was presented and discussed in ProMED-mail posting 20190915.6674499. ECDC's commentary mainly addressed the public health aspects of the reported events. Here we address WNF's animal-related aspects.

West Nile fever is an OIE-listed, mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses, causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness.

Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans. Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses.
