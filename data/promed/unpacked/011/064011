The Ministry of emergency situations in the Dzhidinskiy district of
the republic of Buryatia is applying control measures following the
identification of ovine brucellosis.
According to the directorate of Rosselhoznadzor [Federal Agency for
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance. - Assoc.Mod.NP], the 1st
case of infection in animals was been registered in April 2007.
Victor Smolin, deputy head of the directorate of Rosselhoznadzor,
informed that 132 brucellosis seropositive sheep have been detected.
No human cases have been reported.
The infection affected 4 collective farms in the villages Gegetuj and
Maliy Naryn. Over 1900 animals have been transported to a sanitary
slaughterhouse at a meat packing plant. The sanitary processing
continues today [8 June 2007]. Repopulation of the affected farms
will be possible after completion of disinfection. Surveillance
activities are to be continued.

[Buryatia (or the Buryat Republic), a member of the Russian
Federation, is situated in SE Siberian Russia, north of Mongolia,
extending between Lake Baikal and the Yablonovy mountains. Livestock
raising is one of the main economic activities of the 1.1 million
strong multi-ethnic population. See map at
<http://firntravel.ru/i/buryatia.1.gif>.
Most probably, the causal disease agent is _Brucella melitensis_, the
bacterium causing Malta fever (undulant fever) in humans. _B.
melitensis_ is prevalent in most Mediterranean countries where large
numbers of flocks of sheep and goats are infected, and also in
developing countries of Southwest Asia, central Asia, parts of Latin
America, and Africa, where it constitutes a serious human health
hazard.
Control of the disease needs an extended effort, combining the animal
and public health authorities. "Test and slaughter" method in small
ruminants may be applied but it is costly and difficult to perform if
infection is widespread. Most affected countries apply vaccinations
of the susceptible animals, which should be combined with
identification of the vaccinated animals. Selective culling might be
applied in tandem. The human infection rate may be reduced by the
pasteurization of dairy products and application of other prevention
and hygienic measures, particularly among the rural population. If
the slaughter of infected animals is permitted or imposed, special
measures should be taken to protect the personnel of the
slaughterhouse.
