A Perth council has issued a warning about mosquito-borne Ross River virus after it emerged that in the area more people have contracted the virus in the past 2 months than in all of 2011. In a statement today, the City of Cockburn said it had 62 reported cases of Ross River virus in the area since 1 Jan [2012], almost triple the 21 cases reported in 2011.

There has been a similar rise across the state in the past 2 months, with 511 cases state-wide since the start of the year [2012]. This is more than the total number of cases in all of 2010, when there was just 245. By the same time last year [2011], there was just 245 cases of the virus reported state-wide. [245 cases in each of these 2 years (2010 and 2011)?]

The number of cases of Ross River [virus infection] over the past 2 months have been the worst since the Department of Health's online records began in January 2008.

The City of Cockburn has warned residents in Atwell, Success, Hammond Park and Aubin Grove to take extra precautions in preventing mosquito bites, especially during sunset and for 3 hours after sunset.

The City's Environmental Health officers have carried out trapping adult mosquitoes across Cockburn to determine potential breeding sites and are taking action to reduce mosquito numbers and potential disease risk. Suburbs to the east of Thomsons Lake within the City are at the highest risk.

According to the Department of Health, symptoms can include skin rashes, sore and painful joints, tiredness, fever and headaches. It starts between 3 - 21 days after a mosquito bite, and can last for several months. Fever, nausea and skin rashes usually disappear within the 1st 2 weeks of the illness developing, but the joint, muscle and tendon pain can last for much longer.

There is no cure for Ross River virus, and the only prevention is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the disease. Ross River virus [transmission] is most active between September and May, and people living within 3 - 5 km [1-3 mi] of saltmarshes or brackish wetland are at greater risk.

[The report of record numbers of Ross River virus (RRV) infections so far this year (2012) is of concern. The 12 Apr 2011 ProMED-mail report (archive no. 20110414.1173) indicated that the Western Australia Health Department stated that 613 West Australians had contracted RRV infections since July of 2010. Because this year is the worst in Western Australia's history for this period of the year, one hopes that the citizens will heed the advice to avoid mosquito bites. RRV, an alphavirus, can also cause clinical disease (muscle and joint soreness) in equine animals.

The City of Cockburn, with a population of 91,313 (2010), is located in the southern suburbs of Perth in Western Australian, about 24 km (15 miles) south of Perth's central business district (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Cockburn).
