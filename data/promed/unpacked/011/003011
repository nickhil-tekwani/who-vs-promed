Epidemiological comments: meat and meat products from infected wild boars
are considered as the source of the disease spreading in the domestic
population.

121 out of 194 blood samples from cattle were tested and one positive
result by non-structural protein ELISA was obtained.

117 blood samples from sheep were tested and 14 positive results by
non-structural protein ELISA and Ag detection ELISA type O were obtained.

149 blood samples from goats were tested and 12 positive results were
obtained by non-structural protein ELISA and Ag detection ELISA type O.

22 out of 72 blood samples from pigs were tested and 8 positive results by
non-structural protein ELISA were obtained.

Stamping out of all susceptible animals will start on 11 Jan 2011 and will
finish on 12 Jan 2011.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; stamping out; quarantine;
movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of

[This is the 1st official report identifying the FMDV serotype involved as
O; genotyping results are awaited.

The source of infection in domestic animals, attributed to "meat and meat
products from infected wild boars" is in need of some clarification.
Domestic pigs, orally infected if/when fed with kitchen remains of such
products, may have been the link between wild boars and domestic ruminants.
This would have required at least one cycle of infection in the domestic
pigs prior to further spread to susceptible cattle, sheep, and goats, thus
the virus may have been circulating within the domestic animal population
earlier than the given start of the outbreak on 10 Jan 2011.
Epidemiological investigations into possible direct or indirect contacts
with other locations during the recent weeks is warranted. - Mod.AS]
