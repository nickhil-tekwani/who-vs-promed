An outbreak of anthrax has killed 30 Roan antelopes in the Kruger National Park. Spokesman William Mabasa said the carcasses were found at the weekend in an enclosure created for breeding. He said the park was trying to contain the situation.

"We are burning the carcasses and also vaccinating the other animals." He said the Roan antelope was a rare species. The park had about 100 before the outbreak.

[Anthrax is an enzootic problem in the Kruger National Park and has been there for decades. They work hard to identify carcasses and burn them whenever and wherever.

While roan antelope may be increasingly scarce in the wild, they are bred on wildlife ranches but subject there to tourist hunters. See:
