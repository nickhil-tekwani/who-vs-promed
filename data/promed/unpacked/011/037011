We observed a prolonged shedding of virus 14 and 28 days after
symptom onset in 2 patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza who
did not have immuno-depression and were treated with neuraminidase
inhibitor. This prolonged shedding was not associated with the
emergence of resistance mutation H275Y in the viral neuraminidase
gene. From 1 May 2009 until the beginning of October 2009, the
virology laboratory in Bordeaux received more than 1200
nasopharyngeal samples from the southwest of France for diagnosis of
influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection by real time RT-PCR, 186 of which
were found positive. For 5 pandemic H1N1 influenza cases, we had the
opportunity to monitor the duration of viral shedding and present
here 2 cases of prolonged shedding.

Case report A:

Case A was a man in his mid-50s with body mass index (BMI) less than
30 and without relevant medical history. He developed fatigue and
cough at the beginning of July 2009, shortly after his arrival to
France from California, United States (US). On the day after symptom
onset, he was admitted to the university hospital of Bordeaux with a
fever of 39.4 C and breathing difficulties. Values of partial
pressure of oxygen (PO2) and of carbon dioxide (PCo2) were at 7 kPa
and 5.6 kPa, respectively, and the patient was transferred to an
intensive care unit. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken and found
positive -- on day one after symptom onset -- for influenza A(H1N1)v
by real time RT-PCR, and a treatment with oseltamivir was initiated
at 150 mg/day. Since the patient's clinical condition improved
rapidly, he was transferred to the infectious diseases department on
7 Jul 2009. Oseltamivir treatment was continued, and the presence of
the virus was monitored via PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. The signal
remained positive during the following 5 days despite the patient's
excellent clinical condition; oseltamivir was replaced by zanamivir
on day 11. In 5 samples taken over the following 7 days, influenza
A(H1N1)v virus was still detected. The PCR was finally negative on
day 15, and the patient was discharged. In order to exclude an
immuno-depression, we investigated biological parameters including
IgG subclasses. Total IgG and subclass serum immunoglobulin levels were normal.

Case report B

Case B was a woman in her late 20s with a BMI greater than 40 who had
returned to France from holidays in Spain. On 25 Jul 2009, the day of
the symptom onset, she consulted the outpatient clinic of her local
hospital in France, where typical influenza symptoms were diagnosed.
After staying at home for 5 days, she experienced severe breathing
difficulties and was admitted to an intensive care unit. On 31 Jul
2009, RT-PCR for influenza A(H1N1)v was positive, and oseltamivir
treatment was started at 150 mg/day. In the following days, she
developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required
mechanical ventilation and subsequently extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO). The oseltamivir dose was increased to 300 mg/day
from 2 Aug 2009, and RT-PCR for influenza A(H1N1)v was positive in 13
samples (in deep respiratory secretions but, interestingly, not in
nasopharyngeal swabs) for 19 days and negative on days 31 and 34
after symptom onset. In the meantime, the patient fully recovered and
was discharged from the hospital at the beginning of September 2009.
No cellular or humoral immuno-depression could be diagnosed by
quantitation of IgG subclasses and B cell and T cell phenotyping.

Discussion

In 2 of our patients with confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza who were
treated with oseltamivir, the duration of viral shedding was
prolonged. As confirmed by RT-PCR, starting from symptom onset, the
shedding was 14 days in patient A and 28 days in patient B. For each
patient, the neuraminidase N1 gene was amplified from a positive
viral sample at the end of the shedding period and sequenced. No
H275Y resistance mutation associated with oseltamivir-resistance was observed.

Viral shedding of seasonal influenza A viruses is estimated to occur
over a period between 5 and 7 days [1]. In humans experimentally
infected with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus, oseltamivir
administration shortened the median duration of viral shedding from
107 to 58 hours [2]. Prolonged shedding of seasonal influenza viruses
has been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients even when treated
with antiviral drugs, potentially leading to the emergence of viral
resistant mutations [3-5]. Similarly, most patients with pandemic
H1N1 influenza infection may be shedding virus from one day before
the onset of symptoms until 5 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms
[6]. For infections with the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v virus,
prolonged viral shedding has been reported in immunocompromised
patients treated with oseltamivir, in association with emergence of
viral resistance to the drug [7].

Our observations, although limited to PCR detection without an
attempt to culture the virus, are noteworthy because long-term
shedding of influenza A(H1N1)v occurred in 2 patients without
immuno-depression, who were treated with oseltamivir and in whom the
virus did not develop resistance to the drug. However, it seems
plausible that prolonged viral shedding in our patients was more
likely to be associated with the rather severe clinical course in
both cases. We cannot provide data on how frequently prolonged
shedding for more than 7 days occurred in our series because we only
have the necessary data for a few patients. However, in some
non-severe clinical cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza where a
longitudinal study was undertaken, the viral PCR was negative within
5 to 7 days after symptom onset, which is clearly different from the
observation presented here.

[The prolonged shedding of virus from these 2 patients with normal
immune systems was not accompanied by the evolution of
oseltamivir-resistant virus despite prolonged administration of the
anti-neuraminidase. Virus shedding was detected by RT-PCR analysis
only, and the infectivity of the shed material has not been verified.
It may be that this atypically prolonged period of virus shedding is
a consequence of the generation of defective interfering virus
particles, which is a common feature of influenza virus replication
in vitro. It would be relevant to determine whether there was any
onward transmission of influenza to contacts of these 2 patients. - Mod.CP]

[2] UK - Pandemic analysis
Date: Thu 10 Dec 2009

The 1st flu pandemic of the 21st century is less lethal than experts
feared, killing only 26 out of every 100 000 people who became ill, a
study by the chief medical officer reveals today [10 Dec 2009]. But
1/3rd of deaths have been among healthy people who would not have
been eligible for vaccination under the present strategy. Sir Liam
Donaldson and colleagues say in their paper published online [in the
British Medical Journal, reference below] that vaccination may have
to be extended to a wider population than at present. An estimated
540 000 people have gone down with swine flu in England since a
pandemic was declared in July 2009, and there have been 138 deaths
where flu was confirmed as the cause.

In spite of the concern for children and young people, there has been
a particularly high fatality rate in the oldest age group, just as
there was in previous pandemics. The over-65s are less likely to get
flu, the results show, probably because they have been exposed to
other H1N1 viruses in the past, but if they get it, they are at
greater risk than most of us.

There are low numbers of deaths among the very young (9 in the
under-5s, 20 in the under-14s and 17 among 15- to 24-year-olds),
which may make it difficult to know how lethal H1N1 is proving to
them, says the paper in the British Medical Journal.

"The 1918-19 pandemic was characterised by high case fatality rates
among young healthy adults. There is no evidence of this from our
analysis of the current pandemic," says the paper. "Our estimate of
the case fatality rate compares favourably with those in the 3 20th
century influenza pandemics. The rate in the 1918-19 H1N1 pandemic
was 2-3 percent. Rates in the subsequent pandemics (1957-58 and
1967-68) were in the order of 0.2 percent." The case fatality rate in
the current pandemic is 0.026 percent.

There will be many different reasons for this, the study says.
Estimates in the past will have been less accurate than they are
today, and people may have died from other circulating viruses as
well as flu. Improvements in the food people eat, their housing and
healthcare may also make a difference to survival these days. Modern
intensive care treatment is a big factor. "Many more patients might
have died in England without the ready availability of critical care
support, including mechanical ventilation," it says.

2/3rds of those who died (67 percent) would have been eligible for
vaccination if it had been available, the authors say, because of
their age or a health problem such as asthma. But that leaves a 3rd
who would not have been vaccinated. "Our findings lend support to a
vaccination strategy that prioritises high-risk groups. They also
show that a substantial minority of deaths are occurring outside
these groups. Wider population vaccination, therefore, merits
consideration," they say.

Most of those who died (78 percent) were given antiviral drugs
(mainly Tamiflu), but only a quarter got them within the necessary 48
hours after symptoms appear.

Conclusions:
"Viewed statistically, mortality in this pandemic compares favourably
with 20th century influenza pandemics. A lower population impact than
previous pandemics, however, is not a justification for public health
inaction. Our data support the priority vaccination of high risk
groups. We observed delayed antiviral use in most fatal cases, which
suggests an opportunity to reduce deaths by making timely antiviral
treatment available, although the lack of a control group limits the
ability to extrapolate from this observation. Given that a
substantial minority of deaths occur in previously healthy people,
there is a case for extending the vaccination programme and for
continuing to make early antiviral treatment widely available."

This analysis does not consider the possibility of 2nd and 3rd waves
of infection, a possibility which is beginning to concern other
analysts. - Mod.CP]
