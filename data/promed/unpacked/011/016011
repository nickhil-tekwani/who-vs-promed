Tests are being conducted to determine if some gray bats in a cave near Springfield [southwest Missouri] are carrying a deadly fungus.

Researchers from Missouri State University discovered the possible fungus problem after capturing 44 endangered gray bats at Sequiota Cave.

Biology professor Lynn Robbins says the bats did not appear to have white nose syndrome (WNS), which has killed more than a million bats in eastern states. But he says some gray bat wings had discoloration that could indicate an infection.

The Springfield News-Leader reports (http://sgfnow.co/GZkDPw) samples were sent to the US Geological Survey's disease laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin. Robbins said it could take a few weeks to know if a fungus has reached Springfield. He says it would be big news in the bat world if the disease has reached southwest Missouri.

[Photos of gray bats (_Myotis grisescens_) may be found at http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/grba-photos.html and http://www.about-bats.com/gray-bats.html.

Missouri may be found on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/24MG.

The other reports of WNS have not indicated the wing issue. The description here seems different. We will be anxious for the report identifying the cause of the wing discoloration. - Mod.TG]

[The question being raised here is whether this is a manifestation of the WNS not previously described or if this is a different syndrome. The moderator and editorial decision has been made to keep this report under the ProMED-mail thread of WNS, with concerns about further geographic expansion within North America. - Mod.MPP]
