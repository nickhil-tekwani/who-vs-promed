["Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, vectorborne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope and various other _Artiodactyla_ as vertebrate hosts. Infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in a proportion of infected sheep, deer and wild ruminants. Infection of cattle with BTV does not usually result in clinical signs, with the exception of BTV-8 infection in Europe. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia in the absence of clinical disease. Clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, and erosion of the mucous membranes. However, in mild cases of the disease, a transitory hyperaemia and slight ocular and nasal discharge may be observed".
