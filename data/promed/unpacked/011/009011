Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, AP92 strain - Turkey
-----------------------------------------------------
Title: The first clinical case due to AP92 like strain of
Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus and a field survey
Authors: Kenan Midilli and 8 others

Abstract (provisional)
----------------------
Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection
is a fatal disease, but no clinical case due to the AP92 strain has
been reported. We described the 1st clinical case due to an AP92-like CCHFV.

Methods: A case infected by an AP92-like CCHFV was detected in the
Balkan part of Turkey. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR and
sequencing. Human serologic and tick [vector] survey studies were
performed in the region, where the case detected.

Results: 38 individuals out of 741 were found to be anti CCHFV IgM
positive. The attack rate for overall CCHFV [infection] was
calculated as 5.2 percent. In univariate analyses, CCHFV IgM
positivity was found to be associated with the age (p less than
0.001), male gender (p=0.001), agricultural activity (p=0.036), and
history of tick bite (p=0.014). In multivariate analysis, older age
(OR [odds ratio]: 1.03, CI [confidence interval]: 1.01-1.05, p less
than 0.001), and male gender were found to be the risk factors (OR:
2.5, CI: 1.15-5.63, p=0.020) for CCHFV infection.

Conclusions: This is the 1st human case with AP92-like CCHFV
infection. Furthermore, this is the 1st report of an AP92-like strain
in Turkey. In the region, elderly males carry the highest risk for
CCHFV infection.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe hemorrhagic fever
in humans with a case fatality rate of up to 50 percent. The
causative agent of CCHF is a tick-borne virus of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, genus _Nairovirus_. The virus is transmitted to
humans through infected tick bites, squashed ticks, or from direct
contact with viremic animals or humans. Outbreaks of CCHF have been
documented in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western
Asia where the vector and/or reservoir ticks of _Hyalomma_ spp. are
prevalent. Recent advances in molecular and biochemical analyses of
CCHF virus reveal that the virus encodes larger proteins compared to
other genera of the _Bunyaviridae_ and the processing of viral
proteins is complicated. CCHF viruses are relatively divergent in
their genome sequences and the viruses can be grouped in 7 different
clades. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the S-RNA and
L-RNA segments of CCHF viruses indicate that the seven clades
correlate with their geographical location.

Genetic analysis of CCHF viruses found throughout the Balkan
Peninsula, Russia, and Turkey have been grouped into 6 clades. The
exception is a Greek strain, designated AP92, isolated from ticks in
1976. Up to the present report this strain had not been associated
with human disease and was considered to be associated only with
inapparent infection.

The relevance of the report above is that an AP92-like virus has been
isolated for the 1st time in Turkey and in association with mild
illness. The new isolate has been designated AP92-like and further
analysis may perhaps reveal it to be a recombinant/reassortant virus.
