South Korea will soon remove most of the restrictions on farms affected by avian influenza since the 1st outbreak was confirmed earlier in the year, the government said on Wednesday [3 Sep 2014].

The de facto declaration of the end of the bird flu comes as the last confirmed case was reported on 25 Jul 2014, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. "The lockdown on all farms affected by avian influenza between 16 Jan and 25 Jul 2014 will be removed as of 4 Sept 2014," the ministry said in a press release. Since the 1st confirmed case was reported at a duck farm in Gochang [North Jeolla Province], about 300 km [about 186 miles] south west of Seoul, the country has slaughtered some 14 million animals, with the overall damage likely to reach billions of dollars.

The ministry, however, said it will maintain most of its quarantine measures. "The government plans to strengthen its preventive inspection of poultry farms within the affected areas while also increasing the number of clinical examinations," it said. The ministry earlier said it will begin year-round monitoring against avian influenza and designate special districts, mostly wintering homes for migratory birds, that will be subject to regular inspection and quarantine. The move followed the outcome of a government investigation that pointed to migratory birds from China as the most likely source of the animal disease.

[The role of migratory birds in the dissemination of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses has been subject to lively discussions in the past; hopefully, the results of the investigation that apparently pointed to migratory birds from China as the most likely source of the recent HPAI H5N8 epizootic in South Korea (and in Japan?) will be published.

The immediate notification and 5 follow-up reports submitted by South Korea to the OIE, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668. An interactive map showing all 29 outbreaks' locations is included.

It will be interesting to note if humans, in contact with infected birds, have been serologically tested. - Mod.AS
