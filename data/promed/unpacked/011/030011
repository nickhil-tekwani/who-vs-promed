Washington: first probable human case of West Nile virus infection
------------------------------------------------------------------
The mosquito bite on his knee was so red and swollen Darryl Baker pointed
it out to his mom and brother while they were bowling. He figured he had
gotten it in his back yard the night before, during a game of lawn darts.
But the 36 year old Yakima delivery-truck driver didn't figure the itchy
nuisance would lead to what state health officials yesterday said is very
likely the first human case of West Nile virus contracted in Washington.
Two rounds of tests at the Washington State Department of Health laboratory
in Shoreline came up positive for the potentially deadly virus, said health
secretary Mary Selecky. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
is conducting a more sophisticated test to verify the state's finding, with
results expected in 2 to 3 weeks.
Experts said West Nile virus is entering its peak season across the
country. Nationally this year, nearly 450 people have been sickened by the
virus, with 10 deaths reported. Colorado has been hit hardest, with almost
250 cases and 6 deaths. Last year, more than 4000 people were infected with
the virus and 284 died in the most severe outbreak since the disease was
detected on the east coast in 1999. Health officials warn this year's
numbers could go higher.
Washington is one of only 9 states with no confirmed human cases. In May, a
Tri-Cities-area man was suspected of West Nile virus infection, but further
tests ruled out the diagnosis. Health experts think the man had St Louis
encephalitis, a similar, mosquitoborne disease. Since then, the state
health department has improved its screening, with a test that can
distinguish between West Nile virus and St Louis encephalitis.
Like other states, Washington has been monitoring dead birds, particularly
crows, as a way to detect the presence of the virus. Last year, the virus
turned up in 2 dead crows. Two horses also came down with the disease. So
far this year, no animal cases have been detected.
