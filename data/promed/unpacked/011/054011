New strain of spinach downy mildew found in Salinas Valley
----------------------------------------------------------
A novel strain of the downy mildew that attacks spinach appeared in Salinas
Valley in July 2008, and if officially designated as a new race, it will
bring the total to 11. The downy mildew, _Peronospora farinosa_ f. sp.
_spinaciae_, continued to be a problem during September and October [2008]
on varieties previously resistant to it.

The disease was discussed by James C Correll, plant pathologist, University
of Arkansas. "There's been a rapid increase in the number of races in
recent years," he said. "We don't know exactly why this has occurred, but
it most likely has much to do with production practices. Many changes have
come in Salinas Valley to lettuce and spinach." These range from higher
plant densities to sprinkler irrigation that splashes spores. Seed of
organic spinach does not receive the typical treatment with fungicide, and
that may have also helped the introduction of novel strains.

Correll works closely with the International Working Group Peronospora
Committee which will meet in January 2009 to consider whether the new
strain should be officially designated as race ll. Meanwhile, spinach
breeders are working to incorporate as broad a resistance as possible in
anticipation of additional new strains.

Since spinach is a year-round crop in California, Correll said, the downy
mildew can easily find a new host after being carried by trucks, farm
equipment, or airborne spores. Spores can survive for as long as 10 years.

[Downy mildew caused by _Peronospora farinosa_ f.sp. _spinaciae_ (also
called blue mold) is often considered the most widespread and destructive
spinach disease worldwide. The fungus is specific to spinach and a few
weeds of the genus _Chenopodium_. It survives between crops as spores in
soil or mycelium on seeds. Symptoms include spots on the upper leaf
surfaces which can become necrotic and lead to distortions, and 'downy'
growth on the leaf undersides. Infected plants are unmarketable, their
taste is altered even when used as tinned food. Disease development is
favoured by cool, humid conditions and mostly occurs in young plants.
Spread within a crop may occur by mechanical means, wind and splashing water.

Disease management includes fungicides, crop rotation, and cultural
practices to minimise inoculum and reduce free moisture in the crop.
Previously, cultivars with single-gene resistance to a given pathogen race
were used. However, these cultivars are increasingly succumbing to new
races emerging in Europe, the Americas and Japan.

The downy mildew group of fungi includes many species in several genera
which cause similar symptoms on a range of hosts, including many crops.
Individual species usually have a narrow host range affecting only one or
few different hosts.
