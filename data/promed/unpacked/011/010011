Bird Flu Blow to Miyazaki
-------------------------
Some 410 000 chickens are expected to be culled over the next few days
in the prefecture. That comes after 20 chickens were found dead 23 Jan
2011, and a simple examination of 6 of the birds found 5 as being
infected by the H5N1 virus in the southern Japanese prefecture that's
famous for its agricultural produce, and one of the top producers of
poultry in the country.

The ongoing cull follows that of 10 200 chickens over the weekend
after 36 of the birds were discovered dead 21 Jan 2011 in a separate
farm 8.5km [5.3 miles] away. The government has ordered all birds and
eggs within 10km [6.2 miles] of the farms to be destroyed and has
agreed to deploy 170 members of the Ground Self-Defense Force to help
with the process. While the chickens culled over the weekend were
incinerated, the 410 000 birds doomed in the latest episode are simply
too many for incineration Â­- the bodies will be buried instead.

The new cases will fuel concerns after an H5N1 outbreak in Shimane
Prefecture in November 2010, the country's 1st case [in domestic
poultry] of [HPAI] in 3 years.

Still, Japan is not the only country in the region suffering from the
scourge of the poultry industry; South Korea's and China have
outbreaks also.

[The current outbreak in Miyazaki is the 4th since the start of this
epizootic on 29 Nov 2010. It has been promptly reported by Japan to
the OIE in follow-up report Number 5. See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10185>.

The report includes the following epidemiological comments:

"On 21 Jan 2011, a local veterinary officer visited a farm immediately
after notification from the farmer and collected specimens for
inspection. On 22 Jan 2011, Miyazaki prefecture confirmed the samples
were positive to influenza A subtype H5 by RT-PCR. All poultry kept in
the farm were destroyed by 23 Jan 2011.

"On 23 Jan 2011, the prefecture confirmed [that] samples collected in
another farm located at about 8.5 km away from the 1st farm were also
positive to influenza A subtype H5 by RT-PCR. All poultry kept in the
same site (12 henhouses) are being destroyed as susceptible animals.

"The National Institute of Animal Health confirmed [on 24 Jan 2011]
that an isolate from the 1st farm contained highly pathogenic avian
influenza [HPAI] viruses subtype H5N1. The virus is a closely-related
strain to the viruses isolated in Shimane prefecture, Toyama
prefecture and Kagoshima prefecture. An isolate from the other farm is
being tested.

"Movement restrictions have been instituted within 10 km around the
1st farm since 21 Jan 2011, and within 10 km around the other affected
farm since 23 Jan 2011."

Since 16 Dec 2010, 5 H5N1 foci of infection have been reported in wild
birds, stretched throughout Japan; a summary of this wildlife event,
reported separately and including an interactive map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10072>. The
most recent case was covered in follow-up report Number 3, submitted
to the OIE on 25 Jan 2011. It includes the following epidemiological
comments:

"On 19 Jan 2011, a weak whooper swan was detected near a swamp in
Hamanaka-cho, Hokkaido. On 22 Jan 2011, Hokkaido University confirmed
that an isolate from the bird contained HPAI virus subtype H5N1.

"In addition, on 23 Jan 2011, the university confirmed that 4 other
dead wild birds (2 whooper swans, 1 northern pintail and 1 wild duck
(_Aythya_ genus) collected near the swamp between 12 Jan 2011 and 19
Jan 2011 were also positive to HPAI subtype H5N1.

"There are 4 poultry holdings within 10 km around the swamp. Hokkaido
confirmed there was no case in the holdings." - Mod.AS]
