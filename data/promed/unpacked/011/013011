[1] HPAI H5N1: poultry, Herefordshire, preventive medication of in-contact personnel
Date: Mon 24 Jan 2022

All chickens, geese and ducks at a Herefordshire small farm will be killed after bird flu was found at the site.

It is the 3rd site in Herefordshire where bird flu has been confirmed this winter, with the other farms in Shobdon, near Leominster, and Clifford, near Hay-on-Wye.

Dr James Chipwete, consultant in communicable disease control with the UKHSA in the West Midlands, said: "The A(H5N1) strain is highly pathogenic to poultry and other birds, which is why it is important that poultry owners stick to the Defra [Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] guidance.

"While the risk to human health is considered very low, it is possible for humans to catch the virus through close contact with an infected bird, dead or alive.

"Therefore, it is very important that people do not touch birds infected with avian flu, their carcasses, droppings, bedding or eggs -- and infection control measures may be necessary if they do.

"As a precaution, the farm workers who have been in contact with the infected birds have been given a course of antiviral medication and are undergoing close monitoring for 10 days from last contact with infected birds."

[According to DEFRA's recent, 11th update of the avian influenza outbreak assessment (the source of item 2), published 24 Jan 2022, 3 new outbreaks in domestic poultry have been reported in the UK since their previous update of 17 Jan 2022. One outbreak affected a commercial turkey premises in Cheshire, England while the other 2 outbreaks occurred in backyard premises, one in Herefordshire, England (covered in the above media report) and one in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The circulation of the virus in wild birds was continuing (see commentary of item 2).

There have been no further HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Northern Ireland since 17 Jan 2022. - Mod.AS]

Conclusion
----------
Cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds and outbreaks in poultry continue to be reported across Europe and also in GB since our last assessment [17 Jan 2022]. Total numbers of migrating wild water birds (ducks, geese, and some swan species) will now have peaked in GB and the majority of wintering water birds have now arrived.

There have been 537 confirmed cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds in GB to 24 Jan 2022 across a range of species, including a significant number of resident sedentary birds of species such as mute swan, Canada goose and some raptors indicating that they had been exposed to infection in GB itself. Furthermore, potential bridging species such as gulls, pheasants and some raptors have tested positive.

In continental Europe, corvids and sparrows which could also serve as bridging species continue to be reported as infected. A recent European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) presentation reported that between 15 Sep and 1 Dec 2021, 219 poultry HPAI outbreaks were reported across Europe (and the UK). Of these, 35% had been observed in fattening turkeys, compared to 9% during the same time period in 2020, with a large increase also observed in broilers, representing 15% of outbreaks in 2021 compared to 6% in 2020. The majority (198) of poultry HPAI outbreaks in this period were reported from commercial farms, 78 of which did not have outdoor access and raises concern regarding the stringency of applied biosecurity measures.

Further virus detections are expected across northeast and southeast Europe over the coming months, following incursions from migratory waterbirds, with the epizootic potentially extending the southern and western limits observed in previous seasons.

The increased rate of HPAI detection in the greylag and barnacle goose initially observed in the 2020/21 season has continued into the 2021/22 season. In light of this, EFSA is currently in the process of revising the list of target species for passive surveillance in wild birds.

More wild bird HPAI H5 infections are expected in sedentary species and potential bridging species in GB. HPAI H5 will continue to circulate in both susceptible migrant water birds and sedentary bird species within GB over the next few months, with a greater number of events likely to be observed around water bird wintering sites. The risk level of HPAI H5 in wild birds is therefore maintained at VERY HIGH across GB. The risk of exposure of poultry across the whole GB is maintained at MEDIUM (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied, and at HIGH (with low uncertainty) where biosecurity is suboptimal. This assessment takes into consideration the Avian Influenza Protection Zone (AIPZ) and assumes that bird keepers are taking the additional biosecurity measures required.

[According to DEFRA's updated assessment, in continental Europe, since 17 Jan 2022, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia reported further outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 and Spain reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 in domestic poultry of the current HPAI season. Wild bird HPAI H5 cases continued to be reported, since the previous assessment, in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia and Slovenia. The highest number of cases was reported in Denmark (38) which included a single case of HPAI H5N8. Cases of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds have been reported in Latvia for the 1st time this HPAI season.

The DEFRA Outbreak Assessment includes also the following:
1. Map 1, "HPAI H5 outbreaks in poultry and captive birds across the United Kingdom, October 2021 to 24 Jan 2022."
2. Table 1: "Poultry and captive bird outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in Great Britain since 1 Oct 2021, as of 22 Jan 2022 (a total of 79 outbreaks)."
3. Map 2: "HPAI H5 cases in wild birds across Great Britain October 2021 to 24 Jan 2022."
4. Table 2: "Wild bird species in Great Britain that have tested positive for HPAI H5 as of 24 January 2022."
5. Map 3: "HPAI outbreaks (from OIE) in poultry, captive, and wild birds across Europe, September 2021 to 24 Jan 2022" (flyways presented).
6. Table 3: "Current outbreaks (to 24 Jan 2022) of HPAI H5 in domestic poultry and cases in wild birds since 1 Oct 2021 in Europe according to OIE report date" (31 countries including the UK).

The current wave of HPAI H5N1 has spread, since October 2021, from Asia into Europe, Africa and, recently, North America (wild birds, 3 locations). FAO/EMPRES global map presenting the global distribution of AIV with zoonotic potential (H5N1 in red), observed since 1 Oct 2021 and as of 26 Jan 2022, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/img/map1_2022_01_26.jpg.

Other AIV with zoonotic potential, presented on the map, are the HPAI viruses H5Nx and H7Nx, and the LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) viruses are H5Nx, H6N1, H7Nx, H9N2, H10N7 & H10N8. - Mod.AS
