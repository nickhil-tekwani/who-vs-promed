BSE Case Confirmed In British Columbia
-----------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the
diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a mature dairy
cow from British Columbia. The animal's carcass is under CFIA
control, and no part of it entered the human food or animal feed systems.
Preliminary information indicates that the age of the animal (66
months) falls well within the age range of previous cases detected in
Canada and is consistent with the recognized average incubation
period of the disease. This signifies that the animal was exposed to
a very small amount of infective material, most likely during its 1st
year of life.
An epidemiological investigation directed by international guidelines
is underway to identify the animal's herd mates at the time of birth
and the pathways by which it might have become infected. All findings
will be publicly released once the investigation concludes.
Canada has a suite of robust BSE control measures which exceeds the
recommended international standards. Assessment of Canada's programs
by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has resulted in a
recommendation for recognition as a controlled risk country. The OIE
categorization process is based on an evaluation of the comprehensive
set of risk mitigation measures implemented by a given country.
Canada has taken all necessary measures to achieve the eventual
elimination of BSE from the national cattle herd. The enhanced feed
ban, which comes into effect on 12 Jul 2007, will prevent more than
99 percent of potential BSE infectivity from entering the Canadian
feed system. The CFIA expects to detect a small number of cases over
the next 10 years as Canada progresses towards its goal of
eliminating the disease from the national cattle heard.
The British Columbia animal was identified at the farm level by the
national surveillance program, which has detected all cases found in
Canada. The program targets cattle most at risk and has tested about
160 000 animals since 2003. The surveillance results reflect an
extremely low incidence of BSE in Canada.
It is not unexpected to find BSE-infected animals born after the feed
ban. This has proven to be the case in most other countries with
targeted surveillance programs similar to those in Canada.

[Certainly, the surveillance plan is working. The new feed ban
measures should help decrease the number of cases. For a map of
