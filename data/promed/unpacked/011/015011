An outbreak of bovine rabies in Villa Imperio, Arbieto municpality [Cochabamba Department, Bolivia], has been confirmed and now a vaccination campaign is planned in a radius of 200 kilometers [about 124 miles] with immediate action to prevent the spread, the communications officer of the Agricultural Departmental Service (SEDAG), Romer Aguilar, reported. He said the municipality of Arbieto and the Government prepared, for today, about 275 doses as a preventive measure to rule out any possibility of spread [of the virus].

Laboratory results confirmed the outbreak of bovine rabies thanks to the animal owner promptly reporting symptoms in one of his animals. According to laboratory results, it is presumed that rabies could be transmitted by the bite of a wild animal; the bat is not ruled out. Aguilar said that after the detection of the outbreak the animal was slaughtered and the head was taken to a laboratory for further investigation, while the body was buried under sanitary measures.

"The evaluation of veterinary doctors at SEDAG has indicated that perhaps this is the case of a single bite," he said, ruling out the possibility that other cattle are infected, but he left open the possibility of vaccinating more animals.

[Presumably the "275" doses of vaccine are to protect other animals in the affected herd and immediate neighbours. Significantly more will have to be mobilised to provide a 200 km radius protection. When they talk about a bat source, they mean vampire bats, which are a constant source in Bolivia.
