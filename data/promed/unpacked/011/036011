Anthrax Epidemic Reported in Tajik Pamirs.
DUSHANBE - An anthrax epidemic has been reported from several villages of
the Tajik Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region. Over 30 residents of the
Rushan village, the epidemics epicenter, were taken to hospital, according
to the Tajik Health Ministry.
The epidemics started after local residents ate meat and milk of animals
suffering from anthrax.

[This arrived after I had posted yesterday's communication and largely
repeats the earlier information. However please note the additional
information -- "several villages" involved with Rushan as "the epidemics
center". The English used is confusing in that 'epidemics' (plural) is used
throughout the announcement, while an 'epidemic' (singular) was reported at
the beginning. Also it is most unusual to contact anthrax from milk,
because of its low pH, and that vegetative cells, which may be in the milk
initially when the cow/ewe/nanny goat is milked, would not survive passage
through the
stomach. - Mod.MHJ
