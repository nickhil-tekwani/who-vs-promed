At least 43 cases of shigellosis (primarily _Shigella sonnei_ group D) have been diagnosed among the Observant Jewish community in Borough Park and Williamsburg in the borough of Brooklyn since 14 Nov 2014, according to the New York City Health Department. Young children are primarily affected, with 79 per cent of case-patients under 6 years old.

Health officials say outbreaks of shigellosis have occurred in this community every 3-5 years since the 1980s. Some outbreaks have involved hundreds of cases. The Health Department recommends strict handwashing after using the toilet, after diapering, before eating, and before preparing food. Young children should not attend daycare when they are ill. Children with shigellosis should not return to daycare until their symptoms resolve, and 2 stool specimens obtained at least 24 hours apart are negative for shigella by culture.

New York City health officials say all isolates to date from this outbreak are resistant to ampicillin, and a third are resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

Shigellosis is an acute bacterial disease of the intestines caused by several species of the bacterium, _Shigella_. It is typified by loose stools, frequently containing blood and mucus (dysentery), accompanied by fever, vomiting, fever, vomiting, cramps and occasionally toxemia. It can cause bacillary dysentery because of the invasive ability of the organism that may result ulcerations and abscesses of the intestines.

This diarrheal disease is found worldwide with the vast majority of cases and deaths being in children. Outbreaks usually occur where there are crowded conditions and where personal hygiene is poor: prisons, day care centers and refugee camps are 3 examples. It is transmitted primarily by fecal-oral person to person means. It can also occur through contaminated food or water. Those primarily responsible for transmission are people who fail to wash their hands thoroughly after defecation. Because shigella is resistant to gastric acid, a person can be infected with as little as 10 organisms.

Indiana State health officials continue to see an increase in shigellosis cases reported in Indiana, especially in the central portion of the state. Shigellosis is a contagious illness that causes symptoms such as abdominal cramping, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Around this time in 2013, about 100 cases had been reported statewide. This year, 2014, that number is more than 1000. "Shigellosis has a cyclical trend, so we would expect to see an overall increase in cases some years," said state health commissioner Jerome Adams, MD, MPH. "This year, 2014, we have seen a strong association with younger children, which has helped drive the outbreak and significantly increased the number of cases."

[Shigella was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
