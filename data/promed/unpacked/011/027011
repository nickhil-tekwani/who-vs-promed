Four Cases of Bovine Rabies Detected In Alajuela Farm

At least 4 cases of bovine paralytic rabies were detected in a farm
located in Alajuela, specifically in Amparo de los Chiles, in the
northern zone of the country.

Facing the situation, the Servicio Nacional de Salud Animal (SENASA) -
National Animal Health Service - established quarantine at the farm
and is in the process of the capture of vampires.

In addition, authorities are looking at neighboring farms in search of
more animals that may have been affected.

The SENANA believes the animals will be protected with a vaccination
and SENASA officials will be providing training about the disease and
preventive measures to take.

Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of
warm-blooded animals, including humans, creates incoordination,
difficulty walking, drooling, and starts a paralysis of the legs that
prevents rising, twisting of neck and finally causes death.

[Vampire bats are distributed in tropical areas of the western
hemisphere from Argentina to Mexico, and have been responsible for
transmitting rabies virus most frequently to cattle and equine
animals, and infrequently to humans [by bite]. Of the 3 vampire bat
species, _Desmodus rotundus_ is by far the most common rabies virus
transmitter.

There are 2 options for rabies control in these situations --
vaccination of animals upon which the vampire bats feed, or reduction
of the vampire bat populations or perhaps a third option would be a
combination of the 2 approaches. Eliminating vampire bat hosts is the
fastest and most effective approach when vampire bat-transmitted
rabies appears in an area. In areas where repeated vampire
bat-transmitted rabies occurs, control of these bats has been employed
in some countries. Controlling vampire bats by eliminating their
roosts is extremely difficult because these roosts can be hard to
find. Effective vampire bat control has been accomplished by capturing
bats in mist nets when they come to feed on livestock, and applying
anticoagulant jelly (warfarin and similar products), which they and
their roost-mates ingest on grooming.

Clinical signs of rabies in cattle may include evidence of
neurological disease, loss of coordination (especially in hind legs),
excessive salivation, anorexia, tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness, dyspnea,
aggressiveness, and in some cases, diarrhea and pneumonia. Rabies is
preventable in cattle with a vaccine.

The paralytic form of rabies is first manifested by paralysis of the
throat and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and
inability to swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs.
Owners frequently examine the mouth of dogs and livestock searching
for a foreign body or administer medication with their bare hands,
thereby exposing themselves to rabies. These animals may not be
vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The paralysis progresses rapidly
to all parts of the body, and coma and death follow in a few hours.
The latter is very much what seems to be happening with the livestock
described above.

Rabies is known to be transmitted by the 'bite' of the vampire bat
because the virus resides in the saliva. Rabies is identified through
testing of the brain of a deceased animal.

Rabies can pass from bovines to people, but the animal must bite the
person or the person must have contact with saliva of the animal and
it must enter the human body, through a cut, scratch, the mucus
membranes of the eye, the nose, or the mouth. So it is not casual
contact that will infect the person. The bovines usually have a
distinctive bellow when they are infected with rabies. Although this
is not a diagnostic quality, it is unusual enough that many
veterinarians recognize it. Nevertheless consumption of diseased
animals is not recommended.
