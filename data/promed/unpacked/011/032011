[2] Media report: increase in MERS-CoV transmission

Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry on Monday [27 Oct 2014] urged residents of the world's top oil exporter to renew precautions against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) after a rise in new cases of the disease since early September [2014].

The Health Ministry has announced a total of 23 confirmed new cases this month [see comment below] of the virus, which causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia. In addition to the 12 cases detected in September [2014], this brings the total number in the kingdom to 777 since it was identified in 2012, of which 331 died.

Other cases have been found elsewhere in the Middle East, in European countries, the Far East, and in the United States, but many of those were found in people who had traveled in Saudi Arabia.

"The Health Ministry... urged adherence to preventative measures to curb the spread of the disease, and to avoiding contact with infected camels, and an emphasis on measures to combat infection in health facilities," said a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

The increase in cases in October [2014] has been evident across the country, Health Ministry figures show, with 7 confirmed cases in Riyadh, 6 in Mecca, 5 in Taif, and 1 each in Medina, al-Jouf, Najran, Hofuf, and Jubail. 3 of the new cases were health workers.

Scientists are not sure of the origin of the virus, but several studies have linked it to camels and some experts think it is being passed to humans through close physical contact or through the consumption of camel meat or camel milk.

The disease can then spread between people, and the largest previous outbreaks, including one in Jeddah in April and May [2014] that infected hundreds, have been linked to poor infection control procedures in hospitals.

International health monitors had worried that the disease might be spread abroad through the haj pilgrimage, which took place early this month [October 2014] in Mecca.

Saudi authorities said at the end of haj that they had not detected any new cases of MERS among pilgrims, but of the new cases confirmed in October [2014], 7 were in the pilgrimage centers of Mecca and Medina and 5 in nearby Taif, which many pilgrims also visit.

[3] Saudi Arabia: Taif outbreak and control - MOH 27 Oct 2014

Further to the previous statement issued by the Ministry of Health on the registration of cases of MERS-CoV in Taif, the Ministry [revealed that sporadic cases of MERS-CoV infection are occurring, highlighting] the importance of adherence to preventive measures to curb the spread of the disease, and [avoid] contact with infected camels, as well as an emphasis on infection control measures in health facilities.

The ministry showed that it has completed the review and implementation of all precautionary and preventive measures to reduce the spread of infection in health facilities in the province of Taif, where the renal dialysis unit of the King Faisal Hospital urgently added 20 additional chairs to ease the load at the dialysis unit at the King Abdulaziz Hospital center, which absorbed about 1/3 of the patients.

The actions included a sampling of all the patients in the kidney dialysis units of the kidney King Abdulaziz Hospital; to make sure they did not have MERS-CoV, with daily monitoring of vital signs of all dialysis patients, and measures directed regarding visits to patients.

In addition, the ministry has the support of Health Affairs in Taif with the operation of a mobile laboratory unit at the King Faisal Hospital, which will enable rapid access to results on MERS-CoV testing and also included measures to do more hands-on training for health workers on infection prevention methods.

The statement added that the Ministry is coordinating the transfer of all confirmed cases [of MERS-CoV] to King Faisal Hospital, which had previously been identified as a referral hospital for the treatment of MERS-CoV patients in Taif. Modifications were made in the hospital 'coronavirus' ward to ensure the isolation of suspected cases from confirmed cases.

The ministry revealed that 6 of the reported/confirmed cases in Taif were patients who underwent dialysis at the King Abdul Aziz Taif Hospital. The 1st of the cases there was related to exposure to camels, in addition there were 2 cases (2 female healthcare workers at King Faisal Hospital), and the rest of the cases contracted the disease as a result of contact with camels.

The statement concluded that everyone needs to adhere to [published] health guidelines for the prevention of MERS-CoV, and the need to take preventive measures to reduce infection when dealing with camels and avoid contact with MERS-CoV infected individuals.

[With the additional 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed today [27 Oct 2014] the total number of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now at 779 including 331 deaths. The most recent reported cases occurred in Riyadh and Jeddah, one of the cases (the case in Riyadh) had no known high-risk exposures although she does have pre-existing co-morbidities. The other case may have had exposure in the healthcare environment as the report states 'contact is currently under investigation'. Of note, this is the 3rd case reported in Riyadh in the past 2 days, suggesting there may be some transmission chains ongoing in Riyadh as well as in Taif. As mentioned in an earlier post, Taif, at an elevation of 1879 meters (6165 feet) is the summer retreat for the Saudi government as it is much cooler. It is located in Mecca province (Makkah) on the slopes of the Sarawat Mountains. The hottest months in Riyadh are April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, with October being the wettest month of the year (http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Riyadh,Saudi-Arabia). One can't help but wonder if there is a relationship between the activity in Riyadh and the activity in Taif.

The media report in [2] highlights the geographic distribution of cases reported during October 2014. On reviewing the prior MOH reports, as of today, 27 Oct 2014, there have been 25 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed during the month of October 2014, including 10 deaths. During the month of September 2014 there were 12 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed and 4 deaths reported. In contrast, during the month of August 2014 there were 5 cases confirmed and 4 deaths reported, and during the period 11-31 Jul 2014 there were no new cases confirmed, and 3 deaths reported (see prior ProMED posts listed below for further details).

The Ministry statement in [3] suggests that there were 6 cases of MERS-CoV infection in Taif that occurred through exposure in the renal dialysis unit. As a reminder, of the 17 reported cases in Taif since the beginning of September 2014, (which included 5 deaths -- case fatality rate 29.4 per cent), 4 (23.5 per cent) were in healthcare workers; 4 (23.5 per cent) had a history of exposure to camels/consumption of camel milk or lived near camel farms; 3 of the cases (17.6 per cent) were stated to have become infected while in the healthcare environment, and the remaining 6 (35.3 per cent), while there was no history of currently accepted high-risk exposures, all 6 had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, suggesting they may have had contact with the health sector for their co-morbidities and, during those contacts, may well have been exposed to other MERS-CoV infected individuals. Hence, I presume that at least 3 of the 6 individuals originally reported as not having high-risk exposures were among those now identified as having had exposure in the renal dialysis unit.

One hopes that case-control studies are under way to better identify risk factors for infection in this current increase in MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia.
