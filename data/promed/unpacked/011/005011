[This report represents an expansion of territory for the BTV-8
serotype into Spain, which has traditionally dealt with other
Bluetongue serotypes i.e. BTV-1 and BTV-4. It will be absolutely
fascinating to see how quickly this serotype spreads. The question of
how the infection arrived in Spain is also critically awaiting an
answer as there is quite a geographic gap between it's previous
distribution in France and the northern coast of Spain where it has
been newly identified.

Whittmann, Mellor and Bayliss published an interesting paper which
used BT-1 data in 2001. It indicated that Culicoides distribution can
be best predicted by the following climatic factors: minimum of the
monthly minimum temperatures, maximum of the monthly maximum
temperatures and the number of months per year with a mean
temperature 12.5 DEG C (54.5 DEG F). A similar analysis for the
spread of BT-8 could be instructive. See
<http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/RT/2003/WITTMANN.PDF> for the complete paper.
