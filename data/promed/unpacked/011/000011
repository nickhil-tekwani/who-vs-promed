As someone who spent 11 years supervising local disease reporting, I think
I can respond to the comments about the length of time between onset of
disease and national report for this plague case. Local disease control
staff are overwhelmed with paperwork as well as understaffed. (We all know
there is little budget dedicated to prevention and especially health
department prevention.) Having ascertained that there is no concern that
there would be transmission from the reported case to others and
comfortable that the source of that patient's infection is not out of the
ordinary, there would be no urgency to get the paperwork from the lab and
assemble all the information to be sent off to the state. In fact, the
paperwork might be left hanging while a few details of the case, required
on the report, are collected. Finally, I don't know about automation in
Arizona, but if the local report is not sent by computer, the state must
enter the information to send it on to CDC. Local staff are very effective
in reacting quickly to stop transmission of diseases with concern about
person-to person transmission or to find a source of disease that poses an
ongoing risk. This is the primary focus of their work.
To respond to the comment about terrorism, I would say that effort always
is made to find the source of infections. If there is a question about the
source or there are disassociated cases this would raise an alarm and the
process would move forward much more quickly, although the paper report
would still be slow. There would be a telephoned report and the
information would be transmitted widely. Or, to put it another way,
disease control is usually carried out quickly and efficiently. The
paperwork that accompanies it is much slower.

[While we have every sympathy with local staff and their paperwork burden,
we are not convinced. As soon as the lab report comes back positive,
someone in the local health dept. knows and reports to someone higher up,
*in writing.* Why not just fax a copy of that to State & from there to CDC
to WHO? Local cases are not only of local concern. As Ron St John of
Health Canada has pointed out before on ProMED-mail, they are in the
business of alerting Canadian tourists to the American Rockies that they
may be exposed to plague -- the last thing any Canadian expects to face on
his or her US holiday. Other countries may share the Canadian view -
