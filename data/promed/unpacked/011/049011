Putative filariosis outbreak in white and black rhinoceros at Meru National Park in Kenya
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By: Mutinda et al. (Parasites & Vectors 5: 206)

Habitat and food supply loss and disruption, together with man's pursuit of the animal's unique horn pose significant threats to the charismatic rhinoceros. Filarial worms have been thought to cause cutaneous lesions in black rhinoceros (_Diceros bicornis_) in Kenya and South Africa, but never in white rhinoceros (_Ceratotherium simum_) in the wild, despite the fact that the 2 species live often in close proximity.

_Stephanofilaria dinniki_ has been implicated in the past as the causal agent for such lesions. In this paper we report a putative filariosis outbreak in both black and white rhinos at Meru National Park in Kenya. A total of 4 black and 5 white rhinos were affected by various degrees of filarioid-like lesions, while apparently all sympatric wild and domestic animals were filarial worm-free.

Affected rhinos were captured and successfully treated. Comparison between the epidemiological aspects of white and black rhinoceros filariosis, and the possible relations between this outbreak and annual seasons, the presence of oxpeckers and other host species are discussed.

Our study highlights (i) that filarial infection is not restricted to black rhinos, but it affects both rhinoceros species, and (ii) the importance of the earlier detection and immediate treatment (capture-treat and release) of filarioid infections, which is of pivotal interest for wildlife conservation, and especially the endangered and isolated white and black rhinoceros populations.

The images showing the lesions are quite impressive. It is a pity that they failed to collect the worms surgically and that they did not find any in the histopathological examination of the skin samples taken. The life cycle of
_S. dinniki_ is unknown, but it is assumed that it needs an arthropod vector to be transmitted, just as the rest of the related filarids.
