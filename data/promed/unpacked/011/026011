About 2 months after a bird flu outbreak hit Iran's poultry farms, the Society of Day-Old Chicken Producers is warning that the situation might lead to a "catastrophe," urging President Hassan Rouhani to call for emergency measures.

"The president should step in and issue a strict order to contain the outbreak," Mostafa Seyyed Mostafavi, an SDOCP advisor, was quoted as saying by the Iranian Agriculture News Agency.

"The government should have immediately provided all the financial resources that the Iran Veterinary Organization needed to fight the disease to minimize the costs."

According to Mostafavi, similar outbreaks in the past have caused chicken farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

H5N8, a dangerous strain of the bird flu virus, was 1st detected in 7 provinces late November 2016. It then spread to 11 other provinces, namely Markazi, Alborz, Qom, East Azarbaijan, West Azarbaijan, Kermanshah, Mazandaran, Golestan, Gilan, Lorestan and Tehran, forcing chicken farmers to cull the infected birds.

Chicken and egg exports have come to a halt following the outbreak of the highly contagious virus. Afghanistan has been the latest neighboring country to ban the import of Iranian chicken and eggs after Iraq and Azerbaijan.

"If the situation continues as it is, more than 50 percent of the poultry industry will be destroyed. Furthermore, we will need to import chicken in the near future," Mostafavi declared.

However, considering the global outbreak of the disease, the official added that depending on overseas supplies in case of a potential shortage may not be practical.

Different strains of bird flu have been spreading across Europe and Asia since late last year [2016], leading to large-scale slaughtering of poultry in certain countries and some cases of human deaths in China from another strain of the virus H7N9.

There are many subtypes of avian influenza viruses, but only some strains of 5 subtypes have been known to infect humans: H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2.

Earlier, Iran's Health Ministry Spokesman Iraj Harirchi ruled out the possibility of human avian influenza in Iran. "There have been no cases of bird-to-human influenza in Iran, and all bio-safety measures have been taken to ensure that the virus does not spread among people," he said at a press conference on 9 Jan 2017.

"People should not be concerned about the chicken and eggs supplied in the market," adding that a strict ban on hunting wild birds remains in place.

According to the Iran Veterinary Organization, despite the ban on hunting or trade of wild birds, they are still being practiced in several regions, especially the northern provinces of Gilan, Golestan, and Mazandaran.

Violators will face criminal prosecution, the IVO has warned, urging citizens to report any cases of violation. The organization has also urged farmers not to take any action regarding the diagnosis and treatment of avian flu without informing the IVO.

The National Headquarters to Fight Bird Flu meets regularly to keep the situation in check. Members of the headquarters include First Vice President Es'haq Jahangiri, several ministers, as well as the heads of IVO, the Department of Environment, Law Enforcement Forces and the Management and Planning Organization.

[The 2 Middle Eastern countries which have reported since late 2016 HPAI H5N8 epizootics, Iran and Israel, have today (23 Jan 2017) been joined by Kuwait (see today's OIE immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22481).

The Kuwaiti report included the following epidemiological comments:

"Suspicious clinical cases as well as dead birds comprising ducks, geese and pheasants were detected for H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in the National Veterinary Laboratory. For further investigation, specimens were submitted to the Animal & Plant Health Agency, OIE Reference Laboratory, UK. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N8 was confirmed by the molecular sequencing method in the OIE Reference laboratory. As soon as H5 subtype was detected in the national laboratory, sick and contact birds kept in the affected premises were culled. Carcasses were deeply buried by applying appropriate disinfection procedures. Active clinical and serological surveillance were enhanced in surrounding areas of the affected premises. New cases or new outbreaks if any will be updated in the follow up reports."

This event, reportedly, started on 12 Dec 2016. The HPAI H5N8 virus has been internationally spread, mainly by wild birds, in Asia, Europe and Africa. It may be assumed that this highly infectious strain is circulating in other Middle Eastern countries, remaining hitherto unnoticed or not reported. - Mod.AS
