The UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency], Food Standards Agency, and Food Standards Scotland are investigating an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ [infection] linked to smoked fish. This contamination could be particularly unsafe to people who are vulnerable to listeria infection -- including people who are pregnant and people with certain underlying conditions or who are taking medications that can weaken the immune system.

Listeria is a bacterium that causes an illness called listeriosis. It is widespread in the environment and can contaminate a range of food at low or standard refrigeration temperatures. It can be destroyed by thorough cooking. It is of most concern in chilled, ready-to-eat foods that do not require further cooking, such as smoked fish.

Most people won't have any symptoms of the infection or will only experience mild symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, which usually pass within a few days without the need for treatment. People who are pregnant are at increased risk of developing listeriosis, which can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe illness in their newborn babies. More serious infections such as severe sepsis and meningitis can develop in those with weakened immune systems or those over 65 years of age.

Whole genome sequencing [WGS] analysis has identified an outbreak of 12 linked cases of listeriosis since 2020, with 6 of these since January 2022. Cases have been identified in England and Scotland. The majority of these individuals reported eating smoked fish. One case was a pregnant woman.

Given the ongoing outbreak, as a precaution, information for people who are pregnant has been updated to advise that they thoroughly cook smoked fish before eating it. Advice for avoiding listeriosis infection is being updated to include smoked fish as a high-risk product which should be thoroughly cooked before being eaten by anyone in a high-risk group.

Stuart McAdam, FSS [Food Standards Scotland] head of incidents, said: "Due to an outbreak of _L. monocytogenes_ linked to smoked fish, we are reminding people who are vulnerable to listeria infection -- including people who are pregnant and people with weakened immune systems -- of the risks of consuming smoked fish and asking them to make sure that the smoked fish is always thoroughly cooked including when served as part of a dish before they eat it. We are working closely with UK partners across government to ensure that this advice is as clear as possible -- members of the public do not need to avoid these products, but should ensure risks are reduced as far as possible. You can do this by keeping chilled ready-to-eat smoked fish cold (5 deg C [41 deg F] or below), always using products by their use-by date, following the storage and usage instructions on the label, and cooking or reheating smoked fish until it is piping hot right through."

Professor Saheer Gharbia, interim deputy director Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety (One Health) at UKHSA, said: "Listeria infection in most people is usually either unnoticed or may cause very mild gastrointestinal illness. However, it can have more serious consequences for some people, particularly those with pre-existing health conditions that cause weakened immunity, and people who are pregnant. There are certain foods that are riskier, and in light of this outbreak, we are advising pregnant and vulnerable people to thoroughly cook smoked fish before eating it. If you have any concerns about your health please speak to your midwife, GP, or hospital specialist team."

The risk of listeriosis is particularly high but not completely limited to individuals with cancer, organ transplants, patients taking oral steroids, patients undergoing immunosuppressive or cytotoxic treatment including biologics and chemotherapy, people who are pregnant and their new-born babies, those above 65 years of age, those with uncontrolled HIV infection, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, people with an alcohol dependency, and those with iron overload.

[Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) performed on listeria isolated from 12 ill persons in England and Scotland identified a cluster of cases that likely have a common source. A food history from these patients suggested that smoked fish was the common source, but the news report fails to mention if a particular type or brand of smoked fish is involved or if WGS was performed on listeria isolated from a particular brand or type of smoked fish to confirm this as the common source. There may be additional cases associated with the outbreak strain since there has been no recall of the incriminated smoked fish.

In the USA, a similar system identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on WGS of clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists look at food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a possible common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

_L. monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

Listeria-contaminated, refrigerated, ready-to-eat products (that is, products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked fish or cold-cut meats, like ham or pork) are well-recognized sources of listeriosis due to the fact that listeria is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. Refrigeration allows small numbers of listeria that contaminate food at the source to grow to sufficient size to cause disease. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk, as well as milk and milk products contaminated with listeria only after pasteurization, are other sources of listeriosis. - Mod.ML
