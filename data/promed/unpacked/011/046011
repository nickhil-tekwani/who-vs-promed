2 outbreaks of suspected foot and mouth disease in southern Viet Nam
have prompted local authorities to control pork sales and seal off
the areas to pig trading, officials said Wednesday [11 Jan 2006].
Only about 25 pigs in 2 locations have died, but veterinary
authorities are testing samples for foot and mouth disease, a
fast-spreading animal virus that can devastate entire populations and
render exports worthless. "We need to conduct thorough tests to find
out what the disease is," said Bui Quang Anh, head of the Animal
Health Department under the Ministry of Agriculture. "If it is foot
and mouth disease, we will have to cull all the sick pigs in the
province, disinfect them, and bury them all," Anh said. "At the
moment, we have sealed off the infected areas."
The suspected outbreak started in late November 2005 in Long An
province, 1750 km south of Hanoi. "We have warned local people not to
eat pork from suspected sources," said Dinh Van The, deputy director
of the local Veterinary Department. Local authorities have vaccinated
pigs in the affected areas.

Pigs have been dying in the past week [1st week January 2006] of a
mysterious disease suspected to be mouth and foot disease in Viet Nam
's Mekong River Delta province.
In several hamlets in southern Tien Giang province's Cho Gao
district, 1/3rd of the stocks died -- especially young pigs -- with
symptoms of foot-and-mouth-disease-like vesicles erupting on the
legs, claws [hooves] coming off, lameness and anorexia. Several days
after contracting the symptoms, they died. Fearing losses from dead
pigs, farmers have been selling diseased pigs to crafty dealers at
extremely cheap prices. A 50-60 kg pig was sold at only VND 100 000
(USD 6.25). The sick pigs were then taken to other localities for
sale, increasing the chances of an epidemic.
Pigs from neighboring Long An province probably contracted the
disease from the same source, with 10 families in one commune having
their animals die.
Nguyen Thi Tiep, a local People's Committee chairwoman said she had
instructed relevant agencies to study the situation and make reports,
but so far no comprehensive statistics are available.
Bui Quang Anh, head of the Animal Health Department under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, stressed that if the
pigs were infected with foot and mouth disease, they would be culled
immediately.
Since late 2003, the lethal disease broke out in several places in
the Mekong Delta on a small scale, and was quickly controlled, Anh added.
