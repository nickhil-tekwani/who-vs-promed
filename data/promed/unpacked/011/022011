Cattle in the surroundings of Manalmedu in Bhavani Sagar range where an adult elephant was found dead with anthrax symptoms will be immunised shortly, it is learnt.

The carcass of the female elephant, aged about 15 years, that was found with anthrax spores was burnt and disposed of by a Forest Department team. Blood samples were taken for confirmation through laboratory tests. The post-mortem was not conducted completely after spores were found on the body, [presumably from a stained blood smear. - Mod.MHJ] District Forest Officer, Sathyamangalam Division, K. Rajkumar said. If the [laboratory] tests prove positive, it will be the 3rd elephant death due to anthrax in the last year in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

In May 2015, a 20-year-old female elephant was found dead at Neerodai, near Hasanur, due to anthrax, and was buried in a deep pit to prevent spread of the disease to other animals [see 20150527.3389677]. [In December of 2014], an adult elephant was found dead in Bhavani Sagar range due to anthrax.

As in the cases of the previous 2 deaths, a mixture of turmeric and calcium was sprinkled around the spot where the carcass was burnt, and the area was sterilised. [Disinfectant not named. - Mod.MHJ]

Whenever elephants die of anthrax, villagers are advised through the Village Forest Committees to refrain from grazing their cattle in the surroundings of the sterilised area, Forest Department sources said. Veterinary Department officials said after confirmation of anthrax as the cause for the death of the elephant at Manalmaedu, vaccination of cattle will be carried out by the staff within a radius of 8 km in the area as a precautionary measure.

[When burying an elephant, it is a good idea to place as much soil as one can on top of the carcass, and maybe return at a later date to add more soil. The reason I suggest this is that elephant carcasses are bulky, and as they decompose the volume collapses such that a pit can form at the surface. This needs to be filled in both for safety and to stop any buried anthrax spores floating up into this depression. When a cow is buried, you will find a subsequent 10-15 cms depression covering 2 sq m, and if you are looking for spores in the soil those are the 1st places to search. With elephants somewhat larger than cattle, that decomposition depression will be markedly larger and call for revisiting. Burning an elephant carcass is a lengthy process but once done, it is over.

The local veterinary officers in the Sathyamangalam Division are to be commended for recognising the need to vaccinate the cattle in the area where this dead elephant was found. While elephants can graze, they are primarily browsers and therefore this elephant became infected either through haemophagic flies that had previously fed on a moribund/dead anthrax case or from necrophagic flies vomiting blood from an anthrax carcass onto nearby browse. The history of anthrax in this area suggests that there is a background of enzootic anthrax. A proactive programme of livestock vaccination would be well worth considering.
