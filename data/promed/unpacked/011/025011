In October 2015, unusual symptoms were observed on _Cucurbita pepo_ [see comment below] grown in open fields of the Province of Trapani (Sicily). Symptoms were characterized by yellow mosaic, severe leaf curling, swelling of veins on young leaves, shortening of internodes, roughness of the fruit skin, and reduced fruit size.

Molecular analysis (PCR, sequencing) confirmed the presence of _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (_Begomovirus_, ToLCNDV - EPPO Alert List) in symptomatic samples. This is the 1st time that ToLCNDV has been reported from Italy.

[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; genus _Begomovirus_) has been reported to cause severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops in the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes), and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted.

Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

ToLCNDV was reported from Spain for the 1st time in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131223.2131729), which was suspected to be its 1st appearance in Europe. The source of that incursion so far remains unknown, and the virus has now also been reported from Tunisia. It has a wider host range than the related _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_, which had previously been present in the region. But producers in the currently affected countries hope that the introduced strain is specific to cucurbits and will not spread to crops in other families as well. The virus has recently been included in the EPPO alert list.

_Cucurbita pepo_ (family Cucurbitaceae) originates in the New World and includes a number of varieties of squash, pumpkin, zucchini and inedible ornamental gourds.
