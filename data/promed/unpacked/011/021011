Suspected polio outbreak in Syrian province spreads - WHO
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 22 people are now suspected of having polio in Syria, where health officials are scrambling to respond to the 1st outbreak of the crippling viral disease in 14 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday [24 Oct 2013].

Most of those stricken with acute flaccid paralysis -- a symptom of diseases including polio -- in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor [Dayr az Zawr] are children under the age of 2 [years], WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer said.

"There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," Rosenbauer told Reuters. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak (of polio) and is in outbreak response mode."

The WHO, a UN agency, announced on Saturday [19 Oct 2013] that 2 suspected cases of polio had been detected, the 1st appearance of the disease in Syria since 1999.

Initial tests came back positive for polio in 2 of the 22 cases and final laboratory results due next week from a WHO reference laboratory in Tunis are "very, very likely" to confirm presence of the virus, Rosenbauer said.

There is no cure for the highly infectious disease; it can only be prevented through immunization, usually 3 doses.

More than 100 000 children under age 5 [years] are deemed at risk of polio in Deir al-Zor province, he said. Most of the countryside is in opposition hands but the city of Deir al-Zor itself is still partially controlled by government forces.

"The main concern right now is to quickly launch an immunization response," Rosenbauer said. Vaccination campaigns are being planned across Syria from November [2013] but logistics in a civil war are still being discussed.

With some 4000 Syrian refugees leaving the country daily, immunization campaigns are also planned in neighboring countries, where there may be gaps in coverage, he said.

Most of the 22 victims are believed never to have been vaccinated or to have received only a single dose of the oral polio vaccine, Rosenbauer said.

Polio invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours. It is endemic in just 3 countries, Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but sporadic cases also occur in other countries.

Rosenbauer, asked whether the virus may have been imported into Syria by a foreign combatant fighting in the civil war, replied: "The 1st step is virological verification that it is the polio virus.

"The next step is that every isolated virus gets looked at genetically to see where is the parent. Hopefully that will provide some clarity on where it would have come from," he said.

The outbreak is the latest setback to international efforts to eradicate polio -- as well adding another dimension to Syria's worsening humanitarian crisis as the war forces people from their homes and destroys health systems.

Polio cases worldwide decreased from an estimated 350 000 cases when the campaign began in 1988 to 223 reported cases in 2012, according to WHO. So far this year [2013] -- not including the 22 unconfirmed cases in Syria -- there have been 296 cases of wild poliovirus worldwide.

Data in WHO as of 23 Oct 2012 for 2012 data and 22 Oct 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of this week:
- World Polio Day - [24 Oct 2013]. Partners, governments, civil society and communities worldwide are today marking World Polio Day, as efforts to eradicate this disease once and for all are being intensified.
- In Syria, reports of suspected polio cases have emerged. A cluster of hot cases is currently being investigated, and has prompted planning for a comprehensive outbreak response across the region.
- One wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case has been confirmed in Cameroon. This is the 1st WPV in the country since 2009. WPV1 was isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case from Ouest province, with onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2013]. Genetic sequencing is on-going to determine origin of the isolated virus.

Afghanistan
-----------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 is now 8 (all WPV1), all of which were reported from Eastern Region, close to the Pakistan border. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [19 Sep 2013], from Kunar province.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- National immunization days (NIDs) were conducted on [6-8 Oct 2013]. A 2nd NIDs is planned for late October [2013], followed by subnational immunization days (SNIDs) mid and late November [2013].

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 49 (all WPV1s). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [10 Sep 2013] (from Kano).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- The primary challenges remain to access all children in Borno state, including in areas currently inaccessible during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) due to insecurity, and to further improve the quality of SIA implementation in Kano state.
- OPV was administered along with measles vaccine during Child Health Days (CHDs) in north and middle-band states on [5-9 Oct 2013]. Additional CHDs are planned for early November [2013] in middle-band and southern states. SNIDs are planned for northern states [14-19 Nov 2013].

Pakistan
--------
- Three new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. All were reported from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA -- 2 from FR Bannu and one from North Waziristan). The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 46. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2013] (from FR Bannu). The majority of WPV1 cases in Pakistan this year, 34 (74 per cent), are from FATA, of which 14 from Khyber Agency and 14 from North Waziristan.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for Pakistan remains 29. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis [12 Sep 2013] (from North Waziristan).
- The situation in North Waziristan is becoming increasingly severe, as it is the area with the largest number of children being paralysed by wild poliovirus (14 cases) and cVDPV2s (22) in all of Asia. It is in an area where immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in these areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- NIDs were conducted on [30 Sep to 2 Oct 2013]. SNIDs were conducted [14-16 Oct 2013] using bOPV. Further NIDs are planned for November [2013] with dates to be confirmed using bOPV.

Chad, Cameroon and Central African Republic
-------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi). Nationwide immunization campaigns are planned for late October and November [2013].
- In Cameroon, one WPV1 was reported this week from Ouest province. This is the 1st WPV in Cameroon since 2009 and had onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2013].
- An outbreak response is now being planned. In 2013, 5 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have already been conducted in Cameroon (in April, May, August, September and October [2013]), as the country was considered at high-risk of re-infection due to its proximity with Nigeria. The latest NIDs were conducted [11-13 Oct 2013].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent VPDV had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad, on-going insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, SNIDs were conducted on [30 Sep to 2 Oct 2013] and CHDs are planned for [11-13 Nov 2013].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases (all WPV1) for 2013 in the Horn of Africa remains 197 (174 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, 6 from Ethiopia and 3 from South Sudan). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [19 Sep 2013] (from Somali region, Ethiopia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly-reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. At the same time, operations are improving as more children are being reached, including in some inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. However, more needs to be done, because as many as 500 000 children still remain inaccessible in parts of south-central Somalia and other areas of the Horn of Africa remain at risk of re-infection.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has been reported, environmental surveillance suggests that WPV1 transmission, 1st detected in February 2013, continues in southern and parts of central Israel. WPV1-positive samples were detected also in West Bank (2 sites) and the Gaza Strip (1 site).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age has been on-going since August [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip have been tentatively scheduled for October and November [2013].

Syrian Arab Republic
--------------------
- In Syria, reports of suspected polio cases have emerged.
- On [17 Oct 2013], the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in the Syrian Arab Republic. This cluster of 'hot' AFP cases was detected in early October [2013] in Deir Al-Zour province and is currently being investigated. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.
- A comprehensive outbreak response plan is urgently being finalized. The main aim is to rapidly conduct an immunization activity in the immediately-affected area (by end-October) and high-risk areas. Multiple large-scale SIAs are needed over the next 6 months (beginning in early November [2013]) across Syria and across the region.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for late October [2013]. Additional subnational campaigns were conducted [7-9 Sep 2013] in Niger, and additional rounds are planned in the region for early November [2013].

[Since the last ProMED-mail update on polio earlier this week (Poliomyelitis - update (23): Syria susp., global, RFI 20131020.2010654), the number of suspected cases of polio in Syria has increased from 10 to 22, suggesting that there has been significant circulation of poliovirus in the affected area. Confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV) by the regional polio reference laboratory is still pending.

Another significant occurrence during this past week is the confirmation of WPV infection in Cameroon. Genetic studies on this isolate are still pending but most likely will be similar to those WPVs circulating in Nigeria, one of the 3 remaining polio endemic countries in the world.

As discussed in the above Global Polio Eradication Initiative update, the common denominator that seems to be impeding eradication efforts worldwide is the presence of civil unrest in a number of countries that had led to serious gaps in immunization coverages of the susceptible population.

For a map showing the location of confirmed WPV cases in 2013, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx.

The province (governorate) of Deir al-Zor (Dayr az Zawr) can be seen on the map at http://www.ephotopix.com/syria_province_map.html. It is located in the northeast of the country, bordering with Iraq. If WPV is confirmed, given the civil unrest in Iraq, one wonders if there might be WPV circulating across the border in Iraq as well.
