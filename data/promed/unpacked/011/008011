The government on Sunday [19 Jan 2014] confirmed that poultry from 2 duck farms in Buan, North Jeolla Province were infected with avian influenza [AI] virus. There are now 3 duck farms with confirmed cases of the virus.

"The case reported on 17 Jan 2014 has been confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain," said Kwon Jae-han, director of the livestock policy bureau at the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

As for the farm that reported a suspected AI case on Saturday [18 Jan 2014], it has yet to be confirmed whether the infection is caused by the same strain.

Kwon also said that poultry kept at farms located within a 500 meter radius of the concerned facility are being slaughtered. "At present, there are no other reported cases, and there are no reported cases of the strain found in Buan infecting humans."

The 1st case was reported on Thursday [16 Jan 2014] on a farm raising ducks for breeding in Gochang, in the same province. The case in Gochang was confirmed to have been caused by the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of the virus.

The discovery comes hours after the Agriculture Ministry issued a temporary standstill on the poultry industry in the Jeolla provinces. The measure, which took effect at midnight Sunday [19 Jan 2014], restricts the movement of poultry, industry workers, and equipment for 48 hours. "The standstill has been issued as suspected cases were reported from Buan after the confirmed case in Gochang, which is close to South Jeolla Province," agriculture minister Lee Dong-phil said in a briefing on Sunday [19 Jan 2014]. He added that the measure was considered unavoidable if the latest outbreak of AI was to be contained.

Saying that the government was doing its best to eradicate the virus, the minister emphasized the safety of poultry products in circulation. "The poultry found at AI-infected farms are strictly regulated and have not been distributed in the market. I stress that the public can consume poultry products" [but see item 4].

According to Kwon Jae-han, the standstill is set to last only 48 hours and unlikely expand across the country. "(Expansion of the measure across the country) is limited to when a national outbreak is deemed likely. At present, it is considered that (AI) spreading across the country is unlikely," Kwon said. He added that an order to slaughter the birds at the Buan farms has been issued.

He also said the standstill measure was not issued to the Chungcheong provinces, where ducks from the Gochang farm were distributed, as there is no risk of horizontal transmission [This statement is in need of clarification. - Mod.AS].

The ministry, however, appeared to be unsure of the relationship between confirmed AI cases and the deaths of migratory birds in the area. On Friday [17 Jan 2014], a large number of Baikal teals were found dead in a reservoir located about halfway between the farms in Gochang and Buan. The Baikal teal is a migratory bird that winters in Korea and nearby countries. The authorities have collected carcasses from the reservoir to determine the cause of death.

While Kwon said that migratory birds' feces are suspected to be the source of the contagion, another ministry official indicated otherwise, citing a case from 2005. "About 50 dead birds were collected. About 200 000 birds came this year [2014], and about 100 have died. In 2005, about 30 000 Baikal teal had died, and it was not AI. It is likely to be a similar case," an Agriculture Ministry official in charge of treating animal diseases said.

Kwon rejected criticism that the ministry's preventative measures have been lax, saying that farms were instructed to step up related measures. Prior to the latest outbreak, Korea was hit by AI 4 times, most recently in 2011. At the time, more than 3 million poultry were slaughtered. In 2008, 3.45 million birds were slaughtered due to the virus, at a cost of around 32 billion won [USD 30 million].

The South Korean government on Friday [17 Jan 2014] announced an outbreak of avian influenza at a local farm, saying that a DNA test has confirmed ducks on the farm were infected with a highly pathogenic form of the virus. "Poultry deaths at the farm were caused by a highly virulent strain of the H5N8 virus," the Agriculture Ministry said.

On Thursday [16 Jan 2014], a suspected AI case was reported at the farm in Gochang, some 300 km southwest of Seoul in North Jeolla Province. Provincial quarantine authorities culled more than 20 000 ducks on Friday [17 Jan 2014] after a preliminary test indicated a possible AI outbreak.

Health authorities opened an investigation on Saturday [18 Jan 2014] to determine what killed about 1000 ducks in a southern county recently hit by an outbreak of avian influenza (AI). The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency found the flock of migratory birds dead in a reservoir in North Jeolla Province a day earlier and began an investigation to confirm a possible link to AI, according to the provincial government.

The investigation comes after bird flu was confirmed in thousands of ducks at a duck farm in Gochang, a nearby village in the same province. It was the 1st case of AI since May 2011 in South Korea. More than 3 million poultry were slaughtered at the time in connection with the virus.

If AI is confirmed, it would be the 1st case of the virus in migratory birds in South Korea, authorities said, adding that such a result would have major ramifications.

An avian influenza (AI) believed to be of a highly pathogenic strain broke out at a duck farm in Gochang, North Jeolla Province. The government has culled 21 000 ducks at the farm. The Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said on Friday [17 Jan 2014] that a test conducted after receiving reports of symptoms of AI confirmed that it is a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.

It is the 1st highly pathogenic AI outbreak since May 2011. Highly pathogenic AI could cause a high mortality rate among livestock. The authorities have confirmed that the duck farm in question had sold 173 000 ducklings to 24 other farms in North Jeolla Province, North and South Chungcheong Provinces, and Gyeonggi Province since late December 2013. In particular, quarantine officials have found that vehicles that carried ducklings from the farm entered a poultry slaughterhouse in North Chungcheong Province, making the spread of AI more likely.

[Though the information, as presented in the different media sources, is not uniform, the emerging picture is indicative of several (3?) outbreaks of an HPAI virus in duck farms in North Jeolla Province; at least on one of them, H5N8 has been identified as the causative agent. Information on the clinical manifestation and mortality on the duck farms has not become available.

Some recent background information on HPAI H5N8 virus in Eastern Asia is included in the reference below, to which we have been kindly referred by ProMED-mail's rapporteur Mary Marshall. Its abstract says:

"One H5N8 and 3 H5N5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses which derived their HA genes from the Asian H5N1 lineage were isolated from poultry during 2009-2010 in mainland China. Pathogenicity studies showed that these viruses were all highly virulent to chickens, while they varied from moderate to high virulence in mice and from mild to intermediate virulence in mallards. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these viruses were reassortants bearing the H5N1 backbone, while acquiring PB1, NP and NA genes from unidentified non-H5N1 viruses, and had developed into 3 distinct genotypes (B-D). Molecular characterization indicated that all these viruses might resist antiviral agents. Our findings highlight the emergence and development of HPAI H5 viruses of other NA subtypes in H5N1 endemic areas and their potential threat to the poultry industry and public health."

As is apparent from the full text of the paper, 2 of the 3 H5N1 strains were isolated from geese and one from quails. The H5N8 virus was isolated from ducks which were "apparently healthy." This H5N8 virus was designated as "A/duck/Jiangsu/k1203/2010 (Dkk1203)."

An official OIE notification from South Korea with additional information will, most probably, become available early this week. It will be interesting to note the morbidity and mortality rates observed in the affected ducks. Subscribers are reminded that the term "HPAI" (highly pathogenic avian influenza) relates to the assessment of virulence in chickens; see updated text in the section "B. Diagnostic techniques 2. Assessment of pathogenicity," in OIE's Manual, Chapter 2.3.4. -- Avian influenza, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.

No recordings of past human infection with HPAI H5N8 could be traced.
