UPDATE
Rabies in a puppy imported from Morocco, public health measures taken in
Switzerland and Morocco.
On October 29, 1997 rabies was diagnosed in a female puppy which had been
imported into Switzerland from Morocco by a Swiss tourist. Between October
15, and October 19, the rabid puppy was kept in a camp site near Agadir.
The animal presented first symptoms on October 21. Active search for
persons who had been exposed to the puppy was initiated by the public
health authorities of the two countries concerned and post exposure
prophylaxis was promptly given where necessary. Information was
distributed by radio, internet, press release, and official administrative
notes. The Moroccan authorities sent an investigating team to the area
concerned.
According to information given by Dr. Abdelhaq Tber of the Ministry of
Agriculture in Morocco, a total of 20 persons at the camp site received
rabies post exposure prophylaxis in the Antirabies Center of Agadir by
November 21, 1997. Included were two Austrians who brought the
free-roaming puppy to the camp site of Taghazout. Straying dogs were
eliminated in this area and two dogs already vaccinated against rabies were
given a booster dose, and [were put under observation.
In Switzerland, a total of 17 persons received rabies post exposure
prophylaxis. One initially unidentified person who had been exposed in the
aircraft was found after broadcasting a specific message by radio. One cat
of the dog owner was killed by euthanasia and several dogs were given a
rabies booster dose and put under observation.
