[1] Re: Comment in WHO Roadmap 8 Oct 2014

[ProMED Moderator Emeritus Charlie Calisher has pointed out that mortality rates are not expressed as percentages but as rates, say per 1000 or more cases per unit of time. What I actually inserted in this WHO report was a CFR or case fatality rate of 48 percent since the start of the epidemic. But in any case a CFR derived from reported numbers is pretty meaningless, given that neither all the cases nor all the deaths have been lab confirmed, because not all samples are in fit condition to be tested after a long trip to a lab, and I understand the labs have been pretty overwhelmed up to now. Many new fully staffed labs are now arriving, but they will be hard pressed to keep up with the influx of ever more cases. - Mod.JW]

[2] Liberia: 1332 Nigerian soldiers quarantined

The Nigerian Army has revealed that about 1332 of its peace-keeping troops in Liberia have been placed under surveillance following their contact with a Sudanese who later died of the Ebola virus disease (EVD). The director of the Nigerian Army Medical Corps, Major-General Obashina Ogunbiyi stated this in Abuja yesterday [9 Oct 2014]. According to the Army medical officer, the incident followed the death of a Sudanese Muslim man who had come to the camp of the soldiers to lead them in prayer during the Eid-el Fitri celebration, but developed Ebola symptoms the following day and later died.

Ogunbuyi noted that the country remained at risk as any of the soldiers could choose to travel home anytime, saying "that is why the military had to be totally involved in the fight against the Ebola virus."

[3] Sierra Leone: Chinese holding center

The 30 man Chinese medical team working at the Jui holding center [near Freetown, Sierra Leone] started working on 1 Oct 2014 and on that day they received 6 patients. In an exclusive interview with Dr Jinsong Mu, who is the leader of the medical group, they have received 42 suspected cases -- 13 were confirmed positive and 7 died -- during the 8 days they have worked.

He explained that when the cases are received they are taken to Area 1 where all of them are kept together until the results are out. After the results are released, the confirmed cases are then moved to Area 2 where they are isolated before being transferred to the treatment center. He complained that "these confirmed cases are told strictly to stay in their room, but these people refuse and will come out of the room walking around which is not good for other patients." Dr Mu explained that after the confirmed cases are taken to the isolation ward, the team then contacts the Command Center who will then send an ambulance to collect and take them to the treatment center.

When asked how they receive patients, Dr Mu said every morning, they hold discussions with the Command Center, which calls them at 8am to know how many patients the holding center will receive. After both parties agree, the Command Center will then send the required number to them for testing.

Dr Mu said because they are working in the same compound with the lab, it is easy for them to receive the results. Most of the cases in the holding centre, he disclosed, will take a maximum of 3 days before they are sent for treatment.

The Chinese head of the medical team said they have 4 doctors and 22 nurses, and currently they have 42 patients. This works out at one doctor for at least 10 patients. He said when a doctor goes into the isolation ward, he is there for about one hour dressed in the protective suits. "I tell you, it is not easy to be in that suit for so long, as it is very inconvenient."

One problem he says they have is people just walking into the hospital without any report from community hospitals or from the central Command. This, he said, is not correct because they need to have prior knowledge of these victims. However, he said, they cannot turn them away and have to accept and check them. While there, 8 patients walked into the hospital complaining that they are infected, so they were taken into the holding center for further tests.

Dr Mu disclosed that they are now training some of their other doctors in the hope that they will be able to assist them in the fight. He also revealed plans to train local doctors if and when they have them. For now, however, they are only working with Sierra Leonean nurses.

Dr Mu said the local nurses are very hard working and he is very proud of them because they are complementing their effort in winning this battle. "I am very happy for them and Dr Alex Kanu as they are really working with us to end this fight."

During the interview, a 7th patient died Wednesday morning [8 Oct 2014] and the burial team arrived 3 hours later, headed by Mr Deen, who Dr Mu said has been very active, and doing his work well because he has collected all the dead patients from the Jui hospital.... Dr Mu said he wants to advise all Sierra Leoneans that Ebola can be cured if they go to the hospital early. He said many people have been cured because they went to the hospital on time.

He complimented the Sierra Leone military for their good job at the treatment center as he heard that 49 patients were [discharged] on Monday [6 Oct 2014]. "I hope more patients will be able to make it out alive so that it will give more confidence to others."

[4] China: arrivals monitoring

An article in Chinese media today [10 Oct 2015] reports the case of a patient in Wuhan, a 29-year old worker, returned to China from Nigeria in mid-August [2014]. Experienced fever, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhoea on day 2 after returning home. Went to hospital in Wuhan where Ebola was ruled out and patient was diagnosed with malaria.

Here's a partial translation of an article from Chengdu, Sichuan describing monitoring of people returning from West Africa. It states that about 60 people have returned to Chengdu from countries with Ebola outbreaks since mid-August [2014]. Looking at Chengdu's ratio to China's total population, we can estimate that maybe 5800 people have returned from those countries to any part of China. For sure, this is an oversimplification (among other things, Chengdu is a major metropolis unlike the vast majority of China). But it gives some idea of how Chinese returnees from West Africa might fit into the global picture. This article also talks a little about China's policies on monitoring of returnees. [see below]

Young African man from Ebola outbreak zone coming to Chengdu for PhD: 1st class is 17 days of isolation
------------------------------------------------
"I well understand." [the] 29 year old Nigerian is a new PhD student at Southwest Jiaotong University. Though he says "boring, dry" to describe these 17 days, he still expresses understanding for the isolation. It was learned yesterday that in mid August [2014], Chengdu launched health monitoring of people coming to Chengdu from countries with outbreaks. Now, more than 30 people are undergoing monitoring with a total of 70 having been through it so far ...In fact, "isolation" like [this PhD student] is called "health monitoring" in medical terms and isn't actual medical isolation. From the National Health and Family Planning Commission's "Notice Regarding Ebola Prevention & Control Program (3rd Version)" how medical monitoring for ordinary people merely visiting (returning) to China from outbreak zones, versus those who have had close contact with Ebola cases, is different requires a close look at the details.
...[of the 70] the number of foreigners is less than 10. The majority are Chinese nationals returning from countries with Ebola outbreaks, such as citizens working in West Africa."
