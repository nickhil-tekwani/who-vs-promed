Republic of Congo: WHO declares Ebola epidemic over for now
-----------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever that has ravaged the northern
Cuvette-Ouest region of the Republic of Congo since April 2005 is now under
control, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 17 Jun 2005. "On
17 Jun [2005], the last people [who came into contact with infected
persons] will be removed from the monitoring list. The epidemic will be
regarded as epidemiologically over," WHO said in a statement issued in
Brazzaville, the nation's capital. However, WHO added the qualification
that: "The official declaration of the end of the epidemic will come only
at the end of 21 days, on 8 Jul 2005."
The recent epidemic was declared on 27 Apr 2005 for a forested area of the
Cuvette-Ouest region that borders Gabon. WHO confirmed the finding a month
later. Since the start of the outbreak, the virus has killed 10 people in
Cuvette-Ouest: 9 in the locality of Etoumbi and one in Mbomo.
WHO says Ebola virus was 1st identified in a western equatorial province of
Sudan and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1976, after
significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern DRC, and Nzara, southern Sudan.
The agency describes Ebola as "one of the most virulent viral diseases
known to humankind, causing death in 50 to 90 per cent of all clinically
ill cases."
Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids
and tissues of infected persons. Transmission has also occurred by handling
ill or dead chimpanzees infected with the virus. Over the last few days,
carcasses of dead animals have been found in the forest in the Etoumbi zone
of the Republic of Congo. Animal samples sent to the International Medical
Research Centre in Franceville, Gabon, for analyses have tested positive
for Ebola virus. This means that another outbreak is possible if hunters in
the forest touch dead primates. To head off another epidemic, government
public health officials have mounted a door-to-door awareness campaign in
Etoumbi. An adviser to the Ministry of Health, Jean-Vivien Mombouli, said
that the short duration of this latest outbreak, the 4th, was a result of
previous awareness campaigns. "We are looking for new tools with which to
fight Ebola, which, in the long term, will make the disease banal," he said.
