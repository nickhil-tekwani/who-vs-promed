On Tue, 9 Aug 2005, our lab made the diagnosis of Legionnaires'
disease via urinary antigen in a veteran who attended the
Pennsylvania American Legion Convention in Valley Forge, PA on 17 Jul
2005. He became ill 10-12 days after the meeting. We have reported
the case to the Health Department.
A second case of Legionnaires' disease has been identified among
attendees of the American Legion Convention in Valley Forge, PA as
well. Both patients are residents of the Pittsburgh area.
It is still too early to say whether this represents an outbreak
related to the convention; the appropriate Health Departments are
investigating. However, my colleagues in PA [and elsewhere - Mod.LL]
should ask their pneumonia patients about attendance at the
convention, and order Legionella urinary antigen and culture.

[ProMED thanks Dr Muder for allowing us to post his observations from
the Infectious Diseases Society of America listserve. It is not
stated how many attendees may have been from other states, as more
cases may be recognized in PA or elsewhere.
_L. pneumophilia_, of course, came initially to the mainstream of
infectious diseases related to the 1976 Legionnaires' Convention in
Philadelphia, PA. - Mod.LL]
