28 more cases of suspected Japanese encephalitis were reported from various
districts of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday [25 Aug 2005], taking the toll due
to the fatal brain fever to 185, Additional Director State Health Services
D P Mishra said.
He said Maharajganj and Kushinagar districts remained worst affected; 235
patients [from those areas have] so far been admitted to the medical
college [in Gorakhpur].
Among others admitted in the hospital, 200 were children, he said adding,
"On average, 40-50 patients were being admitted every day."
Hospitals around the state have been asked to take measures such as
anti-larval treatment, indoor spray and fogging, and isolated wards have
been set up for treatment of encephalitis patients.

The number of deaths from an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in India's
Uttar Pradesh state has risen to at least 175. Officials fear the death
toll may be much higher as fatalities in rural areas often go unreported.

They say there is an acute shortage of vaccine in the northern state.
Encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease, has killed 3500 people in Uttar
Pradesh in the past 25 years.
The BBC's Ram Dutt Tripathi in Lucknow says the official figures may be
under-estimates, as Gorakhpur district, 250 km (165 miles) east of the
state capital Lucknow, has itself reported 167 deaths.
Most of the victims are very poor people from rural areas, says Dr TN
Dhole, professor of microbiology in Lucknow's Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate
Medical Institute.
Doctors said children between the ages of 6 months and 15 years were
worst-affected.
Dr KP Kushwaha, a paediatrician from Gorakhpur, said up to 50 new sufferers
were arriving every day.
Japanese encephalitis, which causes high fever, vomiting and can leave
patients comatose, usually hits the state at the end of August, but this
time it struck in July.
The disease has recurred annually in eastern regions of the state since
about 1980. Uttar Pradesh needs 50 million [doses of vaccine] every year,
according to state health officials. But the Kasauli-based Central
Institute is only able to supply 200 000, they say.

Japanese encephalitis has spread from eastern Uttar Pradesh to the capital
city [Lucknow] and several far-flung areas, claiming 158 lives in over 3
weeks. As many as 3 dozen children are under treatment at the children's
ward of King George's Medical University (KGMU), a fact that has only just
come to light.
"The patients were admitted a few days ago but it was only on Sunday [21
Aug 2005] that their diagnosis for Japanese encephalitis was confirmed,"
Ram Kant, the chief medical superintendent, admitted here Monday [22 Aug 2005].
State Health Director General O.P. Singh said the virus had spread to as
far as Chitrakoot in the southeastern corner of the state where 6 children
have died. Fatehpur in central Uttar Pradesh also reported some
deaths. The disease had initially hit Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar,
Bahraich, Barabanki, Lakhimpur-Kheri, Varanasi, Sitapur and Rae Bareli
districts.
"While the victims were mostly children, 8 adults have also succumbed to
the virus since it broke out on 29 Jul [2005]," Singh said.
This type of brain fever, which has been confirmed as Japanese encephalitis
by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), has been a
perennial problem in large parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, where the virus
has been striking consecutively for the past 27 years.

[Thanks to Cat Bachman for the valuable information. ProMED encourages all
its readers to submit reports of outbreaks from reliable sources. In this
report, the 1st official declaration of Japanese encephalitis through the
National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) was documented.- Mod.RY]
[Encephalitis is an annual epidemic and a perennial problem in India. The
current outbreak is particularly serious due to the heavy onset of the
monsoon, which resulted in the worst flooding in the affected area in 27
years. So far the death toll of this outbreak has not only surpassed but
nearly quadrupled that of 2004. - Mod.RY]
