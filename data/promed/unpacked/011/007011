[Re: ProMED-mail Theileria, bovine - New Zealand 20130922.1960608]
------------------------------------------------------------------
New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) wishes to clarify that the New Zealand situation concerns _Theileria orientalis_. _Theileria orientalis_ has been present in New Zealand since the early 1980s, and sporadic cases of anaemia associated with this organism have been reported since that time. Since late 2012 MPI has been investigating increased reports of anaemia in cattle. Testing has confirmed the presence of ikeda strain to be associated with the reports. Up until today (23 Sep 2013) MPI has confirmed the ikeda strain on 124 farms, all but one of which have been on the North Island. The one incident from the South Island (Canterbury) involved a single cow that had been transported south from the North Island.

MPI does not have a definitive number of cattle affected, but it has been estimated that potentially 700 cattle have died since August 2012. In reality, the numbers may be less than that as many farms are only reporting very low losses (one or 2 cows). To put the numbers in context, there are 10 million beef and dairy cattle in New Zealand, so even 700 deaths represents a very small proportion of the country's cattle -- approximately 0.007 percent -- and the mortality has taken place over a year. Looking specifically at dairy herds, only a small proportion have been affected -- 97 out of 11 500 New Zealand dairy herds.

In affected herds, statistically we're seeing approximately 30 percent of cattle in that herd showing actual clinical signs of the condition and 1.6 percent mortality.

Recent opportunistic testing by MPI of 714 herd samples (collected for reasons other than _Theileria_ investigation) by PCR for _Theileria orientalis_ and specific PCR for ikeda, have confirmed that ikeda is widespread. While this ikeda strain was first detected in New Zealand in August 2012, indications are that it may have been present in New Zealand much longer. As is typical for _Theileria orientalis_, the infection in most animals appears to be clinically inapparent.

The reason for the increase in clinical cases is unknown, although it is suspected that unusual weather patterns over the last few years may have led to an increase in tick numbers. The cattle tick _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ is the only cattle tick present in New Zealand and is a known vector of _Theileria orientalis_. Clinical disease is a complex interplay between the organism, host immunity and other stressors such as calving or nutritional stresses. Modelling has shown that there is a high likelihood that farms within 5 km [3.1 mi] of a report case MAY be infected.

Anecdotal reports from veterinary practitioners suggest that the number of report cases of severely affected animals is dropping. Expectations have been that report cases would drop as the calving season comes to an end.
