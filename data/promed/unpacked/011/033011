Steve Steinhardt has led Sheboygan County [Wisconsin]'s emergency response to the 9 tuberculosis [TB] cases recorded since April [2013]. Sheboygan County officials have had to scramble to contain [this outbreak]. At the height of the crisis, the county activated its emergency operation center -- a step usually reserved for major fires, floods and tornadoes.

The county has had to borrow personnel from other jurisdictions, calm parents of schoolchildren, find housing to isolate infected families and appeal to the state for millions of dollars in extra money to deal with the situation. It's a reminder that TB -- a disease most Americans may view as a relic of the 19th century -- is still an insidious threat that can pop up anywhere. In its advanced stages, tuberculosis can destroy lungs, damage other organs and cause death.

The Sheboygan outbreak came to light on April 11 [2013]. The 1st case was a woman at the center of a large, close-knit family. Health officials decline to identify the family, but they say the people were part of an immigrant community, a common theme in most current TB outbreaks in the US.

Sheboygan is home to sizable populations from Mexico and Southeast Asia, where TB is common. Asian immigrants make up half of Wisconsin's recent TB cases. Refugees among the Hmong people of Laos and Thailand have been among the most difficult-to-treat cases.

Public health nurse Jean Beineman says the 1st case in the current outbreak is a middle-aged mother who had suffered from TB for many months. "[She] had symptoms since at least last August [2012] -- weight loss, cough, just feeling poorly," Beinemann says. By early May [2013], Sheboygan County health workers found active TB in 3 other family members, spread over several households. And others had symptoms and abnormal chest X-rays. Ominously, several were schoolchildren.

But the really bad news was that the woman at the epidemic's center [the index case] had a TB strain resistant to at least 2 of the main drugs used to treat the infection. That's known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or MDR-TB. It's especially hard to cure. The antibiotics can cost around USD 300 000 for a single case. Officials worried the MDR bacteria had spread to a lot of other people in town.

Epidemiologists predicted Sheboygan could end up with 15 symptomatic MDR-TB cases and up to 200 people infected with the resistant strain but not yet showing symptoms. Asymptomatic, or latent, TB isn't contagious. But it has to be treated with antibiotics for 6 months to a year.

The kids in the family with active TB infections attended a Sheboygan high school and middle school. One big priority was to see if they had transmitted the disease to their classmates. "We tested about 130 students and teachers who had very close contact with the affected individuals," Beinemann says. The results of a 2nd round of testing aren't yet known.

More than 3 months after the outbreak 1st came to light, there have been 9 confirmed cases of active TB among 5 households. Fortunately, none of the other cases is as drug-resistant as the 1st one. It's not clear yet how many other people in Sheboygan will turn out to be infected. Officials think it will be in the dozens.

That may not sound like such a big deal. But treating TB infections of any kind is complex and labor-intensive. Every day, without exception, a nurse must watch each person take medication [called directly-observed therapy or DOT]. A lapse in treatment could cause them to develop a multidrug-resistant strain. Active TB has to be treated until it's no longer contagious. That can take up to a year [to complete treatment, but usually the infection becomes non-contagious in much less time - Mod.LM].

Officials recently moved the woman with MDR-TB into an apartment paid for by the county. Keeping her and the others apart from everyone while they're contagious requires continuous monitoring and education.

And the cost of all this is enormous. When officials feared they faced a wider epidemic of highly resistant TB, they projected it would cost the county USD 17 million to bring it under control. In the end, Sheboygan dodged that worst-case scenario. But it had to persuade the governor and state legislature to appropriate around USD 5 million to deal with the situation.

But across the nation, the ability to jump on these outbreaks is eroding fast. TB in the US is at an all-time low, with less than 10 000 cases each year. But a recent survey by the National TB Controllers Association shows 60 percent of states have cut their TB control budgets [http://www.tbcontrollers.org/docs/NTCA_Capacity_Survey_Summary_WTBD_03192013.pdf]. Many health workers say cases of TB are being missed and they can't investigate outbreaks the way they used to. Here are some highlights from its report:
- Almost half of states have less ability to make sure high-risk TB patients -- children, homeless people, those with drug-resistant TB and people with lowered immunity -- take their medicine without fail.
- Almost 20 percent of states have less ability to deliver optimal therapy to all TB patients, raising the risk that drug-resistant strains will emerge.
- A 3rd of states have less ability to investigate the contacts of known TB cases to see if they're infected.
- More than a 4th of states have less capacity to investigate TB outbreaks.

This reminds Dr. Richard Chaisson of what happened in the early 1990s. Funding cuts in TB programs led to a resurgence of the disease. "We corrected that mistake, and we've had great results," says Chaisson, who directs TB research at Johns Hopkins University. "Now we're making that same mistake all over again, which is declaring victory and withdrawing from the fight before the disease is controlled. Overall TB rates won't go back to the 1992 level, Chaisson says. "But outbreaks like Sheboygan's will start popping up more often ... and stopping them will cost a lot more than keeping TB under control."

[Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid plus rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is a form of TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the 3, 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

TB due to strains resistant to anti-TB drugs in addition to isoniazid, rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and one of the 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs is still classified as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), according to a January 2012 WHO document (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html). Drug-resistant TB requires more extensive chemotherapy, involves drug therapy over a more extended period of time, is more often unsuccessful, and is more expensive than treatment for drug-susceptible TB.

We are told in the news report above that the index patient is infected with a strain resistant to "at least 2 of the main drugs used to treat the infection," i.e., is possibly MDR TB, but we are not told if this strain is resistant to additional anti-TB drugs, i.e., XDR TB. Strikingly, however, we are told that none of the other 8 confirmed cases of active TB who were contacts of the index case have a strain as drug-resistant as the 1st one, which implies that the index case may not be the source for these 8 additional cases and that there may be another unsuspected source(s) with active TB in close contact with these patients.

We are not told if genotyping of the TB isolates has been done. Genotyping isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ is important to establish lines of transmission and determine if a common source is involved. Through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Tuberculosis Genotyping Service, local health departments in the United States are able to submit for genotyping one _M. tuberculosis_ isolate from each culture-confirmed TB case within their jurisdiction (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/genotyping.htm).

We are also not told if any of the 9 patients in this outbreak is HIV co-infected. TB is a major problem for people whose immune system is disabled by HIV/AIDS.

In the US, the number of reported TB cases in 2011 was the lowest recorded since national reporting began in 1953, and the percentage of MDR TB cases among those with no previous history of tuberculosis (primary MDR TB) declined by 60 percent, from 2.5 percent of culture-confirmed TB cases in 1993 to 1.0 percent in 2005 (http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=773435), and has remained around that level since then (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/TBTrends.htm).

Since 1997, the percentage of US-born patients with primary MDR TB has remained below 1.0 percent. However, the proportion of primary MDR TB cases disproportionately affects foreign-born persons in the United States: of the total number of reported primary MDR TB cases, the proportion occurring in foreign-born persons increased from 25.3 percent (103 of 407) in 1993 to 82.7 percent (81 of 98) in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/TBTrends.htm). A total of 4 cases of extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR TB (all occurring in foreign-born persons) were reported in the US for 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm). From 2001 through 2005, the top 5 countries of origin of foreign-born persons with TB were Mexico, the Philippines, Viet Nam, India, and China.

The CDC has pointed out the challenge to TB control for low-incidence states or local communities with minimal TB control programs. These jurisdictions may be ill-equipped to handle an abrupt increase of TB cases and unfamiliar cultural issues among immigrants (http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/tb/tb.asp).

As stated in moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post (Tuberculosis - USA: (FL) fatal, homeless shelter 20120710.1196037): "Every active pulmonary TB case is a potential outbreak. TB control requires political will to commit adequate financial resources for early detection of cases of active tuberculosis and its prompt and complete treatment, accompanied by identification and treatment of active and latent TB infection among contacts. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the United States saw a resurgence of TB as funding fell for TB control activities. This was reversed by commitment on a national level of adequate resources. Cutting TB control activities is bad health policy that will foster the potential for this contagious infection to spread throughout the community. The inevitable result of less detection and effective treatment for TB is more disease in the future, as well as costly drug resistance."

Sheboygan, with a population of about 50 000 at the 2010 census, is a city in the US state of Wisconsin. It is located on Lake Michigan about 50 miles (81 km) north of Milwaukee and 64 miles (103 km) south of Green Bay. Hispanics are about 10 percent of the population. As of the 1999, about 5000 residents have Hmong ancestry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheboygan,_Wisconsin#Demographics). - Mod.ML
