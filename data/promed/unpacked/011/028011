[1] Cases in Western Australia

Mundaring Shire has received an increase in reported cases of Ross River Virus (RRV) [infection] and other mosquito-related complaints.

RRV is common in WA [Western Australia] and typical symptoms are painful and swollen joints, sore muscles, fever and swollen lymph nodes.

Senior environmental health officer Martin Shurlock said the number of reported incidents of RRV in 2017 was already much greater than previous years. "So far this year [2017] we have had 12 reported cases of Ross River Virus," he said. "By comparison, the Shire was only made aware of 9 cases in total in 2015 and just one case in total in 2016."

Anyone experiencing symptoms of RRV should contact their GP or call Health Direct on 1800 022 222. Mr Shurlock said there were precautions people could take to minimise the prevalence of mosquitoes around their homes.

"Mosquitoes tend to lay their eggs in places containing stagnant water including stagnant fish ponds, pot plants, bird baths and old tyres," he said. "Emptying or changing the water in these containers can help mitigate the number of mosquitoes around your house. If emptying the water is not possible then applying a thin layer of paraffin oil to stagnant water can prevent the survival of mosquito larvae."

Stop mosquitoes breeding around your home by following these simple steps:

- Empty out or discard containers and rubbish that may hold water
- Clean out roof gutters to prevent water from pooling
- Empty, clean and refill bird baths, stock troughs and pet water bowls at least once a week
- Keep swimming pools properly maintained and free of debris
- Empty wading pools at the end of each day
- Stock backyard ponds with fish to eat mosquito larvae
- Cover rainwater and septic tank openings, wells or other large water containers with mosquito-proof mesh
- Keep edges of ponds clear of vegetation.

Mr Shurlock said other mosquito deterrents included flywire on doors and windows, wearing personal insect repellent and/or wearing light, long sleeved, loose-fitting clothing.

[A 2 Mar 2017 post indicated that Ross River virus infections were increasing across the state (see Ross River virus - Australia (04): (WA) 20170305.4880866). At that time, WA Health Department figures showed that 222 people were infected in January and February 2017, 75 of them in the [Perth] metropolitan area. The above report indicates that a small area (shire) has cases as well. Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia, including Western Australia state, when rains are heavy. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.

[2] Virus vector mosquito

The Department of Health is urging people to protect themselves from mosquitoes, as numbers are expected to increase in coastal areas following last week's high tide and local rainfall. Elevated numbers are expected to start around [14 Nov 2017], with numbers expected to further increase over the next weeks until the arrival of the monsoon.

The increase of salt-marsh mosquito numbers will occur despite recent mosquito control carried out by the Department's Medical Entomology unit.

"This is the time of the year when rainfall and very high tides trigger extensive salt marsh mosquito breeding, the Department will respond to each significant rainfall event and high tide with mosquito surveillance and control operations to reduce numbers in the Darwin area," said Director of Medical Entomology Nina Kurucz.

"Since July this year [2017], the Department's aerial mosquito control program has already sprayed 111 hectares of salt-marsh mosquito breeding around Darwin, with an extensive aerial spray of 322 hectares also carried out in the swamp system bordering the northern Darwin suburbs last week in response to the high tides on 5 and 6 Nov [2017]. Known mosquito breeding areas in Darwin urban, Charles Darwin National Park and Casuarina Coastal Reserve have also been treated for mosquito breeding in liaison with the NT Parks and Wildlife Commission."

"After the _Aedes vigilax_ mosquito lays its eggs there is only a narrow window of about 3 days to effectively spray the larvae in the breeding areas. Darwin is surrounded by swamps and with a flight range of over 50 km [approx. 31 mi], these mosquitoes will make their way into Darwin, Palmerston and rural areas from outside the extensive control area."

Salt-marsh mosquitoes can carry the Ross River virus. The high risk period for the virus usually starts in December however it can be contracted all year around, which means those planning outdoor activities need to start taking precautions to avoid being bitten.

To avoid being bitten Top Enders are advised to:

- avoid locations near coastal swamps and mangrove areas
- use mosquito-proof accommodation and camping facilities at night
- wear light coloured clothing with long sleeves, long trousers and socks, especially between dusk and dawn in areas where mosquito are likely to bite
- use a protective repellent containing 20 per cent DEET or Picaridin as a supplement to protective clothing, with creams providing best protection
- use mosquito coils, mosquito lanterns and barrier sprays in patio and outdoor areas near houses
- ensure children and animals are adequately protected against mosquito bites.

[Although the above report does not indicate that cases of Ross river virus (RRV) infection have occurred this year (2017), it does signal that the risk of transmission of this virus will increase as populations of vector mosquito increases. RRV infections occur relatively frequently in Northern Territory (NT). One hopes that the monitoring of mosquito populations and control measures in NT are successful in preventing human cases.
