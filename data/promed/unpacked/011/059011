13 housing estates and villages in 5 districts in Kedah have been declared
dengue outbreak zones. State Health Committee chairman Datuk V. Saravanan said
304 confirmed dengue cases had been reported from 1 Jan to 12 Mar 2006.
He said 5 of the 13 housing estates were in Baling, 4 in Kota Star, 2 in Kuala
Muda, and one each in Pendang and Sik. He said they included Pekan Kuala
Pegang, Taman Tanjung Puteri, Taman Permai, Taman Indah, Taman Bersatu, Taman
Wira, Pekan Pokok Sena, Kampung Aman Pokok Sena and Kampung Banggol Kiat.
"In Taman Bersatu in Kota Star, we recorded 20 confirmed cases," he said.
>From Jan 1 to March 12, Kota Star recorded 108 confirmed cases, followed by
Baling (53), Kuala Muda (46), Kulim (24), Bandar Baharu (7), Kubang Pasu (20),
Sik (16), Pendang (9), Padang Terap (9), Langkawi (7) and Yan (5).
"We need public co-operation to keep dengue at bay,'' he said, adding that the
victims were aged between 7 and 52 years.
Saravanan called on neighbourhood organisations to carry out gotong royong
[mutual cooperation] projects to rid their homes of mosquito breeding grounds.

10 people from Taman Maju in Jasin are down with dengue in the last month.
[Malacca] State committee chairman for human resource, health and consumer
affairs Datuk Seah Kwi Tong said the Health department is monitoring the area
after the victims were admitted to hospital.
"We hope residents will co-operate with the local authorities to prevent
dengue by keeping their surroundings clean and free of stagnant water."
Earlier, Taman Malim Jaya and Parameswara residential areas in Melaka Tengah
district were classified as dengue zones but no outbreak has been reported so
far.
Seah said 113 cases of dengue were reported to the department between January
and 11 Mar 2006, compared to the same period last year [2005], when 201 dengue
cases were reported with one death, he said.
He said the Malacca City Council and the department mobile campaign to create
awareness on dengue, which started a few months ago, were not well accepted.
"Not many people bother to visit the mobile van for information on how to
prevent dengue," he said. [This is a strange statement. One would think that
a mobile van would have a loudspeaker to advertise its presence, perhaps with
rousing music, a video presentation in the open air, and volunteers handing
out leaflets about prevention. - Mod.JW]

The Council of Ministers yesterday adopted a series of measures to contain
dengue fever in Jeddah where nearly 400 people, including a number of
expatriates, have been affected by the ailment. It allocated more than SR1.42
billion [USD 378 million] for projects aimed at combating the mosquito-borne
disease.
Culture and Information Minister Iyad Madani said the Cabinet meeting, chaired
by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah, approved the
recommendations made by a ministerial committee that was set up to study
Jeddah's requirements to confront the danger posed by the disease.
"The meeting called for quick implementation of projects to combat dengue
fever in Jeddah," the Saudi Press Agency quoted Madani as saying. The Cabinet
also sought a "radical, effective and comprehensive solution" for this problem
and other problems caused by the non-completion of sewage projects.
The government has already set aside SR7 billion [USD 1.87 billion] for sewage
projects in Jeddah, Madani said. According to Water and Electricity Minister
Abdullah Al-Hussayen, Jeddah's sewage problem would be solved within 3 years.
"Once the ongoing sewage pipeline project is completed, we hope the problem
will be solved once and for all," Al-Hussayen said. [The mosquito vector of
dengue does not usually breed in sewage. The main problem is small containers
such as discarded cans and bottles, flower vases, water coolers, and also
discarded tires containing rainwater. - Mod.JW]
Spelling out the projects approved by the Cabinet to combat dengue fever,
Madani said they included programs to combat mosquitoes and other insects,
fill in areas of stagnant water, aerial spraying, implement health awareness
campaigns, refurbish rainwater canals and prevent environmental pollution
caused by ponds. A 3-year program to monitor and combat the spread of insects
in the city is also under way.
Statistics published by the Health Ministry said at least 402 people in
Jeddah, mostly in the southern part of the city, have been affected by dengue
fever. "62 cases of dengue fever were reported last Friday," said Yasser Al-
Ghamdi, director of health in the Makkah region. 4 dengue fever deaths have
been reported in the Kingdom so far in 2006.

An eastern island of Madagascar has been hit by Dengue fever, with dozens of
people being hospitalized each day, local health officials reported Monday.
A medic on the island of Sainte-Marie said between 30 and 50 people were being
sent to the only hospital on the island each day and that the medical services
there could not cope with the number of new cases turning up.
According to the Health Ministry, a 4-member medical team had been sent to the
island to conduct an investigation. Authorities had also begun to spray
insecticide to kill mosquitoes, which carry the virus.
With only 7 medics serving 20 700 inhabitants on the island, Sainte-Marie
lacks the resources to fight the epidemic or ensure enough sanitation.

[5] Maldives

Maldives has experienced an outbreak of dengue since January 2006, with 602
suspected cases until 5 March 2006 (including 64 cases of dengue haemorrhagic
fever and 9 cases of dengue shock syndrome).
In the Maldives _Ae. aegypti_ is the presumed vector. Both species bite mainly
during the daytime, particularly in the early hours after dawn and for 2-3
hours before darkness. _Aedes albopictus_ is more active outdoors whereas _Ae.
aegypti_ typically feeds and rests more indoors.
Mosquito control is the main outbreak control activity. Close to habitation,
these 2 mosquito species multiply in collections of stagnant water, mostly in
artificial containers. To control the mosquitoes, their breeding sites must be
removed, destroyed, protected, frequently emptied and cleaned, or treated with
insecticides. During epidemics, insecticides are also often applied as space
sprays to kill the adult mosquitoes.
Such measures require the mobilization of affected communities to carry out
critical, well-identified healthy behaviours. The Communications for
Behavioural Impact (COMBI) approach is a powerful strategy to support this
mobilization process both in individuals and communities.
Control measures
----------------
Although transmission of chikungunya and dengue is continuing in the affected
areas, WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from
these areas. However, it is recommended that individuals take precautions to
protect themselves from mosquito bites, e.g., by wearing clothes that minimize
skin exposure and applying insect repellents to exposed skin or clothing in
accordance with label instructions.

Centre for Vulnerability Reduction (WMC) in Tunis:�

[With the large-scale chikungunya activity in the Indian Ocean islands, and
with the documentation of chikungunya activity in Madagascar (albeit
reportedly only a few confirmations), one would question strongly whether this
might be more chikungunya than dengue here. ProMED-Mail would greatly
appreciate receiving further information regarding the simultaneous epidemics
caused by 2 distinct viral pathogens -- especially lab results. - Mod. RY]
