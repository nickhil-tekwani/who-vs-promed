[3] USA (Texas): 1st death, suspected
Date: Tue 30 Aug 2022
Source: STAT [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/30/texas-reports-death-tied-to-monkeypox-a-first-in-the-u-s/


Texas health officials on Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] reported the death of a person with monkeypox -- what appears to be the 1st fatal case in the United States during the unprecedented global outbreak of the virus.

The unidentified person was a resident of Harris County, which is home to Houston, and was "severely immunocompromised," according to the state health department. The agency released few other details -- including the person's sex and age -- but said it was an adult.

Harris County authorities said the person had "various severe illnesses" and died Sunday [28 Aug 2022] at a hospital in the county.

State and county officials also said that the case remained under investigation to determine how monkeypox may have factored into the person's death.

"Monkeypox is a serious disease, particularly for those with weakened immune systems," John Hellerstedt, the commissioner of the state's health services department, said in a statement. "We continue to urge people to seek treatment if they have been exposed to monkeypox or have symptoms consistent with the disease."

Monkeypox deaths have been rare, with 15 fatalities reported globally prior to the Texas case out of some 47 000 documented cases this year [2022]. Deaths have been reported from countries including Spain and Brazil, where the virus has not historically spread, as well as countries in West and Central Africa where the virus is endemic.

Cases in the outbreak have largely been centered among men who have sex with men, particularly those who have multiple sex partners.

As the data show, the vast majority of people infected during the outbreak have recovered from the virus, but the pathogen does pose a particular threat to people who are immunocompromised. Fatal cases have included a man with lymphoma in Brazil and a man in Mexico with HIV, though health officials are still investigating what role monkeypox played in the latter instance. However, the 2 fatal cases in Spain were in younger men -- 31 and 44 -- who were not immunocompromised and had no underlying chronic diseases. Both developed encephalitis, which is brain inflammation.

[4] Vaccine availability and purchase

The US government said on Monday [29 Aug 2022] it would provide about USD 11 million to support the packaging of Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Jynneos monkeypox vaccine at a US-based manufacturer's facility.

The Danish company, which is the maker of the only [US FDA) approved monkeypox vaccine, had earlier this month [August 2022] signed up Michigan-based Grand River Aseptic Manufacturing to package the 2-dose shot.

The production is expected to begin later this year [2022], the US Department of Health and Human Services said, adding that the funding will help the manufacturer recruit more staff and buy additional equipment.

Globally, the number of confirmed monkeypox cases has crossed 47 600 with over 17 000 cases reported in the United States so far.

The Jynneos vaccine is in short supply and US regulators have authorized a method of administration that allows providers to get 5 doses instead of one from a single vial to expand access.

The United States initially ordered 3 million doses and in July [2022] sought another 2.5 million doses. Bavarian Nordic said the additional doses would be packaged at the US facility. The delivery of the total 5.5 million doses is spread across this year [2022] and the next.

More than 207 000 doses of Jynneos vaccine have been given in the country as of 23 Aug 2022, but very few people have received the 2nd shot needed for full protection, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said last week [26 Aug 2022].

A woman has been diagnosed with monkeypox in Israel for the 1st time since the recent outbreak of the virus in the country, the Health Ministry said on Sunday [28 Aug 2022].

The ministry said the woman was diagnosed after she came into close contact with a suspected case.

[6] Tecovirimat treatment

ref: Desai AN, Thompson GR 3rd, Neumeister SM, et al. Compassionate use of tecovirimat for the treatment of monkeypox infection. JAMA. 2022. Epub ahead of print
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus in the same genus as variola (the causative agent of smallpox). A recent global outbreak has led to more than 39â€¯000 cases reported as of 18 Aug 2022. Monkeypox is typically self-limited with symptoms generally lasting between 2 and 4 weeks in prior outbreaks. Hospitalization was required in 13% of patients in a recent study, suggesting the need for effective therapy.

Tecovirimat is an antiviral that inhibits p37, a protein involved in the release of the enveloped virus, dissemination, and viral virulence. In vitro testing has shown activity against both smallpox and monkeypox, and tecovirimat appears to have a favorable clinical safety profile based on the experience of healthy volunteers. We assessed adverse events and clinical resolution of systemic symptoms and lesions in an uncontrolled cohort study of patients with monkeypox who were treated with tecovirimat on a compassionate use basis.

Methods
Patients were eligible for tecovirimat treatment following laboratory confirmation of orthopoxvirus infection from skin lesions by polymerase chain reaction. Outpatients referred to UC Davis primarily through the Sacramento County [California] Department of Public Health between 3 Jun and 13 Aug 2022, and who had disseminated disease or lesions in sensitive areas including the face or genital region, were offered treatment. Oral treatment with tecovirimat for adult patients was weight-based, administered every 8 or 12 hours, and was taken within 30 minutes of a meal containing moderate to high fat content for improved bioavailability. The duration of therapy was 14 days but could be extended depending on the clinical status of the patient. Clinical data were collected at initial in-person evaluation for treatment and by in-person or telephone interview on day 7 and day 21 following initiation of therapy. All patients provided written informed consent. This protocol was approved by the UC Davis Institutional Review Board.

Results
As of 13 Aug 2022, 25 patients with confirmed monkeypox infection had completed a course of tecovirimat therapy (Table). All patients were self-reported male and the median age was 40.7 years (range, 26-76). There were 9 patients who had HIV, 1 patient had received the smallpox vaccine more than 25 years prior, and 4 received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccination after symptom onset. At the time of treatment, systemic symptoms, lesions, or both were present for a mean of 12 days (range, 6-24). Systemic symptoms included fever in 19 patients (76%), headache in 8 (32%), fatigue in 7 (28%), sore throat in 5 (20%), chills in 5 (20%), backache in 3 (12%), myalgia in 2 (8%), nausea in 1 (4%), and diarrhea in 1 (4%). Almost all patients (23 [92%]) had genital and/or perianal lesions, and 13 (52%) had fewer than 10 lesions over their entire body. All patients had pain associated with lesions.

One patient received 21 days of therapy while the remainder were treated for 14 days. Complete resolution of lesions was reported in 10 patients (40%) on day 7 of therapy, while 23 (92%) had resolution of lesions and pain by day 21. Treatment with tecovirimat was generally well tolerated with no patient discontinuing therapy. The most frequently reported adverse events on day 7 of therapy included the following: fatigue in 7 patients (28%), headache in 5 (20%), nausea in 4 (16%), itching in 2 (8%), and diarrhea in 2 (8%) (Table).

Discussion
In this preliminary study, oral tecovirimat was well tolerated by all patients with monkeypox infection, with minimal adverse effects. However, adverse effects could not always be differentiated from symptoms related to the infection. No control group was included, limiting conclusions of antiviral efficacy pertaining to duration of symptoms or severity. Time from symptom onset to presentation was variable among patients, and conclusions related to antiviral use vs natural evolution of disease should be made with caution.

Limited clinical data exist on the use of tecovirimat for monkeypox infection. In one case report, no new lesions followed 24 hours of therapy and no adverse effects occurred by treatment completion at 14 days.

Limitations of the study include the small number of patients, lack of a control group, and selection bias. Additional large-scale studies are needed to elucidate antiviral efficacy, dosing, and adverse events.
