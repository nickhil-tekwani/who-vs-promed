A new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed today in Nata de los Caballeros, in Cocle province. This case is of a teacher who resides in El Cano de Nata and who now is out of danger in the Rafael Estevez Hospital in Aguadulce.

So far this year [2012], in this province 3 confirmed hantavirus cases have been reported, of whom one of the victims died and 2 are stable. However, health authorities request that the Cocle residents maintain their houses and yards clean.

Cleanup and inspection operations are initiated in El Cano de Nata and other sensitive areas in Cocle province, in which the owners of houses and other locales can be fined who maintain breeding areas for rodents.

[The hantavirus most likely responsible for this case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

A 68 year old man, who currently is interned in the Clinica Santa Maria in Santiago, is case number 31 of [a] hantavirus infection so far this year [2012], as indicated on Sunday [25 Mar 2012] by the Institute of Public Health, a unit of the Ministry of Health.

The history of where the infection was acquired is not available, raising the number [of cases to 31] just 3 days after a reported case on 22 Mar [2012] of a 41 year old man, who is interned in the Herminda Martin Hospital in Chillan, and that of a 61 year old man in the same Santa Maria Clinic [as the current new case].

To date, the Institute of Public Health of Chile, the Universidad Austral and the Laboratorio of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica have confirmed 31 cases of the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), 8 of whom have died (5 in the BioBio region, one in the Maule region, one in the Araucania region and one in the Metropolitan region).

[Although the location where this patient acquired his hantavirus infection is not given, he is hospitalized in a clinic in Santiago, the capital city of Chile. Presumably, he was infected somewhere near there, as most of the cases this year (2012) have been acquired in the southern part of the country, and have been hospitalized there.

Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in this HPS case and the previous ones is most likely Andes virus.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg.)
