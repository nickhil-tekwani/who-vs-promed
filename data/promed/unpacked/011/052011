The Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), confirmed
that since the beginning of the year [2010], already 38 [hantavirus
infection] cases have been counted based on data from the DAK Health
Insurance Company in Erlangen [DAK -- Deutsche
Angestellten-Krankenkasse -- which manages a nationwide network, is
Germany's 2nd largest health insurance society. - Mod. TY]. "There
are already more than throughout last year [2009]," said spokeswoman
Tanya Kniele. For the full year 2009 there were 21 cases reported by
LGL. DAK further indicated that nationwide the Robert Koch Institute
has registered 213 cases so far this year [2010].

According to LGL spokeswoman, Claudia Schuller, this year [2010] just
in Lower Franconia already 18 people affected by a hantavirus
[infection] have been reported. The Swabian Alps, Bavarian Forest,
and the Main-Spessart region were the main areas of dissemination in
Bavaria. The incidence of disease in Lower Franconia could be related
to the forest extent of the region. The spread of the virus is
essentially connected with the occurrence of bank voles, which are
considered the main transmitter of the rampant transmission of the
Bavaria hantavirus species Puumala virus. [_Myodes glareolus_, is a
recognized Puumala virus reservoir in Germany. - Mod.TY]. The bank
voles survived the past winter [2009-10] well because they would have
had much food, said Schuller. In particular, the population would
have survived well because there are many beechnuts. How many bank
voles harbor the virus is unclear.

"The transmission to humans occurs through the respiratory tract,"
said Schuller. The main problem was the feces, urine, and the dust in
which the [infected] animals had shed [virus]. Even when gardening or
when sweeping garden houses and basements there is a risk of inhaling
the dust kicked up [carrying] the pathogen. Experts therefore
recommend that these activities be carried out while wearing a mask.

There was a peak in [hantavirus disease], covered in Bavaria since
2001, in 2007. At that time, just in the State of Bavaria there were
296 reported cases of [Puumala] hantavirus [infection]. Just in the
Main-Tauber-Kreis area there were 11 cases, said Hubert Schlereth,
Head of the State Health Department of Tauberbischofsheim. In 2008
and 2009, he reported one case each. So far this year [2010], 2 other
cases are still not confirmed.

The disease is similar to the flu with a few days with fever,
headache, abdominal, and back pain. "The hantavirus type [of
infection that we have here in Germany, causes a relatively mild form
[of disease]," said Schuller from the Bavarian Health and Food Safety
(LGL) in Erlangen. A characteristic of the type of disease Puumala
virus causes is that the virus also attacks the kidneys. Bleeding in
the gastrointestinal tract and the brain may occur but are rare with
this mild [virus] variant [species]. For this hantavirus, which can
be fatal in some cases, there is currently no vaccine.
