The search for the source of the cholera outbreak looks set to continue
after two more cases were confirmed yesterday and test results from two food
factories linked to the outbreak came up blank. Although the Department of
Health suspected cholera bacteria to be rampant at the two factories
condemned for breaching hygiene standards, cultures taken so far have tested
negative for V.cholerae.
Director of Health Dr Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun said samples taken from the
factories, which prepare chicken and duck feet, were "heavily contaminated"
with E-coli and coliform bacteria. More test results are pending.
Investigations into the sources for two cases confirmed yesterday would be
conducted immediately. The two latest victims - a 91-year-old woman in poor
condition and a 69-year-old woman - are both at Princess Margaret Hospital.
Apparently seafood suppliers have ignored Department of Health
recommendations to take water from Ko Teng Hau in Sai Kung, and not the
cholera-infested waters of
Causeway Bay or Aberdeen. Plans to enforce this were shelved in 1995. So far
this year, only seven suppliers have applied for permits to collect water
from Sai Kung. Six applied last year, and four in 1995. The permits last a week.
