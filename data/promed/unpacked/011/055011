Karpo attacks paddy crop in Bicholim
------------------------------------
The paddy crop in the Bicholim district has come under the attack by
a disease locally known as karpo and as such the livelihood of about
100 farmers has been threatened. Crops spread over more than 125
acres [approx. 51 ha] of land has been affected by the disease.

The agriculture department, which was unaware of the fact, took
measures against the disease by spraying and was instructed to
inspect the fields immediately and bring the disease under control.
The disease attacks the paddy during winter season -- the leaves then
get scorched and fall.

Last year [2009] karpo disease had severely attacked crops in
Bicholim. It is hoped that this paddy crop will survive as necessary
spraying of insecticide has been done when the disease was in the
process of further spreading out.

[A range of pathogens have been reported previously to affect rice
crops in India and neighbouring countries. We would be most grateful
for further information on the problem in Goa.
