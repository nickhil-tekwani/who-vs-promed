Ranchers and livestock officials say a western Wyoming rancher who
has seen more than 20 of his cattle test positive for brucellosis
would have much to lose and little to gain by slaughtering his entire herd.

If the Daniel-area rancher doesn't slaughter his herd by 29 Aug
[2008], Wyoming will lose its federal brucellosis-free status. That
would mean additional testing requirements for Wyoming cattle before
they're sold or transported across the state line.

But ranchers throughout western Wyoming must already submit cattle to
additional testing because they're in a brucellosis surveillance area.

"We have to test in order to sell breeding livestock," said a
Daniel-area rancher. "We are not the same as the rest of the state.
We are currently under restriction, and we don't have the same rights
as everybody else in the state."

State Veterinarian Walt Cook has asked the federal government to
extend its slaughter deadline until later this fall [2008], when the
11 other herds that have had contact with the infected herd can be
tested. The USDA [US Department of Agriculture] rejected Cook's
initial request for an extension, and he has appealed that decision.

Another Daniel-area rancher, said by refusing to extend the deadline
for the rancher to make his decision, the federal government is
pressuring the rancher to slaughter his breeding cattle.

"They're trying to force him. They're trying to make it so bad he'll
have to slaughter," [he] said. "The guy's worked on those cows for
years. It's a high-altitude herd. These cattle have been acclimated
to this area. So why should he have to start all over again? He's
choosing between 2 evils."

Livestock officials point out the rancher could preserve some of that
breeding effort through "test and slaughter" - testing his cattle and
killing only those that test positive.

The program would take at least one year to complete. In the
meantime, Wyoming would lose its brucellosis-free status.

The state will also lose its status if another Wyoming herd tests
positive for brucellosis within 2 years.

[A] Wheatland cattle rancher, said he would support the rancher if he
decided not to slaughter his breeding cattle, even though that would
add a burden to his own operation.

"It's a genetic base he's been working on for generations of cattle.
He's been selecting and raising his cattle according to what he sees
as most fit for his environment and the customer," [the cattle
rancher] said. "If he were to depopulate, he'd liquidate that genetic
base that he's been building for years. I understand very much his reluctance."

[The cattle rancher] said he believes the USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service [APHIS] has given the rancher an
unwarranted ultimatum by holding fast to its 29 Aug [2008] slaughter deadline.

"Brucellosis isn't like foot-and-mouth or other highly contagious
diseases," [he] said. "When it has been quarantined, there isn't any
danger to public health, or the health of the national cattle herd."

[The state of Wyoming, in the western United States, can be located
on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=40,-97.6,4>.

The Greater Yellowstone Area includes Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho; it
can be seen on the map at <http://gorp.away.com/gifs/states/wy/m_gryel2.gif>.

The article makes good points in that the disease is contagious
between animals, but certainly not in the same rapid fashion as
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Even in the FMD outbreak in the UK in
2001 the aspect of valuable genetics of animals was an issue.

Given the genetics of the animals and the disease not having the same
spread capacity as FMD, and the fact that Wyoming is already under
surveillance, it would seem prudent on the part of USDA to allow a
little more time for consideration on the issue. After all, this is
likely many years of work and it being the only herd, it is not
presently urgent to depopulate.

It is gratifying to see fellow producers encouraging more time and
understanding that the best way for this owner may not be
depopulation and their support of him.

It is understandable that USDA would like to eliminate this domestic
nidus of infection, but until the Greater Yellowstone Area is free of
the disease, situations like this may offer perhaps even next year.

The disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost
exclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or B.
melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.
suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection
spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In
a herd in which disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts
only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear
normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period
and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection
and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum
agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal
parturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The
incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage
of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and
uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.
Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine
involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid
uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease
of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously
aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal
parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of
time -- in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are
present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and
uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or
lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by
infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission
may occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated
semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited
in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous
membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has
remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to
direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk and cheese
represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking
unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not
killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.
Brucellosis in humans is not a pleasant disease.

Signs and symptoms in people include malaise, fever, chills, sweats,
headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain,
occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal
pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis
has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing
fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time.
