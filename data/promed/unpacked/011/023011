In as much as we are past the mid-point of the 2021-2022 equine reproductive cycle, we thought it was a good time to send a bulletin on confirmed leptospiral abortions submitted to the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) by Kentucky horse farms.

As of today [27 Dec 2021], the UKVDL has confirmed 10 leptospiral abortions for the 2021-2022 foal crop. A 10-year plot of equine leptospiral abortions follows (a total of 97 aborted foals). Chart can be seen [at the source URL].

The first licensed vaccine against leptospirosis was released in the fall of 2015. Since that time, there has been a downward trend for the incidence of lepto abortions based on our diagnostic laboratory cases. To date, there have been no controlled studies to determine a statistical difference between farms vaccinating vs. not vaccinating. For the 2019-2020 foal crop, our laboratory confirmed zero foal abortions. According to our laboratory archives, this has not happened for at least 20 years in Kentucky. The UKVDL conducted a 20-year retrospective study on foal abortions diagnosed from 1993-2012, which identified 541 positive for leptospirosis (see the annual episodic curve by month [at the source URL]). A farm follow-up study conducted for foals aborted during the 2006-2007 foal crop determined the average loss was USD 189 000 per foal. Assuming that has not changed, the losses for the last 10 years would be USD 18 million. Further studies are needed to reassess this data.

If you would like to follow near-real-time data regarding leptospiral abortion and many other animal diseases identified in our laboratory, we invite you to browse Dr. Smith's interactive mapping apps on our website. In just minutes, anyone can visualize the distribution and number of cases confirmed in any Kentucky county, similar to the way in which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Johns Hopkins, and other labs are helping us all to follow the COVID-19 pandemic.

["Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease found in many animals. It is zoonotic, which means it can also be spread to humans. Horses become infected when mucus membranes (in their eyes, mouth, and nose) or cuts and scratches on the legs contact infected urine or blood. Horses can also become infected by ingesting hay or grain and water that has been contaminated by infected urine.

"Clinical signs include depression, fever, loss of appetite, and signs of uveitis -- also called moon blindness -- where inflammation within the eye causes tearing, swelling, discharge, and cloudiness. Chronic uveitis can lead to blindness. Pregnant mares can also abort. Kidney and liver failure can occur with severe infections, leading to death.

"It is unclear how many horses are affected by this disease; some estimates suggest 45% of horses have been or will be exposed.

"How can you prevent this disease? Good farm management is important. Keep feed sources protected from wildlife (such as mice, rats, possums, raccoons, deer, etc). Refresh standing water in troughs.

"Vaccination is a new option. In 2015, Zoetis released an equine leptospirosis vaccine. This vaccine is considered safe in horses 6 months and older, and is safe and recommended for mares during pregnancy to prevent leptospirosis-induced abortion. Studies suggest it is effective in preventing the infection, but because it is a new vaccine, the data is limited to date." [However, it is likely Zoetis has additional information on this vaccine since this is now 2021. - Mod.TG] (https://vet.purdue.edu/vth/large-animal/equine-health-tip-leptospirosis.php) - Mod.TG
