California will kill 3.2 million trout to stop the outbreak of a bacterial infection threatening hatcheries, wildlife officials said Monday [20 Jul 2020].

The trout, which are used to stock waterways for recreational fishing, are in 2 hatcheries in the Owens Valley in the eastern Sierra and one hatchery in the Mojave Desert city of Victorville, northeast of Los Angeles.

Fish at the hatcheries have been infected with _Lactococcus garvieae_, which is similar to streptococcus, wildlife officials said.

"We didn't have any other choice at this point. Our treatments weren't working," said Jay Rowan, environmental program manager for the wildlife department's hatcheries.

Killing the fish and disinfecting the facilities was "the best option we have available" to restore use of the hatcheries in the shortest amount of time, Rowan said.

Outbreaks have been reported in fresh and saltwater fish farms and shellfish hatcheries but also cattle and poultry farms around the world, according to a statement from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife [CDFW].

However, the bacterium had never been detected in fish in California before it was found at the Victorville facility in April [2020]. About 60 000 fish have since died.

The fish to be killed are at Mojave River Hatchery, Black Rock Hatchery and Fish Springs Hatchery. All 3 facilities had been under quarantine for more than a month. Testing hasn't found any bacteria at Hot Creek Hatchery in the eastern Sierra, authorities said.

The depopulation could begin as early as next week and could last up to 4 weeks, Rowan said. "It's going to be a huge effort," he said.

Infected fish can "show signs including bulging eyes, lethargic or erratic swimming, and increased mortality, or be asymptomatic and show no signs of infection," the wildlife agency said in a statement.

Transmitting the bacteria from fish or animals to humans is "rare and unlikely," but there have been a few cases of people with weakened immune systems getting it from infected raw fish and unpasteurized milk products, the statement said.

Rowan said that it's unclear how the fish were infected, but the strain of the bacterium matches the strain found in the Columbia River in Washington state. One possibility is that migrating birds visiting the California hatcheries brought the bacterium in their feces, but investigators are still working on the cause, Rowan said. "We may never find out exactly how this got in," he said.

Other California hatcheries still have tens of millions of trout, but the fish kills will "have a significant impact for a long period of time," he added.

The agency is looking at possibly moving some fish from central and northern hatcheries to stock some waters in the eastern Sierra and Southern California.

[_Lactococcus garvieae_ is the etiological agent of Lactococcosis, an emergent disease which affects many fish species and causes important economic losses, both in marine and freshwater aquaculture when water temperature increases over 16 C [60 F] in summer months. Normally, it causes a hyperacute and haemorrhagic septicemia;

_Lactococcus garvieae_ is the causative agent of lactococcosis, a hyperacute, haemorrhagic septicaemia of fish. This bacterium is also considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen, as reports of human infection are increasing. Significant economic loss in aquaculture is suffered as a result of lactococcosis, as numerous freshwater and marine species of commercial interest are affected. Development of antibiotic resistance in _L. garvieae_ to several chemotherapeutic agents complicates and restricts treatment options. Effective, sustainable treatment and prevention options are thus needed, but progress is impeded by the lack of knowledge concerning several aspects of the disease and the pathogen [Extracted from:
< https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177294/>].

_L. garvieae_ bacteria are known to be present in the US but to date have only been identified in a handful of aquaculture facilities. Its 1st discovery in California was at the Mojave River Hatchery in late April 2020, and the hatchery was immediately placed under quarantine. All sizes of rainbow trout at the facility have been affected, and total mortalities to date are approximately 50 000, with more likely to succumb to the bacteria. CDFW [California Department of Fish and Wildlife] pathologists identified similar bacteria in the Fish Springs and Black Rock Fish hatcheries on 19 Jun 2020, and they were confirmed as _Lactococcus garvieae_ on 25 Jun 2020.

_L. garvieae_ has not previously been found in California, either in aquaculture facilities or in the wild. Pathologists do not know the source of the original outbreak at Mojave River Hatchery. This bacterium is usually spread by movement of fish or eggs, but it is not believed to be the cause in the Mojave River Hatchery. The current thought is that it was carried into the hatchery with birds having picked it up from an environmental source. The hatcheries were quarantined out of caution until it can be determined whether the bacteria are also present in waters in the area.

Fish can be infected with the bacteria, but not be diseased by it, at water temperatures up to 59 F [16 C]. At temperatures above 59 F, the bacteria can become pathogenic for fish. The bacteria can be spread between hatcheries or other water sources through movement of infected fish or eggs. Contaminated equipment (nets, buckets, boots, etc.) may also be capable of spreading it. Once it has spread into a hatchery and a fish becomes infected, it easily spreads from fish to fish.

Disease outbreaks of different types are not uncommon in fish hatcheries. Most fish pathogens are present in the lakes and rivers of the state and come into hatcheries with the water. They only cause infection and disease when conditions such as elevated water temperatures or crowding stress tilt in their favor. Hatchery staff are trained to recognize sick fish, and they work with CDFW veterinarians to treat sick fish as needed. What's unusual about this particular outbreak is that this pathogen is new in California. Further complicating the treatment of the fish is that the bacteria are resistant to most of the few antibiotics approved by the FDA for treating fish in aquaculture. The bacteria show moderate susceptibility to one antibiotic available for use, so we hope it will help the fish clear the infection and recover.

If treatment is unsuccessful, there are 2 options:

- If it can be demonstrated through eDNA survey work that this bacterium is already widespread in the environment in the Eastern Sierra Nevada and Southern California, healthy carriers of the _L. garvieae_ bacterium could still be released without a negative impact on the environment.

- If widespread environmental presence of the _L. garvieae_ bacterium cannot be determined, then the hatchery fish will have to be euthanized [This seems to be the option currently. - Mod.TG].

The cost of antibiotic feed at Mojave River Hatchery alone has already exceeded USD 75 000 in less than 2 months; additional expenses, including laboratory analysis, are accumulating. Despite our best efforts, the bacteria are still present, and mortality at Mojave River Hatchery continues. [Presently, we know the option is euthanasia for the fish at the 3 hatcheries. This is a tremendous loss in fish and in the amount spent for testing and attempted treatment. This is a loss of several times over 1.5 million rainbow, cutthroat, brown and Eagle Lake trout, as this was an estimate of one hatchery in May 2020, and there are now 3 hatcheries involved. - Mod.TG]

Mojave River Hatchery was scheduled to stock multiple waterways in Southern California's higher elevation waters from now through October 2020. The number of waterways affected, by county, include:

- Los Angeles (1)
- San Bernardino (8)
- Riverside (1)
- San Diego (2)
- Orange (1)
- Ventura (0)
- Santa Barbara (0).

An additional 63 lower elevation waterways normally stocked in the winter months (November through April) will not likely receive their scheduled plants. Also, between 59-67 roadside waters in Inyo and Mono counties traditionally stocked by Fish Springs Hatchery and Black Rock Hatchery are likely to not receive plants this year [2020].

_L. garvieae_ bacteria have been passed to humans in rare cases, but fish-to-human transmission is unlikely. As always, anglers should follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations on cooking fish to an internal temperature of 145 F [63 C].
