The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) within weeks will begin testing sick and dead pigs for a hog virus that has killed herds across Asia in an effort to minimize devastation if the disease enters the USA, the agency said on Thursday [16 May 2019].

Increased testing aims to help US officials detect cases of African swine fever quickly so they can contain the disease. African swine fever kills almost all pigs infected, though it is not harmful to people. There is no vaccine or cure. The disease has spread rapidly across China, the world's top pork producer, and in neighboring Vietnam the government said it will mobilize its military and police forces to combat an outbreak.

Cases in the USA would halt shipments in the USD 6.5 billion export market for American pork at a time when the industry is already facing retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Mexico. "An enhanced surveillance program will serve as an early warning system, helping us find any potential disease much more quickly," said Greg Ibach, the USDA's undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs.

The USDA will start testing pigs for African swine fever when it conducts routine tests for another hog disease, classical swine fever. Sick or dead pigs at slaughterhouses and those that are sent to veterinary diagnostic labs will be included in the expanded testing, according to the agency.

Testing for African swine fever is important because its signs can resemble those for diseases already in the USA, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, said Tom Burkgren, executive director for the American Association of Swine Veterinarians. "This is a significant step for them to take which will certainly help discover the 1st case of [African swine fever], if it happens, early on," Burkgren said.

The USDA said it also will work with state and federal officials to identify incidents involving sick or dead feral swine to determine if they should be tested for African swine fever. The US government previously increased screenings for illegal pork products at airports and cracked down on smuggling in an effort to keep out African swine fever. Last week, the chief executive of Tyson Foods Inc said it was "very plausible" the disease could enter the USA because of its rapid spread across Asia.

[This proactive but somewhat passive approach is excellent. It is hoped the USDA will initiate some webinars and training classes for veterinarians as a reminder of what African swine fever looks like when it affects an animal. Veterinarians should be on the alert regarding any deceased pig. It may not be porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome so it is very important to pay extra attention to the lesions and to operate on a level of suspicion. In this case, "better safe than sorry."

This disease, if it should ever enter the USA, would be devastating to the pork industry.

It is also hoped the USDA and other appropriate organizations will pay particular attention to feed, to vitamin premixes and to all aspects of feed transport and imports. The African swine fever virus has been shown to survive and transmit through feed stuffs, including vitamin premixes. - Mod.TG
