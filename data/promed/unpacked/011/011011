Iran destroys thousands of birds in bird flu alert
-----------------------------------------------
Iran has destroyed thousands of birds in an area along its border
with Turkey in an effort to create a buffer against the spread of bird flu.
Homayoon Hamidi, head of the Veterinary Organization of Maku, West
Azarbaijan province, said 2600 birds in 9 villages were destroyed,
with all birds in the remaining 23 villages facing the same fate in
the next 6 days, the official IRNA news agency reported Sunday [15 Jan 2006].
The health and veterinary officials are on alert in the area "to take
controlling measures and prevent the disease from entering Iran,"
health ministry official Seyed Moayed Alavian told the Shargh daily.
"Only free range birds are to be destroyed, as factory reared
chickens are under control," another press report quoted Kamyar
Dahim, the head of West Azarbaijan province's Veterinary
Organization, as saying.
Iran's Health Minister, Kamran Lankarani, said no bird flu cases have
yet been found in Iran.
The Islamic republic has already banned poultry imports from Turkey
and urged its citizens not to travel there. It has also closed its
land frontier to single day cross border traders.
Fearing the transmission of the disease by migrating birds, Iran's
Environmental Organization has put 10 inland water areas on red alert
and has strictly banned hunting and the sale of hunted wildfowl.
2 Turkish children from the town of Dogubeyazit, just 45 km (28
miles) from the country's eastern border with Iran, died last week
after playing with a sick chicken.

Syria culls birds near Turk border to prevent flu
-----------------------------------------------
Syria culled birds at a market near the Turkish border on Sunday [15
Jan 2006] to prevent the spread of bird flu across the border, though
the birds showed no sign of illness, a health official said.
"Any poultry on sale in an unregulated market and any pigeons or game
are now culled," said George Khoury, head of the animal health
department at the Agriculture Ministry.
"No country is safe from the risk of bird flu today, especially not
Syria, because it neighbors Turkey."
The birds were being traded at an unregulated market where live birds
are sold every Sunday in the northeastern town of Kameshli on the
Turkish border, he said.
"The city is taking precautions against the spread of bird flu,"
Kibrael Kourou, a city official, told the state news agency SANA.
Health officials also shut down the town's regular bird market and
inspected poultry shops for hygiene, SANA said.
A Turkish girl who died on Sunday [15 Jan 2006] in eastern Van
province is suspected to be the 4th child killed by avian influenza
since the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus was found in many parts of Turkey.
Syria shares a 490 km (300 mile) border with Turkey. Scientists have
said the virus could be spread by infected birds migrating south for winter.
More than 18 000 birds have been tested in Syria, and no human cases
of bird flu have been reported, Khoury said.

Duck Shot In Scotland Tests Positive For Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------------
A duck shot dead in Scotland was suffering from a strain of bird flu,
it emerged last night [14 Jan 2006].
Scientists performing checks on birds across Britain as part of a
government investigation into whether the disease has reached this
country, found that a wild mallard shot in West Lothian last month
[December 2005] was the only one that tested positive for avian influenza.
A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
spokesman said the findings were not a cause of immediate concern, as
the duck was not carrying the virulent H5N1 strain of the disease,
which has been provoking alarm across Europe.
But experts believe the discovery underlines the difficulties
involved in ensuring that the UK stays free of a disease that could
be imported by migrating birds.
Defra's 1st study of wild British birds involved almost 1500
carcasses, with samples caught live and shot.

[An update of the report, from which the above information is
derived, was published by DEFRA on 11 Jan 2006; it is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/wildbirds/survey-results.htm>.
Investigations in England and Wales are carried out by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), in Scotland by the Scottish Agricultural
Colleges Laboratories (SAC) and in Northern Ireland by DARD's
Veterinary Sciences Division laboratory.
The surveillance is targeting high pathogenicity avian influenza
virus (HPAI) subtypes H5 or H7, low pathogenicity avian influenza
virus (LPAI) subtypes H5 or H7, and low pathogenicity avian influenza
virus (LPAI) subtypes other than H5 or H7.
Out of 1102 live caught birds in various parts of the UK, not a
single one was found positive, while out of 279 freshly shot birds,
one bird was found infected. This isolate, reported on 7 Dec 2005,
related to a Low Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) virus (subtype
H6N2) strain. The sample was taken from a wild mallard duck that was
shot in West Lothian, Scotland.
Similar surveillance activities are operational in other European
countries, North America and elsewhere (see refs.). - Mod.AS]
