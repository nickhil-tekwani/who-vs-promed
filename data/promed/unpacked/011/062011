Rabies death in UK prompts WHO travel warning
---------------------------------------------
On Thu 7 Jun 2012 the World Health Organization [WHO] has issued a travel warning after a British woman died from rabies, contracted from a dog in India [see ProMED-mail archived reports below]. India has now been slapped with a "high risk" rabies warning, with recommendations for travellers to be immunised before visiting the country. The unnamed woman contracted the disease as a result of an untreated bite from a dog in India. Her death has prompted the organisation to introduce detailed country-by-country advice on pre-travel rabies vaccination, to sit alongside recommendations for yellow fever and malaria protection. In the case of India, for example, it now says: "Rabies: High risk - Pre-exposure immunisation [is] recommended for travellers and other people for whom contact with domestic animals, particularly dogs, and other rabies vectors is likely" - advice that is repeated verbatim for almost every other tropical country.

Dr Mary Warrell, a virologist and specialist in rabies, said last month's incident was a timely reminder of the need for precautions. "In unvaccinated humans, dog rabies infection is 100 per cent fatal once symptoms appear," she added. Other than for short trips to main tourist destinations, all travellers should consider rabies vaccination. Gap-year travellers, frequent travellers, those on longer trips, anyone going far from the beaten track or likely to be in close contact with local communities or animals should have the vaccine.

Vaccine shortages are common, but at the moment the vaccine is readily available at specialist travel clinics. Rabies vaccine for travel is not provided on the NHS [National Health Service]. Ask your travel clinic for advice. For short trips, last-minute vaccination may be unhelpful unless you have future trips in mind. But if you are about to leave for a longer trip, it is sometimes worth starting the course before you go and taking the remaining doses with you.

Rabies can affect any mammal, though most cases are transmitted by dog saliva. You don't need to be bitten: licks or scratches, especially on damaged or broken skin, are also a risk. If bitten scrub and rinse the wound thoroughly, and disinfect with alcohol or strong antiseptic. Get prompt local advice, and back this up with a call to your travel insurance company, your doctor, or a specialist travel clinic. Always report a bite, and seek specialist help. Without prior rabies vaccination, you may need a rapid vaccine course, plus an injection of rabies immune globulin (RIG). RIG is scarce and very expensive, and reliable treatment can be hard to find. With the pre-travel ("pre-exposure") rabies vaccination, simple booster doses are all that are needed following a bite. These provide full protection.

[This travel alert could apply equally to other regions of the world where rabies is still prevalent. Worldwide, rabies is believed to be killing about 55 000 people per year, with canine rabies most prevalent in South East Asia and Africa, while bat rabies predominates in South America. The human death toll in India has been estimated as 35 000 per annum, but may now be declining. - Mod.CP
