Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) announces since 2012, rates of syphilis among both men and women have been steadily increasing in Los Angeles county and in California. Cases in women rose by 50 percent from 2016 to 2017, affecting individuals in almost every area of the county. Most notably, more pregnant women have been diagnosed with syphilis and the number of cases of congenital syphilis has increased over the past 5 years, from 6 in 2012 to 44 cases in 2017.

Due to the increase in congenital syphilis cases, Public Health is recommending more rigorous syphilis screening guidelines to include expanded 3rd trimester screening and a recommendation to screen all women of reproductive age (15-44 years) for syphilis at least once. "My goal is to eliminate congenital syphilis cases in LA county," said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. "Enhanced collaboration and partnership with local hospitals, community based organizations, and school districts throughout the County is key to help raise awareness, increase screenings and drive congenital syphilis rates down."

Public Health recently launched a medical provider education campaign aimed at improving awareness of syphilis trends and guidelines and earlier detection and treatment of syphilis in women before they may become pregnant. During an 8-week period in May and June [2018], Public Health representatives will provide syphilis tutorials and assessments to more than 500 medical providers who serve patients at higher risk of syphilis and pregnant women.

Other county efforts include jail-based screening programs, expedited partner treatment to local clinics, and free and low cost online ordering options for home delivery of condoms and STD [sexually transmitted diseases] test kits. Public Health is also working with the local Comprehensive Sexual Health Education Network to implement the newly enacted California Healthy Youth Act, which mandates comprehensive STD/HIV prevention education in middle and high schools.

[The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA: congenital, rising incidence 20180208.5615435:

Congenital syphilis occurs when a child is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time that pregnancy is confirmed. Testing should be repeated for pregnant women at high risk and in areas of high prevalence at the beginning of the 3rd trimester and at delivery.

The 2015 US CDC guidelines for syphilis screening in pregnancy can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis-pregnancy.htm:

"All women should be screened serologically for syphilis early in pregnancy (106). Most states mandate screening at the 1st prenatal visit for all women (441). In populations in which receipt of prenatal care is not optimal, RPR test screening [the RPR, or rapid plasma reagin, test, is a blood test for syphilis that detects non-treponemal antibody] and treatment (if the RPR test is reactive) should be performed at the time pregnancy is confirmed (442). Antepartum screening by non-treponemal antibody testing is typical, but treponemal antibody testing is being used in some settings. Pregnant women with reactive treponemal screening tests should have additional quantitative non-treponemal testing, because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. For communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for women at high risk for infection, serologic testing should also be performed twice during the 3rd trimester: once at 28-32 weeks' gestation and again at delivery. Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy, and if the mother is considered high risk, documented at delivery."
