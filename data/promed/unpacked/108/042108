48 cases of brucellosis were reported in Getashen community in central Kotayk province, Armine Sukiasyan, a spokeswoman for the State Food Safety Service, told ARKA.

She said that all 48 cows were culled. She added that authorities were working to discover other animals possibly infected with brucellosis. The spokeswoman said also that the movement of cattle in the community is under 24-hour monitoring to prevent further spread of the disease. Meanwhile, the health ministry said it had no information about residents of the community being infected with the disease.

Brucellosis is a highly contagious disease caused by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from infected animals or close contact with their secretions. Transmission from human to human is rare but possible. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.

[Brucellosis is endemic in Armenia, similar to most if not all countries in the eastern Mediterranean, Asia and Africa (map in the reference). According to OIE data, during 2012, 112 outbreaks of _B. abortus_ and 61 of _B. melitensis_ have been reported in Armenia's cattle and sheep/goats, respectively. Though cattle are generally known to be mostly infected by _Brucella abortus_, spillover to cattle from sheep/goats is not rare in countries affected by _B. melitensis_. It would be interesting to note which species of brucellosis bacteria have been found to be involved in this outbreak in cattle; _B. melitensis_ is regarded as more pathogenic to humans.

The following data, available on the zoonoses page of OIE's WAHID interface, pertains to the annual numbers of human cases in Armenia and in its 4 neighbouring countries:

Country / year / cases / per million population
Armenia / 2011 / 250 / 82.9
Georgia / 2011 / 167 / 35.70
Azerbaijan / 2012 / 275 / 34.76
Iran / 2012 / 8610 / 126.58
Turkey / 2012 / 6759 / 97.03

According to Armenia's annual report for 2012, no vaccination against bovine or ovine/caprine brucellosis has been applied. If this information is accurate, and if the same policy is continued, brucellosis is anticipated to spread further with a likely rise in human infection.
