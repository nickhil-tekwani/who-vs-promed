Its origins pointed to one conclusion: that only the government
scientist could be behind the 2001 attacks. Federal investigators
cinched their case against alleged anthrax mailer Bruce E. Ivins
after sophisticated genetic tests by a California firm helped them
trace a signature mixture of anthrax spores, the Los Angeles Times has learned.

Well before the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings, Ivins, through his work
as a government scientist, had combined anthrax spores obtained from
at least one outside laboratory, people familiar with the evidence said.

With the help of leading outside geneticists and a fresh look at the
evidence by a new team of street-savvy investigators, the FBI
concluded in recent months that only Ivins could reasonably have
perpetrated the crimes. Ivins, 62, a senior microbiologist at the
government's elite biodefense research institute at Ft. Detrick, Md.,
died last Tuesday in an apparent suicide as federal prosecutors
prepared to bring murder charges against him.

Records reviewed by The Times and interviews with people
knowledgeable about the investigation provide new details about the
trail of evidence that finally led to Ivins.

Since 1980, Ivins had specialized in developing vaccines against
anthrax and other biological weapons. He experimented with animals,
including monkeys, rabbits and guinea pigs. Ivins had mixed spores
shipped to Ft. Detrick from the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah,
a facility operated by the Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio, a
private contractor that performs top-secret work for the CIA and
other agencies.

By cross-referencing the dates when those spores were received and
handled at Ft. Detrick, the FBI sharply narrowed the list of
government employees with possible access to the material.

Instead of trying to trace anthrax that could have come from perhaps
dozens of sources, investigators became convinced that it had to have
originated at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases, or USAMRIID, located within Ft. Detrick, about 50 miles
north of Washington. "Now, all of a sudden, you can put a time frame
on this material," said one of the people familiar with the evidence.
"By mixing the material from the separate institutions, [Ivins]
provided what became a signature." With new analyses showing that the
admixture of anthrax could not have come from anywhere in the world
but Ft. Detrick, FBI agents plunged deep into Ivins' history.

That history included a pattern of letter-writing to newspapers. In
one he defended the safety of research conducted on anthrax at Ft.
Detrick. "The only way I can think of being seriously injured by
anthrax or plague vaccine is to get plunked on the head by a vial of
the stuff," Ivins wrote in a letter published 12 Apr 1997, in the
Frederick (Md.) News-Post.

Immediately after the 2001 mailings, the FBI had turned to Ivins and
his Ft. Detrick colleagues to help them with initial analyses of the
anthrax evidence recovered in their investigation.

As the investigation ground on, authorities enlisted colleagues of J.
Craig Venter, founder of a Rockville, Md. institute that had helped
map the human genome. Based on analyses performed at the Institute
for Genomic Research, Venter said the culprit "almost had to be a
government scientist." The institute's analysis was completed under
contract to the FBI and the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. Venter said federal investigators within the
last 2 years retrieved the anthrax evidence from the institute. "The
FBI came in and took freezers and all the samples," he said in an
interview Sunday [3 Aug 2008].

Ibis Biosciences, a company in Carlsbad, performed some of the most
recent anthrax analysis. The company tells its clients, including the
FBI, that its high-resolution anthrax genotyping kit provides
analyses more advanced than any other technology worldwide.

The forensic analysis of the anthrax sent in the mailings had long
posed a challenge to the FBI, whose in-house scientists were not
equipped to decipher the potential origin of the material. Some of
the 1st analysis was performed by Ivins and other scientists at
USAMRIID; such efforts also were attempted at Battelle, but
technicians there rendered some of the material forensically useless
by first sterilizing it with steam, scientists told The Times. A
spokesman for Battelle, T.R. Massey declined earlier this year [2008]
to discuss Battelle's role.

Six years ago, Ivins acknowledged to an Army investigator his use of
"Ames strain" anthrax spores obtained from Dugway. "We currently use
Ames spores prepared at Dugway Proving Ground in 1997 for our
challenges," Ivins told the investigator on 10 May 2002, as part of
the Army's investigation of his failure to report what he described
as accidental spillages of anthrax spores near or within his office
and other non-laboratory areas at USAMRIID.

After he bleached those areas in December 2001, Ivins kept it a
secret for 5 months, according to what he told the Army. It also was
in December 2001 that FBI agents began questioning potential suspects
at Ft. Detrick, a development that former colleagues say may have
driven Ivins to panic regarding whether powder from the mailings
could be traced to him. When he acknowledged his stealth bleaching to
the Army in April 2002, Ivins said that he had not wanted to "cry
wolf" and distract his colleagues, who along with him were helping
the FBI to analyze anthrax powder and other materials being gathered
in the criminal investigation.

The FBI Sunday [3 Aug 2008] refused to comment on how it had focused
on Ivins. "As soon as the legal constraints barring disclosure are
removed, we will make public as much information as possible," said
FBI Assistant Director John Miller. "We will do that at one time, in
one place. We will do that after those who were injured and the
families of those who died are briefed, which is only appropriate."

In a possible break for the FBI's investigation of the anthrax
letters of 2001, scientists have discovered that the mailed anthrax
was a mix of 2 slightly different samples, giving the bacteria a
distinct signature that might make it easier to match with a source,
according to 2 non-government experts who have been told of the finding.

The discovery that bacteria taken from the letters all grew in the
double pattern was made at least a year ago, and it is not known
whether the FBI's hunt for a matching sample has succeeded. The
bureau and its scientific consultants are screening dozens of anthrax
samples collected all over the United States and in some foreign
countries seeking the closest match to the spores used in the attack,
according to a scientist who advises the FBI.

The FBI progress report, requested in March 2008 by U.S. District
Judge Reggie B. Walton, is likely to be less about old-fashioned
police work than newfangled science, according to statements made in
court by FBI and Justice Department officials. [Walton was presiding
over a lawsuit filed by former Army biowarfare expert Dr. Steven J.
Hatfill]. The case of the anthrax-laced letters that killed 5 people
and sickened at least 17 others in 2001 has become the 1st major test
of an emerging scientific discipline called bioforensics, the use of
genetic analysis and other modern laboratory tools to track germs
used in an attack back to their origin.

FBI spokeswoman Debra Weierman declined last week to discuss the
investigation, except to say that tests on the anthrax powder have
not been completed. But experts on the fast-developing science of
biological sleuthing say it should by now have helped the bureau to
substantially narrow the search. "I think we have the science now to
trace the anthrax to a particular lab," said Babetta L. Marrone, a
cell biologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratories and a member
of an FBI advisory group on bioforensics. Still, she says finding the
source lab will not by itself identify a perpetrator, only reduce the
number of potential suspects. "If I had to guess, I'd say what has
the FBI stumped is the non-scientific stuff," Marrone said.

An affidavit filed by FBI Inspector Richard L. Lambert in January
[2004] described a major scientific effort to define the "specific
forensic signature" of the attack anthrax. "To forensically
characterize the anthrax evidence ... the FBI has contracted with 19
government, commercial and university laboratories, which are
performing research, analyses and evaluations to assist the FBI
Laboratory," Lambert wrote. "Most of these scientific initiatives are
scheduled to be completed within the next 6 months. If successful,
these initiatives will ... facilitate the attribution of the anthrax
used in the attacks to one or more U.S. and foreign laboratories."

Of 30 FBI special agents and 13 U.S. postal inspectors working
full-time on the case, officials say, 8 of the FBI agents have a
doctorate "in a scientific discipline related to the investigation."

The finding that the attack anthrax came from a combination of 2
distinct samples is one small step in that new science. Like other
bacteria, anthrax grown in the laboratory forms tiny colonies of
bacteria that can have particular physical characteristics. Colonies
from different strains or samples can be larger or smaller, have more
or less uneven edges or form distinctive shapes.

While all the anthrax used in the attacks is a variant of the Ames
strain, scientists found that the spores recovered from the envelopes
grew into 2 slightly different kinds of colonies. That might mean
part of the original sample was removed from a freezer and grown for
a period of days, allowing very slight genetic mutations, and then
recombined with the original sample, according to the 2 outside
experts familiar with the tests. The perpetrator might then have
taken a sample from the mixed batch and used it to grow the bacteria
used in the attack. The double pattern gives the mailed anthrax one
more distinctive characteristic to be compared with possible sources.

"Potentially, that could be very useful," one scientist said.

U.S. Army personnel who act in an aggressive or threatening manner
towards other people would be denied access to toxic or lethal
biological agents under newly revised regulations that were issued by
the Army last week.

Other potentially disqualifying personality traits include:
"arrogance, inflexibility, suspiciousness, hostility, ... and extreme
moods or mood swings," according to the new regulations.
