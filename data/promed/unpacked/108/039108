What Caused 2009 H1N1 Pandemic?
-------------------------------
Researchers say they've identified biochemical process behind 'swine flu'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The [pandemic] 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus used a new biochemical trick
to hijack host cells, a feat that triggered the recent pandemic,
according to an international team of scientists. "We have found why
the pandemic H1N1 virus replicated so well in humans," Yoshihiro
Kawaoka, a leading influenza expert and a professor of
pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
School of Veterinary Medicine, said in a university news release [see
(2) below].

The H1N1 virus is a combination of 4 different avian and swine flu
viruses that emerged over the past 90 years. It also includes genetic
residue of the 1918 pandemic virus that killed as many as 20 million
people, Kawaoka explained.

A typical flu virus requires the presence of two amino acids --
lysine and asparagine -- in specific sites on a key avian protein
[PB2] in order to jump from an animal and replicate efficiently in
human cells. But Kawaoka and colleagues found that the lysine amino
acid is located in a completely different location on the avian [PB2]
protein in the [pandemic] H1N1 virus. This is what gives the virus
the ability to adapt to and co-opt human cells. The study is
published in the 5 Aug 2010 issue of PLoS Pathogens [see (3) below].
"This pandemic H1N1 [virus] has this mutation and is why it can
replicate so well in humans. This gives us another marker to help
predict the possibility of future flu pandemics," Kawaoka said.

As of 25 Jul 2010, the pandemic virus had caused more than 18 398
deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

H1N1 flu virus used new biochemical trick to cause pandemic
-----------------------------------------------------------
The influenza virus, scientists well know, is a crafty,
shape-shifting organism, constantly changing form to evade host
immune systems and jump from one species, like birds, to another,
mammals. Now, in a report in the current (5 Aug 2010) Public Library
of Science Pathogens [abstract and authors' summary reproduced at (3)
below], an international team of scientists shows that the recent
pandemic- causing H1N1 flu virus used a new biochemical trick to
spread efficiently in humans. The new work expands the repertoire of
known factors flu viruses can use to hijack a host cell and amplify
infection in mammals, including humans. The discovery not only yields
new insight into the subtle biology of flu, but also reveals another
genetic marker public health officials can use to presage pandemics.

"We have found why the pandemic H1N1 virus replicated so well in
humans," says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, one of the world's leading influenza
experts and a professor of pathobiological sciences at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Veterinary Medicine. The H1N1 flu
virus caused a worldwide epidemic in 2009 and 2010, sickening as many
as 34 million Americans and causing up to an estimated 6000 deaths in
the United States alone. The H1N1 virus, Kawaoka explains, is really
a combination of 4 different avian and swine flu viruses that have
emerged over the past 90 years, and even includes genetic residue of
the 1918 pandemic virus, an influenza that killed as many as 20 million people.

Typically, the presence of 2 amino acids -- lysine and asparagine --
in specific sites on a key avian protein are required for a flu virus
to make the jump from an animal host and replicate efficiently in
human cells. The [pandemic] H1N1 virus lacked both of these amino
acid building blocks, posing a puzzle for scientists. The new study
found that the lysine amino acid resides in a completely different
location on the protein and is responsible for the [pandemic] H1N1
virus's ability to adapt to and co-opt human cells. "This pandemic
H1N1 has this mutation and is why it can replicate so well in
humans," says Kawaoka, who also is a professor at the University of
Tokyo. "This gives us another marker to help predict the possibility
of future flu pandemics."

The new PLoS Pathogens report also includes critical data for the
3-dimensional structure of the H1N1 protein known as PB2, which
originated from an avian virus. The structure was derived from an
exquisite X-ray crystallographic study produced by the Seattle
Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSCGID), a
consortium of Washington State-based organizations whose mission is
to provide a "blueprint" for the development of new drugs, vaccines
and diagnostics for deadly infectious diseases.

The structural data, says Kawaoka, provide essential insight into how
the virus interacts with the host cell, and could help provide a
basis for antiviral agents that could be used to thwart a future flu
virus that uses the same amino acid trick to infect human cells.
"Clearly, the host factors in human cells are doing something. The
structure may help us better understand the interplay between the
virus and the host human cell."

According to Bart L. Staker of Emerald BioStructures, Inc., a member
of the SSCGID, the structural data also reveals changes in the
surface shape of the avian virus protein in H1N1, which could, in
turn, be responsible for thwarting factors in the human cell that
would otherwise inhibit infection.

Peter Myler, a principal investigator at Seattle Biomedical Research
Institute (Seattle BioMed) and leader of the SSCGID, said the
structural data plays an essential role in shedding new light on the
H1N1 virus. "By determining the 3-dimensional structure of this
protein, we have new information that can be used to develop
much-needed new interventions for this deadly disease," explains Myler.

Ref: Biological and Structural Characterization of a Host-Adapting
Amino Acid in Influenza Virus.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Yamada S, Hatta M, Staker BL, Watanabe S, Imai M, et al. (2010)]

Abstract:
---------
Two amino acids (lysine at position 627 or asparagine at position
701) in the polymerase subunit PB2 protein are considered critical
for the adaptation of avian influenza A viruses to mammals. However,
the recently emerged pandemic H1N1 viruses lack these amino acids.
Here, we report that a basic amino acid at position 591 of PB2 can
compensate for the lack of lysine at position 627 and confers
efficient viral replication to pandemic H1N1 viruses in mammals.
Moreover, a basic amino acid at position 591 of PB2 substantially
increased the lethality of an avian H5N1 virus in mice.

We also present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the
C-terminus of a pandemic H1N1 virus PB2 protein. Arginine at position
591 fills the cleft found in H5N1 PB2 proteins in this area,
resulting in differences in surface shape and charge for H1N1 PB2
proteins. These differences may affect the protein's interaction with
viral and/or cellular factors, and hence its ability to support virus
replication in mammals.

Author Summary:
---------------
Influenza viruses that originate from avian species likely have to
acquire adapting amino acid changes to replicate efficiently in
mammals. 2 amino acid changes in the polymerase PB2 protein -- a
glutamic acid to lysine change at position 627 or an aspartic acid to
asparagine change at position 701 -- are known to allow influenza
viruses of avian origin to replicate efficiently in mammals.
Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1 viruses (which possess an avian-like
PB2 gene) do not encode the 'human-type' amino acids PB2-627K and PB2-701N.

Here, we report that a basic amino acid at position 591 of PB2 can
compensate for the lack of PB2-627K and allows efficient replication
of highly pathogenic H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viruses in mammalian
species. We also present the X-ray crystal structure of the
C-terminal portion of a pandemic H1N1 PB2 protein. The basic amino
acid at position 591 fills a distinctive cleft found in the PB2
proteins of H5N1 viruses. We also speculate on the biological
significance of the altered surface of the H1N1 PB2 protein.

[The authors have discovered that a basic amino acid at position 591
of the PB2 polymerase protein can compensate for the lack of PB2-627K
and allows efficient replication of a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus
and the pandemic H1N1 virus in mammalian species. This is a
significant discovery and time will tell whether other avian
influenza viruses evolve to replicate in mammals by this route. - Mod.CP]
