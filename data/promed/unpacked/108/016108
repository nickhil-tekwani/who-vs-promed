Hand, foot & mouth disease: National University Hospital sets up an
isolation ward
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Hand, foot and mouth disease has landed 19 children in hospital,
with the total number of cases reported rising to 363 as of yesterday [2
Oct 2000. None of the children is seriously ill, although 2 are in
intensive care, said Dr Phua Kong Boo, Head of the Paediatrics Department
at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), where most of the children are
located. One is the 5-year-old brother of the 2 toddlers who died on 30 Sep
2000. He is not in danger but is being kept in intensive care as a
precaution. The other is a 1-year-old child whose breathing is faster than
normal.
The National University Hospital (NUH) has set up an isolation ward for
children suffering from this highly contagious disease. [All child-care
centres have been closed, and as a further precaution play areas, wading
pools and library programs for young children were closed yesterday. There
have been 363 reported cases of hand, foot and mouth disease since 12 Sep
2000, and a total of 4 toddlers diagnosed with the disease died last month.
Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang
noted that between 7 and 11 young children in Singapore die of viral
infection of the lungs every year. But it was unusual for 4 to die within a
month, he said. Mr. Lim said that as well as trying to identify the virus
locally, samples had been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, USA.
