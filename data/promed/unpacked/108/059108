Public health officials in Wales are investigating 2 _E. coli_ O157 infections at different primary schools in the country. Public Health Wales, Conwy County Borough Council, and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board are looking into a case of _E. coli_ O157 at a primary school in Abergele. The same 3 agencies are also investigating a probable case of E. coli O157 at a primary school in Conwy to try and find the source. There is currently no evidence in either case to suggest the child acquired the infection at the school.

Richard Firth, consultant in public health at Public Health Wales, said _E. coli_ infections can be serious. "Parents and guardians of pupils that attend the school and who may have had contact with this case have been contacted and advised on infection prevention and control measures, and what steps to take if their child develops symptoms. Contacts have been asked to submit samples for testing and to remain off school until negative results are received," he said. "Anyone who is unwell with diarrhea or vomiting should stay away from school, nursery or work until they are advised by a medical professional that they are well enough to return or they are free from symptoms for at least 48 hours."

Those suffering with diarrhea or vomiting are advised to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, preparing food or serving food for others and after going to the toilet. All surfaces, including food preparation surfaces and door handles, should be cleaned on a regular, at least daily, basis with standard cleaning materials.

People can become infected through eating contaminated food and from direct contact with animals. Sick people can pass the infection to others.

[Enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ are strains that produce Shiga toxin and are zoonotic in origin. Initially linked to undercooked ground beef with strain O157, other strains can also be toxin producers and transmission to people can also be related to contaminated produce and unpasteurized dairy products as well as from exposure to petting zoos and from recreational and municipal water sources. Person-to-person transmission can also occur. These strains have a longer incubation period than other _E. coli_ enteropaths and often present with significant abdominal pain and watery diarrhea which can then become bloody. There is generally little or no fever with this illness. A small number of cases can progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome and can result in overt renal failure which is usually reversible. Fatalities can occur often related to central nervous system complications.

It is not clear at this point if the 2 isolates are genetically linked or represent independent events. - Mod.LL
