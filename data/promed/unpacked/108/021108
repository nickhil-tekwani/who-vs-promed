Hepatitis E kills 12 in Kaabong
-------------------------------
So far, 12 people have died and 210 have been admitted following an
outbreak of hepatitis E in Kaabong district in northeastern Uganda.
Michael Lochiyo, the district health educator, said scores had been
admitted at Kaabong Health Centre IV and other health centres. "We
have been hit by an increasing number of patients and deaths in the
district," he said.

Hepatitis E is a viral infection that is transmitted through drinking
water or eating contaminated food. The virus is found in the stool of
infected persons or animals.

In 2007, there was an outbreak of hepatitis E in northern Uganda,
killing 169 people and infecting over 10 000. In Karamoja, the
disease was first diagnosed in Kaabong district in August 2009 with a
few cases in the town. However, the last few weeks have seen a
spillover to neighbouring sub-counties due to poor sanitation. "The
most affected sub-counties are Kaabong rural and Sidok, where the
health authorities are registering at least 4 cases daily. Some are
treated and discharged," said Lochiyo. He attributed the spread of
the disease to the local cultural belief, which discourages latrine usage.

"The Karimojong [an ethnic group of agro-pastoral herders living
mainly in the north-east of Uganda] defecate in river beds that are
also places where they scoop water to drink or for domestic use," he
said. The health officer noted that latrine coverage in Kaabong
district stands at only 2 percent. He urged residents to construct
latrines and use them since the disease is spread through contact
with feacal matter. Lochiyo advised people in the affected areas to
boil water for drinking, wash their hands with soap after using the
toilet and remove children's faeces from homes.

"The source of the disease is Sudan where there are no interventions
to contain its spread," Peter Opika Opoka, the Uganda Red Cross
coordinator in Kitgum, said recently. The outbreak in Kitgum district
two years ago could be traced to a family in Madi Opei that hosted a
Sudanese national, Opoka noted.

[The hepatitis E virus outbreak that was confirmed in Uganda for the
1st time in Kitgum district in 2007 has now spread to Kaabong
district. The inappropriate methods of fecal disposal and poor access
to safe water have facilitated the rapid spread of the infection.
There is therefore need for a behavioral change campaign to improve
personal hygiene and sanitation since outbreak control relies heavily
on improving access to safe water, personal hygiene, and safe
disposal of human excreta.
