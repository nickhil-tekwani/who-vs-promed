A marked increase in the number of cases of meningitis was reported by the
health services in the Gaza strip in late May and early June. Most cases
were in children in the age group 2-5 years with, in general, mild symptoms,
few complications and no deaths. The increase was detected through the
strengthened preparedness for infectious diseases prevention and control set
up by the health authorities in accordance with WHO recommendations in which
all cases of suspected meningitis are notified and investigated in the
laboratory.
During January-May 1997 a total of 180 cases of meningitis were reported
compared with 121 during the same period in 1996. The increase in 1997 was
particularly marked in the fourth week of May in the northern part of the
Gaza Strip. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 54 cases, mainly
associated with _Neisseria meningitidis_ but also _Haemophilus influenzae_,
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and other bacteria. During the first 10 days of
June, 157 cases of meningitis were reported to the Palestinian Ministry of
Health, with the daily numbers increasing from four on 1 June to 26 on 10
June. All parts of the Gaza Strip were affected by the outbreak but the
highest rate was in the north. Of the 157 investigated cases, 149 were
diagnosed as aseptic meningitis. Echoviruses and other enteroviruses have
been isolated from specimens from these cases which were investigated
by the virology laboratory in Tel-Hashomer in Israel.

[Sort of difficult to say what country this refers to. As diagnostics were
done in Israel, let's just assume, for now, this is an outbreak among
Palestinians in Israel. Doesn't really matter medically, though. -- Mod CHC
