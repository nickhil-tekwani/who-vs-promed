CJD (NEW VAR.) AND HUMAN PrP GENOTYPES: RFI
===========================================

The paper by Collinge et al (Nature 383, 685-690)served to dispel previous
doubts that BSE is the cause of new variant CJD. However, Collinge et al
also showed that all cases of new variant CJD that had been investigated at
that time were associated with the Codon 129 MM genotype. This should be of
some comfort to those who believe an epidemic of new Variant CJD is
inevitable as it now seems probable that only those with the 129 MM genotype
will be at risk. I believe this would be about one third of the population.
Could someone confirm what the correct figure is for the proportions of 129
MM genotype in the population? Have more recent cases of new variant CJD
also been of the same genotype?
Previous to this paper by Collinge there was a great deal of interest about
some other work being done by Collinge and his co-workers concerning the
challenge with BSE of transgenic mice carrying a human PrP gene. Interim
results from that experiment seemed to indicate that humans would perhaps be
resistant to BSE. Can anyone confirm what genotype the transgenic mice were
carrying? Presumably in the light of the recent findings this could not have
been 129 MM. Are the final results from that experiment now available?
