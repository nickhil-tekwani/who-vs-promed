Yemen: Polio cases increase, follow-up vaccinations planned
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Yemen has announced the completion in July
[2005] of 2 rounds of a nationwide campaign to immunize children
following a polio outbreak in May [2005], and, reported a high level
of success in reaching vulnerable children.
Yemen now has 369 confirmed polio cases, but the rate is slowing,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. As of early
July [2005], there were 300 cases.
Polio is a highly infectious disease which invades the nervous system
and can cause paralysis in a matter of hours. The outbreak in Yemen
was initially confirmed in mid-May [2005] after a routine national
immunization program in April [2005].
The Ministry of Health said this week [1st week August 2005] it was
able to determine that the 2 rounds of vaccinations in July [2005]
had reached at least 97 percent of the target population of 5 million
children under the age of 5.
The ministry, along with the WHO, United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), US Agency for Development (USAID), US Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) and other participating organizations, expect to
conduct 3 more rounds of vaccinations between now and the end of the
year [2005].
Yemen is one of 17 countries previously determined to have been
polio-free but which have been struck by recent outbreaks. Of those
countries, Yemen has the highest number of confirmed cases.
The current outbreak is believed to have spread from Nigeria across
Africa to Yemen, after some local officials in Nigeria had refused to
facilitate vaccinations for months, claiming that they were part of a
plot by western countries to make Muslim children infertile.
During the 2nd round of vaccinations in Yemen in July [2005], there
were also reports of refusals to cooperate by both doctors and
clerics, but, according to UNICEF and Ministry of Health officials,
they had only a minor impact on the overall success of the campaign.
Most of the reports of refusals were based on the fact that there
were cases of polio confirmed following the 1st round of vaccinations
in April [2005], according to experts conducting the emergency
campaign. This outbreak, despite vaccination having taken place,
caused suspicion among some Yemenis.
"It was the families that 1st made the link between the vaccinations
and the disease," Dr. Kamel Ben Abdallah, health and nutrition
officer with UNICEF in Yemen, said.
The fact that it was the campaign that identified the presence of the
disease -- not that caused it -- was not understood by some people in
the community.
Dr. Ali Al-Mudhwahi, director of family health at the Ministry of
Health, who had sent his own doctors and religious leaders around the
country to convince skeptics during the last round, told IRIN that
things had changed this time around.
"It was the active participation of communities that convinced those
who were refusing," he said.
The door-to-door aspect of the last campaign had built up the trust
of families, he said, and this campaign had seen far fewer reports of
refusal to cooperate.
Al-Mudhwahi did, though, report difficulties in the northwestern
governorate of Al-Jawf, a region where the tribal and local leaders
have historically distrusted the central government.
During the previous round of vaccinations, the ministry enlisted the
help of the USAID-sponsored Adventist Development Relief Agency
(ADRA), an international NGO that had built up the trust of tribal
leaders in the past 3 years through its work in the region.
According to Al-Mudhwahi, ADRA had stopped working in the region in
recent weeks, after threats from local groups following the country's
recent unrest over the dramatic rise in fuel prices.
Ministry of Health vehicles were then attacked while transporting
supplies for the vaccination program in the region. The campaign was
brought to a halt after completing the vaccination in just 6 of the
governorate's 12 provinces.
Al-Mudhwahi said that government troops had been sent in to secure
the area but that the ministry is now negotiating with the governor
and local tribes for guarantees and protection in order to complete
the vaccinations in the remaining provinces.
Al-Jawf is currently reported to have one confirmed case of polio.

[According to the Polio Eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>,
as of the week ending 26 Jul 2005, there were a total of 345 cases of
polio reported from Yemen this year. The above mentioned 369 cases
represent an increase of 24 cases in the past week (final week July
2005) and 45 cases since our last update one month ago (Poliomyelitis
- Yemen (06) 20050704.1891), when there were 300 cases reported.
Checking the detailed reports
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>,
as of 28 Jul 2005, there have been a total of 717 cases of acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) reported in Yemen this year, of which 345 to
date have been confirmed as due to infection with poliovirus. From
another report as yet not available on the Internet, the date of
onset of the most recent confirmed case of polio was 24 Jun 2005,
suggesting that this increase in cases confirmed may be due to time
lags associated with laboratory confirmation, or may represent
delayed identification of cases, but suggests that the 2 rounds of
vaccination activities in the country may have interrupted
transmission of the wild poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
