The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Health Department has ordered the establishment of isolation wards to cope with a possible outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a frequently deadly tickborne disease, officials said.

"We made this decision after discovering 2 people reportedly died from the virus [disease]," Dr Muhammad Zafar, director-general of health services, told Central Asia Online on Fri 19 Jul 2013. "The [presence of the] virus was not confirmed in the victims, but the government is not taking any chances." The virus also has killed about a dozen in Karachi, he said.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 per cent. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected people. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. There is no vaccine, and protection depends on better education of the population regarding the adverse consequences of tick bites.

The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, where they have been at the origin of human cases. There is no apparent disease in these animals. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. - Mod.CP
