Re: Undiagnosed deaths, elephant - Botswana: RFI 20200702.7533835

I disagree with the assertion that the observed rate of drought mortality in this outbreak is "unprecedented" for this region, if it is in fact drought-related mortality sensu stricto.

I conducted a study on elephant drought mortality in Hwange National Park during the mid-1990s (https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0141-6707.2000.00297.x).

Aerial surveys indicated that an estimated 5% to 9% of the population of the more than 20 000 elephant population inhabiting the park died during this drought (some 1000 to 2000 elephants).

The Hwange elephants are part of the same discrete "Kavango-Zambezi" regional metapopulation as the Okavango elephants, which ranges across the area from Hwange National Park north to the upper Zambezi River and Chobe National Park area and westward across the Makadaghadi/northern Kalahari/Okavango region (see map here https://bit.ly/2W05T4j).

There are currently an estimated 150 000 elephants in this population, which despite moderate levels of ivory poaching and trophy hunting is believed to have increased or at least remained stable through reproductive recruitment during the past several years.

If there are currently some 15 000 elephants in the Delta region as reported, the number of dead elephants would need to be on the order of 1000 or more individuals to reach levels comparable with that seen in Hwange National Park during the drought die-offs that occurred there during 1983-1987 and 1994-1995.

[Special thanks to Dr. Dudley for his very insightful comment. It is not clear why the BBC post states the deaths were unrelated to drought. There was a drought in the Okavango delta last year [2019]. It would be useful to have information on the situation this year. - Mod.PMB
