The Butte County [California] Public Health Department [BCPHD] announced on Wednesday [2 Sep 2015] that there's been a major increase this year in lab confirmed cases of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis. The county says that from January to June [2015], there have been 12 confirmed syphilis cases reported, compared to only 2 cases in 2014 during the same time period.

The county also said that people between 20-29 years old and 40-54 years old have been affected, and 1/3rd of those cases occurred in women. The remaining cases, the county said, were found in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in heterosexual males.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection spread through sexual contact, including oral, vaginal and anal sex, with an infected person. The disease is known as "The Great Imitator" because syphilis symptoms can look like symptoms from other diseases.

Syphilis develops in stages and symptoms vary with each stage. The most common symptoms include: small ulcers on the genitals, rectum or mouth, and a non-itchy body rash on the palms of hands or soles of feet, often mistaken as a skin reaction or condition. Stages may overlap and don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis and not notice any symptoms for years. If left untreated, syphilis can cause permanent health problems, including blindness and damage to the heart, brain and spinal cord. Pregnant women infected with syphilis may pass the bacteria to their baby during childbirth, which may cause severe birth defects and health issues that may not show up for years after birth.

"Testing and treatment for syphilis is quick and simple. We urge people at risk to get tested often, as symptoms may be hard to recognize" states Butte County Health Officer, Dr. Mark Lundberg.

Increases in syphilis throughout Butte County are consistent with statewide trends. The California Department of Public Health is reporting an increase in ocular (infection of the eye) syphilis.

BCPHD says that if you are sexually active, your chances of getting syphilis may be reduced by being in a monogamous relationship, limiting sex partners and using a latex condom every time you have sex. Free condoms and free or low-cost STD testing are available at BCPHD clinics in both Chico and Oroville. For more information or to make an appointment please call 891-2731 in Chico or 538-7341 in Oroville. Additional locations throughout Butte County offer free condoms.

[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3622699,2116. Butte County, in the Central Valley of California, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/california-county-map.gif; it is rural and agricultural (http://www.buttegeneralplan.net/products/SettingandTrends/01_LandUse.pdf), with a population (in 2010) of 220 000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_County,_California#Demographics). The city of Chico, Butte County's largest urban community with a total population (in 2010) of 86 187, is home to a major California State University campus with about 16 500 college students. Chico is located in the northwest part of Butte County, about 85 miles (137 km), via California State Route 99, north of the nearest large metropolis, the city of Sacramento, the California state capital.

ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak of syphilis in the 1st quarter of 2013 in Butte in young men who had sex with men (MSM) with multiple sexual contacts, "many" of whom were anonymous (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA: (CA) MSM, RFI 20130522.1730900). Butte County had reported only one case in the period 2006 to 2011 of primary or secondary syphilis in 2009 (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/STD-Data-2010-Report.pdf) and 2 cases in 2011 (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/STD-Data-LHJ-Butte.pdf). We were not told if the syphilis cases were college students or where syphilis was acquired, in Butte County or in Sacramento, the nearest large metropolis.

In 2015, ProMED-mail reported that about half of those with gonococcal disease were between 14 and 25 years old and because of their age the report suggests that they may be Chico State students. However, the news report failed to describe the cases in further detail, such as their sexual behavior or use of smartphone apps, drugs, etc., which would be needed to plan an effective prevention program that targets specific characteristics driving the outbreak in Butte County.

The 2015 news report above says that people between 20-29 years old and 40-54 years old have developed syphilis, and 1/3rd of the cases occurred in women. The remaining cases were men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual males. We again were not told if the syphilis cases were college students or where syphilis was acquired, in Butte County or in Sacramento; whether any had HIV infection; used smartphone apps for "hook-ups," or used psychoactive drugs.

More information on this outbreak of STDs in Butte County from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.ML]
