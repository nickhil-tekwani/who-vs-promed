Influenza, epidemic preparedness 980109223412
Date: Sat, 10 January 1998
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

It has been pointed out to me that I erred in passing on a web site for
Fred Murphy's controversial paper "Problems in the surveillance and control
of viral diseases with specific reference to the developing world". The
proper site is:
<http://www.uct.ac.za/microbiology/icvomurp.html>.
Just as I was preparing the posting, someone said to me what I thought was
"Get the L out" and I misunderstood.
In all seriousness, though, I suggest the site for Fred's paper and more.
There is a delightful photo of Ed Rybicki and his dog as well as some
insightful lectures and hot keys to other useful sites. I recommend it.
Sorry for the mistake, my first in 1998.
