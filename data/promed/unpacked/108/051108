A second new variant CJD cluster?
---------------------------------
Two [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) deaths [may have
occurred in the same street of Armthorpe, a suburb of Doncaster, South
Yorkshire. An investigation has been launched into the possibility that 2
young people living in the same street may have died from vCJD. A 19 year
old male living at 21, Wickett Hern Road in Armthorpe, died from the human
form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or "mad cow" disease, 3
years ago. Tests are being conducted to determine whether a 28 year female
neighbor living at 43 Wickett Hern Road, who died last month, was also a
victim of the disease. Both individuals had attended the same school in
Armthorpe.
Experts from the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh have travelled to
Doncaster to explore links between the two victims. A spokesman for Trent
Region of the National Health Service confirmed the cause of Mr Parker's
death as vCJD, but said investigations into the second case were continuing.
