New Zealand: Diagnostic Brain Biopsy Ruled out in Suspected Case of vCJD
---------------------------------------------------
The doctor caring for the man who may have New Zealand's first case of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new
var. or vCJD] has ruled out doing a brain-tissue biopsy, the only
definitive test available. This is despite a leading neurologist, Associate
Professor Martin Pollock, saying a biopsy would be justified to confirm the
disease and help track its cause. It would involve drilling through the
skull to remove a small piece of tissue. Variant CJD (vCJD), an invariably
fatal brain-wasting disease, is thought to be caused by eating meat or meat
products from cattle infected with mad-cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE).

Test results are awaited on the 26-year-old farm worker to see whether he
has vCJD. Alzheimer's disease or other brain diseases are other
possibilities. He is in a stable condition in a general ward at Waikato
Hospital in Hamilton. Professor Pollock, head of the Otago University-based
CJD registry, said that if these weaker tests were equivocal, or even
positive, it would be important to make a certain diagnosis by biopsy.
"It's such a pivotal case [and would be] the first one in Australasia.
Getting tissue from the brain under the microscope, we would be really sure
about that diagnosis." But Dr Paul Timmings, the man's neurologist,
disagrees, saying "a brain biopsy cannot be justified, given we can offer
no specific treatment". A Ministry of Health spokeswoman said a brain
biopsy would be unethical.

Professor Pollock said neurosurgeons were usually unwilling to perform
brain biopsies on possible vCJD cases because of the risk of contaminating
the operating theatre and the difficulty of killing the disease's infective
agents, called prions. "If done by a competent surgeon there should be very
little danger to the patient. It's mainly the difficulty of how you handle
the drills, which are very expensive, and the instruments, and incinerating
them is an expensive exercise. The instruments are usually put in a
particular furnace that heats to a very high temperature and destroys them."

2 bodily samples from the man -- spinal fluid and a tonsil -- have been
sent to Australia for testing in addition to other tests. Results of the
fluid are expected on Monday and the tonsil within 2 weeks. The fluid test
is at best suggestive and the tonsil test has high rates of false positives
and false negatives. Dr Timmings said the false negative rate was 25 to 30
per cent. "It is possible the diagnosis might simply change from possible
to probable."

Once all the tests had been completed, the man might be able to go home.
The Waikato District Health Board said family and staff looking after the
man were not at risk of infection, as there was no evidence vCJD was
transmitted by saliva, bodily secretions, or excreta. Board chief executive
Jan White said the family were being "strongly supported".

The Ministry revealed the man's illness on Thursday. It had wanted to wait
for the test results, but said it had to dispel mistaken reports from
Britain of a foot and mouth disease outbreak here. More than 130 people
have contracted vCJD, almost all in Britain, where the median age of
patients at death is 28. It often starts with depression and progressively
affects movement and memory. Patients generally survive for just over a
year from diagnosis. It is thought likely that if the man does have the
disease, he would have contracted it years ago from imported food. Imports
of potentially risky beef or beef products from Britain were banned in
1996. Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton yesterday repeated assurances that NZ
cattle does not have BSE. "For 50 years we have not allowed imported
meat-and-bone meal."

[This article brings up an interesting topic: the risk/benefit assessment
of diagnostic procedures. In this case, the risk discussed is the
potential of contaminating operating theater equipment with prions, should
the case in question have prion disease, versus the potential benefit of
having a pre-mortem definitive diagnosis of new variant CJD. Is there
something to be gained by a definitive pre-mortem diagnosis to justify the
risk? An interesting discussion for the medical ethicists. - Mod.MPP]
