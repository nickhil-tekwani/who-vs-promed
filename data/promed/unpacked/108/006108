Malaria outbreak: more than 20 cases reported
---------------------------------------------
The National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) has declared a malaria
outbreak in the Sidvwashini area of Northern Hhohho and surrounding
locations at Masutaneni, Nya-katfo, and Ngonini.

Simon Kunene, NMCP programme manager, said the epidemic was
discovered by malaria surveillance agents who were screening and
testing residents in the community after a case was reported by
Bhalekane Nazarene Clinic. The country defines a malaria outbreak, or
epidemic, as 5 or more locally transmitted cases in a community.

Since Tuesday [5 April 2011], over 20 malaria cases have been
detected in the area through community screening and have been
referred for treatment to the local health facility.

"Due to the country's disease notification hotline 977, the NMCP was
able to respond quickly and efficiently to the reported cases," Kunene
said, emphasising the important role health facilities and healthcare
workers have in the country. Kunene added that this was the 1st of its
kind in the area and thus a cause for concern.

The NMCP has trained healthcare workers in the country to test and
confirm malaria among patients showing signs and symptoms of the
disease. The main signs and symptoms of malaria are fever, fatigue,
severe headache, chills, and sweating. Malaria is a deadly disease and
anyone with these symptoms should be rushed to the nearest health
facility within 24 hours.

Although investigations are still ongoing, the outbreak was likely
due to someone who travelled outside the country and became infected
after being bitten by malarial mosquitoes. When the traveller returned
to the community, he/she was bitten by local mosquitoes, which
transmitted malaria to surrounding neighbors. Mosquitoes are common in
the Sidvwashini area due to stagnant water related to agricultural
operations.

The NMCP advises residents to avoid stagnant water and use personal
protection measures like sleeping under bed nets and accept indoor
residual spraying (IRS) every day during the malaria season. [Residual
spraying does not need to be repeated daily. - Mod.JW] The NMCP has
responded to the outbreak by applying IRS to houses to reduce mosquito
populations, distributing bed nets to protect the population, and
handing out health education materials about protection against
malaria.

"The NMCP will do everything in its power to prevent malaria
outbreaks in the country and eventually eliminate the disease
entirely. It is the responsibility of the community to do everything
they can to protect themselves against malaria," Kunene said.
Community residents can protect themselves and their neighbours by
taking prophylactic medication when travelling outside the country,
accepting house spraying when offered, sleeping under bed nets and
seeking treatment immediately if one feels sick.

[Hhohho district is the northernmost region in Swaziland reached by a
road that follows the border with South Africa from Mbabane to Piggs
Peak, the main town in the region.

The area has a climate which supports endemic transmission of malaria
according the 2005 map of malaria risk in Swaziland by MARA (Mapping
Malaria Risk in Africa, http://www.mara.org.za/).

In the World Malaria Report 2010, reporting malaria in Swaziland for
2009, a total of 106 _P. falciparum_ cases autochthonous cases are
reported among 230 hospitalised cases with a total of 13 deaths
(http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/wmr2010_annex7a.pdf).

Thus, Swaziland has a climate and vector potential where imported
cases can easily start local transmission, and is located close to
Mozambique, which reported 4.3 million suspected malaria cases in 2009
with nearly 94 000 microscopy proven cases (World Malaria Report 2010,
see link above).
