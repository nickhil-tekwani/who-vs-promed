Recall of Aldi Simply Nature Organic Poppy Seed Dressing for potential _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drew's Organics, LLC of Chester, VT is voluntarily recalling one lot code of Aldi Simply Nature Organic Poppy Seed Dressing due to a processing issue that could allow for microbial growth. The recalled product comes in a 12 fl. oz. glass bottle with the Best if Used By date of 15 Feb 2023, and UPC no. 4099100023169. The lot code is printed on the shoulder of the bottle above the label.

This action is being taken in cooperation with the US FDA. Product has been distributed to select Aldi stores between 20 Aug 2021 and 10 Sep 2021 in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

To date [16 Sep 2021], no illnesses related to this product have been reported. No other Aldi products are affected by this recall.

The recall was initiated after Drew's Organics, LLC observed a color difference in the Simply Nature Organic Poppy Seed Dressing after manufacturing. Investigation revealed out-of-spec pH with the potential for microbial growth, including _Clostridium botulinum_, rendering it unsafe for consumption.

Consumers should discontinue use of this product and can return it to their place of purchase for a full refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
