Key Points
----------
- A World Health Organization official said on [Mon 10 May 2021] it is reclassifying the highly contagious triple-mutant COVID-19 variant spreading in India as a "variant of concern," indicating that it's become a global health threat.

- Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for COVID -19, said the agency will provide more details in its weekly situation report on the pandemic Tue [11 May] but added that the variant, known as B.1.617, has been found in preliminary studies to spread more easily than the original virus and there is some evidence it may able to evade some of the protections provided by vaccines. The shots, however, are still considered effective.

- "And as such we are classifying this as a variant of concern at the global level," she said during a press conference. "Even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, we need much more information about this virus variant in this lineage in all of the sub lineages, so we need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done."

- The WHO said last week it was closely following at least 10 coronavirus variants across the world, including the B.1.617. The variant was previously labeled a "variant of interest" as more studies were needed to completely understand its significance, Van Kerkhove said.

- "What it means for anybody at home is any of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating can infect you and spread and everything in that sense is of concern," she said on [Mon 10 May 2021]. "So, all of us at home, no matter where we live, no matter what virus is circulating, we need to make sure that we take all of the measures at hand to prevent ourselves from getting sick."

- A variant can be labeled as "of concern" if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments, according to the WHO.

- The group issued a clarification [Mon 10 May 2021] to their earlier remarks, saying that current data shows the existing COVID-19 vaccines "remain effective at preventing disease and death in people infected with this variant."

- The international organization has already designated 3 other variants with the classification: B.1.1.7, which was 1st detected in the U.K. and is the most prevalent variant currently circulating throughout the U.S.; B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, and the P.1 variant, 1st detected in Brazil.

[A variant of interest means that there are mutations in the virus that give it the potential to:
- Be more transmissible compared to the original strain.
- Result in more severe disease compared to the original strain.
- Escape immunity, such as from vaccines or from previous COVID-19 infection.
If more evidence emerges that it does one or more of these things, a variant of interest may be upgraded to a variant of concern. B.1.617 has now been designated a variant of concern that is a global health risk. - Mod.LK]

After many weeks of steady rises, the world's COVID cases and deaths show a shift to a plateau, led by declines in the Americas and Europe, 2 of the hardest-hit regions, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said today at the WHO briefing.

He warned, however, that the world has been in the same situation before, only to see cases go up again when populations let down their guard. Tedros added that cases are still rising rapidly in the WHO Southeast Asia region and that there are some countries in every WHO region experiencing increasing trends.

He said the WHO Foundation today [Mon 10 May 2021] launched a "Together for India" appeal to raise funds to support work in India, including for purchases of oxygen, personal protective equipment, and medicines.

Over the weekend, India's cases remained near record levels, with the country reporting more than 400 000 cases on 8 May and about 366 000 cases yesterday.

In other Indian developments, the country is asking former army medics to help care for patients at overwhelmed hospitals and military doctors to do online consultations, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-covid-19-cases-rise-by-over-400000-despite-state-lockdowns-2021-05-09/].

Meanwhile, doctors in India are reporting an increase in potentially fatal fungal lung infections called mucormycosis in people with COVID or in those who recently recovered, according to the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/world/india-covid-mucormycosis.html]. Some experts said the cases could be linked to increased use of steroids or from treatment at home, including oxygen, without proper hygiene. [See ProMED-mail 20210510.8354377. - Mod.LK]

Two of India's neighbors--Nepal and Sri Lanka--today reported record high cases.

A concert event that aired on [8 May 2021] called Vax Live, organized by the international advocacy group Global Citizen, raised more than USD 60 million and other support for COVAX, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced today. The event featured performances from musical stars and messages from heads of state, including US President Joe Biden, and other well-known leaders, such as Pope Francis.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that it will donate 1 million COVID vaccine doses and will help distribute 25 million doses through its supply chain. Other countries announcing donations included Croatia, which pledged to share doses with its neighbors, and Canada, which announced more support for the WHO's ACT Accelerator, designed to speed the development and equal distribution of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests.

Several corporations also announced new support, including a USD 25 million pledge from Mastercard and USD 5 million from Cisco and Procter & Gamble.

In a statement, Seth Berkley, MD, Gavi's chief executive officer, said the group is grateful for the new pledges from philanthropy and private sector groups, as well as the UAE. "Now we need more countries and organizations to follow their lead and let COVAX deliver to health workers and those at highest risk for COVID-19, so that no single country is left behind," he said, adding that COVAX needs USD 1.6 billion by June [2021] to be fully financed for 2021.

With an eye on India, Africa ramps up monitoring of coronavirus variants
With Africa accounting for only around 2% of global coronavirus vaccinations, health officials on the continent are looking warily at waves of infections sweeping India and elsewhere that have stoked fears of a long tail end of the pandemic.

Current timelines for mass vaccination campaigns in most African countries run well into next year [2022], if not further. Confirmed cases have been rising steadily in many African countries, though quick but economically destructive restrictions on movement have clamped down surges before they've gotten out of control in most places.

The slow rollout has made Africa's hunt for new variants, which tend to emerge where spread goes unchecked, more urgent. The continent's top health official as well as leaders at its main virus genome sequencing laboratories in Nigeria and South Africa said they were trying to avoid a crisis like the one in India. Despite efforts to contain them, the emergence of yet more new variants in Africa is likely this year [2021], they said, because of vaccine hoarding by wealthier nations, delivery delays and low vaccination capacity.

"My big concern is that if vaccine nationalism continues, and if people [in Africa] are not vaccinated early enough, the virus will keep mutating, and as the virus keeps mutating, we may end up having a virus that is completely resistant to all of the vaccines out there," said Christian Happi, director of the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) in southern Nigeria. "Eventually, the world could be back to square one."

As of this week, fewer than half a million people in Africa had been fully vaccinated, while fewer than 10 million had received a 1st dose, according to the World Health Organization. Most of the continent has avoided the huge death tolls seen in Western countries because of a combination of factors ranging from swift imposition of lockdowns to its relative lack of inclusion in global networks of travel and trade, and other factors, including biological ones, that are still being studied.

Happi's laboratory, along with the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) in South Africa, are Africa's 2 main hubs of genomic sequencing. Although they have been credited with discovering significant variants of concern in their respective countries, they are under-resourced and have only been able to sequence less than a 10th of the samples that labs in Britain and the United States have, despite being home to around three times as many people.

Most African countries don't have labs that can do genome sequencing, so ACEGID and KRISP field weekly batches of a few hundred samples from around their respective regions, some of which are spoiled by the time they arrive because of the difficulty of keeping them stable across multiple flights and various other handlers.

"What we've tried to do -- although we're doing lower volumes -- is still sequence systematically so we're able to understand what's happening in different parts of the continent," said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist and group leader at KRISP. "That's what basically allowed us to detect the 501Y.V2 variant before Christmas [2020]."

The 501Y.V2 variant, which 1st emerged in South Africa, and the B. 1.525 variant, which 1st emerged in Nigeria, are the most widespread variants on the continent, said Happi. They have both also been found in dozens of countries outside of Africa.

Without any major sequencing effort in other countries, it remains unknown whether the emergence of these 2 variants coincidentally happened in the countries with capable labs, or if there might be other variants circulating widely in countries that produce very few samples for testing.

Senegal, Uganda and Kenya, among others, have also done smaller batches of sequencing at national research institutes. On [Wed 5 May 2021], Uganda announced it would start taking samples from arriving passengers at its main international airport, a monitoring measure also taken by Angola since the beginning of the year [2021].

Among the samples Angola sent to KRISP was a variant found in 3 travelers from Tanzania that researchers described as the "most mutated" variant of the coronavirus discovered to date.

Tanzania's government announced new containment measures this past week, more than a month after the death of the country's president, John Magufuli, who was an ardent denier of the pandemic's severity as well as its presence in Tanzania.

"The Angolans had a robust system for retesting people on arrival and isolating anyone if tested positive," Lessells said. "Of course, you don't know at the time that people at the airport have tested positive that that's a new variant straight away. But the policy of testing and isolating at the border has the potential to limit the introduction of new variants."

Since the pandemic began, African labs have sequenced fewer than 15 000 samples compared with hundreds of thousands in some Western countries.

"Our goal is to make sure we generate 50 000 sequences by the end of the year [2021] so we can have a better picture of what's going on in the continent," said John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the continent's main health body. "I'm hoping we can expand the capacity to more countries to do it locally."

The variants thought to be currently most prevalent in Africa exhibit mutations on the E484K protein, which studies have suggested makes them able to partially escape antibodies created by existing vaccines.

That has led researchers like Happi and Lessells to feel less concerned about recent findings of a variant spreading widely in India, known as B. 1.617, having been found in South Africa, Uganda, Kenya and other African countries. Given what is known about B. 1.617, said Lessells, it appears unlikely it could take over dominance from the variants already present in much of Africa.

Above all, however, is a need for more sequencing resources, and a greater sense of urgency and vigilance. Last month, a spike in coronavirus cases in South Africa's Northern Cape province set off alarm bells among local health officials after more than 100 cases were reported overnight in a small cluster of towns. "Through sequencing we could quickly show that it was still the 501Y.V2," Lessells said. "But steady, regular surveillance depends on what resources you have. We can only do a small number because we don't have limitless capacity and money."

[3] Pfizer-BioNtech: FDA EUA adolescentes
Date: Mon 10 May 2021
Source: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) News, press release [edited]
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use


Today [Mon 10 May 2021], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] expanded the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age. The FDA amended the EUA originally issued on 11 Dec 2020 for administration in individuals 16 years of age and older.

"The FDA's expansion of the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age is a significant step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. "Today's action allows for a younger population to be protected from COVID-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic. Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations."

From 1 Mar 2020 through 30 Apr 2021, approximately 1.5 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 -- 17 years of age have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Children and adolescents generally have a milder COVID-19 disease course as compared to adults. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, the same dosage and dosing regimen for 16 years of age and older.

The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria to amend the EUA, and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine's use in this population.

"Having a vaccine authorized for a younger population is a critical step in continuing to lessen the immense public health burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic," said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "With science guiding our evaluation and decision-making process, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that the available data meet our rigorous standards to support the emergency use of this vaccine in the adolescent population 12 years of age and older."

The FDA has updated the Fact Sheets for Healthcare Providers Administering the Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) and for Recipients and Caregivers with information to reflect the use of the vaccine in the adolescent population, including the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

The EUA amendment for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The issuance of an EUA is not an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance or to protect public health or safety.

FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data
---------------------------------------
The available safety data to support the EUA in adolescents down to 12 years of age, include 2260 participants ages 12 through 15 years old enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the United States. Of these, 1131 adolescent participants received the vaccine and 1129 received a saline placebo. More than half of the participants were followed for safety for at least 2 months following the 2nd dose.

The most commonly reported side effects in the adolescent clinical trial participants, which typically lasted 1--3 days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, chills, muscle pain, fever and joint pain. With the exception of pain at the injection site, more adolescents reported these side effects after the 2nd dose than after the 1st dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the 2nd dose. The side effects in adolescents were consistent with those reported in clinical trial participants 16 years of age and older. It is important to note that as a general matter, while some individuals experience side effects following any vaccination, not every individual's experience will be the same and some people may not experience side effects.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should not be given to anyone with a known history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis--to any component of the vaccine. Since its authorization for emergency use, rare severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in some recipients.

FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data
----------------------------------------------
The effectiveness data to support the EUA in adolescents down to 12 years of age is based on immunogenicity and an analysis of COVID-19 cases. The immune response to the vaccine in 190 participants, 12 through 15 years of age, was compared to the immune response of 170 participants, 16 through 25 years of age. In this analysis, the immune response of adolescents was non-inferior to (at least as good as) the immune response of the older participants. An analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring among participants, 12 through 15 years of age, 7 days after the 2nd dose was also conducted. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, no cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1005 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 978 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19. At this time, there are limited data to address whether the vaccine can prevent transmission of the virus from person to person. In addition, at this time, data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection.

Ongoing Safety Monitoring
-------------------------
As part of the original EUA request, Pfizer Inc. submitted a plan to continue monitoring the safety of the vaccine as it is used under EUA. This plan has been updated to include the newly authorized adolescent population and includes longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials, as well as other activities aimed at monitoring the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.

It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death.

[This is an important step to increase the level of immunity in the population and to facilitate school reopenings, as well as a big step towards returning life to be more like we knew it pre-COVID. Adolescents are prone to gather in groups and this allows greater confidence that they will be safe while socializing with their friends, playing sports, and sitting in classrooms. - Mod.LK]

[4] Taiwan: New domestic cases
Date: Tue 11 May 2021
Source: Taiwan Times [edited]
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4200562


Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on [Tue 11 May 2021] announced 11 new COVID-19 cases, including seven local and four imported cases. During a press conference on [Tue 11 May 2021], Health and Welfare Minister and CECC head Chen Shih-chung announced 11 new coronavirus cases, including 5 infections from a new local cluster, one from the China Airlines pilot cluster, one from an unknown source, and 4 imported cases.

According to Chen, case No. 1,201 is a Taiwanese woman in her 40s. She is a family member of case No. 1,187, a China Airlines pilot. She has no recent history of traveling abroad and is asymptomatic. After being identified as a contact of case No. 1,187, she was tested for the virus by the health department on [9 May 2021] and diagnosed with COVID-19 on [11 May 2021], with a Ct value* of 22.

Chen said that case No. 1,202 is a Taiwanese woman in her 30s who works at the Galaxy Baccarat arcade on Zhongzheng North Road in Yilan County's Luodong Township. On [9 May 2021], she began experiencing chills, general weakness, fever, a cough, and other symptoms. On [9 May 2021], she went to a hospital for treatment and to be tested for the virus. On [11 May 2021], she was diagnosed, with a Ct value of 20. Given the fact that she works in an indoor, crowded place where customers stay for long periods, the CECC deemed the risk of transmission high. After being notified of her case, the health department immediately identified 35 contacts, including family members, colleagues, and frequent visitors. These contacts have been told to enter home isolation and are being tested for the disease. As of [11 May 2021], 4 contacts have tested positive for the virus: cases 1,208, 1,209, 1,210, and 1,211. Another 17 have tested negative, and 10 are being tested. The health department will continue to investigate all those who have recently entered the arcade.

Chen said that cases 1,208, 1,209, and 1,211 are colleagues of case No. 1,202. Case No. 1,208 has a Ct value of 11, case No. 1,209 has a Ct value of 20, and case No. 1,211 has a Ct value of 25. All are female, and they range in age from their teens to their 40s. Two of these contacts are asymptomatic, while case No. 1,211 had symptoms on [8 May 2021]. Case No. 1,210 is a man in his 30s who is a regular customer of the arcade. He experienced a cough and diarrhea on [9 May 2021].

During what the CECC believes was an infectious stage, case No. 1,202 worked at the arcade from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. [7 May through 9 May 2021]. The arcade is located at No. 42 Zhongzheng North Road on the 2nd floor of a complex of shops and a 5-minute walk from the Luodong train station and a Christian church.

Chen said case No. 1,203 is a Taiwanese man in his 60s who has no recent history of traveling abroad. On [7 May 2021], he began to experience fatigue, a cough, and chills. He was admitted to a hospital on [9 May 2021] for treatment after he developed a fever. On [11 May 2021], he tested positive for COVID-19, with a Ct value of 18. His source of infection is currently under investigation. The health department has identified a total of 115 contacts in his case, all of whom have entered home isolation, and the search for additional contacts is currently underway.

* The cycle threshold (Ct) value refers to how many cycles at which fluorescence of the PCR test is detectable. The higher the number of cycles, the longer the virus has gone undetected. The lower the number, the more recent the infection and the higher the viral load.

[According to the update on the Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) page; https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/AjK-JHPHnPq01NQueiQyPA?typeid=158, "a cumulative total of 217 045 cases related to COVID-19 have been reported in Taiwan among which COVID-19 has been ruled out in 214 507. Of these reported cases, infection with COVID-19 was laboratory-confirmed in 1210 cases. Of the 1210 confirmed cases, 1052 are imported; 106 are indigenous; 36 are naval crew members aboard the Panshi fast combat support ship; 2 are infections on an aircraft; 1 case has unknown sources of infection; 13 cases' sources of infection are being investigated; and 1 case (Case No.530) has been removed (Case No.530 is not assigned to any patients). Of the confirmed cases, there have been 12 deaths, and 1093 patients have been released from isolation, with the other 105 patients remaining hospitalized in isolation."

Additionally, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced on 11 May 2021 that in response to the increased risk of community transmission caused by local cases of unknown sources of infection in Taiwan, it would raise epidemic warning to Level 2: Local Cases of Unknown Sources, effective from today to 8 June 2021, a total of 4 weeks, and would impose restrictions on personal activities, going out, gatherings, business venues, public transportation and other related measures. Related restrictions and measures are listed below;

1. Members of the public should avoid crowded venues and to wear a mask at places with high risks of infection and transmission. Those who do not wear face masks may be fined.

2. Organizers of gatherings and activities should adopt measures that ensure social distancing and mask-wearing, use partitions, keep a record of participants' contact information, take temperatures, sanitize environments, and institute crowd flow control, capacity limits and route arrangement. Organizers failing to adopt these measures should cancel their activities.

3. In principle, organizers should cancel outdoor activities of more than 500 people and indoor activities of more than 100 people. However, if organizers of such gatherings and activities can arrange designated seats for participants and spare a seat from the next participant; keep a record of participants' contact information; ensure participants wear masks all the time; and prohibit consumption of food and beverages, organizers may hold such events after submitting disease prevention plans to the local regulatory authority and obtaining permission.

4. Business owners and public venue management units should take measures that ensure social distancing and mask-wearing, use partitions, keep a record of customers' contact information, take temperatures, sanitize environments, and institute crowd flow control, capacity limits and route arrangement. Those failing to take these measures should suspend their business. When necessary, entertainment and leisure businesses and public areas will be closed.

5. Food and beverage service owners should keep a record of customers' contact information; sanitize/disinfect environments regularly; ensure staff members wear masks, maintain hand hygiene, take customers' temperatures, sanitize customers' hands, provide serving utensils, and provide assistance in other personal protective measures for customers; and install partitions between customers. Members of the public are advised to choose takeout at food and beverage service venues failing to adopt these measures.

6. Consumption of food and beverages is prohibited on Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) trains, Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) trains, and intercity buses. Starting 15 May2021, no standing ticket shall be sold on THSR intercity trains and TRA intercity trains. https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/0jMlImCVWTuhO9mfQCd-4g?typeid=158 - Mod.UBA]
