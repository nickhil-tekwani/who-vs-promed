Emergency departments in West Australia [WA] are under pressure from an increase in influenza-like illnesses and a lack of Commonwealth-funded aged care beds, the state's chief medical officer says. August is usually the busiest time for hospital emergency departments, with 97 extra daily attendances at Perth sites, compared to those in July [2016]. WA Health said there were already 275 patients in emergency departments across the metropolitan area just before 9 am on [Tue 30 Aug 2016].

Chief medical officer Gary Geelhoed said hospitals were feeling the demand, with levels of influenza at their highest since 2012. "In the past week alone, there has been a 10 per cent increase in the number of patients presenting with flu-like illness compared to the same week last year," he said.

Professor Geelhoed says the main virus strain this year [2016] is known to disproportionately affect older people, but WA has the lowest number of aged care beds per population in Australia. "There are many elderly people in our hospitals waiting for beds to become available in residential care," he said.

Due to the unprecedented demand, ambulance ramping time has increased, with 160 hours recorded across Perth's tertiary hospitals on [Mon 29 Aug 2016]. Professor Geelhoed said anyone who did not require emergency care should consider other health care options such as a GP or Health Direct Australia.

[According to the last WHO update on seasonal influenza (see posting Influenza (35): seasonal, WHO global update 20160827.4445283), based on data up to 7 Aug [2016], influenza activity has been low overall for this time of the year, and influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in Australia. However, another recent report from New South Wales (Influenza (33): Australia (NS) seasonal activity surge 20160817.4420409), which is geographically located farther, also highlighted the increased hospitalization rates in elderly patients.

It seems that the recent surge in West Australia is evidence of increased activity, which may be a regional trend. The influenza subtype or whether the cases are outpatients or require hospitalization has not been specified in the report above. - Mod.UBA
