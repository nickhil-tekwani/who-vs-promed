Along with the havoc wreaked by tropical storm Dineo, Mozambique has also been hit by a cholera epidemic, with 216 confirmed cases of the diarrheal disease and one death in 3 cities, radio station VOA Portugues reported on [Thu 16 Feb 2017].

The capital Maputo, currently experiencing water shortages and rationing, is one of the affected cities. The others are Matola, which lies to the south of Maputo and Nampula in northern Mozambique. The radio said, quoting the deputy national director of public health.

[2] Cholera - Angola

Several infectious disease outbreaks in the southern African country of Angola are overloading health services and compromising the health of citizens in the country, according to a statement by Health Minister Luis Gomes Sambo. Luis Sambo said the country has been vulnerable to epidemics of yellow fever, malaria, cholera, Zika and HIV/AIDS during a recent press conference in Luanda.

He confirmed that the cholera epidemic currently affects 3 of Angola's 18 provinces, namely in Cabinda (73 cases and 3 deaths), Zaire (174 cases and 8 deaths) and Luanda (5 cases and zero deaths), for a total of 252 cases and 11 deaths. He urged the population and the local governments to follow the recommendations and take the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the disease. "Measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the epidemic including the need to consume safe drinking water and to educate the population about prevention and personal hygiene practices," he said.

[3] Cholera - Tanzania, 2015-2016
Date: Thu 16 Feb 2017

Notes from the Field: Ongoing Cholera Epidemic -- Tanzania, 2015-2016
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On [Sat 15 Aug 2015], the Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MOHCDGEC) was notified about a case of acute watery diarrhea with severe dehydration in a patient in Dar es Salaam. _Vibrio cholera_ O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, was isolated from the patient's stool and an investigation was initiated. MOHCDGEC defined a suspected cholera case as the occurrence of severe dehydration or death from acute watery diarrhea in a person aged ≥5 years, or acute, profuse watery diarrhea with or without vomiting in a person aged ≥2 years in a region with an active cholera outbreak. A confirmed cholera case was defined as isolation of _V. cholera_ O1 from the stool of a person with suspected cholera. Tanzania's 1st reported cholera epidemic was in 1974 with intermittent outbreaks since then; the largest epidemic occurred in 1997, with 40 249 cases and 2231 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] was 5.5 percent) (1).

As of [Sat 26 Nov 2016], the current epidemic continues, affecting 23 (92 percent) of 25 regions in mainland Tanzania (excluding the Zanzibar archipelago), with a cumulative reported case count of 23 258 and a cumulative CFR of 1.5 percent. The median number of reported cholera cases per week was 271 (range = 5-1240). Approximately half of all reported cases have been from 4 regions: Dar es Salaam (5104; 22 percent), Morogoro (3177; 14 percent), Mwanza (2311; 10 percent), and Mara (2299; 10 percent). Of 511 stool specimens tested during [Mon 17 Aug 2015 - Fri 18 Mar 2016] at the National Health Laboratory-Quality Assurance Training Center in Dar es Salaam, 268 (52 percent) were positive for _V. cholerae_; all specimens were serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing revealed sensitivity to cotrimoxazole, ceftriaxone, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, and resistance to nalidixic acid and ampicillin.

The Tanzania Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program and CDC in the USA and Tanzania evaluated cholera mortality reporting in Dar es Salaam; 81 deaths were identified during [Sat 15 Aug 2015 - Wed 28 Oct 2015]. Cholera treatment center (CTC) records revealed that 21 (26 percent) patients died in CTCs. Municipal burial permits recorded 60 (74 percent) cholera deaths in the community. These results motivated follow-up interviews with decedents' family members to identify characteristics associated with an increased risk for death from cholera in January 2016.

Tanzania continues to face challenges with epidemic control. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in most countries neighboring Tanzania, including Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia (3, 4). In addition, the El Niño phenomenon, which has exacerbated cholera transmission in the past in the Great Lakes region of Africa (5), caused heavy rains throughout East Africa. To help address the challenges of this epidemic, MOHCDGEC established a national Emergency Operations Center in November 2015 and developed a National Cholera Response Plan in February 2016. The Emergency Operations Center is currently coordinating the deployment of multidisciplinary rapid response teams to support affected regions and districts. These activities have improved the ability of Tanzania to respond to this epidemic and serve as a model for responding to future public health emergencies.

[As a reminder, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL
