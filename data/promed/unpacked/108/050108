An outbreak of FMD has been found in several herds located in the
rural sector of Cabeza Mala, Roscio municipality [Bolivar state].

No time was lost in sounding the alarm, and there was an immediate
mounting of a roadblock at the entrance to this agricultural community
for disinfecting the tires of vehicles coming to this community.

Although we have not received official information because of the date
[Sunday], we know unofficially that there are several herds affected
with foot and mouth disease, for which health authorities should
report on the situation and make necessary recommendations so that the
population will refrain from consuming meat that may be contaminated
with the virus.

There were some cars on their way to buy cattle for slaughter early in
the morning yesterday [23 Nov 2008], but they were turned back by the
danger this outbreak presents for meat consumers. [There is no such
danger -- FMD does not infect humans. But vehicles can carry the virus
for miles between farms on their tires. - Mod.JW]

The Health Department and the new mayor are expected to speak on this
later today [24 Nov 2008] to provide reassurance to the population of
the Roscio municipality following the long election day held on Sunday
[23 Nov 2008].

According to the information we have, there are at least 3 farms where
cattle are sick, and therefore consumers should not buy beef or cattle
in this village and its environs. [But see comment above. The only
danger is to other livestock from meat transported by consumers from
one place to another. - Mod.JW]

[There are no current OIE reports on FMD in Venezuela. The latest
detailed reports are for June 2008 on outbreaks in Barinas, Bolivar,
and Tachira; previously this year (2008), there have been outbreaks in
Cojedes, Merida, Monagas Portuguesa, Tachira, Yaracuy, and Zulia.
Basically, it is a mess.

Cabeza Mala is 75 miles/121 km southeast of Ciudad Bolivar as the crow
flies; or 83 miles/134 km by road, more or less. Bolivar was not
included in the recent list of places undergoing livestock
vaccination; see 20080716.2158.
