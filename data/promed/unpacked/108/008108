An infection linked to pigeon droppings was a "contributing factor" in the death of a child at a Glasgow hospital, it has been confirmed.

Scotland's health secretary ordered a review of the design of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after the deaths of 2 patients. The hospital has put infection control measures in place, and officials insist it is safe for patients and visitors.
Jeane Freeman [Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport in the Scottish Government, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Health_and_Sport] said there was an "absolute focus on patient safety".

At the weekend, it emerged that 2 patients who had died at the hospital had contracted a cryptococcal fungal infection, which is linked to pigeon droppings. Ms. Freeman said one of the patients was elderly and had died from an unrelated cause, but that the infection had been a "contributing factor" in the death of a child.

The likely source of the infection has been traced to a 12th floor [top floor] room containing machinery, which is not open to the public. Ms. Freeman said traces of excrement had been found in the room, where there was a small break in the wall, which was "invisible to the naked eye".

The health secretary spoke to the chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and senior clinical staff to seek reassurance for patients at the hospital. She told MSPs: "In November [2018?] the bacteria _Cryptococcus_ [sic - _Cryptococcus_ is a fungus, not a bacterium] was identified in one patient. That patient was discharged for palliative care and sadly subsequently died in late December [2018?] - but _Cryptococcus_ was not a contributing factor in the death.

"In December [2018?], a post mortem of a child who had passed away confirmed that _Cryptococcus_ was both present and contributing factor in the death.

"I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say to both families that our thoughts and sympathies go to them."

The identification of 2 cases acted as the trigger for additional infection control measures at the hospital, including antifungal treatment for potentially vulnerable patients.

The health secretary said NHSGGC [National Health Service Greater Glasgow and Clyde] had kept patients and their families updated on an ongoing basis and would ensure they had the opportunity to discuss concerns with the senior clinical team.

Portable HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] air filter units have been installed in specific areas as an additional precaution. There have been no further cases reported.

Ms. Freeman said: "There are 2 strands to this. The first is to deal with the current infection, which the board has done thoroughly; they've taken all the measures they should take. The other is the building itself. We need to be absolutely sure about the current state of this infrastructure - what do we need to fix, how has that arisen, and what are the lessons for our buildings elsewhere in the health service. That may be in aspects of the design that we weren't aware of at the time, it might be in aspects of the commissioning, it might be maintenance, or maybe a combination of all of those. That work has already been scoped out, and towards the end of this week I will agree with the board what external independent advice they will bring in to ensure that work is taken forward and that I'm assured that we do that as thoroughly and quickly as we possibly can."

Prof. Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director for healthcare quality and strategy, said he was "assured that this hospital is safe today". He said: "That doesn't mean there aren't issues around the building that need reviewed and looked into, both for this building and to learn for Scotland. But I can assure the families who are coming in tomorrow for chemotherapy or coming in this week for bone marrow transplants, that this hospital is safe."

On [Sun 20 Jan 2019], former health secretary Alex Neil called for an inquiry into the deaths as it emerged concerns about pigeon numbers at the hospital were raised in December [2018?]. Mr. Neil told BBC Scotland: "I think there has to be an outside inquiry by experts to find why this happened in the 1st place, secondly how it has been handled by the health board and, thirdly, what precautions need to be taken for the future."

[The news article above reports that 2 patients are believed to have acquired cryptococcal infection at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland in late 2018 and are attributing these infections to pigeon droppings found in the 12th floor machine room. Both patients, one elderly and the other a child, died; underlying conditions clouded the exact cause of death in the elderly patient, but the infection was thought to have contributed to the death in the child. However, we are not told if either patient had HIV/AIDS or was a transplant-recipient, the usual predisposing conditions, or the type of cryptococcal infection they had, e.g., pulmonary or CNS, the most common clinical manifestations.

Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast _Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _C. gattii_. These 2 species have 5 serotypes based on antigenic specificity of the capsular polysaccharide; these include serotypes A, D, and AD (_C. neoformans_) and serotypes B and C (_C. gattii_). The ecologic niches for _C. neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ appear to be distinct. _C. gattii_ lives in the soil and areas on or around trees, such as the eucalyptus. _C. gattii_ is not associated with birds, whereas _C. neoformans_ is found in the accumulated droppings around roosting and nesting sites of birds, especially pigeons. Pigeons are not known to acquire symptomatic disease but can carry cryptococci on feathers, skin, in the crop and cloaca (common cavity into which the intestinal, genital, and urinary tracts open). _Cryptococcus neoformans_ is presumably the cryptococcal species isolated from the patients in the above news report.

Cryptococci can become aerosolized when dried bird droppings or contaminated soil are stirred up. People can become infected when they inhale aerosolized cryptococci, which primarily infect the lung, but may subsequently spread systemically via the bloodstream, especially to the central nervous system (where the organisms cause a basilar meningoencephalitis), skin, prostate, and medullary cavity of bones. Pulmonary _C. neoformans_ infection in immunocompetent persons is asymptomatic or resolves without specific therapy. Dissemination of _C. neoformans_ is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients, especially with defective cell-mediated immunity, e.g., HIV/AIIDS patients or transplant recipients. However, the news report above fails to detail the type of cryptococcal disease in the 2 patients who died and if the 2 patients were known to have an immune defect.

Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) is an acute care hospital located in southwest Glasgow, Scotland, UK. The hospital opened at the end of April 2015, with 1109 beds for adults, 256 beds for children and 2 major emergency departments, one for adults and one for children, in addition to buildings retained from the former hospital on its grounds.

Although the source of cryptococci at QEUH is said to be pigeon droppings found in the 12th floor machine room, the news report fails to detail the type of machinery housed on the 12th floor and how the 2 patients, who were likely housed in different areas of the hospital, were exposed to cryptococci in the pigeon droppings. Because clusters of patients with cryptococcosis from acute fungal exposure is said to be quite unusual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593437/), genotyping the clinical isolates, if they match, will help determine if this is a common source outbreak and genotyping the environmental isolate will help confirm the source, if the genotypes of the clinical and environmental isolates match. - Mod.ML
