Dysentery outbreak puts 400 in hospital in Russia
----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of dysentery in southern Russia has put more than 400
people, mostly children, in hospital, with officials on Wednesday,
blaming a dairy plant for the mass contamination. The Health
Ministry said 404 people were receiving treatment in the Krasnodar
region, 75 percent of them children.
Deputy Health Minister Gennady Onishchenko told reporters 7 were
seriously ill, with most cases in Kropotkin, a town 250 km (150
miles) from the Black Sea. He said the number of cases could still
increase.
"80 percent of those who are ill said they ate sour cream from the
local plant," Igor Kalashnikov, Krasnodar region's chief
epidemiologist, told First Channel television. "So we are 80 percent
certain of the source of the problem."
The plant denied any involvement, according to television reports,
and blamed a plot by competitors.
The Health Ministry said production at the dairy plant had been
halted and workers were undergoing tests. But a manager told NTV the
plant was functioning, subject to tighter checks.
Hospital workers said treatment was effective against fever, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea, and the rate of admissions was declining. But
reports said patients with non-urgent cases were being discharged to
make room for other victims of the outbreak.

[More microbiological information is needed to confirm the etiology
of the dysentery outbreak. Bacterial dysentery is caused classically
by members of the genus _Shigella_, but occasionally other pathogens
may cause a similar illness with fever, chills, and frequent bloody
mucoid diarrheal stools -- but not generally in outbreak form. -
