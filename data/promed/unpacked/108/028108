The incidence of dead and dry root diseases on maize crops is currently increasing in Jalna district. This will affect the production. It is also doubtful whether the crops can be used as fodder. Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated during the summer. Rainfall increases the incidence of fungal diseases and has prevailed in the district recently.

Scientists from the district Agricultural Research Center [ARS] have inspected the crops in the area. They said that it is necessary to introduce hybrid varieties which are less susceptible to diseases. For biological control, trichoderma can be used. Fungicides can be applied in the field as soon as the disease appears. Farmers should then not remove any of the crop for a month.

[A large number of pathogens is known to affect maize in the region and worldwide. Drying symptoms of roots and shoots, as described above, can be due to several of them or be caused by environmental factors. A 'fungus' is implied above, but no diagnostic process or proof is mentioned. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) is always essential before any management strategies can be designed.
