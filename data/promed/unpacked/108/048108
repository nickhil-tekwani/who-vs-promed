Dominican Republic faces banana threat
--------------------------------------
The Dominican Association of Banana Producers (Adobanano) has revealed
that some producers in the northwest of the Dominican Republic have
been hit by yellow sigatoka disease.

A recent growers meeting was called to discuss the situation, with one
company losing 30 000 Euros [approx. USD 44 000] after a shipment of
the fruit was returned from Europe. "The problem affects producers in
the northwest, where 92 percent of the country's banana crop is
located," Victor Pena, president of Adobanano, said.

[Yellow sigatoka (YS; sigatoka leaf spot) is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella musicola_. The related _M. fijiensis_ (black sigatoka,
BS; black leaf streak) as well as a number of fungal pathogens in
other genera cause similar leaf spot symptoms on banana in various
regions of the world. YS occurs in most banana growing areas and was
first reported from Java in 1902, long before BS appeared in Fiji in
1963. In areas where more than one leaf spot pathogen is present, it
is often difficult to distinguish between them under field conditions,
and laboratory analysis may be needed for a clear diagnosis.

Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for YS and BS. YS symptoms
appear mainly on older leaves and, therefore, less damage is caused to
photosynthetic tissue than by BS. There are more cultivars of banana
and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. YS is more
adapted to cooler temperatures and is often dominant at higher
altitudes. The pathogens are spread by water, wind, and with plant
material, including suckers, and can cause yield losses of up to 50
percent. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment causing further losses, and this may have
been the cause for the refusal of shipments reported above. Disease
management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary
measures, and cultural practices.

Both YS and BS have been reported to cause serious problems in the
Caribbean region. For example, in 2004, a major campaign was conducted
in St Lucia to combat YS. Establishment of collaborative efforts to
control these diseases is being attempted in the region (see
ProMED-mail post 20090614.2204).
