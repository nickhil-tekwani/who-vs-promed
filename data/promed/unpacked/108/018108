Kozhikode District [Kerala] health officers have sealed off the Elathur coastal area for the 2nd consecutive day on [Wed 8 Jun 2016] after 5 cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria were reported. Indoor space spraying (ISS) was done in 7 houses including the one where 5 cases were detected.

Guppy fish was distributed in wells and 'Abate' was mixed as larvicide in the well to destroy the breeding source of the anopheles mosquito, which causes malaria. As many as 158 samples of blood were collected from the area and sent for tests. All the 194 samples sent on [Tue 7 Jun 2016] proved to be negative in the lab analysis.

Further, a health education class was conducted at GMLP School Elathur with the participation of close to 150 local people. A fever clinic was also conducted in the area. District medical officer [DMO], Dr RL Saritha, said that the condition of the 5 persons admitted due to _P. falciparum_ malaria was stable.

They are being treated at the general hospital in the beach area and at medical college hospital. The surveillance work will be continued on [Thu 9 Jun 2016] also. The area will be under fever surveillance for 14 days, according to health officials. The health team, including the DMO visited the spot on [Wed 8 Jun 2016].

Not cerebral malaria
--------------------
DMO Dr RL Saritha said that all the 5 cases were not cerebral malaria as reported but _P. falciparum_ malaria. "Cerebral malaria is the extreme condition where falciparum malaria affects the brain and may lead to death. No such condition existed here. Falciparum malaria was reported a couple of months back also," she said.

Kazhikode (Kerala State) is found on the west coast of India, about 600 km (373 mi) south of Goa. Kerala is usually regarded as a low risk area for malaria, but malaria is probably hugely underreported in India (see ProMED-mail posting 20160430.4192324 discussing this). - Mod.EP]
