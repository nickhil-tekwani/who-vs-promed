New evidence linking mouse virus and chronic fatigue
----------------------------------------------------
A federal study published on Monday [23 Aug 2010] raises further
questions about a possible link between chronic fatigue syndrome
(CFS) and a mouse virus. The researchers found that the blood of 32
of 37 patients (86.5 percent) diagnosed with CFS contained murine
leukemia virus-related viruses (MLVs). But when they looked at
healthy blood donors, they found that just 3 of 44 (6.8 percent) had
the viruses, which can cause leukemia or cancers in mice.

"Further studies are needed to determine whether the same strong
association with MLV-related viruses is found in other groups of
patients with CFS, whether these viruses play a causative role in the
development of CFS, and whether they represent a threat to the blood
supply," the authors concluded in their study, which was published in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [Abstract
reproduced below]. "We haven't studied enough people, we don't know
enough about the mechanisms," co-author Dr. Harvey J. Alter told
reporters in a conference call.

CFS is a complex illness whose cause is not known and for which no
diagnostic test or approved treatment exists. Despite the fact that
Monday's study finds no more than an association, researchers from
France and Canada suggested in an accompanying commentary [see below]
that there is enough evidence to support initiating trials to see
whether antiretroviral drugs like those used to treat the virus that
causes AIDS might help people who have both chronic fatigue syndrome
and are infected with MLV.

The possible link emerged last year [2009] when DNA from a similar
virus -- called xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV)
-- was found in blood from two-thirds (67 percent) of 101 CFS
patients versus 8 of 218 (3.7 percent) of healthy controls. But
researchers were perplexed when 4 later studies found no murine
leukemia virus in CFS patients' blood. "Very good laboratories have
come up with disparate results," Alter said. "We think there are
reasons for this. We think it's in the patient populations rather
than in the laboratory testing, though the latter has not been
completely ruled out."

Monday's study underscores how messy science can be. "These results
do raise as many questions as they answer," said Dr. Steve Monroe,
director of the division of high-consequence pathogens and pathology
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Clearly, the
different findings from different laboratories now that have been
reported suggest that there are still a lot of things about this
virus that we do not know."

And researchers are looking for ways to protect the blood supply from
possible contamination. But a study looking for virus in donated
blood is under way. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration
requires that blood donors be in good health at the time of donation.
And the AABB, a blood-banking organization, recommends that people
diagnosed with CFS be discouraged from donating blood or blood components.

Study re-ignites debate over virus' role in chronic fatigue
----------------------------------------------------------
Government scientists have found traces of a mouse-related virus in
86 percent of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, a discovery
that is likely to re-ignite the controversy surrounding the virus
widely known as XMRV [murine leukemia virus-related virus}. Nevada
scientists 1st reported the presence of the virus in chronic fatigue
patients in 2009, but at least 3 subsequent studies failed to detect
it. On Monday [23 Aug 2010], however, researchers from 3 different
government agencies said they had found the virus in stored and fresh
blood samples.

"There is a dramatic association with chronic fatigue syndrome ...
but we have not proven causality for the agent," said Dr. Harvey
Alter, chief of clinical studies at the National Institutes of Health
Clinical Center and one of the authors of the new report, speaking at
a news conference. The report was posted online ahead of its
publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
[Abstract reproduced below]. "The dilemma now is how to reconcile
that some labs find the association and some don't." Co-author Steve
Monroe, director of the division of high-consequence pathogens and
pathology at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, conceded
that "these results do raise as many questions as they answer. There
are still a lot of things about this virus that we don't know."

Researchers hope some of those questions will be answered within the
next year or so. The government is sponsoring a number of studies to
determine, among other things: whether the virus is, in fact, present
in many or most chronic fatigue patients; whether researchers can
find antibodies against it in such patients; whether a standardized
test for the virus can be developed; how common the virus may be in
the blood supply; and whether it can be transmitted through blood donations.

In an editorial accompanying the report [see below], French and
Canadian researchers called for clinical trials to determine whether
chronic fatigue patients can be treated with anti-AIDS drugs that
have been shown to block replication of the virus in a test tube.
Desperate patients have already begun taking the drugs despite a lack
of proof that the virus is even related to their symptoms.

Alter cautioned that all of the questions surrounding the virus would
remain controversial "when not everybody finds the same thing. Very
good laboratories have come up with disparate results," and no one is
sure why that is so. It may be due to differences in laboratory
testing or, more likely, because of differences in patient
populations. It is also possible that there is more than one cause of
chronic fatigue syndrome.

The illness itself has a long history of controversy. Thought to
affect at least 1 million Americans and 17 million people worldwide,
it is characterized by debilitating fatigue, chronic pain and
depression, among other symptoms. But because there are no
biochemical markers to identify it, some physicians still argue that
it resides mostly in the minds of patients; activists contend that
the CDC and other government agencies have refused to study the
disease adequately.

Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus, or XMRV, was 1st
discovered -- in some human prostate tumors -- 4 years ago. That
study has been only partially replicated, and the link to tumors is
also controversial.

In October 2009, researchers from the Whittemore Peterson Institute
for Neuro-Immune Disease in Reno reported that they had found the
virus in 68 of 101 blood samples from chronic fatigue patients, but
in only 8 of 218 healthy patients. This summer, however, 3 separate
groups of researchers reported that they could not replicate the
Whittemore Peterson findings. The 1st 2 negative results were from
Europe, and some experts speculated that there might be different
patient populations involved. But the 3rd study, from CDC
researchers, involved American patients.

The study reported on Monday had already been accepted for
publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
when the CDC study was published in July [2010]. The current study's
authors requested a delay in publication while they tried to resolve
conflicts between the 2 reports. Ultimately, they were unable to do
so and publication proceeded.

The team from the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food
and Drug Administration studied blood samples from 37 chronic fatigue
patients collected in the mid-1990s for a study to determine if the
disease was caused by a type of infection-causing bacteria known as
mycoplasma. Mycoplasma was not found and the samples were stored in a
freezer. Using sensitive assays, the team found evidence for several
[murine] virus variants in 32 of the 37 samples and in 3 of 44 (7
percent) samples from healthy patients. Fresh samples from some of
the patients showed the same viruses. "We're delighted," said Judy A.
Mikovits, the lead researcher at the Whittemore Peterson Institute.
"This is the 1st group that attempted to replicate the study using
our methods." She said her group would present additional positive
findings at a meeting in Washington in 2 weeks.

The key difference in the new study is that the government team found
viruses that appeared to be polytropic. That is, they can replicate
in more than one species, including mice and humans. The original
virus isolated in Nevada was xenotropic -- it could grow in humans
but not in mice.

Alter noted that, since the original discovery, the Whittemore
Peterson group has isolated the virus, grown it in culture and
identified antibodies against it in humans.

Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo, director of the FDA's tissue safety laboratory
program and a coauthor of Monday's report [Abstract reproduced
below], said his team had not yet been able to isolate the virus. "We
have tried very hard, but that has not been accomplished."

below: Title: Detection of MLV-related virus gene sequences in blood
of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and healthy blood donor. By
Shyh-Ching Lo and 6 others
<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/08/16/1006901107>.

Abstract: "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious systemic
illness of unknown cause. A recent study identified DNA from a
xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 68 of 101 patients (67 percent)
by nested PCR, as compared with 8 of 218 (3.7 percent) healthy
controls. However, 4 subsequent reports failed to detect any murine
leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus gene sequences in blood of CFS patients.

We examined 41 PBMC-derived DNA samples from 37 patients meeting
accepted diagnostic criteria for CFS and found MLV-like virus gag
gene sequences in 32 of 37 (86.5 percent) compared with only 3 of 44
(6.8 percent) healthy volunteer blood donors. No evidence of mouse
DNA contamination was detected in the PCR assay system or the
clinical samples. Seven of 8 gag-positive patients tested again
positive in a sample obtained nearly 15 y later. In contrast to the
reported findings of near-genetic identity of all XMRVs, we
identified a genetically diverse group of MLV-related viruses.

The gag and env sequences from CFS patients were more closely related
to those of polytropic mouse endogenous retroviruses than to those of
XMRVs and were even less closely related to those of ecotropic MLVs.
Further studies are needed to determine whether the same strong
association with MLV-related viruses is found in other groups of
patients with CFS, whether these viruses play a causative role in the
development of CFS, and whether they represent a threat to the blood supply."

The following are extracts from the accompanying commentary in PNAS
titled: Mouse retroviruses and chronic fatigue syndrome: Does X (or
P) mark the spot? By. Valerie Courgnauda, Jean-Luc Battinia, Marc
Sitbona,, and Andrew L. Masonb
.

"Five years ago, a retrovirus resembling a murine leukemia virus
(MLV) was found in patients with prostate cancer, and last year, a
similar gammaretrovirus was identified in patients with chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). The agent was named xenotropic MLV-related
virus (XMRV), because its env gene was nearly identical to that of
xenotropic MLV, an infectious endogenous MLV that preferentially
infects cells from foreign species, including humans. The 2 reports
struck a common chord, because the viral sequences found in prostate
cancer and CFS were nearly identical.

"A 2nd common theme emerged in reports from Europe that XMRV was
rarely found, if at all, in prostate-cancer samples or patients with
CFS; however, other investigators confirmed the presence of XMRV in
prostate-cancer samples from North America. Although a recent report
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not
find a link between XMRV and CFS, distinct MLV-related sequences are
found in serial samples collected from the mid-1990s to 2010 from
patients with CFS reported in the study by Lo et al. in their PNAS
paper. However, the reasons for the current geographical restriction
and the source of the infection are baffling."

"Originally, a viral etiology of familial prostate cancer was pursued
in patients with RNase L deficiency, an antiviral endoribonuclease
that relays the antiviral IFN response. Because modulated RNase L
activity has been linked with CFS, similar case-control studies were
conducted, and XMRV was found in 67 percent of CFS patients. Since
then, XMRV has been found in prostate-cancer patients with no link to
RNase L deficiency and in 3.7 percent of healthy donors in the
original CFS study. Lo et al. detect MLV-related sequences in 88
percent of their CFS samples and 6.8 percent of control blood donors.
If verified, this perplexing frequency of detecting MLV-like
sequences in blood donors suggests a more widespread source of infection."

"The current data suggest that a variety of xenotropic and polytropic
MLV can be found in North Americans with and without disease. To add
to this bewilderment, it is likely that more than one environmental
agent impacts on the development of both CFS and prostate cancer. At
this juncture, it would seem reasonable to conduct extensive
case-control studies in North America, as suggested by Lo et al.,
using coded control samples from subjects with inflammatory disease
to determine the frequency of MLV infection in patients with CFS. The
potential transmission of MLV-related sequences from human to human
should also be epidemiologically evaluated."

"The caveats for conducting clinical trials in patients with CFS and
MLV infection are that the potential benefits of treatment should
outweigh the risks; also, studies should be conducted as randomized
controlled trials with meaningful and feasible endpoints using robust
therapies. At this juncture, studies to establish proof of principle
are justified to determine whether safe antiviral regimens can impact
on CFS and to determine whether xenotropic or polytropic MLV is
causally associated with this debilitating disease."

It is beyond the competence of the Moderator to resolve the conflicts
of evidence accumulating in this research field. The proposition of
the Canadian and French commentator is that CFS should be treated as
a retrovirus infection has some merit, although a solution which
might create more uncertainty. - Mod.CP]
