As the dengue epidemic continues to take a hold on the community,
authorities announced Thursday [23 Oct 2008] that 72 laboratory
confirmed dengue cases have been recorded between 1-18 Oct [2008].

The Dengue Action Response Team (DART) estimates that this figure is
likely to surpass the 100 mark before the end of October 2008.

The DART Team is calling on every household to take immediate
measures to stem the breeding of mosquitoes. "The only way to stop
the dengue outbreak from growing is by every household taking
mosquito breeding preventive action. By taking measures, you are
protecting your family from getting dengue fever," Government
Information Service (GIS) said in a press release yesterday [24 Oct 2008].

This month [October 2008], 2 persons have already succumbed to
dengue, one from DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] and the other of
dengue shock syndrome [DSS].

The Island Government has approved an emergency budget of over 300
000 guilders [USD 170 952] to cover a number of interventions related
to the local outbreak. The Hygiene Department has also resumed its
fogging exercise.

Every household is asked to check debris, old tires, and standing
clear/clean water in yards as these are the main source and breeding
grounds for [_Aedes_] mosquitoes, bringing about an increased risk of
mosquito-borne diseases. These areas should be immediately eliminated.

Residents should also immediately check for clear/clean standing
water in roof spouts, empty drums, buckets, jars, birdbaths, boats,
plant containers, saucers, paint cans, and other items that can
collect water around your homes and businesses. "Where clear/clean
standing water exists, one can use small amounts of kerosene, just to
cover the surface as a measure to prevent mosquito breeding or just
get rid of the container.

"In the case of where containers are used for storing water,
residents should keep these properly covered and check every 3 days
to make sure mosquitoes haven't laid any eggs. Inlets and outlets of
cisterns must be covered with a mosquito net or cloth to prevent
mosquitoes from breeding in the water."

The 3 types of dengue [viruses] circulating on the island are DEN-1,
DEN-2, and DEN-4, increasing the risk for DHF, which is potentially
deadly, and DSS, which, if not treated correctly, can lead to
profound shock and death.

"Residents are strongly advised to continue to take urgent preventive
action against mosquito breeding in order to stem the increase in the
number of dengue cases on the island," it was stated in the release.

There is a 2nd suspected case of DHF that was acquired on the island
reported by the Daily Herald
<http://www.thedailyherald.com/news/daily/l136/deng136.html>, but the
victim may have had an underlying medical condition. The case is

The rapid and significant increase in clinical [dengue] cases
continued during the 1st week of October [2008], with 230 cases
estimated during this week alone. A decline was observed during the
2nd week of October (150 cases). The increase in cases that were
laboratory confirmed followed a similar dynamic. However, the number
of cases recorded during the 3rd week of October (8 cases) remains
high, but still above the maximum expected for this period.

Laboratory confirmed [dengue] cases are spread over the whole island.
In total, 8 people were hospitalized in September [2008] (37 percent
of which were of severe forms [of the disease]). Since early October
2008, no hospitalizations have been recorded.

Since early September [2008] the DEN-2 [virus] serotype was
identified but [the number of virus serotypes] increased (5 DEN-2 and 3 DEN-1).

According to island doctors Jack Buchanan and Gys Koot, 9 cases of
dengue fever have been confirmed on Saba, and this constitutes an
epidemic. Both doctors are expecting additional cases.

A screening test is 1st done on the French side of St. Maarten,
followed by more in-depth testing at the Diagnostic Center in
Curacao. So far, 20 individuals have been tested.

Of these, 9 tested positive for the disease [virus or antibody]. None
of the cases so far have been of the hemorrhagic variety, and only 2
persons had been hospitalized.

Of the 2 persons who were hospitalized, one of them had never left
Saba. In another case, 3 family members had a complaint [that took
them] to the doctor. All were later confirmed to have dengue fever,
and all had been to Orient Beach.

The doctors are currently assuming that Saba's dengue originated in
St. Maarten, and was probably brought to Saba by infected persons.
Rudolph Johnson, head of mosquito control, said that it is a very
unusual situation, since he has heard of only one case of dengue in
Saba since he started work in 1971.

Johnson has posted extra notices and has increased home inspections.
He appealed to homeowners to be vigilant that there is no standing
water around their homes.

Stagnant water for flower arrangements must be changed daily to wash
out possible larvae deposits. Recent rains could have activated the
mosquito eggs, which could lie dormant for months.

[The appearance of dengue on Saba Island, presumably imported from
the outbreak on St. Martin, indicates the ease with which people
transport the virus to new sites where vector populations are
adequate to permit ongoing virus transmission.

Saba is the smallest island of the Netherlands Antilles, located at
17 38 N, 63 14 W, (east of Puerto Rico and 28 mi (45 km) south of St.
Maarten). It consists largely of the dormant volcano Mount Scenery
(888 m), the highest point of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Saba
has a land area of 13 sq. km (5 sq. miles). At the 2001 Netherlands
Antilles census, the population was 1349 inhabitants, which means a
population density of 104 inhabitants per sq. km. In 2004, the
population was estimated at 1424 inhabitants (information from the
Saba government

Despite the continuing trend in the drop in the number of cases of
dengue in recent months this year [2008], Ceara recorded 4 new deaths
as a consequence of [dengue] fever with complications. There were 2
deaths in Fortaleza, one in Aracati, and one in Miraima. With this,
the number of deaths from dengue with complications climbs to 12 in 2008.

In the epidemiological week of 12-18 Oct [2008], 24 new cases of the
disease were reported in the state, of which only 3 were confirmed in
the month of September. All occurred in the interior. The month of
October 2008 has just one confirmed case. The data are from the
weekly dengue bulletin released yesterday afternoon [17 Oct 2008] by
the Secretariat of Health of the State.

In total, 6 cases of dengue with complications were confirmed this
week, and 3 cases of suspected DHF were reported, with 2 cases
occurring in the capital and one in the interior. The number of
deaths from DHF remains at 15. In total, there have been 27 deaths
confirmed in the state.

With these cases, Ceara reaches a total of 41 172 laboratory
confirmed cases in 167 municipalities. There remain an additional 18
suspected cases of the disease under investigation, with 16 deaths.

Currently, Fortaleza has the greatest concentration of cases, with
74.36 percent of confirmed dengue cases in the state, with a total of
30 622 occurrences. The neighborhoods with the highest incidences of
dengue are Messejana (1870 cases), Barra do Ceara (1015), Jangurussu
(881), Jardim das Oliveiras (758), and Mondubim (748). The age range
between 10-19 years is the [cohort] most affected by the disease.

The dreaded dengue fever has taken its toll in Mohali. A resident of
Phase I, a woman in her early 30s, died on late Tuesday night [21 Oct
2008] after a drastic fall in her platelet count at the Fortis
Hospital. The woman was suffering from acute fever since 14 Oct
[2008] and had initially taken medication from a private practitioner
in Phase VI, who then referred her to the PGI, Chandigarh, or Fortis
Hospital on 16 Oct [2008], said area municipal councilor Rajinder
Prasad Sharma while speaking to Newsline.

In a contrasting statement, Fortis Hospital medical director Dr Ashok
V Chordiya claimed the patient was brought to the hospital only on
Tuesday [21 Oct 2008] and had died within 8 hours of hospitalization.
"She came with acute fever, and her platelet count was very low,
which is believed to be cause of death," revealed Dr Chordiya.

The DHO [district health officer] revealed that on coming to know
about the dengue death from civil surgeon Dr Avtar Singh, he sent a
team of officials, led by epidemiologist Dr Sunita Paul, to visit the
area. "Our team was stunned to find the larvae of the dengue [virus
transmitting mosquito _Aedes_] in stagnant water at the victim's
house," said Dr Surila. "We also carried out fogging in the house
besides undertaking fever survey in the area," said the DHO. He added
that no other member of the victim's family was found suffering from fever.

Though officially it was the 1st dengue death in Mohali, a young
woman had also died due to suspected dengue nearly a fortnight ago at
the PGI. No confirmation was received from the PGI on a query posed
by the Mohali district health department, said District Health
Officer (DHO) Dr S P Surila.

The official count of confirmed dengue patients reported from Mohali
has touched 138, confirmed the DHO. A number of suspected dengue
patients, however, continue to pour into private and Government hospitals.

Around 17 new suspected dengue fever cases were reported from
different parts of the city [Karachi] on Monday [20 Oct 2008],
according to the health department spokesman. About 11 patients were
shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, 2 each at Ziauddin Hospital and
Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre, respectively, and one each at
Civil Hospital, Karachi and Sindh Government Qatar Hospital. The
spokesman said that, so far, around 953 suspected dengue fever cases
have been reported this year [2008], out of which 324 were positive
dengue fever cases.

Taiwan's Disease Control Department of Health today [21 Oct 2008]
warned that Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City's local dengue fever
cases have been in an upward trend, with the increase in the last 3
weeks reaching a total of 33 cases.

As the territory of the epidemic continues to expand, there will be
risk of cross-spread coupled with cross-infection with different
dengue virus serotypes, making the patients more prone to an
infection that can lead to the more serious DHF.

Taiwan's "News" reported that despite the autumn season, the dengue
fever outbreak on the island is in an increasing trend in the
epidemic concentrated in the cities of Kaohsiung. In Taiwan-based
monitoring of the health sector, 11 Kaohsiung City Administrative
Region of China, there has been a total of 146 cases of indigenous
dengue fever confirmed; Kaohsiung County has a total of 30 cases.

Taiwan health authorities worried that with the 1st epidemic of
dengue in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County, the risk of the
disease has spread in other districts.

Taiwan's health authorities called on local people to remove
mosquito-breeding sites so as not to have dengue fever become a New
Years epidemic.

The number of cases of dengue fever has surged over the last year
[2007], and health officials say the dreaded disease is now showing
greater complications. Dengue fever in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] has
increased dramatically this year [2008], with more than 10 000 cases
and 5 deaths reported so far, according to the HCMC Preventive Health
Center. Now, 242 out of around 320 wards and communes in the city
have reported outbreaks of the disease.

Nguyen Tran Chinh, director of the HCMC Hospital for Tropical
Diseases said last month [September 2008] they admitted 1000 adults
and 532 children with dengue, nearly a 300 percent increase compared
to the previous year [2007]. This month [October 2008], 1164 more
patients have been hospitalized, while last October [2007], 716 were admitted.

More than 100 in-patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital
on Wednesday [22 Oct 2008] night. Dr Nguyen Thi Kim Loan of the
hospital's Pediatrician Department A said 42 children were currently
being treated for dengue and 7 to 8 of them were in danger of going into shock.

Since the department has just 38 beds, 2 to 3 patients have to share
a single bed, while some even have to sleep on the floor or along
corridors when the department is overcrowded. Sometimes it looks like
a refugee camp, Loan said.

The hospital's Pediatric Department B specializes in treating
patients with blood poisoning (septicemia), but has now had to admit
dengue fever patients, as the dengue department is overloaded, said
nurse Le My Tien.

Tran Thi Thuy, deputy head of Children Hospital No. 2's Infectious
Disease Department, said on Thursday [23 Oct 2008] that since the end
of November 2007, they have admitted 718 children, a 20 percent
year-on-year increase. 80 percent of patients were from HCMC, mainly
District 2 and the suburban districts of Thu Duc, Go Vap, and Binh Thanh.

The department admits between 30 and 60 patients per day, Thuy said.
Each day, there are between 100 and 130 in-patients, of which 10-12
percent are in critical condition. On Wednesday [22 Oct 2008], 15
children with dengue were listed in critical condition in the
hospital. Some also had to share beds.

Dr Phan Tu Quy of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases Pediatric
Recuperation Department said within the 1st 3 weeks of this month
[October 2008], they admitted 50 children suffering shock due to
dengue. Last month [September 2008], the department admitted 86 similar cases.

The signs and symptoms of dengue fever patients are also showing more
complications than before, according to doctors.

More patients are listed in critical condition and are suffering
longer bouts of fever, up to 10 days in some cases. Bloody diarrhea,
loss of consciousness, respiratory failure, and problems with the
liver, kidneys, and brain are other symptoms cropping up in greater
numbers than before.

Lam Thi My, deputy head of Children Hospital No. 1's Dengue Fever
Department, said numbers of dengue patients had never been so high at
this time of year before. Recently, babies less than 3 months old
have also been coming in with dengue fever, said My.

According to the HCMC Preventive Health Center, efforts to curb the
disease from June [2008] to August [2008] have been largely
ineffective. Until [25 Sep 2008], more than 56 100 cases of dengue
fever and 52 deaths had been reported nationwide, the Ministry of
Health reported.

While the number of cases nationally has decreased by 22 percent, and
deaths have decreased by 15 percent year-on-year, 13 provinces and
cities have suffered from greater outbreaks than in previous years.
The southern provinces of Ca Mau and Binh Phuoc and the central
province of Nghe An are among the localities with the highest rates,
including deaths.

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha, vice chairwoman of the HCMC Peoples Committee, has
ordered local agencies to take better measures to reduce the
incidence of dengue.

[Dengue outbreaks are still being reporting in Viet Nam, with more
than 10 000 cases and 5 deaths reported from Ho Chi Minh City alone.
As of 25 Sep 2008, more than 56 100 cases and 52 deaths of dengue
fever had been reported nationwide in 2008. Central Nghe An province
had detected 687 cases of dengue fever during 2008 (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (15): Nghe An 20081014.3250).

According to a newswire on dengue fever in Viet Nam dated 25 Oct
2007, nearly 80 000 cases with 68 fatalities had occurred nationwide
since the beginning of 2007 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet
Nam (15) 20071025.3469). During October 2007, the hospitals from Ho
Chi Minh City had reported the overloading of dengue fever patients,
with an average of around 70-100 dengue fever cases per week (see
prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (14): adults, RFI 20071012.3354).

Recently, Yunnan province from China reported 68 cases of dengue
fever, while most of the cases were reported to be imported (see
prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - China (05): Yunnan 20081016.3274).

For maps of Viet Nam with provinces, see

The newswire above is very curious, as the information gives the
demographic breakdown of cases reported from HCMC during the month of
September 2008 as 1000 adults and 532 children. If this is not a
typographical error, it is a complete change from what is usually
seen in Viet Nam, where the preponderance of cases usually occurs in
children. Earlier PRO/MBDS reports have commented on the increase in
adult dengue fever cases seen, but this large disparity with almost
twice as many cases in adults than children reported during September
2008 is cause for reflection: either it is the appearance of a strain
of dengue virus that has been absent from HCMC for many years or is
just appearing there for the 1st time; or the possibility is that not
all of these reported cases are attributable to dengue virus
infection but might well be another viral infection such as
chikungunya virus infection. Chikungunya virus has been circulating
in Southeast Asia this year 2008, with cases identified in Malaysia,
Singapore, and now in Thailand (see prior PRO/MBDS posting
Chikungunya - Thailand, Malaysia: Thailand, conf. 20081026.3380).

That being said, it is also curious that the newswire mentions the
increased proportion of childhood cases presenting with serious
manifestations of dengue virus infection -- with dengue hemorrhagic
syndrome and dengue shock syndrome. PRO/MBDS would very much
appreciate more information on the virology investigations of this
outbreak -- which dengue virus type(s) have been prevalent this year
in comparison with the last few years.

More information on results of laboratory testing on the adult cases
of dengue reported from HCMC would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
