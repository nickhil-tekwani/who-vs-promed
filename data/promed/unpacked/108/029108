I wish to point out the inaccuracies in the post, transcribed from CICC. I
check the
CICC version, the inaccuracies are the same.
[We cut and pasted the CICC English version, so the inaccuracies were
already there - Mod.JW
I wish now to furnish a translation from the [Chinese original - (the
names of people and places are transliterated by me, may not be standard)
.........The Disease Control Bureau of the Department of Health's Acting
Bureau Chief, Hsu Kuok Shuing, pointed out that a new death was notified by
Changhua City's Hsuichuang Hospital concerned a girl who was not yet two
years of age. She had onset of illness on 20th June and died on 1st July.
The principal signs were hand-foot-and-mouth disease, pulmonary edema,
hemoptysis [coughing up blood, aseptic meningitis and heart failure. ........
The main inaccuracy in [the previous translation was to describe "heart
failure" as
"heart attack". The other is to omit "aseptic" from the "meningitis". These
are significant inaccuracies clinically.

[We thank Prof. Yap for his important correction. We would cross-reference
readers to the aseptic meningitis outbreak in Belarus last year, caused by
ECHO-30 with confounding isolates of EV-71 -- see ref. above - Mod.JW
