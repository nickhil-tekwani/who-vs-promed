Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 5 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan - 10 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- No WPV1 case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 was 21.
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: 4 from Kandahar province, 1 from Lashkargah district, Hilmand province. Samples were collected on [6 Jan 2019].
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.
- The technical advisory group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 was 12.
- 10 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 3 from Gadap and 1 from Baldia Town Karachi, Sindh province; 2 from Lahore and 2 from Rawalpindi in Punjab province; 1 from Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 1 from Quetta in Balochistan province. Samples were collected from [2 Jan 2019 to 15 Jan 2019].
- Pakistan has an ongoing nationwide anti-polio drive, which aims to vaccinate 39 million children by the end of the week.

Nigeria
- No cases of cVDPV2 this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 was 34.
- 2 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Maiduguri in Borno state. The samples were collected on [1 Jan 2019].
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Niger in 2018 was 9, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 30 Oct 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 is 26.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province) and a community contact of the case.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district).
- Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

[The rationale for preparing a post this week when there were no new cases of WPV1 or cVDPV disease reported is to highlight the positive environmental samples, all collected in 2019, that document that the WPV1 is still circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that the cVDPV2 is still circulating in Nigeria. The absence of similar reports from other countries does not exclude that the viruses (cVDPV) may be circulating in areas where environmental sampling is not being done.

As a reminder, earlier this week we posted on a media report announcing the 1st WPV1-associated case confirmed in Afghanistan for 2019. Presumably this case will be reported as a confirmed case in future GPEI/WHO updates (see Poliomyelitis update (09): Afghanistan (KD) RFI 20190130.6285898 for details).

Of additional interest is a science blog commentary about the impact of the civil unrest ongoing in Venezuela that is worth showing here. "According to PAHO-WHO, vaccination coverage in Venezuela against polio has dropped below minimum recommended levels (80%). This creates the conditions for the potential reemergence of the virus via the vaccine-derived strain. Decreased vaccination coverage, dwindling surveillance programs, mass emigrations, and a worsening political and economic crisis are increasing the likelihood of a new polio outbreak in the Americas" (excerpted from https://scienceblog.com/505706/venezuelas-next-crisis-rampant-spread-of-infectious-disease/).

Unfortunately, it would not be a total surprise to have cases of cVDPV occurring in any location worldwide where coverages with the vaccine are sub-optimal. Were it to occur in Venezuela, it would be a major setback for the Americas, as the Americas region was where the polio eradication effort was 1st launched with a successful outcome, with the last case confirmed in Peru in 1991. In the early days of recognition of problems associated with cVDPVs, there was an outbreak of cVDPV on the island of Hispanola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 2000-2001, countries where the vaccination coverages had fallen to sub-optimal levels).
