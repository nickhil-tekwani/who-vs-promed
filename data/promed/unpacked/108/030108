Southend Council and Public Health England have confirmed that the authorities are dealing with 9 confirmed cases of measles [and] still awaiting results of 3 further suspected measles cases, and the authorities say 2 suspected cases have returned negative results.

Southend Council is continuing to communicate [with] 284 people who were potentially exposed to the virus to encourage them to find out their immunisation status from their GPs and to book a vaccination appointment if they have not had both MMR jabs already.

The council has given emergency MMR jabs to 34 people since the 1st case was confirmed.

Measles can still be deadly, even in Europe, says the FOPH [Federal Office of Public Health]. Thus 2 deaths related to the virus have been recorded so far in 2019.

A total of 214 cases of measles have been reported in Switzerland since January [2019], 6 times more than in 2018 (34 cases), and 2 deaths. The outbreaks of the disease could nevertheless be controlled.

The incidence of measles during the 1st 9 months of the year increased from 4 cases per million inhabitants in 2018 to 25.1 cases in 2019, says the Bulletin of the FOPH broadcast Monday [21 Oct 2019]; 19% were isolated cases spread over 13 cantons, of which 83 were in the canton of Bern alone.

Of these 214 cases, 58% were endemic, with no known foreign link; 17% were imported; and 9% were related to an imported case. In 16% of cases, the origin of the infection could not be established. Of the cases, 9% were fully vaccinated.

According to the FOPH, 20% of those infected were under 10 years of age, 23% were aged 10-19, and 57% were 20 or older; 91% of the 172 people with known vaccination status were not vaccinated or were incompletely vaccinated, while 9% were fully vaccinated.

The majority of cases in 2019 in Switzerland belonged to one of the 30 outbreaks recorded from January to May, which could be stopped at the end of May [2019]. These outbreaks occurred in total in 12 cantons. The most affected were Geneva, St. Gallen, Zurich, Neuchatel, and Bern.

One of the [deaths] was a young adult who was previously healthy and unvaccinated. Post-exposure vaccination took place too late to save him.

The other case was an elderly man, immunosuppressed due to cancer. He died of measles pneumonia, despite intensive care in the hospital. A total of 45 people (21% of the reported cases) had to be hospitalized.

In 2010, Switzerland set itself the goal of eradicating this disease. At the end of July 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared for the 1st time that endemic measles had been eliminated from Switzerland between 2016 and 2018. Like Austria, it is one of 35 countries (out of 53 WHO European Region countries) in which this disease was eliminated between 2016 and 2018.

According to WHO indicators, the virus is considered eliminated when no transmission chain of more than 12 months is observed for 3 consecutive years. Cases imported from abroad are not taken into account.

Despite the outbreaks of early 2019, Switzerland still fulfills WHO's elimination criteria, as no chain of transmission has been observed since June [2019].

For the FOPH, this success is mainly due to vaccination coverage, particularly for infants, which has been steadily increasing in recent years. But efforts must be kept up.

[4] Samoa: outbreak
Date: Wed 16 Oct 2019

https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/samoa-confirms-7-measles-cases-and-1-fatality-2019


The Independent State of Samoa's Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed a measles outbreak based upon test results from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory Melbourne, Australia.

In a press statement on 16 Oct 2019, Samoa's MOH revealed 3 new confirmed measles cases; 2 were children under 5 years of age and one was an adult. All patients have been treated and discharged from a hospital.

Previously, on 30 Sep 2019, test results confirmed 4 measles cases, with one fatality.

The deceased child, 14 months of age, was admitted on [8 Sep 2019] with a history of febrile convulsions, cough, and skin rash typical of measles associated with severe dehydration. The verification-of-immunization status for this child revealed that he was not vaccinated against the measles virus.

Samoa is a country consisting of 2 main islands, Savai'i and Upolu, and has a population of 190 000 residents. The country is located south of the equator, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, in the Polynesian region of the Pacific Ocean.

American Samoa is a separate, unincorporated territory of the United States, located southeast of Samoa. As of 2019, the population of American Samoa was approximately 55 000 people.

Previously, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has included Samoa in its June 2019 level 1 travel alert regarding the ongoing spreading of the measles virus.

Additionally, the CDC updated its travel-vaccination suggestions on 2 Aug 2019, to include the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, varicella, and the annual influenza vaccinations. The CDC also suggests yellow fever, hepatitis A, and typhoid vaccinations for certain Samoa visitors.

Furthermore, the US Department of State issued a low-level travel advisory in December 2018, saying visitors to Samoa should take normal precautions.

https://www.theage.com.au/national/queensland/unprecedented-measles-outbreak-on-brisbane-s-south-triggers-warning-20191016-p531cy.html


An unprecedented outbreak of measles in Brisbane's south has triggered an urgent plea by Metro South Health for people to get checked and vaccinated. Eight cases of measles were detected in the past few weeks, with public health physician Dr Kari Jarvinen expecting many more cases to arise.

"There are well over 1000 contacts (people who could be affected) that we know about and there will be more, and the numbers are increasing even today as we speak when we find out more information," he said.

Dr Jarvinen said one child was infectious during a flight from Auckland to Brisbane, while some others caused a potential spread in a college. [See URL for locations / times of possible exposure. - Mod.LK]

Dr Jarvinen said the number of cases was highly unusual, especially in the southeast Queensland area.

"In our area, we might see 1-3 cases a year," he said. "In the last few years, we have had similar numbers or more, but this is fairly unprecedented . . . getting so many cases so quickly. Very rarely we will see 2 or 3 cases linked occasionally, but not like this.

"Many of these are closely related through family and social connections and networks, but it's also beyond that.

"We fully expect the numbers to increase, because quite a large number of people have been exposed to measles while these people have been infectious."

Two more measles cases are likely to be confirmed in the Far North, as an outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease threatens to spread further across the region.

Public health officials have urged people who are unvaccinated to be immunised immediately, and to be alert for symptoms to prevent a wider outbreak of the infectious disease, following 2 new suspected cases emerging in Cairns and Mission Beach.

To date, there has been 3 cases of measles confirmed across the region since 3 Oct [2019].

Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair said one of the latest cases, who lived at Mission Beach, was unknowingly infectious and visited Malanda [Queensland] on the weekend of 19-20 Oct [2019]. The other suspected case is from Cairns.

"If these cases are confirmed, it will bring the total number of cases of measles in the Cairns region to 5 in the last few weeks," Dr Gair said.

https://www.communitynews.com.au/western-suburbs-weekly/news/department-of-health-acts-on-measles-spike


The Department of Health has urged people at risk to take up their offer of free measles vaccination following the "highly unusual" cluster of cases confirmed over the past 2 months.

There have been 26 confirmed cases of measles associated with the cluster from the Rockingham area, prompting health authorities to renew their plea for vaccination checks, specifically targeting Western Australians between 20 and 53 years old.

"That is in recognition of the fact that people of that age group may not have gotten 2 doses of measles vaccine when they were children because vaccination schedules were different back in those days," she said. "They are people who are definitely at risk now, and so we urge them to get vaccinated as soon as possible and check their immunisation status."

Communicable disease control director Donna Mak said the last time WA [Western Australia] had a cluster this big was nearly 10 years ago.

"It's been a long, long time, and thank goodness for that, because we wouldn't want this to be happening on a daily basis," she said. "We have had 53 cases this year [2019] to date in WA. This is highly unusual; usually we would see a handful of cases every year."

A former measles patient from Busselton spent 5 nights in the ICU in Bunbury for measles, which was believed to be from his trip to Singapore in early July [2019].

"I had flu-like symptoms. I had no idea," he said. "I didn't really think Singapore would be a hotbed of measles, to be perfectly honest. It took a couple of days to determine these were measles."

[The former patient] said he was in the negative pressure room, in complete isolation with no air escaping, for 5 nights and took about 3 weeks to fully recover.

https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/10/tax-cuts-would-threaten-fight-against-measles-associate-health-minister-julie-anne-genter.html


Associate health minister Julie Anne Genter says if National goes into the next election promising tax cuts, it'll be at the expense of the fight against measles.

More than 1800 people have been infected with the highly virulent disease in the present outbreak, about 1500 of them in Auckland alone. Measles has the ability to weaken the body's immunity to other diseases and can even be fatal.

Appearing on The AM Show on Monday [21 Oct 2019] morning, Genter defended the government's efforts to control the virus' spread.

"If you look at the 1st 10 months of this year [2019], already we've administered over 300 000 vaccines. We've got another 107 500 being distributed around the country right now and another 155 000 coming in the next few months."

Shortages have remained, however, which Genter blamed on an "unprecedented number of people looking to get vaccinated" in a 2-week stretch in September [2019].

Measles cases have been rising worldwide over the past few years. In the 1st 3 months of 2019, there were 4 times as many cases than in the 1st 3 months of 2018.

Asked if the initial response here in New Zealand was too slow, Genter blamed a lack of funds initially available.

Ministry of Health data shows only 88% of present-day children are fully immunised, and some Generation X/older Millennials might not be immune at all due to historical gaps in coverage.

Genter said there are presently enough vaccines to ensure everyone under 15 is able to get immunised. A catch-up campaign for young adults is planned for "early next year [2020]."

According to the World Health Organization, New Zealand has been technically measles-free since 2017. That means there are no homegrown outbreaks, and any outbreaks caused by someone bringing the virus into the country is eliminated within 12 months.

New Zealand has until March next year [2020] to end the present outbreak to retain that status, vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris told RNZ in August [2019].

National has not said whether it would cut taxes if elected in 2020, but it's likely. The party's promised tax cuts at the 2017 election didn't come to pass because it lost.

People at a Tokoroa wedding may have been exposed to measles. A child at the Fri 11 Oct [2019] wedding has since been confirmed as having the highly infectious viral disease.

That makes a total of 48 confirmed cases in the Waikato this year [2019], 32 of them since 1 Aug [2019]. Most have been linked to the Auckland outbreaks, a Waikato DHB [District Health Board] statement said.

Tonga's Ministry of Health today [Tue 22 Oct 2019] issued a measles alert after 13 members of a Tongan school rugby team developed measles after returning from New Zealand this month [October 2019]. Measles is a highly infectious disease, and the public is urged to be vigilant for signs and symptoms and to get immunized, especially if they are traveling overseas.

The high school rugby group were playing rugby in New Zealand in September [2019]. There were 60 boys and 8 officials in the group. One of the boys became unwell while in New Zealand and was laboratory confirmed as having measles.

Since their return to Tonga on 1 Oct [2019], 13 other members of the group developed symptoms of measles. Six of those cases had been confirmed by a laboratory test.

Another person who was in contact with one of the players was a suspected case, bringing the total number to 15 cases.

None of the cases are seriously ill.

The Ministry reported that it had taken rapid steps to prevent further spread of the virus, including isolating the current cases at home, vaccinating contacts of the cases, and quarantining the remaining squad members, staff, and other contacts.

Ministry of Health CEO, Dr Siale 'Akau'ola said that parents of players have been contacted and provided with information about measles, and the boys were instructed to remain at home until they were sure that they would not develop measles.

"The Ministry is confident that steps have been taken to contain the spread of the virus. However, measles is a highly infectious disease, and it is possible that further cases may occur."

New Zealand has a major outbreak of measles with more than 1800 cases since the beginning of the year [2019].

People travelling to New Zealand and other countries experiencing measles outbreaks are strongly recommended to check their immunization status.

The number of measles cases in Singapore has hit the highest level since an outbreak in 1997, figures from the Ministry of Health on Thursday [24 Oct 2019] showed.

According to the latest weekly infectious diseases bulletin published on Thursday [24 Oct 2019], there were 149 measles cases in Singapore as of 19 Oct [2019]. That is more than 4 times the number of cases for the whole of 2018, when there were 34.

The number of measles cases in Singapore hit 1413 in 1997, before the government introduced the 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule in 1998. The number of cases fell to just 114 that year [1998].

In July this year [2019], MOH urged Singaporeans to remain vigilant, as measles cases around the world have increased substantially.

"As a travel hub, Singapore is likely to see increased cases from importation," it said.

According to the latest Communicable Diseases Surveillance report released by MOH in 2018, the number of reported measles cases has "rapidly declined" since the introduction of compulsory measles vaccination in August 1985.

In 1992 and 1997, there was a spike in the number of reported cases across all age groups. The "catch-up" immunisation initiative was implemented between July 1997 and November 1997, and the 2-dose MMR vaccination started in January 1998.

The number of measles cases ranged between 13 and 96 between 2001 and 2010, before an increase in 2011 to 148 cases. Since then the number of cases has fluctuated, with 38 cases in 2012 and 46 cases in 2013, jumping to 142 cases in 2014.

There were 42 measles cases in 2015 and 136 cases in 2016. That dipped to 70 cases for the whole of 2017 and dropped further to 34 cases in 2018.

There have been outbreaks around the world as the virus exploits gaps in vaccination coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this month [October 2019].

The disease, which is, according to the WHO, one of the world's most contagious, rose by 300% globally in the 1st 3 months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. There have been consecutive increases over the last 2 years.

The Fiji Ministry of Health is closely monitoring the outbreaks of measles in the region. There is an ongoing outbreak in New Zealand followed by recent outbreaks declared for Samoa and Tonga.

The Ministry says measles is rare in Fiji due to an effective immunization program. However, outbreaks around the world, including in neighboring countries, puts Fiji at risk of having travel-related cases of measles.

In response to the outbreaks in the region, the Ministry has made measles vaccine available for free to Fijians travelling overseas.

Fijians travelling overseas need to get vaccinated at least 2 weeks in advance of travel.

The Ministry will soon offer free measles vaccine to people that are at higher risk of exposure to those infected with measles. This includes airport and airline workers, hotel workers, and healthcare workers.

Weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies
Week 42: 14-20 Oct 2019

Summary: Cases: 8514; deaths: 57; CFR [case fatality ratio]: 0.67%

Description

Ethiopia has been experiencing a measles outbreak since late December 2018. The outbreak was initially reported in Oromia region and later affected 3 additional regions: Afar, Amhara, and Somali.

In week 41 (week ending 13 Oct 2019), 24 suspected cases with no deaths were reported. Between week 1 and week 41 in 2019, a total of 8514 suspected measles cases, including 57 deaths (CFR 0.67%), were reported. Of the 8514 suspected cases, 180 samples were tested, and 14 tested IgM-positive for measles virus infection at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute laboratory in Addis Ababa. The peak of the outbreak was reached in week 9 (week ending 3 Mar 2019), with 642 cases reported, followed by a gradual decline in the number of cases to 24 cases reported in week 41.

A total of 4 regions have confirmed measles outbreaks, including 28 zones and 113 woreda [districts]. Oromia region is the most affected, accounting for 58% of the total reported cases, followed by Somali (28%), Amhara (8%), and Afar (6%) regions.

The majority of affected cases are children under 5 years old, comprising 50.4% of all cases, followed by the age group 15-44 years (25.4%) and 5-14 years (23.3%). Upon investigation of the vaccination status of the cases, it was noted that 72.6% had never received a single measles dose.

Public health actions

- A national coordination committee was set up at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute to coordinate the response to the measles outbreak as well as regional coordinating committees in each of the affected regions.
- Enhanced surveillance activities continue to enable the early detection of cases and prompt treatment.
- The Ethiopian government together with WHO, UNICEF, and other partners supported a responsive vaccination campaign in Somali region.
- In early February 2019, Ethiopia launched a measles vaccine 2nd dose (MCV2) vaccination into the routine immunization programme in the 2nd year of life.
- Management of measles cases is ongoing at healthcare facilities in the affected regions.

Situation interpretation

Measles is endemic in Ethiopia with outbreaks reported annually. A quarter of the people affected during the current outbreak are 15 years and above, and more than 82.6% of cases were either not vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown. In addition, an effective cold-chain system for storage and transport of the vaccine is lacking in a number of regions, especially Afar and Somali regions. The estimated measles vaccine 1st dose (MCV1) coverage by WHO and UNICEF in 2018 was 61%, and the administrative coverage for the same period was 88%. This is suboptimal to protect a community against an outbreak (to achieve herd immunity, usually 95% and above coverage is required).

There is a need to apply simple yet innovative approaches to address the health system challenges that impact the effective delivery of measles vaccines, and other vaccines, to the population, especially those located in the hard-to-reach areas of the country. Routine measles vaccination for children, combined supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) and strong community engagement are key public health strategies to reduce the incidence of the disease.

https://www.who.int/csr/don/22-october-2019-measles-lebanon/en/


Health authorities in Lebanon are responding to an outbreak of measles. From 1 Nov 2018 through 12 Oct 2019, a total of 1171 cases have been reported, of which 675 (57.6%) were laboratory confirmed, 8 (0.7%) epidemiologically linked cases, and 488 (41.7%) were clinically diagnosed. No associated deaths have been reported as of now.

Measles cases have been reported in all 8 Lebanese governorates, with Aakar, Baalbek-El-Hermel, Bekaa North, and Mount Lebanon governorates most affected. A total of 90% of suspected measles cases were Lebanese nationals, while 10% were Syrians living in informal settlements and in residential areas. The cumulative incidence of measles among Lebanese was higher than that of Syrians (22.4 versus 11.1 per 100 000 population, respectively).

The most affected age group among the 1123 cases with known age was children under the age of 5 years with 705 cases (63%), followed by cases of 5-9 years of age (271 cases; 24%), 10-14 (31 cases; 3%), 15-24 (19 cases; 2%), and people over 24 years of age 97 cases (9%). In addition, children below 5 years old have the highest cumulative incidence (124.6 per 100 000 population) followed by children in the age group of 5-9 years (41.4 per 100 000 population).

The immunization strategy employed by the Lebanon public health sector includes both measles vaccine given at 9 months of age (introduced in 1987) and measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine given to children as 2 doses at 12 and 18 months of age (MMR, introduced in 1996). The private sector implements MMR vaccination, at 12 months and 4-5 years of age.

In Lebanon, between 2000 and 2018, the WHO-UNICEF coverage estimations for 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine ranged from 15-75% with a median coverage of 63%.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Lebanon is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. Public health response measures include:

- Epidemiological investigations, contact tracing, and monitoring of close contacts;
- Sensitization of clinicians on measles surveillance, reporting, case investigation, and management;
- Social mobilization and distribution of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials;
- Measles assessment mission, conducted in May 2019, recommended a national measles campaign and support to the epidemiological surveillance unit;
- Localized accelerated immunization activities in areas of measles clusters; and
- Planning of a national measles campaign targeting 1 170 000 children in the age group of 6 months to less than 10 years of age.

WHO risk assessment

Based on the available information, the risk at the national level is considered to be high for the following reasons: nationwide case distribution and low vaccination coverage at national level with immunity gaps; the country host around 1 million displaced Syrians with limited access to healthcare; limited funding for supplementary immunization activities to improve measles vaccination coverage and for the epidemiological surveillance unit to support surveillance activities and capacity building; and measles cases being reported throughout the country.

The overall risk at regional level was assessed as moderate due to porous boundaries allowing free movement between Lebanon and Syria, the low vaccination coverage, and recent measles outbreaks reported in neighboring countries. The overall risk at global level was assessed as low.

WHO advice

While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, the provision of Vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles, as it is associated with reduced mortality and severity of complications. In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of measles cases result in death, and in the most vulnerable groups, deaths can reach up to 30%. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia.

In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every 2-3 years and usually last between 2 and 3 months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population's immunity status.

WHO urges all member states to do the following:

- Vaccinate to maintain high coverage (greater than or equal to 95%) with 2 doses of measles-containing-vaccine, in every district;
- Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation, and international travelers;
- Maintain a reserve of MCV for control of imported cases;
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance for "fever with rash cases" for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities;
- Ensure that collected blood samples from suspect measles cases are received by laboratories within 5 days;
- Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or re-establishment of endemic transmission;
- Administer Vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (2 doses of 50 000 IU for a child less than 6 month of age, 100 000 IU for children between 6 and12 months of age, or 200 000 IU for children 12-59 months, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).

A Pennsylvania woman has been ordered quarantined after she was potentially exposed to measles, the 1st time the city ordered a quarantine in decades, according to a city spokesman.

T.B. visited Lehigh Valley Health Network on 12 Oct [2019] during a time when people there may have been exposed to measles, according to a court petition. When she was notified of her possible exposure, she was informed that a vaccine could provide immunity but did not show up to get the vaccine and did not prove immunity to the Allentown Health Bureau, the petition says.

The petition says T.B. indicated she would not comply with the quarantine. In response, the Health Bureau went to court, and on Monday [21 Oct 2019], Judge Edward Reibman ordered her to stay in her home until 3 Nov [2019], or until the Health Bureau decides that she is noncommunicable.

T.B. is one of 5 people in the city to be directed to stay under quarantine due to measles concerns, Mike Moore, a spokesman for the city, said in a statement. Moore said that none of the 5 are currently displaying symptoms of measles. During her quarantine, the Allentown Health Bureau is responsible for providing T.B. food and other necessities, the order states.

Allentown Health Bureau director Vicky Kistler said it is the 1st time such a court order was issued in about 2 decades, according to Moore's statement.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in a statement that confirmed measles cases are up in 2019. It said there have been 16 confirmed cases this year [2019], while there were only 2 last year [2018].
