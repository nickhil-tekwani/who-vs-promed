Rare strain of AIDS virus moves beyond Cameroon
-----------------------------------------------
A very rare strain of AIDS [acute immunodeficiency syndrome] virus
previously found only among a few people in Cameroon has most probably
spread outside the West African country, according to a case reported
by The Lancet on Friday [25 Nov 2011]. [HIV-1 group N: travelling
beyond Cameroon, By Constance Delaugerre, Fabienne De Oliveira,
Caroline Lascoux-Combe, Jean-Christophe Plantier, and Francois Simon.
In The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9806, Page 1894, 26 Nov 2011;
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61457-8/fulltext#article_upsell].

The 1st identified infection with the so-called "group N" strain of
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found in 1998 in a
Cameroonian woman who had progressed to AIDS. [For an explanation of
the nomenclature of HIV, see the moderator comment below]. Since then,
more than 12 000 HIV-infected patients living in Cameroon have been
tested for group-N infection, but only 12 cases, including 2 couples,
have ever been found.

The new case, reported by French doctors, involves a 57-year-old man
who was admitted to the Saint Louis Hospital Paris in January [2011]
suffering from fever, rash, swollen lymph glands and genital
ulceration. The patient had high levels of a virus in the HIV-1
"family''[i.e., Family _Retroviridae_, genus _Lentivirus_, species
_Human immunodeficiency virus_], but tests to pinpoint the particular
strain proved inconclusive.

On 9 Feb 2011, the patient developed facial paralysis. The French team
then carried out further tests on blood samples, which were found to
react in an antibody essay for the N strain. [For those in the trade:
Fourth-generation ELISA (ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott, Chicago,
IL) was weakly positive, and HIV-1 western blot (New Lav Blot I,
Biorad, Paris, France). - Mod.CP].

Tracing his sexual history, the researchers believe the infection was
probably the "group N" virus acquired from intercourse with a partner
in Togo, from where he had just returned. This case of HIV-1 group-N
primary infection indicates that this rare group is now circulating
outside Cameroon, which emphasises the need for rigorous HIV
epidemiological monitoring, according the the team led by Professor
Francois Simon.

The finding is important because the patient suffered not only severe
symptoms but also a fast-track decline in his immune system, as shown
in the number of his CD4 white blood cells. He was given a powerful
5-drug combination of anti-retrovirals, to which he responded, but
needs close monitoring in the future, the letter [in Lancet] stated.

Group N may have leapt to humans from chimpanzees, possibly through
the handling of bushmeat infected with the simian equivalent of HIV,
scientists believed. It is one of 4 sub-types of virus gathered in the
HIV-1 group, the others being M, which is by far the most prevalent, O
and P. The P strain, like O and N is very rare and may have jumped to
humans from gorillas, according to a study published in 2009. There is
also a minority viral family [species] called HIV-2, which also may
have passed to humans from animal primates.

Experts Confirm 12 Group N Cases Since 1998
-------------------------------------------
Besides severe health conditions, AIDS is also observed as a social
stigma in almost every part of the world. Consequently, experts are
[striving] in order to develop some efficient measures that can reduce
the severity of HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, it has been reported that an
extremely rare strain of AIDS virus has increased its [range] beyond
the boundaries of Cameroon. Earlier, health experts [detected] this
uncommon virus only among a few people in the region.

Investigators identified the first N group infection earlier in 1998
in a Cameroonian woman. Afterwards, this woman was observed to develop
AIDS. Up till now, there are more than 12 000 confirmed HIV-infected
patients in the region, [of whom only 12] have have tested positive
for group-N infection.

Recently, French doctors described a 57-year-old man hospitalized in
the Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, in January 2011, suffering an array
of disorders including fever, rash, swollen lymph glands as well as
genital ulceration. Medical tests have confirmed that the victim is
suffering from higher levels of an HIV-1 virus, though initial tests
failed to identify the particular strain conclusively. Later he
developed facial paralysis and admitted to have had sexual contact
with a Togolese partner and had developed HIV primary infection.

"This case of HIV-1 group-N primary infection indicates that this rare
group is now circulating outside Cameroon, which emphasizes the need
for rigorous HIV epidemiological monitoring," noted the expert team.
Meanwhile, scientists have claimed that a blend of 5 anti-retroviral
drugs has had beneficial effect.

[There are 2 types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both types are transmitted
by sexual contact, through blood, and from mother to child, and they
appear to cause clinically indistinguishable AIDS. However, it seems
that HIV-2 is less easily transmitted, and the period between initial
infection and illness is longer in the case of HIV-2.

Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1, and generally when people
refer to HIV without specifying the type of virus they will be
referring to HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated
in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. The strains of HIV-1 can
be classified into 4 groups: the "major" group M, the "outlier" group
O and 2 new groups, N and P. These 4 groups may represent 4 separate
introductions of simian immunodeficiency virus into humans.

Group O appears to be restricted to west-central Africa and group N --
a strain discovered in 1998 in Cameroon and described in the Lancet
letter -- is extremely rare. In 2009 a new strain closely relating to
gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus was discovered in a Cameroonian
woman. It was designated HIV-1 group P. More than 90 percent of HIV-1
infections belong to HIV-1 group M. Within group M there are known to
be at least 9 genetically distinct subtypes (or clades) of HIV-1.
These are subtypes A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J and K.

Occasionally, 2 viruses of different subtypes can infect the cells of
an infected person and interact to create a new hybrid virus, but most
of these new strains do not persist. Those that infect more than one
person are known as "circulating recombinant forms." (From: AVERT HIV
Types, Subtypes Groups and Strains).

It remains to be seen whether the N-type HIV which appears to have
spread from Cameroon to Togo and now been detected in the patient in a
French hospital is an isolated phenomenon, or may be the harbinger of
an epidemic in other parts of West Africa and beyond (including
Europe).
