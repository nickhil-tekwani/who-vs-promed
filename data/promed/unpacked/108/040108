The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on Friday [3 Jan 2014] confirmed 2 outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants [PPR], also known as goat plague, in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

On 20 Dec 2013, a farm in Kuqa County in Aksu Prefecture reported that some goats showed suspected symptoms of the disease and 26 of them had died. On 22 Dec 2013, goats in Kalpin County in the same prefecture also showed suspected symptoms of the disease, and 44 of them died.

The country's exotic animal disease research center on Friday [3 Jan 2014] confirmed that the epidemic in both cases was PPR.

In Kalpin County, local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 448 goats have been culled and safely disposed of.

In Kuqa County, work to seal off the infected areas and cull goats is being conducted in an orderly manner to prevent the disease from spreading, according to the MOA.

Peste des petits ruminants, also known as PPR, goat plague, or ovine rinderpest, is a contagious disease mainly affecting goats and sheep. The virus causes fever, lesions, labored breathing, and diarrhea in infected animals.

[The 2 new outbreaks were notified on Fri 3 Jan 2014 to the OIE, in China's 3rd follow-up report since the start of the epizootic in early December 2013. The report is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14610.

The 2 current outbreaks are situated south-west to the 3 earlier outbreaks reported in Xinjiang, and closer to the border with Kyrgyzstan. As indicated in ProMED-mail's previous posting on this continuing epizootic, dated 2 Jan 2014, the actual circulation of the virus in China is suspected to be wider and it may have commenced some time back; an earlier PPR outbreak was reported from Tibet in June 2010.

Without vaccination, PPR is likely to spread further in China, which maintains a population of 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats (OIE data, 2012).

Tajikistan notified 2 PPR outbreaks in October 2013. Kazakhstan reported that PPR "was not reported in 2012". According to Kyrgyzstan's report of June 2013, PPR was "never reported" there. In May 2013, PPR was added to the list of diseases for which the OIE has put in place a specific procedure for official recognition of disease status. The list of countries with their officially approved PPR-status is yet to be produced. - Mod.AS
