We would like to provide some quantitative data regarding influenza hospitalisations in South Australia referred to in ProMED-mail post "Influenza (26): Australia (SA), hospital pressures 20140906.2754016."

Australia has a sentinel influenza hospital-based surveillance system based in 17 hospitals across Australia. The South Australian site is the Royal Adelaide Hospital, which has collected data on admissions with confirmed influenza since July 2009. The Royal Adelaide Hospital is an adult referral hospital located in Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia.

Between 5 Apr and 5 Sep 2014, there have been 161 admissions with influenza at the Royal Adelaide. This compares to 109 in the entire April-November 2013 season, 196 in 2012 and 80 in 2011.

In the week ending 5 Sep 2014, there were 39 admissions reported, which is the highest weekly number of admissions since 2010. The peak weekly number of admissions was 11 in 2013, 30 in 2012 and 10 in 2011.
