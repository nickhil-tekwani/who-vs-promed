[Both Namibia and Zimbabwe have experienced similar isolated
small-scale outbreaks of African Horse Sickness (AHS) in 2003. The
disease is caused by a virus of the family Reoviridae, genus
Orbivirus and can cause mortality of greater than 75 percent. AHS is
characterized by several forms, including subacute, respiratory,
cardiac, and mixed. The respiratory form is characterized by large
amounts of froth pouring out of the nasal passages and pulmonary
edema. Some horses with cardiac forms have lesions characterized by
a distinctive intramuscular, gelatinous edema which can often be seen
on the ligamentum nuchae of these horses. Thus, the presentation is
sometimes quite dramatic. Culicoides species are the main insect
vector. - Mod.PC]
