Zimbabwean health authorities say 11 people have died from cholera in
a town outside Harare in an outbreak blamed on collapsing sewer
services and the country's economic crisis.

Authorities said Tuesday [21 Oct 2008] at least 500 people have been
treated since the outbreak earlier in October 2008 in Chinhoyi, 70
miles (113 km) northwest of Harare.

Diarrhea outbreaks in impoverished towns across the country have been
blamed on water outages and other problems associated with Zimbabwe's
economic meltdown. Authorities have urged the government to stem the
discharge of sewage from broken pipes into rivers and dams.

Cholera and diarrhea have hit Zone 'F' preliminary games camp of the
16th Nigeria College of Education Games (NICEGA) being held at the
Federal College of Education in Gombe, with no fewer than 5
participants in serious condition.

A Leadership Sports check revealed that there were complaints about
the acute shortage of water supply, mattresses, and hostel rooms. This
is connected to the fact that the host school is in session and the
accommodation facilities are inadequate for the students and visitors.
