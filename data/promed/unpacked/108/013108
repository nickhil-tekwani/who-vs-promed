Mexico: Conjunctivitis Reaches Epidemic Proportions in Tamaulipas
----------------------------------------------------
Conjunctivitis, a contagious eye [infection] commonly known as "pink eye",
is infecting Matamoros [Mexico] residents in epidemic proportions,
Tamaulipas Health Department officials reported on Tue 30 Sep 2003. About
921 cases of conjunctivitis have been reported across Tamaulipas in the
last 3 weeks ­-- 582 of them from Matamoros, the Health Department stated.
Ernesto Chanes, Director of the Health Department, said "The majority of the
cases we registered are being passed from family member to family member.
Its very contagious."
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the membrane that covers the white of
the eyeball and the inside of the eyelid. It is caused by a bacterial or
viral infection. The [infection] does not pose any long-term health
problems. In Texas [USA], Cameron County and Brownsville health officials are
closely monitoring the situation in Matamoros. No cases have been
documented in Brownsville, but "conjunctivitis is not a disease that has to
be reported to the county," said Alicia Omana, epidemiologist at the
Cameron County Health Department.
Ricardo Puente, administrator at the Red Cross branch in Matamoros, said in
the last 3 weeks the Red Cross has treated 450 patients for conjunctivitis.
Cases have risen dramatically since Sunday, said Jose Antonio Garcia,
director of a Matamoros hospital affiliated with the Social Services and
Security Institute for State Employees. His hospital has treated about 162
patients for conjunctivitis, he said. He said "We have heard that more cases
are being registered in other hospitals. This is an important outbreak
compared with other years." Matamoros health officials recommend frequent
hand washing to prevent spreading the illness.
"This kind of disease is a seasonal viral [illness]," Chanes said. "It often
registers during the month of September through the end of
October. "Meanwhile, 2 of Matamoros' hospitals have opened up wings
specifically to deal with the flood of conjunctivitis patients.

[Outbreaks of conjunctivitis have been reported worldwide so far in 2003
(Algeria, Bhutan, South Korea, Mexico, and Central America), sometimes
associated with natural disasters resulting in the breakdown of normal
patterns of hygiene. The identity of the infectious agent in Mexico and
adjacent countries in Central America is unclear from this report, but the
clinical and epidemiological picture is consistent with acute hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis, which is often associated with infection by an enteroviral
agent such as _Human enterovirus 70_ or _Human coxsackievirus A24_. Further
information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
