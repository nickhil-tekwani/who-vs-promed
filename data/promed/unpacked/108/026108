A St. Helena, California, maker of an olive oil dip sold through
Williams-Sonoma retail stores is recalling thousands of jars of the
product after a routine state inspection found that it could
potentially harbor the bacteria that cause botulism poisoning.

State health officials are urging consumers not to eat Olivier brand
Parmesan & Asiago Dip with Garlic and Basil, even if the contents of
the product's 11.76 ounce jars do not smell spoiled.

No one has been sickened, and no specimens of the botulism producing
_Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium have been found, said Patrick
Kennelly, chief of the Food Safety section at the California
Department of Public Health. However, state inspectors on Wednesday
[30 Jan 2008] at the Olivier Olive Oil Products Inc. plant found that
acid levels in the jars of dip were too low to kill such bacteria. In
an insufficiently acidic environment, the bacteria can grow in sealed
jars, producing one of the most potent and deadly toxins known.

"This is all a precaution," Kennelly said. "We have no evidence of
toxin production."

The company immediately ordered a voluntary recall of 10 000 jars,
about a year's production of the olive oil dip, which contains garlic
and basil as well as Parmesan and Asiago cheeses. The products were
sold through Olivier stores in St. Helena and Truckee, and are
distributed nationwide through Williams-Sonoma.

Affected lots are numbered OPA 34171, OPA 23471, OAP 17271, OAP
17671, OAP 36061, OAP 36161, and OPA 33961. Consumers who find a jar
with one of those lot numbers are encouraged to call the state hot
line at (800) 495-3232.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.

Infused oils have previously been implicated in botulism outbreaks in
the USA and worldwide (1-4). An acidification step in the preparation
of herb-infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential
production of botulism toxins.

As a result of previous outbreaks in BC (Canada) and in New York
(USA) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code requires 2
barriers in the destruction of spores and in the prevention of toxin
production in a commercial product of this type (reduced oxygen
packaging): 1) destruction of the spores by heat (thermal processing)
2) inhibition of toxin production by altering the food through
acidification, controlling aw (water activity), the use of salt and
preservatives, or refrigeration. Also, it is because some single
barriers can result in a product unacceptable to consumers that
multiple barriers are used. The common 2nd barrier in infused oil of
this kind is acidification via phosphoric or citric acid, for
example. The pH of the final product should be 4.6 or less.
