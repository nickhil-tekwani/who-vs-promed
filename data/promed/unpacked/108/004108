[The following information comes from the European Commission's Animal Disease website section on avian influenza, available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animal-diseases/control-measures/avian-influenza_en (accessed on 9 Jan 2021).

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2020

"During 2020, 2 distinct epidemic seasons of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were observed in the European Union. The 1st HPAI epidemic season started on 31 Dec 2019, with the 1st outbreak in poultry confirmed in Poland. A new HPAI virus of subtype H5N8 (2020) was involved in the outbreak. By March [2020], the disease was confirmed in Poland, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. The H5N8 (2020) subtype of the HPAI virus was responsible for all of these outbreaks. The most affected Member State was Hungary, after the virus entered in the area with a high density of duck and geese holdings. Outbreaks of HPAI were also detected in Bulgaria between March and June 2020, but the virus involved was of subtype H5N8, which also circulated in Bulgaria in 2018-2019. The last outbreak in poultry related to the 1st epidemic season of HPAI was confirmed on 5 Jun 2020.

"Only 3 wild birds were found infected with HPAI during the 1st half of 2020 (in Germany and Poland). The virus involved was the same as the one detected in the poultry farms.

"The 2nd HPAI epidemic season started at the end of October 2020 when the 1st cases were reported in wild birds in the Netherlands. Again, the 1st HPAI virus detected was of H5N8 subtype, different from the one that circulated in the 1st half of the year [2020]. Since then and until the end of 2020, a high number of dead and sick wild birds, mostly of migratory species, were found to be infected with HPAI viruses of subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, and H5N3 being detected by several EU countries and the United Kingdom. The largest number of cases in wild birds were reported in the northern part of Germany, in Denmark, and in the Netherlands. Between October and end of December 2020, the disease was also confirmed in poultry in Croatia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

"See the map with the distribution of the HPAI detected during 2020, separated by epidemic season [at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2020_map.pdf].

HPAI- Latest developments 2021

"The HPAI epidemic season, which started in October 2020, will continue in 2021. Outbreaks and cases in wild birds continued to be confirmed by several EU countries. This map [from 1 Oct 2020 to 5 Jan 2021, https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2021_map.pdf] represents the distribution of the HPAI detections." - Mod.CRD]
