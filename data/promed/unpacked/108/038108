Analysis of European Influenza Surveillance Scheme Database Reveals Possible
West-east Spread of Influenza Across Europe
-------------------------------------------
An analysis of data collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme
(EISS, <http://www.eiss.org>) during the past 5 winters (1999 to 2004)
reveals a possible west-east spread of influenza across Europe (1). During 3
of the 5 winters (2003/2004, 2002/2003, 2001/2002), the analysis suggests
that there was west-east spread and during one of these seasons (2001/2002)
there was also a south-north spread [Illustrated by a figure, not shown
here, showing the peak week of clinical activity versus the longitude of
each country: 2003/2004 season].
More detailed mapping analyses are needed to confirm these findings, and
EISS will initiate a European Mapping Project, which is based on a
collaborative mapping project between Germany and the Netherlands (2), to
further explore these question and to improve the presentation of influenza
activity each winter. The current objective is to provide this new mapping
data on the EISS web-site during the 2005/2006 season.
The analysis also found that the clinical activity (usually cases of
influenza-like illness, but occasionally cases of acute respiratory
infection) reported by sentinel physicians and collected by EISS are a valid
indicator of influenza activity and that, for Europe as a whole, increased
influenza activity lasts for 10 to 22 weeks (2 to 5 months) each season.
The long period of increased influenza activity and the possibility of a
west-east spread may have important consequences for influenza pandemic
planning in Europe. For example, these findings could help with the planning
and efficient allocation of resources (e.g. antivirals and vaccines) in
Europe before and during a pandemic.
