Hospitals on alert amid fears of new superbug outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Every Scottish hospital is to be put on alert for a new bug that is
resistant to normal antimicrobial agents, amid fears that Scotland is
facing an outbreak. Currently, only half of all hospitals are
monitoring the deadly strain of bacteria that is responsible for
dozens of deaths across Britain each year.
As part of a government crackdown, every hospital laboratory in
Scotland will be required to report all infections involving extended
spectrum beta lactamase-producing (ESBL) coliforms.
They will also be issued an action plan to deal with outbreaks,
including the isolation of infected patients and the introduction of
disinfection procedures to halt the strains.
In Scotland, the number of confirmed ESBL [coliform] infections has risen
almost 10-fold since 1999. With 220 cases reported by June 2004, the 2004
tally is expected to overtake the record 420 infections identified in 2003.
The rising rate of infection has fueled fears that Scotland could
soon be hit by an outbreak similar to the one that killed 28 patients
in Shropshire in 2003. Doctors believe the official Scottish figures
represent the tip of the iceberg. Because so few hospitals are
monitoring the bacteria, it is not known how widespread the bug is or
the number of persons it has killed.
Dr. Ian Gould, the president of the Scottish Microbiology Association, is
spearheading the offensive against ESBL [coliforms]. The alert network is
being set up in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and funded with
a grant from the Scottish executive.
Only around half of the 30 or so hospital laboratories in Scotland are
actively screening for ESBL [coliforms]. Even then, different techniques are
being used to identify them, some of which are more effective than others.

[Extended-spectrum beta lacatamases (ESBLs) are enzymes elaborated by
bacteria, most often _Klebsiella_ spp., but other
_Enterobacteriaceae_ as well. These enzymes cleave, and, thereby,
inactivate most penicillins and cephalosporins. These have become
common nosocomial pathogens in many regions, and nosocomial outbreaks
may occur. Treatment can be difficult, but many isolates remain
susceptible to the carbapenem antibiotics, such as imipenem.
In New York, where hospital-acquired infections with ESBL-producing
bacilli are fairly commonplace, an increasing number of these
isolates are carbapenem-resistant and many are amikacin-resistant.
Polymyxin B has retained activity, however, against most strains.
Monitoring the number of cases of ESBL [coliform] infection is important but
is only one step in their overall control, which must include control of
overuse of antimicrobial drugs, aggressive, well-supported infection control
programs and the development of both rapid diagnostic and new therapeutic
methodologies. - Mod.LL]
