----------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to keep you informed about the testing carried out on
samples collected during a recent outbreak of bluetongue in Israel,
and the preliminary results.

Between 13 Oct and 24 Nov 2008, the Virology Division of the Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Israel (KVI) received 12 samples (7 blood
samples, 5 spleens) taken from animals in 9 locations throughout the
country where clinical bluetongue (or alternatively EHD [epizootic
hemorrhagic disease], when involving bovines) cases were reported.
From all samples (7 from sheep, 4 from cattle, and one from a goat) a
virus suspected as BT or EHD was isolated by IV inoculation of
embryonated hen egg. For confirmation and serotyping, all 12 isolates
(egg homogenates) were forwarded to the Bluetongue Community
Reference Laboratory (CRL) at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH)
at Pirbright.

Once received at the CRL, RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction] was performed on the 12 samples and all were found
positive for bluetongue virus and negative for EHD. The samples were
then passaged onto BHK [baby hamster kidney] cells and the
supernatant was tested using prototype serotype-specific real-time
RT-PCR assays for serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 16. The presence of
BTV-4 and BTV-16 was confirmed in 4 of the samples. The CRL were
unable to identify the serotype of BTV in the remaining samples using
both the serotype-specific real-time PCR assays as well as
conventional typing primers for the 24 BTV serotypes.

The CRL then went about trying to identify the serotype in these
remaining samples in 2 ways:
1. A Virus neutralisation assay (VNT) was set up and 2 of the samples
were tested against control sera for all 24 serotypes.
2. Nucleotype specific primers were used to amplify and sequence
cDNAs from these samples.

Results
-------
The VNT confirmed the presence of BTV-serotype 24 in the 2 samples tested.

The primers for nucleotype A (which includes serotypes 4, 10, 11, 17,
20, and 24) generated a cDNA product of the expected size (482 bp).
These amplicons were then sequenced, confirming that the remaining
samples (except one sample) contained BTV-serotype 24.

This work has confirmed the presence of BTV-4, BTV-16, and BTV-24 in
the samples from Israel.

The CRL are continuing to screen these samples for mixed infections.

Thanks to all the staff at the CRL and Arbovirus Research group at
IAH, Pirbright for carrying out this work.

[The bluetongue epizootic observed in Israel during the fall months
of 2008, when BTV-4, BTV-16, and BTV-24 were identified, was
characterised by 2 exceptional phenomena:

1. The occurrence of clinical disease cases in bovines, apparently
caused by BTV-16;
2. The 1st appearance in Israel of BTV-24.

Bluetongue is regarded endemic in Israel since its initial
laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, clinical disease seen
almost every year (September-December), mainly in sheep of European
breeds or their crosses. Since 1952, clinical cases in cattle were
regarded as extremely rare, though seroconversion, reflecting
widespread subclinical bovine infections, was demonstrated to be very
common. Six serotypes have been identified in Israel throughout the
years, namely BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6 (1972), BTV-2
(1973), BTV-10 (1973), and BTV-15 (2006) (Year of first
identification). BTV-4 is the most prevalent serotype. The disease is
typically seasonal.

The 2008 BTV-16 outbreak was observed in 2 farms in northwest Israel
(Acco district, Western Galilee), in cattle and goats. The most
remarkable event was seen in a dairy cattle operation in Rosh
Haniqra. It started on 19 Nov 2008 and, reportedly, resolved on 10
Dec 2008, with 80 cases among the 250-strong herd, 12 of which died.
As reported by Israel to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health), this means an apparent morbidity rate of 32 percent and an
apparent case fatality rate of 15 percent, a most unusual event in
Israeli terms. Israel's report on its BTV-16 outbreak is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7741>.

BTV-16 cases have been reported, during the same period, from another
eastern Mediterranean territory, namely the Greek island of Lesbos
[Lesvos], close to the Turkish mainland; possible cattle involvement
(pending requested information) was discussed in ProMED-mail posting
20090126.0350. It will be interesting to obtain data on the
phylogenetic relationship between the current Israeli and Greek BTV-16
strains.

BTV-24 has become Israel's 7th serotype. According to the data
provided by the Pirbright laboratory (table titled "Isolates of
Bluetongue virus type 24 (BTV-24 ) in the dsRNA virus collection at
IAH Pirbright"), the following 2 BTV-24 strains are included there:

1. Reference strain of BTV-24 from South Africa.
2. BTV-24 strain isolated from a spleen sampled on 25 Sept 2007 in
Marion County, Florida, USA from farmed white-tailed-deer, kept in a
herd with "multiple losses and clinical disease."

For this and additional information, see
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/btv-24.htm>.

Serotype 24 is phylogenetically related to serotypes 4, 10, 11, 17,
and 20, but the serological data concerning relationships between
this and other types are limited (see ref 1). This information
deserves to be taken into consideration if/when vaccination against
BTV-24 is discussed. The only BTV vaccine currently available in
Israel (and reportedly applied "in response to the outbreak"), is an
inactivated bivalent (BTV-2 and 4) vaccine (of European manufacture).
Currently, no vaccine against BTV-24 is available, anywhere.

According to South African sources, 9 isolates of BTV-24 were
obtained there from ovines between the years 1983-2003 (Ref 2).

The Israeli BTV-24 OIE report is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7737>.
The reason given for its immediate notification is "New strain of a
listed disease." The report includes a map, showing the distribution
of these outbreaks throughout the country.
