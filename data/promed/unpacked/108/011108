The season's 1st 2 cases of the mosquitoborne illness La Crosse
encephalitis have been confirmed in 2 children in western North Carolina.

Both children, one in Haywood County and one in Transylvania County, are
recovering after contracting the virus. La Crosse is the commonest
mosquitoborne virus affecting North Carolinians and is largely confined to
western North Carolina. There were 10 reported cases of the virus in North
Carolina last year [2007].

La Crosse symptoms occur from a few days to a couple of weeks after being
bitten by an infected mosquito. These symptoms include fever, headache,
nausea, and vomiting. In more severe cases, convulsions, tremors, and coma
can occur. Children under 16 years of age and the elderly are the most
susceptible to the disease.

The disease is rarely fatal, but a child from Transylvania County did die
as a result of infection in 2001.

Public health officials are telling people to take measures to make their
homes less mosquito-friendly, including
- removing any containers that can hold water,
- keeping gutters clean and in good repair,
- repairing leaky faucets and changing the water in bird baths and pet
bowls at least twice a week, and
- checking window and door screens.

People can also protect their families from mosquito bites by using
mosquito repellants, wearing light-colored long pants and long-sleeved
shirts, and reducing time spent outdoors in the early morning and early
evening when mosquitoes are most active.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using
repellants that contain DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus.

[La Crosse virus (LACV) is in the California serogroup of viruses in the
_Bunyaviridae_ family. Although most LACV infections are subclinical or
mild febrile illnesses, frank encephalitis progressing to seizures and coma
can occur and the case fatality rate is less than one per cent. In the USA,
particularly in the upper midwestern states, an average of 70 clinical
cases are reported annually, the vast majority in pre-adolescent children.
Hospitalizations and saubsequent care can be lengthy with costs approaching
USD 450 000.

The virus is transmitted by _Aedes triseriatus_ mosquitoes and maintained
by transovarial transmission with amplification in forest rodents
(chipmunks _Tamias striatus_ and squirrels _Sciurus carolinensis_). More
recently, the virus has been isolated from the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes
albopictus_, which has become established in the Western Hemisphere. No
vaccine against LACV is available. A brief fact sheet for LACV and its
pathogenesis and epidemiology provided by the US CDC can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/lacfact.htm>.
