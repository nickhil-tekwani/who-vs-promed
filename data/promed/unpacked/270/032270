Thirteen employees from the Veterinary Services Department tested positive
[sic for Nipah virus during efforts to contain the viral outbreak [in
Malaysia this year. Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk
Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor said they were from different levels of the
department including those working in laboratories and overseeing the pig
culling operations. "They contracted the virus in the early stages of the
outbreak."
He refused to reveal the status of their health and the States they were
from. However, it is understood they are in good condition.
Mohd Nordin said the workers who tested positive for the virus [sic were
presently undergoing counselling and regular medical examination as a
precautionary measure.
The director-general added that they were initially inoculated against
Japanese encephalitis [virus before carrying out their duties. "It was
only after further research that the department discovered and realised
that we were actually facing the Nipah virus and not JE. That is why staff
from the department were infected by the Nipah virus," he added.
He added that although the worst had been overcome in the outbreak, the
department was still investigating the virus and would always be on the
alert in tackling future cases. "Investigations on the viral outbreak may
continue for several more years."

[This is a troubling report. Laboratory workers? Previous reports
indicated that no laboratory workers had become infected. This must have
been based solely on clinical observations, i.e., no one ill, so all well.
I simply had assumed that adequate serologic surveillance had been and was
being carried out. If the names and locations of residence of these
workers are not being released, why is there a problem revealing the status
of their health?
"Tested positive" must mean "have antibody". Is there any evidence that
humans can become subclinically infected with Nipah virus and shed virus in
urine, saliva, and other body fluids? - Mod.CHC
