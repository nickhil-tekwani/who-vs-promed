I wholly agree with JW 's comments. The commercialised state of medicine
today with emphasis on profits et al may affect the psyche of health
workers. We may have arrived at a point where emphasis on moral and civic
responsibilities, rather than new medical advancements alone, can indirectly
contribute to public health prevention and control programs. With the sort
of networking permitted by ProMED we may soon realise that the situation is
far from being better in some other parts of the world.

Three cheers for your editorial comment on this topic -- "without having to
be told". Good grief.......OF COURSE you report it! Regardless of the
possibility that someone will slap you with a lawsuit. I have been through
this exact scenario with bacterial meningitis.The patient's family did not
want a report filed with county health because one was a food service worker
at a LTCF! Our responsibility as health care workers includes PROTECTING the
public from disease. (first do no harm).

It is obvious that some kind educational initiative may be needed. It would
seem that only those health professionals with a profound sense of personal
and professional integrity will report these kinds of cases without some
kind of external pressure.
This is a sad commentary on the profession, is it not?
