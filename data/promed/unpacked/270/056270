Hungary admits link with UK bird flu outbreak
----------------------------------------------
Hungary has admitted for the first time that it may have been the source
of the deadly flu virus that caused an outbreak at a British turkey farm.
Bognar Lajos, Hungary's deputy chief veterinary officer, conceded that the
H5N1 virus could have gone undetected in a Hungarian turkey flock which
was sent to slaughter. He said the meat might then have been exported by
Bernard Matthews, the British poultry company, to its plant in Holton,
Suffolk [England], before the virus infected birds there.
Despite the admission, Mr. Lajos insisted that ultimately the blame for
the British outbreak must lie with Bernard Matthews, which was criticised
for shortfalls in its biosecurity in the wake of the scare. Mr. Lajos
said: "It is possible that the virus was still in an incubation period in
a flock and no symptoms would have been seen. Such a flock could have been
sent to slaughter and the meat transported to the UK. The problem was not
with Hungary though. The problem was Bernard Matthews and its
biosecurity." Until now, officials in the east European country have
flatly denied that the virus could have come from Hungary. The Csongrad
region of the country, south-east of the capital Budapest, is the area in
which 2 goose farms were hit by the virus in January [2007], weeks before
the same strain infected a flock of Bernard Matthews turkeys.
A report into the British outbreak by the Department of Environment,
Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) concluded that the most plausible
explanation was that the infection had been introduced to Britain through
imported turkey meat from Hungary. Britain's poultry industry is still
paying the price of the bird flu outbreak. Research by the analysts
Nielsen shows turkey sales have fallen by 29 percent over the past 3
months while sales of frozen turkeys are down 33 percent on last year
[2006]. The industry is thought to have lost sales worth more than GBP 9.4
billion [USD 18 629 295 598]. Sales at Bernard Matthews have also dropped
dramatically, although the company insists the decline has been halted.
Last month, the multi-million pound company was paid GBP 600,000 [USD 1
189 199] in compensation by the Government for the 160,000 birds it had to
cull as a result of the outbreak.
In Hungary, however, the goose farmers affected by bird flu shortly before
the British outbreak say they are still waiting for compensation. In a
dingy shed on the Kolos Agro farm in Szentes-Lapisto, Csongrad, Garai
Tibor, a farmer, described how just a few months ago it had been full of
geese. Now, the only evidence of the 3335 birds that once inhabited his 3
55-yard huts is a small patch of feathers on the ground. "The outbreak has
given us a bad name, but I am not angry about that," he said. "It was bad
luck that the virus came to our farm. I am angry that we have been blamed
for the English outbreak though when they seem to have brought the
infection upon themselves. We did nothing wrong, while they had all these
problems. How is it they have received all this money?" Mr. Tibor has been
forced to lay off 3 workers from the local village and has lost more than
74 million Hungarian forints (GBP 200,000) [USD 403 735].
Under European legislation, member states can have half of any
compensation given to farmers hit by bird flu outbreaks paid by the
European Commission. A spokesman at the EC said it had received no
application for compensation for either of the farms hit by the outbreak.
However, Mr Lajos insisted that between them, the two farms had received
about 100 million forints [USD 544 993] from his government. Szekely
Zsolt, who owns the other farm in nearby Derekegyhaz, refused to comment.
A spokesman for Bernard Matthews said: "None of the investigations to date
has been conclusive about the causes of the outbreak."

[It has long been known that delays in paying compensation have a very
negative impact on persuading farmers to report suspect outbreaks of
disease in their animals. Without prompt reporting, even the best
government service will be severely hampered. And then come the
temptations to pre-emptively slaughter healthy in-contact stock, and all
that that implies. - Mod.MHJ]
