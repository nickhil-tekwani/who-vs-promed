This is the 1st report from Peru of transmissible gastroenteritis
(TGE) in swine since 2005. In fact, in the Americas only Canada, USA,
Mexico, and Cuba have reported the disease to the OIE WAHID database
since 2005. TGE is an important disease of swine in most countries
around the world caused by a coronavirus resulting in both epidemic
and endemic disease in pigs.

In the epidemic form of TGE, typical clinical signs include transient
vomiting, watery, yellow diarrhea which may contain undigested milk,
weight loss, dehydration, and high morbidity/mortality, especially in
pigs less than 2 weeks of age. One of the most notable signs is the
smell of the diarrhea -- foul steatorrhea (excess fat in feces) due to
maldigestion. Many pigs older than 3 weeks of age will survive but are
likely to remain stunted. Growing and finishing pigs with epidemic TGE
may show inappetence, diarrhea, agalactia, or vomiting of variable
period of time. - Mod.PC]
