More and more cases of whooping cough are turning up in the Lynchburg area. Just Monday morning, 24 Feb 2014, a local school put up a sign warning that a parent of a child that attends came down with the illness. The Lynchburg Health Department says they have seen an outbreak of pertussis, or whooping cough, since November 2013. There are cases in every age group from infants to the elderly, but officials say more often than not it is adults that spread the disease. "We've had more cases than expected in this area," said District
Epidemiologist Haley Phillips Evans.

Health experts say it's not necessarily kids that spread the disease. "Half of the kids that get whooping cough an adult brings them the illness," said Dr Thomas Eppes.

Any way you look at it, 2013 was a bad year for whooping cough. Dallas County counted the most cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis, in more than 2 decades with 404. Texas had to go back to the 1950s to find more cases than the 3908 confirmed last year [2013]. Its previous record was 5842 in 1959. But Tarrant County topped even that terrible distinction. Its 697 cases in 2013 beat the whooping cough record set there in 1940.

"It was an awful year," said Russell Jones, Tarrant County's chief epidemiologist. "We had the most pertussis cases of every county in Texas."
Other counties reported high numbers including Denton County with 312 and Collin with 203.

Jones blamed the spike on the cyclical nature of pertussis. The respiratory disease reappears annually with a noticeable increase in cases every 3 to 5 years. 5 years ago, Tarrant recorded 312 pertussis cases, Jones said. The county's previous record was set almost a decade before a vaccine became available for the disease.

To stem a repeat in 2014, local officials hope to encourage residents to update their immunizations against the disease.

According to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, 22 new cases of pertussis were reported in San Diego County last week [week of 10 Feb 2014], including 8 cases at locations where others may have been exposed to the disease.

Cases where others were exposed, include:
- a 5-year-old at Adams Elementary School in the San Diego Unified School District;
- a 7-year-old at Richland Elementary School in the San Marcos Unified School District;
Â· An 11-year-old at High Tech Middle School in San Diego Unified School District;
- a 12-year-old at El Camino Creek Elementary School in the Encinitas Union School District;
- a 12-year-old at Greenfield Middle School in the Cajon Valley Union School District;
- a 14-year-old at High Tech High Media Arts charter school in the San Diego Unified School District;
- a 16-year-old at La Jolla Country Day School;
- an individual at Love to Dance studio in Carmel Valley

The number of cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, reported in the county now stands at 83 for the year [2014]. There were 430 cases reported in 2013, 165 in 2012, and 1179 cases in 2010.

"We are continuing to see high levels of pertussis activity throughout the county," said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, county public health officer. "Being up-to-date on your vaccinations continues to be your best defense against the disease."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get doses of DTaP vaccine at the following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. Health officials also recommend that preteens and adults get a Tdap booster. Infants younger than 1-year-old are especially vulnerable because they cannot have the full five-dose series of pertussis vaccinations.

http://www.mydesert.com/viewart/20140207/NEWS08/302070016/Two-month-old-Riverside-County-dies-from-whooping-cough


A Riverside County infant died of complications related to whopping cough, in the 1st known fatal case in the state in 2014, health officials said Friday [7 Feb 2014]. According to the Riverside County Department of Public Health, the 2-month-old had not been vaccinated for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, nor had the infant's mother received a booster shot while she was pregnant. The child was not identified, though county health department Communicable Diseases Specialist Barbara Cole confirmed the infant was from the southwest county area.

"This serves as a sad reminder that illnesses like whooping cough are still very much with us, and immunizations are the 1st line of defense," said Dr Cameron Kaiser, public health officer for Riverside County.

"We strongly encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated, all parents to vaccinate their children on time, and for adults to keep current with their booster shots to reduce the spread of the disease."

California Department of Public Health Director Dr Ron Chapman said pregnant mothers can get a pertussis booster by their 3rd trimester. "Preventing deaths in infants by ensuring that all pregnant women get vaccinated is our primary goal in pertussis control," Chapman said. When pregnant women are vaccinated, the immunity they develop against pertussis is passed to their infants and helps protect infants until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Young infants are at the greatest risk of severe or fatal pertussis."

Health officials noted that whooping cough cases had moderated since peaking in 2010, when 9100 cases and 10 deaths were reported in California. However, the number of infections began to surge again last summer, and 83 percent of those with symptoms were youths under 18 --12 percent of whom were infants less than 6 months old, according to the state.

Officials said children need 5 doses of pertussis vaccine before they reach kindergarten, while adults should be inoculated if they're in regular contact with toddlers or are healthcare workers.

http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20140208/HEALTH/302080029/Whooping-cough-hits-Kent-County-Amish-community


A total of 48 people living in an Amish community in western Kent County have been infected with whooping cough, a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes violent coughing and can be fatal in infants. 80 percent of the cases are in children age 10 and younger, said Dr Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. 25 of the cases have occurred in infants through age 6, while 15 are ages 7 to 10. The rest are older youth or adults. So far, no cases have been identified outside the Amish community. Students from at least 3 schools have fallen ill. There have been no deaths or hospitalizations, and none of those sickened is seriously ill. "It is the youngest that we are the most concerned with," she said.

In Delaware, there were 57 cases in 2012 and 29 in 2011, according to DPH's communicable diseases statistics.

Rattay said DPH held an immunization clinic in the Amish community this past week with vaccinations available. The community has been supportive and helpful, with one of the elders opening their home as a meeting place for community education, antibiotics and vaccinations. "Because of that, we believe we're going to be able to keep this well contained. They've been helping us with the investigation and ensuring that communications are reaching individuals, so we can get treatment and vaccines to individuals in the community," Rattay said.

In 2004-2005, there was a bigger outbreak of pertussis in the Kent County Amish community, resulting in 345 identified cases, mostly among school-age children.

Clearly, much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from _Bordetella pertussis_ infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63 percent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997-2000 there were 11.8 percent with pneumonia, 1.4 percent with seizures, 0.2 percent with encephalopathy, and 0.8 percent died [56/7203]. This compared with parallel numbers of 28 percent, 8.6 percent, 0.7 percent, 0.1 percent, and less than 0.1 percent in infants 6-11 months of age http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea sometimes with hypoxia-induced seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental O2 in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

Immunization of the immediate family of the pregnant woman as well as of the woman herself are necessary to prevent needless deaths from infant pertussis. - Mod.LL]
