New outbreak in Thailand; Bird flu scare; Virus re-emerges in 9 provinces
Newin faults fighting cocks; vet disagrees
----------------------------------------------
Bird flu disease has re-emerged in poultry in 9 provinces, with officials
blaming unregulated movement of fighting roosters for the 2nd wave of the
epidemic.
Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob said random checks at 14 spots
confirmed the H5N1 strain of the flu had struck again. The check was
performed in 9 provinces, 8 of which had originally been declared bird flu-
affected "red zones", marked for strict quarantine, and then been downgraded
to "yellow zones", marked for surveillance.
8 provinces are experiencing a recurrence of the outbreak: Chaiyaphum,
Uthai Thani, Uttaradit, Sukhothai, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Petchaburi,
and Phangnga. The 9th province, Roi Et, is having its 1st outbreak of the
virus.
Newin said 10 300 samples from poultry, possible flu carriers, had been
collected since 12 Feb 2004 from the red zones and 427 samples from the
yellow zones, where movements of poultry were banned without a transport
certificate. He said the flu was found in 20 percent of all the samples in
the red zones. In the flu-emerging provinces, the infection was present
mostly in fighting roosters.
In Roi Et, the flu came from "nomadic ducks" transported to open fields to
graze for food such as snail pests.
In the 8 provinces, all poultry within a 1km radius of the outbreak epicentre
was being destroyed.
Newin said infected fighting roosters smuggled out of red zones during
the first outbreak and then brought back to the areas had probably
re-ignited the infection.
In Roi Et, poultry would be culled in a 5km radius as this was the 1st time
the flu had been reported in the province. A poultry movement ban was also
imposed.
Some owners have refused to slaughter their prized fighting roosters.
Newin expected the latest culling operation to take no more than 72 hours.
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra downplayed fears of the re-emerging flu,
saying the government would carry out 3 spot checks every 21 days after the
initial outbreak to ensure the virus was eradicated. He said the 1st
quarantine period may not root out the infection but subsequent rounds
would do the trick.
Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, who oversees the flu situation,
said the fact the disease had returned in the same red zones showed the
viral spread had been contained.
Jiroj Sasipreeyajan, of Chulalongkorn University's faculty of veterinary
science, said the detection of the bird flu virus in yellow surveillance
zones was due to the failure to eradicate all fowl in the epidemic area.
Birds in their natural habitats should also be culled, not just chickens, Dr
Jiroj said. The Ministry of Agriculture needed to work more closely with the
Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment, he said.
He did not believe the reappearance of the H5N1 strain in Thailand would
damage the nation's credibility in dealing with the bird flu epidemic.
Concealing a report on bird flu discovery was more shameful than it being
detected again, Dr Jiroj said. A 2nd round of detection was not unusual for
such a highly infectious virus. He disagreed with the Ministry of
Agriculture's assertion that owners of fighting cocks were to blame.

[If birds smuggled from an infected zone to a non-infected zone are the
reason the non-infected zone becomes infected, the smuggler is responsible
for the infection. It does not matter whether their occupation is raising
layers or fighting cocks, it is the smuggler who is responsible. The
motivations in this case are likely related to fighting -- either actually
fighting the birds or acquiring their genetics.
Newcastle disease in California in 2003 was associated with fighting cocks;
now the issue is Avian Influenza in fighting cocks. How may cases of Avian
Influenza in humans have been associated with cock fighting?
Certainly, these regions in Thailand will have to be very diligent in the
surveillance of this disease. ­ Mod.TG]

Dead roosters in Oita Prefecture raise bird flu fears
-----------------------------------------------------
A case of bird flu is suspected in the town of Kokonoe in Oita Prefecture
following the deaths of bantam roosters kept as pets, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Tuesday.
2 of 7 dead roosters tested positive for bird flu, and the National
Institute of Animal Health is conducting confirmation tests, ministry
officials said. The ministry will find out the results in the evening,
they said.
They said a household in the southwestern Japan town kept the 7 bantam
roosters along with 6 other roosters and 1 duck.
The 6 other roosters and duck have been killed for testing to determine
whether all 14 had been infected. If infections are confirmed, this will
mark the 2nd outbreak of bird flu in Japan following the country's first in
79 years at a poultry farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture, detected 12 Jan 2004.
About 34 000 chickens were depopulated in the Yamaguchi case.
According to ministry officials, a local animal health sanitary facility
reported the suspected case to the ministry Monday night via the Oita
prefectural government. The household found 3 dead roosters Saturday and 4
others Sunday. It reported the findings to the Oita prefectural government
Sunday, they said. The ministry has banned public access to the area and
sterilized chicken coops.
About 570 000 chickens, or 1/3 of the total chickens raised in Oita
Prefecture, are kept within a 30-kilometer radius of the household in
question, a local livestock official said.
The bird flu outbreak in Yamaguchi Prefecture has been traced to the same
strain as the H5N1 bird flu virus found in South Korea and Vietnam, which
have seen large-scale bird flu epidemics since late in 2003.
Similar epidemics have also emerged in Thailand, Indonesia, and China. Some
people infected with the bird flu virus have died.
Masato Tashiro, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, said the suspected case in Oita Prefecture may have no link to
the Yamaguchi farm and could be contained easily.

The 2nd bird flu case to hit Japan in 2004 has been reported in Oita
Prefecture, local government officials said Tuesday.
A private breeder from Kokonoe, Oita Prefecture, reported to the town hall
that 7 of 13 Japanese bantams he raised at his home had died since last
weekend.
Experts at a prefectural lab detected the bird flu virus in the dead
bantams, also known as Chabo. A duck raised by the same breeder also
developed an antibody against the bird flu virus, suggesting that it was
also infected with the disease.
Samples from the birds have been sent to the National Institute of Animal
Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, for further examination.
The type of bird flu virus that caused Japan's first outbreak in 80 years
in the Yamaguchi Prefecture town of Ato in January [2004] was one of the
deadliest and killed 80 percent of birds infected with it. Thousands of
chickens at a poultry farm in Ato where the outbreak was reported had to be
killed to stop the virus spreading.
Agricultural Ministry officials said the bird flu outbreak was confirmed in
10 countries and regions, including Vietnam, Hong Kong, [mainland] China, the
United States, Germany and South Korea. [The strain in the US is not the same
strain as the Asian countries. ­ Mod.TG]
People could get infected with the bird flu virus by coming into contact
with an infected bird, but it is safe to consume fully cooked chicken or eggs.
