The cholera outbreak in northern Iraq has infected some 16 000 people
since late August 2007, of whom at least 10 have died, the WHO said
on Fri 14 Sep 2007.
Since 23 Aug 2007, at least 6000 people have been reported with
diarrhoeal diseases in Sulaymaniyah province, almost 7000 in Kirkuk
province and at least 3000 in Erbil province, WHO spokeswoman Fadela
Chaib told journalists. The outbreak has so far remained confined to
the 3 northeastern provinces, which have a population of 3 million people.
A UN team is working on the ground to help Iraqi authorities fight
the epidemic and inspect water sources in the affected areas since
the end of August 2007. The source of the epidemic remains unclear
but the WHO remains confident it can be brought under control, Chaib said.
Naeema Al-Gasseer, the WHO's representative in Iraq, warned however
that delays in ensuring access to safe water, safe food, and enhanced
hygiene practices could all lead to the further spread of cholera.
Northern Iraq suffered an earlier cholera outbreak in 1999, while the
disease struck the southern province of Basra shortly before the
US-lead invasion of 2003.

Cholera has spread in northern Iraq, where the diarrheal disease has
stricken 16 000 people and caused 10 deaths in a month, the World
Health Organisation (WHO) said on Fri 14 Sep 2007. The doubling of
known cases, from 7000 earlier this week, is probably due to better
surveillance by health authorities, although the death toll remains
the same, it said.
"The cholera outbreak has now infected 16 000 people including 10
deaths in the provinces of Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk, and Erbil in
northern Iraq," WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing.
Health officials in Sulaymaniyah, where there are now 6000 cases,
said 2 weeks ago [30 Aug 2007] that they traced the outbreak in the
province to a water treatment plant.
A WHO team led by Dr. Naeema Al-Gasseer, its representative for Iraq,
has provided technical advice and kits containing antibiotics and
other supplies to combat the outbreak.
"Dr. Al-Gasseer warned that delays in ensuring access to safe water,
safe food, and enhanced hygiene practices ... combined with the lack
of sanitation could lead to further spread of cholera," Chaib said.

province on 23 Aug 2007, and then to Erbil province on 6 Sep 2007,
caused 10 deaths so far, and continues to be a major threat to public
health in the region.
Specific control measures to contain this ongoing outbreak and limit

acute watery diarrhea reported from 5 out of 11 districts of
Sulaymaniyah province stands at 6142 including 9 deaths with an

Iraq: cholera update
----------
Between 23 Aug and 10 Sep 2007, the cumulative number of cases of
acute watery diarrhea reported from Sulaymaniyah province stands at
6142 including 9 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 0.14 percent). Of
these reported cases, _Vibrio cholerae_ has been laboratory confirmed
in 392 stool specimens.
From 29 Jul to 12 Sep 2007, the health authorities of Kirkuk
province reported a total of 6749 cases of acute diarrheal disease
including one death (CFR: 0.01 percent). The 1st index case of
cholera, confirmed by laboratory test, was reported on 14 Aug 2007.
The outbreak continues to spread into Erbil province, where, between
1 and 10 Sep 2007, 11 641 cases of diarrheal disease with no deaths
were reported. Among samples tested, 33 were identified as positive
for _V. cholerae_.
Until now, there is no confirmed information that cholera has spread
to other parts of Iraq. A stool sample collected from a suspect case
in Baghdad has tested negative for _V. cholerae_. Another suspect
case detected in Mosul is currently being investigated.
The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the
outbreak. A high-level National Committee on Cholera Preparedness and
Outbreak Response has been established. The health authorities of
affected provinces are implementing public health control measures,
including regular water quality testing, to contain the outbreak and
to mitigate its effect on the population.
WHO, along with other UN agencies, the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC), and international NGOs, continue to support the
Ministry of Health and local health authorities in ongoing response
operations. WHO is procuring emergency supplies such as chlorine
tablets, rapid diagnostic tests, and interagency diarrhoeal diseases
kits, as well as disseminating technical guidelines on case
management. Social mobilization campaigns are being implemented with
the participation of religious and community leaders.
In controlling the spread of cholera, WHO does not recommend any
special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.

[The 1st 2 postings here seem to reflect the WHO situational data
from several days earlier. Today's, 14 Sep 2007, WHO report updates
several of the numbers related to positive cultures for _V. cholerae_
from Sulaymaniyah and Erbil provinces. Most notably, however, the
number of diarrheal cases from Erbil has been now reported to be 11
641, almost 8000 more than the 3406 noted in the situation report
from several days earlier.
The numbers of estimated cases of diarrhea continue to increase, but
how much of these numbers are cholera is unclear.
The affected provinces can be found on a map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/iraq.pdf>.
Given the overall state of the infrastructure of Iraq further spread
to more central areas of the country is certainly possible. - Mod.LL]
