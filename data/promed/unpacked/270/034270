In Argentina, there is an outbreak of the super fungus _Candida auris_ for the 1st time. It is an emerging pathogen worldwide that causes serious infections in hospitalized patients and is resistant to available drugs. Because of the crisis in the health system generated by the coronavirus pandemic, the spread of the fungus accelerated in the world. The mortality reported from outbreaks in other countries varies between 30 and 72%.

The outbreak was declared after the detection of the pathogen in 2 patients in a private clinic in the city of Buenos Aires, according to the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health in its weekly bulletin. It is considered to be an "outbreak" because no cases of people with the disease had ever been diagnosed before in the country.

The species of fungus affecting patients was identified and confirmed by the ANLIS/Malbrán Institute, although the results of molecular biology techniques are still awaited, which will allow us to know exactly the strain of the fungus affecting the 2 patients.

One of the affected patients was admitted to the intensive care unit at a Buenos Aires clinic on 2 Oct 2022. The patient was referred from another clinic from abroad and transferred on a medical flight. They did a lab test to check if there were bacteria or other germs in a urine sample on 18 Oct 2022. At that time it was identified that the microorganism belonged to the genus _Candida_. Last Friday [28 Oct 2022] it was found by a more precise technique, MALDI-TOF, in a private laboratory, that the species was _C. auris_.

Meanwhile, the 2nd case corresponds to a patient who had a drainage fistula after surgery. It was treated on an outpatient basis in the same clinic as the other patient who has _C. auris_ infection. Last 13 Oct 2022, they did a culture of the fluid that had collected in the space in the abdomen around the internal organs. On Friday [28 Oct 2022] that person was also identified as having _C. auris_ infection.

"The 2 patients did not share the same environment in the same moment during their stay in the clinic", informed the experts in epidemiology of the national agency. The epidemiological investigation continues," they clarified.

The Ministry of Health of the Nation warned health centers and hospitals to be aware of the characteristics which [_C. auris_-infected patients] may present. He noted that the infection can also occur without symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the infection and the immune state of the patient.

"Outbreaks due to _C. auris_ are generally related to infection control problems within hospitals and by the use of antimicrobial drugs," explained Pablo Scapellato, a member of the Argentine Society of Infectology (SADI).

The fungus is transmitted by contact with a contaminated environment or with affected patients. People who are most at risk of acquiring [_C. auris_] infection are those with diabetes mellitus, those who are hospitalized, who have undergone surgery, or who are immunocompromised. So that the fungus does not continue to spread, "it is very necessary to work mainly on [infection] control measures, such as hand hygiene, barrier measures, and isolation of patients who have been diagnosed with a _C. auris_ infection," emphasized Scapellato.

"It depends on the strain of _C. auris_ that affects the patient. Some are resistant to a single antifungal, other strains are multi-resistant, and others are resistant to all available drugs and are called pan-drug-resistant. We still don't know which strain caused the outbreak in Argentina. They are studying it at ANLIS/Malbrán," Dr Giusiano said.

[The news article above reports the 1st patient was transferred to an ICU in Buenos Aires from a medical facility in another country on 2 Oct 2022. The pathogen in a urine culture obtained on 18 Oct 2022 eventually was identified 10 days later, on 28 Oct 2022, as _Candida auris_. This patient could have acquired _C. auris_ at the foreign medical facility or in the Buenos Aires ICU. Presumably, this patient was not isolated while in the Buenos Aires ICU, during which _C. auris_, if not already present, likely spread widely in the medical facility environment.

The 2nd patient was treated on an outpatient basis in the same clinic as the 1st patient, but was said not to have shared the same environment with the 1st patient; nevertheless, the pathogen in a culture of abdominal drainage obtained on 13Oct 2022 was identified as _C. auris_ on 28 Oct 2022. Genotyping may help identify both these 2 isolates as the outbreak strain, if the genotypes match. Cultures of environmental surfaces, patient contacts of the 2 affected patients, and hospital staff in this medical facility may confirm the extent of its spread.

More information on the outbreak would be appreciated as the investigation unfolds.

_C. auris_ is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen that causes healthcare-associated infections, associated with high mortality. _C. auris_ has the ability to persistently colonize environmental surfaces, and epidemiologic investigations of hospital outbreaks find widespread _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patient rooms, and surfaces that were frequently touched, such as computer screens, touchpads, and keyboards.

The US CDC recommends that infection controls for _C. auris_ in healthcare settings include hand hygiene, transmission-based precautions (isolation of patients in single rooms or housing people with the same multidrug-resistant infection in the same room), disinfection of the patient environment, communication with other facilities when transferring patients, screening contacts of patients, and prospective laboratory surveillance to identify new cases in facilities where _C. auris_ has been detected. (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html)

Screening cultures of patients at multiple sites (e.g., axilla, groin, rectum) in nosocomial outbreak settings commonly find asymptomatic colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-screening.html). Patients at highest risk include close healthcare contacts of patients with _C. auris_ infection or colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html). Colonized or infected patients frequently have prior extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, highlighting the value of careful and thorough communication at inter-healthcare facility transfers. Patients with _C. auris_ colonization should be placed on appropriate transmission-based precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html#transmission). Investigations of the causes of hospital outbreaks frequently find infection control lapses, undoubtedly compounded by the care required for critically ill ICU patients.

_C. auris_ can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole; however, isolates that are resistant to fluconazole may occasionally respond to other triazoles, such as voriconazole and posaconazole (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-antifungal.html). Many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are least commonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the initial empiric drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy. - Mod.ML
