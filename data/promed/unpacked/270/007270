Chikungunya continues to spread across Papua New Guinea. It started in Sandaun province last June 2012 and has now been reported in Madang, West New Britain, East New Britain, Morobe, and Eastern Highlands. There are suspected outbreaks in New Ireland and Oro provinces.

The Environmental and Emerging Diseases Unit at PNG's Institute of Medical Research is tracking the disease. Pius Bonjui [the reporter] asked the head of the unit, Dr Paul Horwood, for an update on the situation.

[There was a significant chikungunya virus outbreak on the main island of Papua New Guinea last year (2012). From June-October 2012, a total of 633 patients suspected of having symptoms of chikungunya were reported from Vanimo hospital. The outbreak was localized to the town vicinity and its satellite communities (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121010.1335814). The current outbreak continues to spread. So far, no numbers of cases have been reported, but they would be of interest.
