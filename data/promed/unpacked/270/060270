We wish to advise that _Mycobacterium chimaera_ has been detected as part of regular testing of a heater-cooler unit used in open cardiac surgery at a New South Wales [NSW, Australia] public hospital.

Whole genome sequence analysis of the isolate strongly suggests it belongs to the same clone that has been previously associated with contaminated Stockert Heater-Cooler 3T units. This clone has been linked to 4 clinical cases of _M. chimaera_ infection in NSW following open cardiac surgery in another hospital assisted by units manufactured by LivaNova (Sorin) before September 2014.

The affected machine is also a Stockert Heater-Cooler 3T unit but it was manufactured in November 2014 and purchased in April 2015. The machine had been cleaned and maintained in accordance with manufacturer and Therapeutic Goods Administration directions since purchase and all previous testing had been negative for _M. chimaera_.

Of note, the same hospital hosted another Stockert Heater-Cooler 3T unit manufactured in 2008, which was removed from service in August 2016 after testing positive for the same clone of _M. chimaera_. The more recently affected heater-cooler unit was immediately removed from service on receipt of the positive test result in April 2018 and has been decommissioned.

While no clinical cases of _M. chimaera_ have been linked to either positive machine at this hospital, potentially exposed open cardiac surgery patients are being informed of the risk and advised to remain vigilant for signs of the infection, which may appear years after exposure.

The source of contamination of this 2nd heater-cooler unit remains unclear. The manufacturer reported that remedial measures had been implemented to reduce the risk for these machines by September 2014 (see the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration safety alert - https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/infections-associated-heater-cooler-devices). The machine was in service at the hospital before the 1st affected machine was removed from service. There is no record of the 2 machines having been used at the same time and in the same operating theatre but other sources of cross-contamination, such as during cleaning, could not be excluded.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sean Tobin for the submission above.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil worldwide, that can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems. Biofilms are relatively resistant to cleaning and disinfection. Water from these systems can contaminate medications and medical instruments. _Mycobacterium chimaera_ is an NTM. An outbreak of _M. chimaera_ infection following cardiac surgery has been associated with use of _M. chimaera_-contaminated heater-cooler devices (HCDs). A total of more than 100 cases has been reported from Australia, Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, and multiple countries in Europe. All of the cases involved the use of the Sorin Stockert 3T HCD manufactured in Germany. The 3T devices manufactured at this facility had been distributed worldwide. Implantation of prosthetic material (such as, heart valve, vascular graft, left ventricular assist device) increased the risk of infection. Onset of symptoms and signs of invasive _M. chimaera_ infection occurred months to years following surgery, with a mean time between surgery and diagnosis of 1.5 years (range of 3 months to 5 years). Patients developed endocarditis, vascular graft infection, mycotic aneurysms, surgical site infections (including mediastinitis and sternal wound infections), bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and ocular infections. Case fatality rates have varied, but were often about 40 percent.

Genotyping of the _M. chimaera_ isolates confirmed a common-source outbreak. Testing conducted by the manufacturer in August 2014 found _M. chimaera_ contamination on the production line and supply at the 3T manufacturing facility.

The HCD does not have any direct contact with the patient; but during surgeries, the HCD is often positioned adjacent to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in the OR and aerosolized _M. chimaera_ in exhaust air from the HCD has been thought to contaminate the surgical site during the operative procedure. To prevent aerosols from reaching the operative field, the HCD has been subsequently repositioned outside of the operating suite and/or facing away from the surgical field to reduce contamination of the surgical site. No case has occurred in operating room personnel exposed to aerosolization from HCDs.

In response to the outbreak, the manufacturer has implemented changes in disinfection processes in the production line in an attempt to reduce the risk of _M. chimaera_ contamination of 3T HCDs manufactured after September 2014. Samples taken at the same manufacturing facility by the German Regulatory Authorities in July 2015 did not show _M. chimaera_, possibly indicating the contamination at the manufacturing facility had been resolved. Nevertheless, the FDA reported that some 3T devices manufactured after September 2014 have tested positive for _M. chimaera_ (https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm610394.htm).

The news report above refers to the Australian Government Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA], Infections associated with heater-cooler devices / Update 15 Nov 2017 (available at https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/infections-associated-heater-cooler-devices). Sections from this report are extracted below:

"Consumers and health professionals are advised that a total of 6 Australians have been confirmed with _Mycobacterium chimaera_ infections following heart surgery involving heater-cooler devices.

"NSW [New South Wales] Health has reported 4 _M. chimaera_ patient infections, Victoria has reported 1 and the earliest case, in Queensland, is mentioned in our 2016 alert below. There has been one confirmed death in NSW following a patient infection with _M. chimaera_.

"As a result, the TGA has been conducting a product safety review into all heater-cooler devices supplied in Australia. Information about the progress of this review can be found in the table below. [For the table, see the source URL.]

"The above confirmed cases of infection are associated with contaminated St√∂ckert Heater-Cooler 3T heater-cooler units that were manufactured before September 2014. See the section below -- 'Contamination found in devices' - for more details.

"Heater-cooler devices are used within operating theatres and intensive care units to control the temperature of blood during procedures where heating or cooling of blood is required. The devices contain water tanks that provide temperature-controlled water for the operation of the device. This water is not intended to come in contact with the patient or their blood.

"The focus of the review is those heater-cooler devices intended to be used for cardiac bypass surgery and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

"The TGA previously published advice (see below) regarding the potential for water within heater-cooler units to become contaminated with bacteria, most commonly non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). There is evidence to suggest that patients are infected when bacteria in the device's water tank becomes airborne.

"The latest recall for production correction by LivaNova, published on the TGA Recall actions web site on 27 Oct 2017, (see below) is to install a modification that reduces the risk of potential patient infection by preventing dispersion of contaminated aerosols in the operating room. This correction will be implemented by onsite modification of units currently in use. The servicing will be undertaken in the field by LivaNova service personnel or a local agent. Although the potential for infection is less likely when the 3T device's water system is maintained according to the current Instructions for Use (IFU), the disinfectant required to undertake the maintenance is not currently included in the appropriate category of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Therefore, the TGA has suspended the supply of new 3T devices until the disinfectant can be suitably accessed to ensure adequate maintenance. The suspension of the 3T's device's ARTG entry does not preclude LivaNova from undertaking the modifications to existing 3T devices. The 1T devices will be replaced with 3T devices as the 1T devices are unable to be modified to prevent aerosol dispersion.

"Approximately 100 patients worldwide have been identified as being infected with one species of NTM, _Mycobacterium chimaera_, following cardiac surgery. Cases of infection with _M. chimaera_ have been identified between 3 months and 5 years postoperatively.

"An article published in The Lancet on 12 Jul 2017 provides further information about research that is being undertaken to determine the source of contamination and infection.

"The risk of _M. chimaera_ infection in patients undergoing open-heart surgery has been estimated as 0.4-16 per 10 000 patient-years. Given a background risk of 1.2 percent for surgical site infection in the 1st year after cardiac valve operations, and a cumulative 5-year incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis of 3.2-5.7 percent, the risk of infection by _M. chimaera_ is low."

"Contamination found in devices
-------------------------------
"The TGA has received reports for _m. chimaera_ contamination of 4 St√∂ckert 3T Heater-Cooler System (3T) devices manufactured after September 2014. The investigation into these recent reports is under way. The root cause has not yet been identified.

"The TGA had previously received reports for _M. chimaera_ contamination of St√∂ckert 3T devices manufactured before September 2014, as reported in our previous web statement below. All patient infections have to date been associated with St√∂ckert 3T heater cooler devices manufactured prior to September 2014."

The full TGA update, which includes additional sections on TGA product safety review for all heater-cooler devices, information and advice for consumers, health professionals and facilities, and stratified risk mitigation for St√∂ckert 3T Heater-Cooler System (3T) devices and other heater-cooler units is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML
