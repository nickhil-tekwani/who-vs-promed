After a long period, chikungunya [virus infections] are back again. In
December 2011, 14 persons sought treatment for chikungunya [virus
infections], and among them, 13 are in Thiruvananthapuram and one in
Ernakulam.

Health department officials said that the virus still remains in
people affected with chikungunya earlier.

[Most of the chikungunya virus infections within the past 2 months
have been reported in northern India (Delhi and Uttar Pradesh state).

Symptoms (particularly joint pain) may persist for weeks to months
after chikungunya virus infections. The pain can be incapacitating.
There is no evidence that the virus itself persists, but the symptoms
certainly can, perhaps due continued joint inflammation or autoimmune
responses triggered by the infection.
