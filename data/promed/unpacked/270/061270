65 rabid skunks found in Arizona
--------------------------------
Health workers in Flagstaff, Arizona will spend the next 6 weeks trapping,
vaccinating, and releasing skunks in an effort to stop a rabies epidemic in
the area. In Flagstaff, trapping and injecting skunks with a rabies vaccine
is believed to be the only way to rid the area of the disease. Workers are
setting 400 traps in a 35 mile radius around Flagstaff.
Since late January, authorities have found 17 rabid skunks in the Flagstaff
area, compared with 17 confirmed cases of rabid skunks [throughout Arizona
last year. Dr Mira Leslie, a veterinarian with the Arizona Department of
Health Services, said [that 15 of the rabid skunks in Flagstaff were found
in one neighborhood, the Foxglenn development.
This is the first time rabid skunks have ever been documented in northern
Arizona, Leslie said. "It's a pretty intense outbreak," she said. "And it's
epidemic in southern as well as northern Arizona." In southern Arizona, 29
rabid skunks have been found so far. The disease is believed to have spread
to the north when a skunk was bitten by a rabid bat.
Leslie said 65 rabid animals have been found statewide this year, compared
with 22 for the same time last year. She expects the numbers to grow if
left unchecked. "There are more rabies cases this year, from January to
May, than for any other documented period," Leslie said. "Usually this is a
slow time, and we're seeing 3 or 4 cases daily."

[Trapping and vaccinating skunks is not an easy task, nor is it risk-free.
A preferable approach might be the oral rabies vaccine used successfully in
Texas and Canada and elsewhere. ­ Mod.TG
