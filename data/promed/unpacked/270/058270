The eastern [Indian] state of West Bengal is currently undergoing its
3rd outbreak of bird flu since 2006, and more than 100 000 birds have
already died from the disease. In an attempt to contain the outbreak,
the government has ordered 2 million ducks and chickens killed.
According to the animal resources minister for West Bengal, Anisur
Rahaman, the state is "determined to cull all poultry in the
districts in 3 or 4 days, otherwise the state will face a disaster."

Five people experiencing clinical symptoms of bird flu, including
cough, fever, muscle ache and sore throat, have been quarantined and
are undergoing tests. Health officials are also analyzing blood
samples from another 150 people who reported fever symptoms. Bird flu
does not spread easily to humans, and most cases arise in people
who've come into close contact with infected poultry. But health
experts worry that if not contained, the disease could mutate into a
more dangerous form.

Authorities' efforts to cull poultry in West Bengal have been
hampered by a lack of local cooperation, with villagers smuggling
birds out of cull zones and selling them. The sudden glut of smuggled
birds on the market has caused the price of chicken to fall from 60
rupees [USD 1.50] per kilogram to 20 [USD 0.50]. "Poor villagers are
feasting on chicken. At normal times, they cannot afford to buy, as
prices are so high. Now they are enjoying the meat," said Sheikh Ali,
a market vendor.

Experts in neighboring Bangladesh warned that their government is
suppressing news of the current outbreak. "Bird flu is now
everywhere," said M. M. Khan of the Bangladesh Poultry Association.
"Every day we have reports of birds dying in farms. Things are now
very, very serious, and public health is under danger. The government
is trying to suppress the whole scenario."

[Previous reports of suspected human cases of avian (H5N1) influenza
have failed to be confirmed (see the ProMED-mail references below).
In the current situation, the signs and symptoms described in the
above report are not sufficiently specific to exclude seasonal
influenza or, indeed, any other febrile condition. Nonetheless, the
extent of the outbreaks in domestic poultry in West Bengal and
adjacent parts of Bangladesh indicate that the risk of human cases of
avian influenza virus infection is real. Further information is
awaited.
