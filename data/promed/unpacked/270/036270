A 32-year-old man died in Brazilia of yellow fever (YF) on 21 Jan
2008. With this death, the number of deaths in the country due to
this disease has increased to 15.

The Secretary of Health of the Federal District (DF) confirmed this
additional death from yellow fever on Wednesday [13 Feb 2008]. The
man died at the hospital in Sobradinho, a satellite city of Brasilia.
The report confirming the cause of death was issued this past
Wednesday [13 Feb 2008].

According to the Ministry of Health, the likely location of infection
of the man was in the Federal District. That contradicts what the
health authorities in Brasilia have previously expressed. According
to them, prior to this announcement, the people who died of YF in the
DF had all been infected in Goias [state]. Of the cases reported in
the DF, 11 were confirmed, 3 are being investigated and 2 were
discarded [based on] clinical [grounds] and laboratory [results].

Mato Grosso
The Ministry of Health, also confirmed on Wednesday [13 Feb
2008], the 1st YF case in Mato Grosso (MT). Laboratory tests
performed by the Evandro Chagas Institute, in Para, indicated that a
farmer from Novo Sao Joaquim, MT died of the disease.

According to the Ministry of Health, the state of Mato Grosso has 2
other suspected cases of the disease which are still under investigation.

[This worrisome report indicated that the man who died of YF acquired
his infection in a satellite city of the DF, suggesting possible
urban transmission. ProMED-mail requests more information concerning
the probable location of infection and the travel history of the
above mentioned fatality (in the DF), in order to have a better idea
if this was another sylvan (jungle or forest) YF case or was truly a
case of urban YF virus transmission. The Mato Grosso death is very
likely a sylvan YF case.

Health authorities reported this Sunday [17 Feb 2008] that a
39-year-old woman died Saturday night [16 Feb 2008], after a week of
intensive therapy in a hospital in the capital [Asuncion].

At least 6 people have died in Paraguay as a result of the yellow
fever (YF) outbreak which has the entire population on alert, and
responding with a massive [influx going to] vaccination centers, the
government announced. Thousands of citizens went to the health
centers in the capital where massive vaccination is taking place.

This weekend, the country received 944 000 doses of [YF] vaccine from
Brazil, of which 800 000 were donated by the government of the
neighboring country and 144 000 were furnished by the Panamerican
Health Organization.

Nicanor Duarte, the President of Paraguay, this past Friday [15 Feb
2008] declared a national state of emergency to address the YF
outbreak, so that the [governmental] authorities can deal with this
health emergency.

[Given the massive vaccination campaign in the capital city, it
appears that the previous urban YF cases that were acquired there
have generated considerable concern (panic?) on the part of both the
government and the citizens. ProMED-mail would be interested to know
if similar vaccination campaigns are being carried out in other areas
of Paraguay. Brazil, which had embargoed the export of the YF
vaccine produced there, has shown remarkable public health
citizenship by providing vaccine to Paraguay in a very timely way,
despite continuing YF cases in Brazil.
