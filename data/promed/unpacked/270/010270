[3] Argentina: child case
Date: Thu 27 Oct 2022

For the 1st time, monkeypox was diagnosed in a child in Argentina. He is 10 years old and lives in the city of Buenos Aires, according to the epidemiological bulletin of the Ministry of Health of the Nation. Since last May [2022], when the 1st case of infection caused by the monkeypox virus was confirmed in the country, most of those affected have been adults, with an average age of 35 years.

In Argentina, between May and August [2022], monkeypox cases increased slowly. From the 2nd half of August they grew "gradually." In the 1st week of October, a lower number of cases was registered than in the previous week. But in the 2nd week of October, 85 confirmed cases were reported and another 20 were under study at the time of closing of the latest epidemiological bulletin.

It was the week with the most confirmed cases reported since the beginning of the outbreak in the country. "In relative terms, the average week-on-week increase registered for the last 4 weeks was 14%," said the epidemiology experts from the Health agency, referring to the evolution of the outbreak between 2nd half of September and the 1st half of October [2022].

In total, 627 cases of people with monkeypox have been confirmed in Argentina. Until now, the youngest patient registered was an 18-year-old adolescent. Now there is the case of the 10-year-old boy. As for symptoms, the boy had a fever greater than 38°C [100.4°F] and rashes on his arms. "As an epidemiological background, it is a close contact of a confirmed case, and the area of contagion would be within the family," the experts clarified. That is, the child had been a close contact of a relative who also had the infection. At the moment, "he evolves favorably."

The 10-year-old boy is the youngest monkeypox patient ever recorded in Argentina so far. The oldest patient is 61 years old. Of confirmed cases, 99% correspond to people of legal male sex. The presence of the virus has also been detected in 3 trans women and 3 cis gender women, which means that they identify with the sex assigned at birth. The majority had lesions with vesicles on the skin in different locations, including genitals, perianal area, hands, torso and face, fever and swollen glands as symptoms.

[4] Cases decline
Date: Thu 27 Oct 2022
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf4961


When monkeypox cases in Europe began to decline this summer [2022], researchers' 1st question was: Is it real? Some worried that people might not be getting tested because of receding fears of the virus, coupled with strict isolation requirements for patients. "They might be reluctant to be confirmed and be told not to go out at all," says Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Regional Office for Europe.

But the decline is now unmistakable. WHO Europe, which reported more than 2000 cases per week during the peak in July [2022], is now counting about 100 cases weekly. In the Americas, the other major epicenter of the outbreak, numbers have dropped by more than half (see graphic at source URL). "We're seeing a true decline," Smallwood says.

Vaccines, behavior change among the most affected group -- men who have sex with men (MSM) -- and immunity after natural infection are all playing a role in that decline, says Erik Volz, an infectious disease modeler at Imperial College London, but how much each factor has contributed is unclear. "This is something we've debated a lot internally."

The answer is important because it determines the likelihood of a resurgence of the virus. Knowing what has driven down cases so far will also help shape strategies to eliminate the virus outside endemic countries in Africa, a goal WHO Europe is already pushing for.

In the United Kingdom, at least, vaccination campaigns have played a minor role, according to a model published as a preprint this month [October 2022] by Samuel Brand, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Warwick. Monkeypox's reproductive number -- the average number of new infections triggered by an infected person -- began to drop by mid-June [2022], even though campaigns only started in July, Brand notes. Several other European countries saw the same pattern.

That leaves behavior change and immunity from natural infections. A survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among MSM in August [2022] found about half had reduced their number of sexual contacts. As awareness of the disease increased, people also became more likely to seek diagnosis and treatment early and to avoid sex while they were infectious. The UK Health Security Agency has presented data suggesting syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections declined as well -- which would bolster the case for behavior change -- although that signal is "suggestive but not conclusive," Volz says.

For Smallwood, that raises a concern: that MSM who feel reassured by the plummeting case numbers may revert to their past behavior. That's why vaccination of at-risk groups may now be more important than it was at the peak of the epidemic, she says. Brand agrees; in fact, his UK model suggests that although a slight uptick in cases in the coming months is likely, vaccinations should prevent a real resurgence. "I don't think there's room for complacency at this point," he says.

Eliminating the virus altogether from nonendemic countries may be difficult. "That last bit is always the hardest," Smallwood says. Among the reasons are stigma and discrimination. "In many countries, [infected people] will not be presenting purely because they're concerned about how they may be treated," she says. Besides, it has become clear that some people have asymptomatic infections and could pass on the virus unknowingly, says Boghuma Titanji, a virologist at Emory University.

Even if, say, Europe or the United States managed to eliminate the virus, reintroductions from sexual networks in countries where the virus is still circulating in humans would remain a threat, Smallwood says. And the ultimate source of the virus will remain untouched: the animal species in Africa where the virus circulates, occasionally spilling over to humans, as it has for decades. "This is not an outbreak that just needs to be fixed, and then the risk is gone," Smallwood says.
