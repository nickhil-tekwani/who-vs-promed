Estonian authorities have detected mad cow disease in a dead 11 year old
cow after a routine test at a slaughterhouse, the Agriculture Ministry said
on Monday [24 Apr 2006]. If confirmed, it would be the country's 1st case
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a disease that destroys the
brains of cattle.
"The rapid test needs to be confirmed with a positive test for BSE and the
results from that test will be out on Wednesday," Ago Partel, director of
the Veterinary and Food Authority, told Reuters. The cow was from a farm in
Jogevamaa county, south eastern Estonia, the Agriculture Ministry Press
office said. [See Jogeva in the map at

BSE was discovered in Britain in 1986 and devastated the country's beef
industry. Individual cases of BSE have recently been found in cows in
Japan, Canada, and the United States. More than 160 people have died from
the human form of the disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, believed
to be contracted by eating meat from infected cattle.

[The discovery of a BSE case in Estonia should not be surprising; in fact,
it was anticipated according to the Opinion of EU's Scientific Steering
Committee (SSC) on the GBR (Geographical Risk of BSE) in Estonia. The said
opinion, adopted by the SSC on 10 Apr 2003, includes the following statement:
"The BSE-agent may have reached the territory of Estonia before its
independence in 1991. Since 1995 significant amounts of MBM were imported
from BSE risk countries. A significant risk that BSE infectivity entered
processing therefore exists since some years, at the latest since 2000,
when domestic cattle potentially exposed to contaminated imported MBM
around 1995, could have entered processing while approaching the end of the
incubation period. Given the instability of the system, this could have
lead to BSE cases.
"It is concluded that it is likely but not confirmed that domestic cattle
are (clinically or pre-clinically) infected with the BSE-agent (GBR III)."
Official confirmation of the case is anticipated. If confirmed, Estonia
will become the world's 26th BSE country. The number of cases in the other
25 countries, between 1989 and 2006, may be seen at

in Feb 2006 (see 20060217.0521), remains unconfirmed. - Mod.AS]
