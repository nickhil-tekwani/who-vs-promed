In Switzerland, Grapevine flavescence dor√©e phytoplasma (EPPO A2 List) was 1st recorded in Ticino in 2004 and remained limited to this canton until 2015. In autumn 2015, the disease was found for the 1st time in the canton of Vaud in 2 localities. Phytosanitary measures have been taken to prevent any further spread of the disease.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was 1st reported in 1954 in France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the US, the home of its vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. The only known natural hosts are _Vitis vinifera_ and interspecific hybrids, but some wild American _Vitis_ species may be asymptomatic carriers.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, the 1st report of FD north of the Alps was from Germany in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025). In Switzerland, after its detection in Ticino in 2004, the the entire rest of the country was declared a quarantine protected zone (see ProMED-mail post 20110122.0273) with all plants of genus _Vitis_ subject to strict phytosanitary regulations. It would be important to find the source of this unfortunate incursion in Vaud.

The presence of FD in central Europe now may pose a risk of the disease and/or possibly the vector spreading in the region as another example of "warm climate diseases" getting established in cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).
