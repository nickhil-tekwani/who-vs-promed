[2] Extent of USA recall

Federal health officials say the salmonella recall now involves about
31 million pounds [about 14 000 tons] of peanut butter and peanut
paste.

That's a whole lot of peanut butter. But consider this: The nonprofit
National Peanut Board says Americans eat 700 million pounds [about
318 000 tons] of the gooey treat every year.

Peanut Corp. of America, the company that made the recalled products,
isn't an industry giant. But its peanut paste is used by others to
make dozens of goodies, from energy bars, to cakes, to dog biscuits.
And the recall list keeps getting longer.

It's making the food industry nervous, although no major national
brands of peanut butter are affected. Even the Girl Scouts are
reassuring customers Peanut Corp. is not their supplier.

the weight of around 14 billion peanuts! - Mod.LL]
