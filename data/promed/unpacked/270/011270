[According to ECDC's (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) most recent weekly report (published on 28 Aug 2020); "Between 21 and 27 Aug 2020, EU member states reported 56 human cases of WNV infection: Spain (38), Greece (15) and Italy (three). All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 4 deaths were reported by Greece (2) and Spain (2). No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

"Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season and as of 27 August 2020, EU member states have reported 122 human cases of WNV infection and 10 deaths through The European Surveillance System (TESSy): Greece (54, including 8 deaths), Spain (44, including 2 deaths), Italy (22), and Romania (2). Spain is currently experiencing an outbreak of WNV infection in the province of Seville. All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

"Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 40 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (33, including 23 in the province of Seville), Italy (5), France (1), and Portugal (1) through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS."

A map of the distribution of West Nile virus infections among humans and outbreaks among equids and/or birds in the EU transmission season 2020, latest data update 27 Aug 2020, is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/west-nile-virus-europe-2020-infections-among-humans-and-outbreaks-among-equids-10.

Although the latest ECDC report indicates that "no outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS", during this current season Germany has reported to the OIE cases in wild and captive birds; see reports at
