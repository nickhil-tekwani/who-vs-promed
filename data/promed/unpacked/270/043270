*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive, climatic factors
Epidemiological comments: it is thought that as a consequence of abnormally high temperatures experienced in Yamalsky district, the permafrost thawed which led to anthrax spores being shifted to upper soil layers. The animals got infected while grazing by ingesting vegetation contaminated by the causal agent. Before this event no outbreaks had been reported in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug since 1941. Emergency vaccination of animals against anthrax is being carried out in the region. An epizootiological investigation is still ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); Disinfection / Disinfestation; Dipping / Spraying; Quarantine; Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; Official destruction of animal products; Official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; Surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; Control of wildlife reservoirs; Treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

[So now it is official and we have some data. A mortality rate of around 6 percent is about what one might expect for severe non-domestic animals on open grazing. I have seen 10 percent in Wood Bison. But questions still remain. Firstly 4 out of the 5 sites all started on the 16th July. A bureaucratic convenience I suspect but epidemiologically explicative. Secondly how many animals were in fact sampled and on which sites? Thirdly, did they look for any other causes? We can expect a significant number of reports to come out describing this event and some will be scientific. - Mod.MHJ
