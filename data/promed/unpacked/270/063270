[Though this follow-up report on the Dutch Q fever outbreak is not
named "final," it probably may be viewed as "semi-final," providing
accumulated data on the extent of this unusual event which involved 8
out of the Netherlands' 12 provinces. To our knowledge, the incidence
of Q fever in the Netherlands in humans has fallen following the
application of compulsory vaccination against Q fever on the dairy
goat and sheep farms.

The Dutch Q fever experience in the human, animal and laboratory
fields is to be one of the topics to be reviewed during IMED 2011
(International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance), which
will be held on 4-7 Feb 2011 in Vienna, Austria. - Mod.AS]
