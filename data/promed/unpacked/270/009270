The Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has confirmed that 11 elephants were found dead yesterday [Fri 28 Aug 2020] at Pandamasue Forest, New Ziana reports.

ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said the authorities were concluding investigations into the deaths of the elephants, but they suspected that they could have died due to anthrax. Said Farawo: "The elephants were found dead in Pandamasue Forest. Zimparks suspects anthrax. Veterinary doctors are on the ground. We are waiting for results from the laboratory."

The new possible outbreak might be another leading cause of elephant mortality after last year's [2019] drought claimed close to 200.

A spokesman for Zimbabwe's national parks says authorities are investigating the deaths of 11 elephants in a forest in the west of the country. The carcasses of the elephants were discovered on Friday [28 Aug 2020] in Pandamasue Forest, located between Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls, Tinashe Farawo, spokesman of the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, said.

Blood samples have been taken to a laboratory for analysis to determine the cause of their deaths. The dead elephants were found with the tusks still on their bodies, ruling out poaching. In recent years poachers in Zimbabwe have poisoned dozens of elephants and then have taken their ivory tusks to sell to illegal traders.

[Until the results of the examination of the blood samples are known, this is just suspected anthrax. We should note that in Africa, drought is a greater killer, directly and indirectly, of elephants. - Mod.MHJ
