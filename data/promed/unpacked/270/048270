- Montgomery (2 new confirmed positive cattle premises; 3 new suspect equine premises),

- Butler (10)
- Cowley (2)
- Greenwood (2)
- Montgomery (2)
- Sedgwick (2)

The 2020 VSV outbreak began in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, on 13 Apr 2020. Kansas' outbreak began on 16 Jun 2020 in Butler County. Since then, officials have identified 105 premises in Kansas (64 confirmed positive and 41 suspect) in 10 counties: Butler, Chase, Cowley, Greenwood, Marion, Miami, Montgomery, Morris, Sedgwick, and Sumner.

[2] Kansas: Coffey and Lyon counties

The VSV outbreak continues to spread. The Kansas Department of Agriculture says vesicular stomatitis has now entered Lyon and Coffey counties. Lyon County has one confirmed case, 3 suspect and pending cases, and 4 cases under quarantine. Coffey County has one confirmed case under quarantine.

VSV now covers most area counties. Chase County has one case under quarantine. Greenwood County has 3 cases released from quarantine. Morris County has one case in quarantine.

Currently, VSV is in 17 counties. There are 28 confirmed cases and 44 suspect or pending cases. Nearly 90 animals have been released from quarantine.

VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses but has also been found in other livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, swine, llamas, and alpacas. Symptoms include lesions on the muzzle, lips, ears, coronary bands, or ventral abdomen. Infected animals can also have fevers and other blister-like lesions on the mouth, dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, ears, and hooves. The virus is transmitted from biting insects such as black flies, sand flies, and midges, according to KDA.

It can take 5-7 days for the virus to subside; however, it can take an additional week for the affected animal to fully recover.

For more information, call the Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health or go online to <www.agriculture.ks.gov/VSV>.

Kansas counties with vesicular stomatitis virus cases on newly identified premises include Allen, Cherokee, Coffey, Elk, Labette, Lyon, Miami, Neosho, and Wilson.

The 20 Jul 2020, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Vesicular Stomatitis Situation Report confirmed the highly contagious disease has spread to 19 new Kansas premises since the previous week's report.

The counties and number of new premises in each include

Allen County (3)
Cherokee County (5)
Coffey County (1)
Elk County (1)
Labette County (2)
Lyon County (2)
Miami County (1)
Neosho County (2)
Wilson County (2)

Additionally, USDA/APHIS identified suspect premises in Allen, Butler, Cherokee, Cowley, Labette, Lyon, Neosho, and Wilson counties.

VS 101
Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2-3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The southwestern and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[This is clearly a busy season for vesicular stomatitis. Kansas appears to be a hot spot, or their media is much better at getting the word out. However, it remains disappointing that the USDA has stopped reporting the strains. The strain may not change the outcome of the situation, but for those of us tracking the disease, it is frustrating to know there were 2 strains at the beginning of this very busy VSV season, and now it is all lumped into one category, without allowing tracking of the different and locations of the different strains. - Mod.TG
