AVIAN INFLUENZA, H7, POULTRY - CANADA (BRITISH COLUMBIA)(07): CORRECTION

From: Dr. Robert Parker <Robert.Parker@fraserhealth.ca>

The originating source interview (CP/Canadian Press wire story, on
mytelus.com/news) of this ProMED article below -- 20040313.0704 --
contains an error. It states the H7N3 virus causes "pink-eye" in
humans ....8th paragraph - "H7N3 commonly manifests as pink eye in
people, but there is worry that it could mutate and become more
deadly in people who are already suffering from the flu."
In Fraser Health Authority, we are not aware of any literature
stating that H7N3 causes human disease. The reporter/news article may
well have meant to say "some" H7 strains (or specifically the H7N7
strain, such as in Holland during 2003) is known to cause human
conjunctivitis, but not H7N3 strains specifically. There has been no
detected human illness in relation to this virus in BC. We are the
public health officials doing the symptom surveillance among the
exposed farm workers.
The error is an important difference to be corrected; if the
erroneous impression is left that the current H7N3 virus in BC is
causing some degree of human illness (conjunctivitis)... we have not
found that to be the case thus far.
