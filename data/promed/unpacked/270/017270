MYCOBACTERIUM BOVIS, BUFFALO - SOUTH AFRICA (KRUGER NATIONAL PARK)

In spite of a long held belief that tuberculosis could never become a
problem in South African wildlife because of the hot dry climate and
culling efficiency of predators it has emerged as a widespread infection in
buffalo herds in parts of the Kruger National Park. According to the park's
senior veterinarian, virtually half of the buffalo herds in the park are
considered infected.
The infection is believed to have entered the park during 1959/60. A cattle
ranch near Crocodile Bridge developed TB to the extent that the herd was
slaughtered out. In those days the park was unfenced and cattle and
wildlife mixed freely. In 1966 an examination of 100 culled buffalo
revealed no TB. The first sick buffalo was noted in 1990, killed, and the
infection confirmed. By 1992 about 30 buffalo in each herd of 150 to 600
were shot and examined ... the closer the buffalo herd was to Crocodile
Bridge, the higher the prevalence of infection; in one instance 85%.
Latterly other species have been noted to be infected ... 6 kudus, 3 lions,
2 cheetahs, and 24baboons ... and all with the same DNA strain of M.bovis.
Until 1966 the infection had remained south of the Oliphants River, but in
1966 two herds were found to be infected north of the river.
The cause of the epidemic is unknown but is believed to be associated with
the recent prolonged (13 years) drought affecting nutrition and that it
forces normally scattered herds to crowd onto the remaining forage.
The current control proposal is to create a 25-mile buffalo free corridor
north of the Oliphants river. Each year the corridor would be brought 12
miles south. Thereby, it is hoped that within 10-15 years the southern
buffalo herds would have been slaughtered out and the area repopulated by
"clean" northern buffalo.
So far the infection has not been noted in the species which the park
profitably exports ... elephants, hippopotamuses, zebras, and white & black
rhino.
