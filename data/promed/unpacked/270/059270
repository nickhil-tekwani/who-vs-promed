The antiviral sensitivity of 1918-1919 influenza virus and biosafety
-----------------------------------------------
I read with great interest the research pinpointing the virulence
factors of the 1918-1919 influenza virus. I also experienced
disbelief, and a great deal of discomfort, regarding the decision to
relocate the reconstructed 1918-1919 influenza strain from a BSL4
facility to a BSL3 facility, based on its susceptibility to antiviral
medication. I would like to raise several concerns and, hopefully,
spark a prompt revisiting of this decision.
1. Given the limited extent to which antiviral drugs shorten the
duration and severity of disease due to the currently circulating
strains of influenza, is there solid clinical evidence of the extent
to which these drugs would modify the clinical course of the vastly
more virulent 1918-1919 strain? What would be the pattern and
rapidity of resistance to these drugs? What would be the
recommendations for their use in prophylaxis and treatment?
2. Even if these antiviral agents were found to be extraordinarily
effective against the 1918-1919 virus, there is a totally
insufficient supply of these drugs to cope with an accidental
release. (We have just researched this question in light of the
2004-05 vaccine shortage: the current national supply of all the
antiviral drugs combined would be nowhere near enough to effectively
cope with an outbreak, should one occur.)
3. What security measures are in place to absolutely preclude the
release of the 1918-1919 virus? (Given the evidence that released
strains of anthrax, plague, and other agents may have originated from
highly secure facilities, is there evidence that this is even
possible?)
4. What emergency response plans are IN PLACE to prepare for the
potential release of this virus?
These are not simply academic questions, they are the essential
public health and policy questions that must be answered in order to
safeguard the public from the unleashing of a pandemic. Unless they
can all be answered in a robust fashion that assures that public
health is now being protected, and will be in the future (and I do
not believe that they can be), the decision to relax the biosafety
level for this virus seems to be extremely short-sighted; hopefully
it will not also prove disastrous.
Experience, and the fact that, ultimately, all systems rely on human
beings with all of our inherent limitations, would suggest that if
this virus is to be maintained, it should only be maintained in a
BSL4 facility and then only with extraordinary physical and human
security measures that substantially exceed those used in the past
for maintaining variola virus. I strongly support Dr. Karl Johnson's
suggestion for an emergency revisiting of this decision.

[The data obtained by Tumpey and colleagues provide reassurance that
constructs containing the hemagglutinin gene (the putative virulence
factor) of the 1918/19 pandemic influenza A virus will remain
sensitive to currently available antivirals. The deployment of these
drugs is likely to provide adequate protection for laboratory staff
and diminish, but not eliminate, risk of transmission of influenza
virus to others. If influenza virologists are convinced that the
1918/19 pandemic influenza virus was as lethal as generally assumed,
it would seem prudent, in my view, to confine experimental work to
biosafety level 4 facilities as advised by Karl Johnson and Ronald
Voorhees. - Mod.CP]
