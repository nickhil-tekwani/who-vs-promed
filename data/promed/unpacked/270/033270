Grapevines are susceptible to many viruses that may affect their overall health, as well as the yield and quality of the fruit. At Perennia Food and Agriculture, we have tested and confirmed at least 2 viruses that are present in Nova Scotia vineyards - Grapevine leafroll and Grapevine red blotch.

Growers should closely identify and monitor their vineyards for these potential problems.

[Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9 different grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to different genera within the family Closteroviridae have been reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, as well as reduced fruit size, sugar content and yield. Several species of mealy bugs and soft scales (families Pseudococcidae and Coccidae, respectively) have been reported as vectors for GLRaV 3. Similar vectors are thought to be involved in the spread of some of the other GLRaVs. All of the GLRaVs are also spread by grafting and have been widely distributed and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities. Symptoms of viral leafroll disease vary on different grape varieties resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular diagnostic methods for Closteroviridae have been developed and can be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening. It has been reported in a wide range of grape cultivars, including wine, table, raisin and rootstock varieties. GRB does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease. The new geminivirus _Grapevine red blotch virus_ (GRBV, only species in the new genus _Grablovirus_) has recently been shown to be associated with GRB. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards. GRBV has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. It is not known whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. GRBV is transmitted by grafting tools, with infected budwood and via rootstocks. A treehopper (family Membracidae) vector for GRBV has also been identified (ProMED-mail post 20160610.4276953). GRBV is considered an emerging threat to grape industries.

Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, viruses and viroids may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars. They can accumulate over many generations, leading to general decline of plants and severe yield reductions. Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.
