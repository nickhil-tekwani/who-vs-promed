Agriculture officials in Victoria, Australia reported responding to positive identification of anthrax in a sheep on a property near Swan Hill over the weekend [17-18 Nov 2018]. Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Charles Milne, said the affected property had now been quarantined and appropriate biosecurity protections were in place.

Dr. Milne said it was not unusual for incidents of anthrax to be detected in cattle and sheep in the region, with several farms in the Swan Hill area affected in March 2017 and a property in March this year [2018].

"Incidents tend to occur during the warmer months when it is drier and livestock forage deeper into the soil when eating grass," Dr. Milne said. "We are well prepared to handle these incidents and we are currently contacting local farmers and veterinarians." Dr. Milne said all sheep on the affected property had now been vaccinated and appropriate disposals were taking place today.

The current evidence suggests that one property has been affected. Agriculture Victoria will continue to work with nearby farmers, veterinarians and the local community to monitor the situation.

[This report is a copy of a previous 20 Mar 2018, report on the outbreaks at Swan Hill, mentioned above in this report. It was more severe than we had reported; see 2 Mar 2018 Anthrax - Australia: (VI) ovine 20180302.5662041.

"Swan Hill anthrax: 4 properties affected, 4300 animals vaccinated"
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/swan-hill-anthrax-four-properties-affected-4300-animals-vaccinated-42814/.

"In a follow-up on the anthrax situation in Swan Hill, Victoria, Australia, Agriculture Victoria reports sheep deaths on 4 properties near Swan Hill have been confirmed as being caused by anthrax in March 2018."

Agriculture Victoria on Mon 19 Nov 2018 said it was continuing to respond to the anthrax outbreak to include vaccinating animals: "There have been around 4300 animals vaccinated to date, including 4032 sheep, 109 cattle, 139 pigs and 12 goats, according to Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Charles Milne."

Now that spring is over in Victoria and they are entering summer any spores surviving from that March (2018) series will find a ready host with the summer heat reducing their innate resistance, and the benefits of any vaccination waning. When I first started investigating anthrax outbreaks I met Max Sterne at the Compton Animal Health Research Institute. I had gone back to the administration building to report to the director, Gregor Henderson, and he was outside chatting with Max. Max commented that based on his experience with livestock anthrax in Natal in the late 1930s that pasture sites tended to stay infectious for 3 months to 3 years. It has been over 10 months since the March outbreaks. Unfortunate, but not unexpected.
