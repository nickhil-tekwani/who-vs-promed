The Municipal Health Secretariat received the confirmation of the 1st case of death due to yellow fever in a resident of Itatiba, State of São Paulo. Diagnostic studies performed by the laboratory of the Adolfo Lutz Institute demonstrated the disease.

The male patient was 76 years old and resided in the border region between Itatiba and Jundiaí. The family has been notified, and the municipality of Itatiba is providing support.

So far, 13 monkeys have shown positive results for yellow fever. One of them is still under investigation as is an additional human case.

The latest epidemiological bulletin from the State Health Department, released on 9 Oct 2017, indicates that 15 people died from the disease. Of the total, 9 are autochthonous, and 6 cases are imported.

As a precaution, residents of Itatiba and the entire region should receive the yellow fever vaccine. According to the municipal government, in April 2017, the staff of the Ministry of Health was mobilized to the rural area to apply immunization from house to house.

The city will have a special day to vaccinate residents from Monday to Friday, from 8:00 to 16:00 various points.

[The occurrence of a new human case of the disease and numerous cases in primates after the declaration by the health authorities of the end of the outbreak this year [2017] is worrisome. It indicates that the declaration was premature, mainly by the fact of having happened at a time of year outside the usual season. - Mod.JT]

[It is concerning that there are new cases of yellow fever (YF) in monkeys and one (possibly 2) in humans in Sao Paulo state. All the previous YF cases were reported to have been due to spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission and not to the urban cycle transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, which could have resulted in a much bigger outbreak in this under-vaccinated population. Presumably, the fatal human case reported above was also due to sylvan spill-over. One hopes that increased surveillance and vector control efforts have been initiated. - Mod.TY
