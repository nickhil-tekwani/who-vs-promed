We have heard from our colleagues at Eurosurveillance Weekly (EW) that the
original article posted in the EW did not contain the following
introductory paragraph:
"Of a group of 8 adoptees from China who came to Norway at the end of March
2004, 4 children developed a rash on the journey or shortly after arriving
in Norway. In all 4 cases, measles was confirmed by laboratory results."
Our thanks to our colleagues for alerting us to this amendment.
