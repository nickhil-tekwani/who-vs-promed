Another person has died of cholera in the Ohangwena Region, bringing
the death toll to 3 since a cholera outbreak was announced almost 3 weeks ago.

The number of suspected cholera cases continues to rise with the
figure standing at 455 by yesterday [19 Mar 2008]. Oshana Regional
Health Director, Dr. Naftali Hamata confirmed that the number of
suspected cholera cases has shot up. He said Engela State Hospital by
yesterday morning [19 Mar 2008] had 270 suspected cases while Odibo
Health Centre had 120 cases and Okatope recorded 65 cases. All age
groups are affected. Dr. Hamata said in most cases where there is
cholera endemic, the most affected are children especially those
below the age of 5. The sudden rise in suspected cholera cases is
partly blamed on lack of water purification chemicals. Dr. Hamata
said although all health facilities in the region have water
purification sachets, not every individual has access to them due to
inaccessibility brought about by floods.

He told New Era that plans are underway to engage the Ministry of
Education in the distribution of the crucial water purification
chemicals. He explained that health officials would have to
distribute the purification tablets at schools so that pupils can
take them home. The health official urged people in Ohangwena to "try
to get water purification tablets and use them properly."

[5] Cholera, acute watery diarrhea (AWD) - Somalia (Hiran)

A number of people have died in the town of Beletweyne, the Hiran
regional capital in central Somalia, following an outbreak of acute
watery diarrhea (AWD), medical sources said on 17 Mar 2008.

"At least 3 people have been confirmed dead [from the disease] in
Beletweyne," said Nahashon Erupe, the program coordinator for the
International Medical Corps (IMC), in Beletweyne. Erupe said 516 cases
of AWD had been recorded between 16 Feb 2008 and 9 Mar 2008.

The IMC, he added, had set up a treatment center on 12 Mar 2008 and
suspected it was dealing with an outbreak of cholera, being the lead
humanitarian agency for cholera response in the area.

A local humanitarian worker, who requested anonymity, said the
situation in Beletweyne was stabilizing but expressed concern for
outlying villages. In the village of Omaad, 50km [31 miles] north of
Beletweyne, 4 people in a family of 12 were reported to have died of
AWD. "Unfortunately, we are having difficulties in accessing some of
these villages due to lack of transport or insecurity or both," the
aid worker said.

[7] Cholera - Viet Nam (north)

15 acute diarrhea patients who all ate raw vegetables have been
verified as being positive for cholera. The Health Ministry, thus,
will seek sources of raw vegetables that have the _Vibrio cholerae_
bacterium in the 3 provinces that have cholera patients.

On 19 Mar 2008, the Health Ministry reported 2 more cholera patients
in Hai Phong, raising the total number to 6 in this location.

According to experts, cholera patients in Hanoi, Hai Phong and Ha Tay
all ate raw vegetables. In Hai Phong, all cholera patients ate raw
vegetables bought at An Duong market which come from Kien An and An
Lao vegetable-planting areas in Hai Phong and Kim Thanh area in Hai
Duong province.

Health experts tested some vegetable samples taken from the 3
provinces but they didn't discover the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium.
The Health Ministry, thus, asked scientists to test water sources and
fertilizer taken from vegetable-planting areas. According to Deputy
Health Minister Trinh Quan Huan, many farmers still use [human]
excrement as fertilizer, and this is the source of the _Vibrio
cholerae_ bacterium and many viruses which can cause digestive diseases.

[As suspected in the last update (16), cholera has once again been
found in the northern parts of Viet Nam. It was reported on ProMED by
Dr. Ehara of Nagasaki, Japan (Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update
2008 (09) 20080206.0486) the strain of _V. cholerae_ causing the
outbreak in the Fall of 2007 was a Matlab variant, a hybrid having
characteristics of both Classical and El Tor biotypes. More of a
discussion regarding Matlab variants can be found there.

A map of the provinces of Viet Nam showing the affected areas can be found at:
