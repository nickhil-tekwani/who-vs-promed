A wolf killed in the southern Brooks Range in late March 2013 has tested positive for rabies, the 1st time the disease has been detected in a wild animal population in the interior.

The wolf was shot by a trapper after it approached him near Chandalar Lake, about 185 miles north of Fairbanks, according to Alaska Department of Fish and Game spokeswoman Cathie Harms. It's unusual for wolves to approach humans, but animals infected with rabies often display abnormal behavior because the disease affects neurological systems, she said.

The trapper, who is from the Mat-Su area, took the wolf home to skin it and cut himself while doing so, Harms said. "He knew that was grounds for being concerned, because the wolf had acted oddly, so he contacted us, and we tested the head, and it tested positive," she said.

The trapper had discarded the wolf carcass in the woods, but it was retrieved once it was determined the wolf had rabies because of the potential to spread or introduce the disease if the carcass was scavenged, Harms said. "Rabies has been around forever, but it's usually found along the north and western coasts of the state but not in the interior," Harms said. "We don't have a firm reason for it, but that's the way it's been. This far south, this far inland from the coast is new," she said.

As a result, the Department of Fish and Game is asking the public to report any abnormal behavior in wolves, wolverines, foxes or other wildlife in the area around Chandalar Lake to the nearest Fish and Game office. Animals with rabies might be fearless in approaching people, attack inanimate moving objects or be unable to run or move normally, according to Fish and Game veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen.

The department is also seeking sample tissues from the head of any wolf, wolverine, fox or coyote taken in the Chandalar Lake or Fortymile regions to determine whether this was an isolated incident or an actual outbreak of rabies. Heads must have been previously frozen to do the test, and taking a sample does not damage the skull, Harms said. "Since it's in a new area, we're eager to learn if it's in many animals or if it's a single, isolated case," Harms said. "It's a curiosity at this point, and we're hoping to learn more."

There have been cases of rabies reported in interior Alaska before, but they were in pets and usually traced to someone transporting an infected carcass from the North Slope or western Alaska, Harms said. While rabies is most commonly found in canids like foxes and wolves, any mammal can contract rabies. There have been cases of rabies in caribou and moose, Harms said.

Fish and Game has expanded its rabies surveillance program during the last 2 years by using a recently developed field test to detect the disease. Fish and Game staff have tested more than 1000 specimens collected from around the state during that time and found some interesting results, including the 1st case of rabies in a wolverine last summer [2012] near Umiat on the North Slope. The tests also determined that 3 percent of red foxes trapped in the area around Bethel were rabid.

There has always been a risk of rabies exposure to trappers who are injured while skinning rabid foxes, but documenting rabies in a wolf in the southern Brooks Range has extended that risk to more species and in more areas of the state, said Beckmen, the Fish and Game veterinarian.

To protect against acquiring the disease from animals, trappers and hunters are advised to wear gloves when skinning animals, wash any wounds with soap and water, avoid cutting into the brain or spinal cord as much as possible, and wash knives with soap and water immediately after severing the head. Injuries sustained while skinning an animal should be reported to a health care provider, and the animal should be saved for possible rabies testing.

Because of the potential range of wolves, the positive test prompted the state Department of Health and Social Services to expand its lay vaccination program to cover most villages in the Yukon-Koyukuk region. Lay vaccinators are not veterinarians but civilians trained and permitted to vaccinate dogs and cats to protect pets and humans in areas where rabies has been documented.

The vaccination program is being expanded to cover an approximately 100-mile buffer around the Chandalar Lake area, according to a news release issued by the state Department of Health and Social Services. Residents in that area should make sure their pets are current on their rabies vaccines, advised Robert Gerlach, state veterinarian with the Department of Environmental Conservation.

"There is always a risk of rabies when you have direct contact with rabid wildlife, but the greater risk is that domestic pets will bring rabies into the home," he said.

[This report was taken virtually word for word from the Alaskan Department of Fish & Game news release:
http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=pressreleases.pr04232013. Over the years, the Alaska Health & Human Services Department has issued a number of rabies reports going back to 1974; see: http://www.epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/catlist.jsp?cattype=Rabies. Their most recent, 2011 (http://www.epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2011_06.pdf), is brief and to the point:

"2011 Animal Rabies in Northwestern Alaska

Introduction
------------
Rabies is enzootic among the fox populations of northern and western Alaska, with periodic epizootics (epidemics among animals) documented every 3 to 5 years (Figure). The last epizootic was in 2006-07. Although rabies has been documented in animals every month of the year, most cases are usually reported during early fall through early spring. In early spring, foxes tend to move inland off the sea ice, increasing the likelihood that they come into contact with domestic animals or humans. Dogs can readily serve as a transmission vehicle of rabies virus from wildlife to humans; therefore, it is especially critical during these seasons to ensure that adequate rabies prevention and control measures are in place. Reducing rabies in Alaska fox populations is not yet feasible; therefore, the mainstays of preventing human rabies cases are public education of the risk in the wildlife (fox) population, vaccination of domestic animals against rabies, and prompt administration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis to persons potentially exposed to rabies virus.

Recent cases of animal rabies
-----------------------------
Of the 16 animals evaluated for rabies from 1 Jan through 23 Mar 2011 at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) in Fairbanks, 9 tested positive (Table). 5 were arctic foxes, and 4 were red foxes. Although no humans were exposed to the rabid animals, several dogs were attacked. Dogs not previously vaccinated against rabies were euthanized. All rabid animals came from Alaska's north and west coasts. Finding rabies in an animal from one village signals the need for heightened awareness and prevention activities in that village. However, because rabies is reservoired in mobile fox populations with occasional spill-over to dogs, a positive result also signals broader geographic risk. There is no current systematic surveillance of rabies among Alaska fox populations" [Refer to the link for their figure and table. The figure, which displays cases of animal rabies in Alaska for 1999-2011, shows a cyclicity which is very typical for fox rabies in the northern latitudes. - Mod.MHJ].

The epidemiological meaning of this recent singular wolf case is yet to emerge, but logically it must include the possibility that rabies is more widely enzootic than was appreciated; remember Alaska and the northern Canadian provinces and territories are not awash with humans. Secondly, be extremely cautious if you see a wild animal wandering around outside its normal activity time, e.g., in daylight instead of dawn and dusk, or place, e.g., village street instead of woodland, and is not avoiding human contact, e.g., is aggressive. This is a red flag for possible rabies.
