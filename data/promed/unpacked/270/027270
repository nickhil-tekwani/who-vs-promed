Patients, clinicians seek answers to the mystery of 'Long COVID'
----------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, public attention has mainly focused on the number of people who become severely ill and die from COVID-19. But what's become clear in recent months is the large and growing group of people who continue to deal with prolonged symptoms long after their original illness.

In a recent study posted on the preprint server medRxiv [preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248802], analysis of an international survey of more than 3700 respondents with COVID-19 found that over 2/3 were still experiencing numerous symptoms at 6 months, with significant impacts on patients' lives and livelihoods. Respondents with symptoms for more than 6 months said they are experiencing an average of nearly 14 symptoms across multiple organ systems.

That study has not yet been peer-reviewed, but it adds to a growing body of literature on prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. An Italian study published in JAMA in July [JAMA. 2020; 324(6): 603-605. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12603; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351] found that 87% of 143 hospitalized COVID-19 patients had at least one symptom 2 months after illness onset. A study published this month [January 2021] in The Lancet [397(10270):220-232, 16 Jan 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32656-8] found that more than 3/4 of 1655 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, had at least one symptom 6 months after discharge.

With more than 95 million confirmed COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, these reports are likely just the tip of the "Long COVID" iceberg. And while the world is currently focused on driving down new infections, reducing deaths and hospitalizations, administering new vaccines, and getting the pandemic under control, public health experts are starting to turn their attention to these "long-haulers," as they've come to be known, and the mechanisms behind their lingering symptoms.

Speaking at a recent online workshop [https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=38878] on post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 hosted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD, said the issue urgently needs to be studied given the number of people who've been infected. "This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive," Fauci said. "Even a small proportion with post-acute sequelae are going to represent a significant public health issue." Yesterday [19 Jan 2021] NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, highlighted the problem on his director's blog [https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/01/19/trying-to-make-sense-of-long-covid-syndrome/] and encouraged long-haulers to participate in an ongoing study [https://patientresearchcovid19.com/].

A poor understanding of Long COVID
----------------------------------
For many clinicians who are treating COVID long-haulers and researchers who are starting to look in the phenomenon, there are a lot of questions and not many answers. There isn't even a working definition at the moment. "This is an area that we really have a very poor understanding of right now," John Brooks, MD, the chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 response, said during the NIH workshop. "This is an area we're really working on, epidemiologically, to understand."

Alejandro Comellas, MD, is a pulmonologist and medical director of the Respiratory Illness Follow-Up Clinic at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics. His clinic is just one of many that are popping up around the country to treat patients who have prolonged post-COVID symptoms. Another is the Post-COVID-19 Clinic at UC Davis Health, where Christian Sandrock, MD, MPH, sees patients. Sandrock said the staff at the clinic first started seeing the signs of prolonged post-COVID issues in some of their colleagues who had gotten ill in the spring [2020]. "Then we started also seeing this in patients, and we realized, as the literature and data was coming out, that there were just a number of patients with varying needs, whether it was brain fog, or shortness of breath, or chest pain, or fatigue," Sandrock said. "We realized we needed to get on top of it."

Sandrock noted that the most common prolonged symptoms he and his colleagues see are chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance. "I have some patients who are really short of breath just walking down a block," he said. "I have another group that does fine for the most part but can't maximally exercise like they used to."

Both clinics are treating long-haul symptoms in patients who had severe illness, some of whom were in intensive care units (ICUs), and patients who had mild COVID-19 cases. Comellas said the primary impetus for starting the Iowa clinic was the anticipation that they would likely be dealing with patients who'd been in the ICU and were experiencing post-intensive care syndrome, which is common in patients who survive severe illness and ICU treatment. But he said it's the number of patients with mild cases who have lingering symptoms, and the severity of some of those symptoms, that's been so surprising.

"I've seen patients who were actually in the ICU and they ended up on ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation], and they are not feeling as sick and debilitated as people that had COVID as an outpatient," he says. "The severity of your disease doesn't seem to predict how you're going to respond down the road in regards to the chronicity of the symptoms."

That observation is reflected in the medRxiv study, which analyzed a survey created by patients who are members of the Body Politic online COVID-19 support group. Of the 3762 respondents, only 8.4% were hospitalized during their original illness.

The 'brain fog' mystery
-----------------------
Among the most confounding symptoms experienced by COVID long-haulers is the brain fog, which is marked, in varying degrees, by problems with memory, attention, and multitasking. Sue Mattison, a provost at Drake University, said she first noticed signs of it shortly before her diagnosis, when she went to pick up a prescription from her pharmacy and couldn't remember her phone number. "My mind just kind of went blank," she said. "I'd not had that kind of experience before." Though she's not experiencing these symptoms any more, Mattison said the difficulties with forgetting things and recalling the right word lasted throughout the summer. [KS of Arlington, Massachusetts] is still dealing with issues like word retrieval. "It's just like a slower process going on for me right now," she said.

The neurologic impacts of the coronavirus first caught the attention of Igor Koralnik, MD, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, in March 2020. That's when he read a paper by Chinese scientists that found that more than 1/3 of hospitalized COVID-19 patients experienced neurologic manifestations. That led Koralnik and colleagues to review data on the 1st 509 patients hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for COVID-19 during the spring surge in Chicago.

Their research showed neurologic manifestations were present in 82.3% of patients at any time during the course of the disease. The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (muscle pain), headaches, and encephalopathy, or diminished brain function. Patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to develop neurologic symptoms. The findings led Koralnik and his colleagues to open the Neuro COVID-19 Clinic at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to treat patients experiencing some of these neurologic side effects. They soon started seeing COVID-19 patients who had never been hospitalized who were also experiencing neurologic issues. "These 'long-haulers' had many different neurologic manifestations that were persisting despite the fact that they didn't have pneumonia," Koralnik said.

In a paper published in June 2020 in the Annals of Neurology [https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.25807], Koralnik and Kenneth Tyler, MD, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, reviewed some of the potential mechanisms that may be linked to neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 patients. These include systemic disease marked by multiorgan failure and global inflammation, direct viral infection of the central nervous system, and postinfectious autoimmune-mediated processes.

While neurologic problems in patients with severe COVID-19 may be linked to the 1st 2 mechanisms, Koralnik thinks the 3rd mechanism is a potential explanation for the neurologic symptoms that non-hospitalized long haulers are experiencing, and he is currently studying that in his lab. "It's more likely a post-infectious auto-immune problem," he said. "The immune system has been confused by the virus in some ways, and now the immune system is attacking normal components of the nervous system."

Kloiber says the research into the neurologic issues is what she's keeping an eye on. "What I'm really watching for closely is can folks figure out...what is actually the mechanism of what's happening to people's minds," she said.

Investigating potential mechanisms
----------------------------------
While treating long-haul patients is his focus at the moment, Comellas, like Koralnik, Sandrock, and other clinicians treating COVID long-haulers, is also interested in figuring out what's behind these lingering symptoms. He's trying to put together a pilot study to further explore the potential mechanisms. "One hypothesis that we have is that autonomic dysfunction could be part of this mechanism," he said, referring to the autonomic nervous system, which controls functions such as breathing, blood pressure regulation, digestion, and temperature regulation. "A lot of these patients are having temperature changes. They feel febrile or very cold, they have these palpitations with pulses going up and down, they have some gastrointestinal complaints...so one speculation is that the virus is affecting the autonomic system," Comellas said.

Sandrock suggests the lingering symptoms could be another manifestation of the varying inflammatory response that people have had to the virus. "The inflammatory response we have to the virus has been so variable in people," he said, with some people having no symptoms whatsoever and others dying very quickly. "We have some patients that just have chronic signs of inflammation, and some that don't." Sandrock added that he would like to see some large cohort studies that can help define what it means to have persistent symptoms.

That could soon be on the agenda. At the NIH workshop, Janet Diaz, MD, head of clinical care for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 response, said the agency hopes to convene a meeting early this year [2021] to further discuss research into the pathophysiology of prolonged COVID symptoms. Other aims include agreeing on a working definition, estimating the actual burden of disease, and updating clinical guidance for physicians treating Long COVID patients.

Diaz said the prolonged illness in non-hospitalized COVID patients in particular "urgently needs to be better understood and investigated for us to make decisions on policy or interventions."

[KS], who has been through a battery of physical and cognitive tests that have all come back normal, would just like to start getting some answers for the constant fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and persistent chest and throat pain that have dogged her since March [2020]. "Honestly, the longer journey has been worse than the 1st 2 weeks," she said. "My life is not what it was."

[2] USA: California coronavirus variant CAL.20C
Date: Wed 20 Jan 2021 12:53 PM PST
Source: NBC, San Diego [abridged, edited]
https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/coronavirus/coronavirus-variant-emerging-in-california-one-to-watch-local-researcher/2500217/


A new strain of the coronavirus, CAL.20C, may be contributing to the acceleration of the recent surge of cases across Southern California, according to a study released this week. The strain, which the investigators designated as CAL.20C, is believed to be in part responsible for the dramatic increase in cases over the last 2 months. The findings from researchers at Cedars-Sinai did not indicate whether the strain is more deadly than other current forms of the coronavirus.

"It's one to watch, but it's very unclear if it's more transmissible or whether it's been driven up in frequency because of founder effects and/or biases," Kristian Andersen, a professor in the department of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, said in a statement released Wed. "The virus mutates all the time and some variants will increase in frequency (sometimes rapidly) due to biases in sequencing, biases in sampling, nearby superspreading events and founder effects. It's unclear where this particular variant falls in that whole picture."

Andersen led the team at Scripps Research that detected, in San Diego, one of the 1st cases of B.1.1.7 -- also known as the UK variant -- in the United States.; He told the New York Times that it's not yet known if the variant found in California has some sort of advantage biologically or is becoming more prevalent simply some sort of statistical anomaly. Anderson also said that researchers should not necessarily assign blame for any surges on "functional changes in the variants" when, in fact, most of the spread could be stopped by social distancing, large scale testing and screening, avoiding congregant settings, and, of course, wearing a mask.

CAL.20C is distinct from the B.1.1.7 version that is also spreading in the US and is believed to be highly transmissible. In Southern California, B.1.1.7 has been found in scattered coronavirus cases in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino counties. In contrast, the CAL.20C strain was identified in 36.4% of cases in the Cedars-Sinai study. CAL.20C includes a virus variant the California Department of Public Health reported Sunday [17 Jan 2021] based on data submitted by Cedars-Sinai and other investigators.

This variant, dubbed L452R, is one of 5 recurring mutations that constitute the CAL.20C strain, which is propagating across the country, starting in Los Angeles County. "The recent surge in COVID-19 positive cases in Southern California coincides with the emergence of CAL.20C," said Dr Eric Vail, assistant professor of pathology and director of molecular pathology in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Cedars-Sinai. Vail is the co-corresponding author of the study, submitted to medRxiv.org [see reference below], an online archive for health science manuscripts that have not been peer-reviewed, while simultaneously submitted for peer-review on Thursday [21 Jan 2021].

"We're still learning a lot about what the [L452R variant] means, working hard with the tremendous genomic sequencers at institutions like UCSF and Scripps and other places across the state, working with the CDC, and our local public-health partners to continue determining what the role of this variant has been in our transmission rates across the state," Dr Mark Ghaly, the secretary of the California Health & Human Services agency, said on Tuesday [19 Jan 2021] in his weekly coronavirus update.

Ghaly said the variant was first identified last year [2020] is several other countries and states, including California. "We know that it was recently identified in several large outbreaks in Santa Clara County -- some of those outbreaks in the congregant-care facilities that we know are prone to having broad and large outbreaks," Ghaly said, adding that researchers are trying to determine if it is, in fact, more infectious, and what it's impact might be on vaccinations.

Ghaly stressed his concern about the emergence of the new variants. "The concern with variants of all varieties is that it changes the behavior of the virus," Ghaly said on Tuesday [19 Jan 2021]. "We see mutations in viruses all the time. RNA viruses are notorious and known to have mutations even more than other viruses. So, the point is: Are they important variants, right? Do they have affect the level of infectiousness? Do they affect virulence, the level, the severity of disease? We continue to learn as much as we can as quickly as we can ... so far, I don't have any additional news on the variant that ... was here in California."

Investigators using publicly available databases have also detected the CAL.20C strain in multiple recent patient samples in Northern California, New York, Washington, DC, and Oceania. To identify the CAL.20C strain, the Cedars-Sinai investigators examined SARS-CoV-2 virus samples from 192 patients at Cedars-Sinai who tested positive for coronavirus between [22 Nov 2020] and [28 Dec 2020]. Using an advanced technique known as next-generation sequencing, they analyzed the genes of the viruses. They combined this data with 4337 gene profiles of SARS-CoV-2 viruses obtained from patients throughout Southern California, also using publicly available databases.

While the CAL.20C strain was almost nonexistent in October [2020], by December [2020], 36.4% of virus samples from Cedars-Sinai patients were determined to be the strain, as were 24% of all samples from Southern California, defined by Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties.

"The double-digit prevalence of the CAL.20C strain in November [2020] and December [2020] was striking given that it was first observed in July 2020 in just one of 1230 virus samples in Los Angeles County and had not again been detected in Southern California until October [2020]," said Jasmine Plummer, research scientist at the Cedars-Sinai Center for Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, associate director of the Applied Genomics, Computation & Translational Core at Cedars- Sinai and the other co-corresponding author.

Wenjuan Zhang, assistant professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at Cedars-Sinai and 1st author of the study, said the research team is "not sure what the new findings mean in terms of the infectivity and antibody resistance of the CAL.20C strain, which is important for follow-up studies that will need to be completed."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Since October 2020, novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 including B.1.1.7, have been identified to be of global significance from an infection and surveillance perspective. While this strain (B.1.1.7) may play an important role in increased COVID rates in the UK, there are still no reported strains to account for the spike of cases in Los Angeles (LA) and California as a whole, which currently has some of the highest absolute and per-capita COVID transmission rates in the country. From the early days of the pandemic when LA only had a single viral genome uploaded onto GISAID we have been at the forefront of generating and analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from the LA region. We report a novel strain emerging in Southern California. Most current cases in the catchment population in LA fall into 2 distinct subclades: 1) 20G (24% of total) is the predominant subclade currently in the United States 2) a relatively novel strain in clade 20C, CAL.20C strain (approximately 36% of total) is defined by 5 concurrent mutations. After an analysis of all of the publicly available data and a comparison to our recent sequences, we see a dramatic growth in the relative percentage of the CAL.20C strain beginning in November 2020. The predominance of this strain coincides with the increased positivity rate seen in this region. Unlike 20G, this novel strain CAL.20C is defined by multiple mutations in the S protein, a characteristic it shares with both the UK and South African strains, both of which are of significant clinical and scientific interest."

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, more mutations will arise and undergo selective pressures. The implications for the current vaccines and diagnostics are not clear. Biological implications also are unknown, that is, infectiousness, virulence. - Mod.LK]

Besides general information including infographics, daily case counts, and maps with disease distribution, examples of latest updates comprise: Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, Rapid assessment of laboratory practices and needs related to COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccination and prioritisation strategies in the EU/EEA.

Box: Summary of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on the risk related to the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the EU/EEA from [21 Jan 2021]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viruses constantly change through mutation and variations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, due to evolution and adaptation processes, have been observed worldwide. While most emerging mutations will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, some mutations or combinations of mutations may provide the virus with a selective advantage, such as increased transmissibility or the ability to evade the host immune response. In this update we report new information on the spread of 3 virus variants (VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2 and variant P.1). These variants are considered to be of concern because of mutations which have led to increased transmissibility and deteriorating epidemiological situations in the areas where they have recently become established.

Based on the new information, the risk associated with the introduction and community spread of variants of concern has been increased to high/very high and the options for response have been adjusted to the current situation.

- Variants of concern
VOC 202012/01 was first identified as being of concern in the south of the United Kingdom (UK) in December 2020. The 1st sample in which it could be identified has been traced back to September 2020. Since then, it has become the predominant variant circulating in the UK. It is characterised by a significantly increased transmissibility, which has contributed to increases in incidence, hospitalisations, and pressure on the healthcare system since the 2nd half of December 2020. The UK has implemented stricter nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce transmission. Preliminary studies indicate that there is no evidence that VOC 202012/01 is associated with a significantly different infection severity or that it disproportionally affects certain age groups more than the previous circulating viruses. However, as a result of the increased incidence, by January 2021 the UK had reported the highest daily COVID-19 mortality since the start of the pandemic. Ireland, where local circulation of VOC 202012/01 has also recently been identified, has experienced an increase in case numbers and hospitalisations, growing pressure on the health system and has also had to implement stricter NPIs. Denmark has also observed community transmission of VOC 202012/01 and in response has strengthened NPIs and prolonged measures throughout January 2021.

The variant 501Y.V2 was first identified in South Africa in December 2020, where it is now the most prevalent variant. Preliminary results indicate that this variant may also have an increased transmissibility. However, as for VOC 202012/01, at this stage it is uncertain whether the 501Y.V2 variant causes a change in disease severity. As per [19 Jan 2021], 501Y.V2 has been identified in 10 EU/EEA countries. One cluster of this variant is currently being investigated in France. In addition to France, Israel, and the UK have also reported cases or clusters of non-travel-related 501Y.V2 cases. The remaining cases identified in the EU/EEA have mostly been travel-related, but not only from South Africa.

The P.1 variant has so far only been identified in Brazil, and in travellers from Brazil (mostly from the Amazonas State) reported in Japan and South Korea. The capital of Amazonas, Manaus, is currently experiencing an upsurge in COVID-19 cases, putting significant pressure on the healthcare system.

The under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections in general, and the very small proportion of cases undergoing sequencing in most EU/EEA countries, may lead to a large under-ascertainment of the true number of VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2, and P.1 infections, and other potential variants that may contribute to rapid epidemiological changes.

- Risks associated with virus variants
ECDC assesses the probability of the introduction and community spread of variants of concern in the EU/EEA as very high due to their increased transmissibility. Such an increased transmissibility is likely to lead to an increased number of infections. This, in turn, is likely to lead to higher hospitalisation and death rates across all age-groups, but particularly for those in older age groups or with co-morbidities. Consequently, stricter NPIs are needed to reduce transmission and relieve the pressure on healthcare systems. Therefore, the impact of introduction and community spread is considered to be high. The overall risk associated with the introduction and community spread of variants of concern is therefore assessed as being high/very high.

- Options for response
Member States should continue to monitor local changes in transmission rates or infection severity to identify and assess the circulation and impact of variants. In order to detect introductions of known variants, as well as the emergence of new variants, Member States need to increase the level of surveillance and sequencing of a representative sample of community COVID-19 cases.

Member States should prepare laboratories for increased testing turnover. Laboratories should consider implementing diagnostic pre-screening for variants of concern (such as N501Y and deletion 69-70), ensure resources are available to manage an increasing number of requests for detection and characterisation of COVID-19 samples, and increase sequencing capacity by making use of all possible sequencing capacity from clinical, diagnostic, academic and commercial laboratories across different sectors.

In order to control the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants with increased transmissibility, a combination of compliance with NPIs -- including potentially stricter NPIs than those currently in place -- and strengthened case detection with contact tracing is required. Since the population groups driving transmission will not be targeted with vaccination for some months, Member States are recommended to be very cautious about relaxing NPIs. Furthermore, in light of the evidence of substantially higher transmissibility of the new variants of concern, national authorities should rather be ready to enforce even stricter measures, communicating and engaging with the population to encourage compliance. In general, contact tracing should be reinforced, and its scope widened in relation to cases suspected to be infected with new variants.

In order to slow down the importation and spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, ECDC recommends that non-essential travel should be avoided. In addition to recommendations against nonessential travel, and restrictions on travel for those infected, travel measures such as the testing and quarantining of travellers should be maintained, in particular for travellers from areas with a higher incidence of the new variants. If sequencing is inadequate to exclude the possibility of a higher incidence of the new variants, as per ECDC guidance on genomic sequencing, proportionate travel measures should also be considered from areas where there is a continued high level of community transmission.

Member States should prepare their healthcare systems for a further escalation in demand due to the increased transmissibility of the new variants of concern.

Member States are encouraged to accelerate the pace of vaccination for high-risk groups, such as the elderly and healthcare workers. At this stage, vaccination should be focused on protecting those most at risk from severe disease, and reducing morbidity, mortality and the burden on healthcare systems. It is important to use the available vaccines to provide protection for those who are most vulnerable and for key workers against the current circulating virus variants in the EU/EEA, and hopefully also against one or all of the new variants of concern. Assessment of VOC 202012/01 suggests cross-immunity is present, while investigations into the other variants of concern are still on-going. Member States should monitor vaccine effectiveness for these new variants. Breakthrough infections should be monitored, carefully investigated (including sequencing the virus variant causing breakthrough infection), and reported to public health and regulatory agencies to allow for an overview at country and EU-level. In addition, Member States should explore options for optimal use of the limited number of vaccine doses.

[This is a very somber and sobering risk assessment with much validity behind it. Highlights of the report are below:

"Characteristics of the new variants
-----------------------------------
- VOC 202012/01
"Transmissibility
"Several modelling studies corroborate the postulated increased transmissibility of VOC 202012/01 [31-33]. Voehringer et al reported that VOC 202012/01 had spread during the English lockdown in 87% of local authority areas with a lower degree of implemented NPIs, with an average R=1.25 in contrast to other lineages, which had an average R=0.85 [34]. Leung et al used the combination of N501Y and delta69/delta70 markers as surrogates of the VOC 202012/01 to estimate its R0 between [22 Sep and 1 Dec 2020] in the UK. In line with previous modelling studies, the R0 for VOC-202012/01 was estimated as 75% more transmissible than other variants [35]. Davies et al modelled data from 3 English regions to estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval (CrI): 50-74%) than previously identified SARS-CoV-2 variants [32]. Danish modelling studies performed in January 2021 estimated that VOC 202012/01 was 36% more transmissible than other variants [ECDC communication with Danish authorities].

"Severity
"There is currently no indication that infections with VOC 202012/01 are associated with more severe clinical presentation than pre-existing strains.

"Immunity, reinfection, vaccination
"The Public Health England Technical Briefing 4, on the investigation of VOC 202012/01, published on [15 Jan 2021], indicates consistent evidence of cross-neutralising activity in convalescent sera [39]. Sera from patients infected with non-variant virus show neutralising activity towards the variant virus, and vice versa.

- 501Y.V2
"Transmissibility
"Preliminary results, using a mathematical model previously used to characterise the transmissibility of VOC 202012/01 [32] and simplified calibration, estimate that 501Y.V2 is 50% (95% CrI: 20-113%) more transmissible than previously circulating variants in South Africa [41]. As the 501Y.V2 variant carries spike protein changes that are associated with reduced neutralisation by antibodies [42], the authors tested the assumption of similar transmissibility to previous variants and estimated that, in this scenario, 501Y.V2 would need to evade 21% (95% CrI: 11-36%) of previously acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity to account for the increased spread of the variant. A mix of these 2 scenarios is also possible, and there is no indication that one is more plausible than the other.

"Severity, immunity, reinfection, vaccination
"There is currently substantial uncertainty as to whether the 501Y.V2 variant causes a change in disease severity [41]. The combination of amino acid changes in 501Y.V2 has been shown to confer complete resistance to neutralisation by several monoclonal antibodies, as well as reduced neutralisation, or complete resistance to neutralisation by convalescent plasma and sera in a preprint article [43]. These results raise some concerns about whether the variant can increase the risk of reinfection or vaccine breakthrough infections. No information is yet available as to whether the number of reinfections related to this variant is actually higher.

- P.1 variant
"Transmissibility
"There is currently no microbiological or epidemiological evidence of any change in transmissibility of P.1, but the amino acid change N501Y, also present in VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2, indicates that increased transmissibility is plausible.

"Severity, immunity, reinfection, vaccination and treatment
"Nothing is known yet about potential changes in infection severity in those infected with the P.1 variant. The presence of amino acid change E484K, also present in 501Y.V2, may indicate a reduction in neutralisation overall and by the anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies used in the assays [42,44,45]. As yet, there is no indication as to whether the number of reinfections related to this variant is higher."

I highly recommend reading the entire risk assessment document available at the source URL above.

Reading between the lines the recommendations are approaching those of implementing and enforcing lockdowns. Especially highlighting avoiding non-essential travel as there has been clear geographic spread of theses variants related to travel. The mandate of a negative COVID test within 72 hours preceding travel gives a false sense of security as people can test negative 72 hours before travel and be positive the next day or be exposed the next day. Unfortunately the Americas and European regions have had extensive ongoing community transmission. Similar patterns have been seen in some of the South East Asian countries and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. While African countries had reduced cases reported, they are picking up and may reflect a major increase in transmission ongoing in the region. The Western Pacific region has countries that have managed to control transmission going after clusters, in some cases large clusters. For countries experiencing major community transmission, the recommendations of this risk assessment document should be taken seriously for measures to implement and enforce in the countries.

A challenge is to build up the laboratory capacity to do genomic sequencing on isolates on a larger scale than is presently done to maintain a high vigilance for other new variants. Another key challenge is to implement and enforce NPIs and non-essential travel. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (197 111), Spain (148 269), Brazil (59 946), and the UK (37 892) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 17 138 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 20 Jan to late 21 Jan 2021). I think there is an error in the Spain total case number and it should possibly be 44 357

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Spain Brazil, UK, France (22 848), Mexico (22 339), Russia (21 887), Germany (18 734), Colombia (15 366), India (14 481), Italy (14 055), Portugal (13 544), Indonesia (11 703), Argentina (11 396), and South Africa (11 381). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 58 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 14 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 6 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 9.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 21.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 750 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 98.0 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.10 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 6 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 11 out of the last 12 days. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
