In addition to COVID-19 and influenza A, which strongly broke out in Asturias at the beginning of March [2022], there is now another respiratory infection, known as Q fever. An "epidemiological rarity," according to doctors from the Principality Health Service (Sespa), of which there have been several cases in the last week, mainly in health area III, with an epicenter at the San Agustín de Avilés Hospital.

The affected patients were admitted with pneumonia, which [later on] the diagnostic tests carried out by the doctors attributed to an acute manifestation of Q fever. This infectious disease, triggered by an intracellular bacterium that receives the scientific name of _Coxiella burnetii_, is spread by domestic animals, such as cows, sheep or goats. Ticks also transmit this "peculiar" bacillus, which finds its breeding ground in rural areas "and is not very common."

Q fever can be contracted by drinking raw milk (unpasteurized) or after inhaling dust from a stable where, for example, there is urine or feces from an infected animal. Typically, it presents as a flu-like syndrome, with mild symptoms. But in its acute phase, this disease is characterized by high fever, headache, fatigue, chills, sore throat, nonproductive cough, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and chest pain. The process that can lead to "atypical" pneumonia.

Health professionals at the San Agustín Hospital, where the most striking cases of Q fever have been detected, are now monitoring these patients to "find out if it is a specific outbreak or something we should worry about." This medical finding coincides with a "slight rebound" in COVID-19 and a notable increase in influenza A infection, which is beginning to have an impact on hospitals. "Influenza admissions are increasing, especially in people over 75 years of age, while we continue to look askance at the evolution of the pandemic," hospital sources point out.

[Q fever is a zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. The most common animal reservoirs for this organism are cattle, sheep, and goats. Infected animals excrete the bacterium in milk, urine, feces, and birth by-products, especially the placenta. Intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ that can be dispersed for a considerable distance to involve people living downwind from infected livestock.

Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5-km (3 mi) high-risk zone (https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to spore-like particles the organism forms in mammalian cells as part of a biphasic developmental cycle (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949614/). These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (ProMED post 20170416.4974554). Rarely, Q fever has been spread person to person through blood transfusion, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430 and https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html).

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, or an arterial aneurysm (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863).

Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.

The tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865).

A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in "at-risk" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever).

If the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions.

Asturias is an autonomous community in northwest Spain on the Bay of Biscay. Avilés (pop., almost 80 000 residents) is an industrial port city in Asturias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avilés). San Agustín University Hospital is a 436-bed Spanish public health center located in Avilés (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Universitario_San_Agust%C3%ADn). A map showing the location of Aviles, Asturias can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Asturias,+Spain.

Seroprevalence of Q fever has been studied in Asturias, where a significant number of human cases are said to be diagnosed every year (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/5/1395/htm). This study found 8.4% sheep, 18.4% cattle, and 24.4% goats had serologic evidence of _C. burnetii_ infection; 15.9% of the patients admitted with a clinical picture compatible with acute Q fever had suggestive serologic evidence of _C. burnetii_ infection; and _C. burnetii_ DNA was detected in environmental samples collected in 20 of the 25 livestock farms.

However, the news report above fails to mention the number of Q fever cases, the timeline during which the cases occurred, demographic characteristics of the affected patients, possible factors that placed the patients at risk of Q fever, and the suspected source for the current Q fever outbreak. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
