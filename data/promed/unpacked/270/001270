[3a] Australia: Tasmania outbreak ex cruise ship
Date: Thu 23 Apr 2020
Source: 9 News [edited]
https://www.9news.com.au/national/coronavirus-australia-ruby-princess-tasmania-outbreak-likely-from-cruise-ship-senate-inquiry-covid-19/05b86a55-9479-41ac-814f-8b7c74bb8074


Australia's chief medical officer says a deadly COVID-19 outbreak in northwest Tasmania likely originated from a Ruby Princess passenger and is a lesson of how easily the virus can spread.

The region has been told to brace for an extension of tough restrictions as authorities try to contain the outbreak, which accounts for more than half of the island's 205 cases. There were no new virus cases recorded on Thursday [23 Apr 2020], the 1st time since 31 Mar [2020].

The Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus debacle in NSW could have contributed to an outbreak in Tasmania, Australia's chief medical officer has said. Professor Brendan Murphy earlier told a senate committee into the nation's pandemic response that northwest Tasmania is a "very good example" of how infectious the virus is.

"Tasmania Health has been investigating. I haven't seen the final report, but it seems likely healthcare workers picked up the virus, probably, from a Ruby Princess passenger who was being cared for," he said. The 1st 3 of the state's 8 virus deaths were passengers aboard the ill-fated cruise ship, which originally docked in Sydney. Two of them were patients at the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie, which has since been closed alongside its private counterpart, forcing 1200 staff into quarantine.

[3b] Indiana: prison outbreak
Date: Thu 23 Apr 2020
Source: Yahoo News [edited]
https://news.yahoo.com/indiana-prison-tested-hundreds-inmates-205050215.html


A prison in Indiana has reported that 92% of the people incarcerated there who have been tested for COVID-19 have had positive results. Westville Correctional Facility is a medium-security prison with a population of 3200. As of Wednesday [22 Apr 2020], only 137 inmates had been tested, but 126 of those had tested positive, according to the Chicago Tribune.

As of Thursday [23 Apr 2020] afternoon, 130 of the 246 COVID-19 cases in state correctional facilities were at Westville, according to the Indiana Department of Corrections website. Last week, Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box discussed the growing outbreak at the facility, simply saying that people in the prison who have tested positive are being isolated from the rest of the community. Meanwhile, advocates continue to push for incarcerated people to be released due to the pandemic, which Gov. Eric Holcomb has previously said he does not support.

On Tuesday [21 Apr 2020], the Indiana chapter of the National Lawyers Guild issued an open letter asking Gov. Holcomb to "immediately exercise his executive authority under the Indiana Constitution" to release all state prisoners who are at risk of dying or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. According to IndyStar, the governor's office responded to the letter by calling it "inflammatory."

According to David R. Bursten, chief communications officer at the Indiana Department of Correction, the positive test results were somewhat expected. "The Indiana Department of Corrections (IDOC) is following CDC guidelines to test offenders who display symptoms of the COVID-19 virus. For this reason, it is expected the vast majority of persons tested will come back with a positive test result," Bursten said in a statement to Refinery29. He also stated that, at the Westville Correctional Facility, only 26 symptomatic inmates are currently being isolated, but 1498 asymptomatic inmates are also being quarantined due to suspected exposure. However, it is unclear what measures are being taken within the facility to quarantine thousands of inmates.

As has been predicted by experts and advocates since the virus came to the United States, prisons have become hotbeds for COVID-19. The close quarters, lack of adequate protection, and unsanitary conditions make the facilities breeding grounds for the spread of disease. As such, advocates have been asking for governors in infected states to release people who are incarcerated in order to lessen their risk of contracting the virus.

However, in places where that is being done, there are inadequate quarantine protocols, which raises concern of people leaving correctional facilities and becoming sources of community spread. In San Bernardino County, at least 3 people tested positive for COVID-19 soon after they were released from the California Institution for Men (CIM).

"If we know that someone is coming from one of those facilities, maybe we reach out to them, we offer them services, maybe we offer them testing, or monitor them, check to see if they have any signs or symptoms," Lake County California Sheriff Brian Martin told KQED. "It's not to punish them; it's nobody's fault that they catch coronavirus. But we want to make sure that they're safe, and our community is safe as well."

Expanded testing of the inmate population at the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater continues as the Michigan Department of Corrections reported a 10th prisoner at the prison has died from COVID-19. The MDOC reported on Friday [24 Apr 2020] night a total of 971 tests have been conducted at Lakeland with 642 of the tests coming back positive, while 297 tests were negative. Results are pending on 32 tests.

In addition, 15 Lakeland prisoners who previously tested positive are now in a step-down unit and are no longer contagious.

The MDOC also reports 31 Lakeland staff members have tested positive for COVID-19.

Lakeland has had the most deaths of any Michigan prison facility because of the virus. The MDOC reports there have been a total of 30 deaths of prisoners in Michigan who had tested positive for COVID-19.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/nations-plan-coronavirus-live-updates-200424232518547.html


The World Health Organization's chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the agency is teaming up with countries and partners worldwide to accelerate work on drugs and a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Noticeably absent: the United States, which is the hardest hit country in the world.

Meanwhile, the WHO has warned against countries issuing so-called "immunity passports" to those recovered from COVID-19, saying there is no evidence yet that the previously infected cannot be reinfected.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that there was currently "no evidence" that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a 2nd coronavirus infection.

In a statement, the UN agency warned against issuing "immunity passports" or "risk-free certificates" to people who have been infected, saying the practice may actually increase the risk of spread as they may ignore standard advice.

Africa
- Africa's coronavirus cases have surged 43% in the past week, but its countries are dangerously behind in the global race for scarce medical equipment. Ten nations have no ventilators at all. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the continent is competing with the developed world in terms of obtaining supplies and equipment. "The very future of the continent will depend on how this matter is handled."

Europe
- Poland 12:30 GMT: Poland to reopen outdoor playgrounds as it eases sports curbs.
Poland plans to reopen outdoor sports areas on 4 May [2020] and will allow top league football matches to be played at the end of next month [May 2020] as part of an easing of restrictions put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Poland started relaxing some of the curbs earlier in April [2020], saying they were costly for the economy. It has reopened forests and parks and eased rules on the number of customers in shops.

By Saturday [25 Apr 2020], the European Union member state of 38 million had reported 11 067 cases and 499 deaths.

"Sport is an important part of the national economy, which contributes to improving health, and we are aware how important it is to restore normality," Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference on Saturday [25 Apr 2020].

- Belarus 10:10 GMT: Outbreak hits home for disabled children
Several people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in an orphanage for 170 children with developmental disabilities in Belarus, the local authorities have said, without disclosing the exact number of cases. The 1st case of the virus had been found in one of the employees at the orphanage, according to the local authorities of the Mogilev region, where the institution is located. After that, tests were conducted with all employees and residents.

"Some have received positive test results. At present, most of them have no symptoms of the disease," said a statement from the Executive Committee of the Mogilev region.

President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed fears about the coronavirus outbreak as a "psychosis" and has not closed borders or imposed strict lockdown measures in the eastern European country. There were 8773 confirmed coronavirus cases in Belarus as of Friday [24 Apr 2020], of which 396 are in the Mogilev region in the east, and 63 deaths in total.

United Kingdom
- Britain 00:05 GMT: Britain starts plasma trial
Britain is to start trials to see whether plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 could be an effective treatment for patients who are severely unwell with the disease, Reuters news agency reported. Up to 5000 severely ill patients with COVID-19 could soon be treated each week with plasma as part of a new approach to treating the virus, the health department said on Saturday [25 Apr 2020]. Plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can be transfused to patients who are struggling to produce their own antibodies against the virus.

- Britain 08:40 GMT: Britain nears grim milestone of 20 000 deaths
Britain could hit the grim milestone of 20 000 COVID-19 deaths later on Saturday [25 Apr 2020] when the daily count is added to the current toll of 19 506 people who tested positive for the new coronavirus and died in hospital. The death toll from COVID-19 in hospitals across the UK increased on Friday [24 Apr 2020] by 684 in 24 hours to 19 506. [I do not think this includes deaths at home or in long-term care facilities/nursing homes. - Corr.SB]

USA
- The death toll in the United States surpassed 51 000 amid more than 890 000 cases. But the number of daily deaths in New York has gone down, with 422 reported on Friday [24 Apr 2020], the lowest since 1 Apr [2020]. Meanwhile, China reported it has not had a new death from the virus in 10 days.

Close to 196 000 people have died due to the pandemic, with 2.7 million infected globally, out of whom almost some 781 000 have recovered.

- New York 07:00 GMT: Disinfectant poisoning
An unusually high number of New York City residents contacted city health authorities over fears that they had ingested bleach or other household cleaners in the 18 hours after President Donald Trump's suggested that injecting such products could cure coronavirus, the New York Daily News reported. The Poison Control Center, a subagency of the city's Health Department, managed a total of 30 cases of possible exposure to disinfectants during the period, a spokesman told the newspaper. During the same period last year [2019], the agency handled only 13 similar cases.

Of the cases reported between Thursday and Friday [23-24 Apr 2020], 9 were specifically about possible exposure to Lysol, while 10 were in regard to bleach and 11 about household cleaners in general, the spokesman said.

To be clear, disinfectants are not intended for ingestion either by mouth, by ears, by breathing them in any way, shape, or form. And doing so can put people at great risk. https://twitter.com/nycHealthy/status/1253720226543386626

<nychealthy@nycHealthy>
Do NOT ingest or inject Lysol or any other disinfectant as a treatment for #COVID19. Household disinfectants are poisonous and can cause serious harm or even death if swallowed or injected. Call the Poison Control Center for info about safe use of products: 212-764-7667.

[5] WHO situation report 96 (as of 25 Apr 2020)
Date: Sat 25 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200425-sitrep-96-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=a33836bb_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 25 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- WHO, together with heads of state, global health leaders, private sector partners, and other stakeholders launched the Access To COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to new COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. More information including the WHO director-general's opening remarks, full list of participants, and the group's statement are available via the source URL.
- Although some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an "immunity passport" or "risk-free certificate," there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a 2nd infection. More information is available at https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19.
- WHO has seen a dramatic increase in the number of cyberattacks directed at its staff and email scams targeting the public. WHO asks the public to remain vigilant against fraudulent emails and recommends using reliable sources to obtain factual information about COVID-19 and other health issues.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 52 138 new cases (55.6 % of the global newly reported cases) and 2520 deaths (43.7% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 58.9% were reported by the USA, followed by Ecuador at 22.1%, Brazil at 7.2% and Canada at 3.7%.

The European region reported 30 450 new cases (32.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 2940 deaths (51% of the global newly reported deaths). Spain reported 22.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 17.7%, Turkey 10.3%, and Italy 9.9%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5675 new cases (6.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 142 deaths (2.5% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 1172 new cases representing 20.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 20.5%, Pakistan at 13.8%, Qatar 13.4%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.2%. Saudi Arabia surpassed Iran for the 1st time.

The African region reported 1263 new cases (1.35% of the global newly reported cases) and 24 deaths (0.42% of the global newly reported deaths). There were 22 countries reporting no cases in this 24-hour period. That being said, South Africa reported 21.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana at 9.9%, Algeria at 9.5%, and Nigeria at 9.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1688 new cases (1.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 37 deaths (0.64% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 53.1% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 26.1%, and the Philippines at 12.5%.

The South East Asia region reported 2501 new cases (2.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 104 deaths (1.8% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 57.1% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 20.1% and Indonesia at 17.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through (25 Apr 2020]) at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend; the European region increased following the weekend but to lower levels than the prior week. The America's region does not appear to have decreased. One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA]
