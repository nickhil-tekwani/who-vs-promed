Dengue look-alike infects Hanoi
-------------------------------
Viet Nam is verifying an outbreak in Hanoi of a mosquito-borne virus
that closely resembles the dengue fever virus, a health ministry
official said on Monday [19 Oct 2009].

So far, 60 percent of patients with classic dengue symptoms have
tested negative for dengue, according to Vu Sinh Nam, deputy director
general of the Preventive Health and Environment Department.

At this stage it seems they have contracted the look-a-like
chikungunya virus, which is carried by the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito.

They have caught some _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes in Hanoi and are
trying to determine whether they are responsible and whether they
really do have an outbreak of chikungunya [virus infection], Nam said.

It's recurred in regional countries like India, Thailand, and
Singapore, and some deaths have been recorded in consequence, according to Nam.

Nam said it was hard to tell the 2 diseases apart without testing as
the symptoms were virtually identical.

The World Health Organization is helping out by supplying Viet Nam
with 50 testing kits for the chikungunya virus. The kits have already
been distributed to the northern Pasteur Institutes and Institutes of
Hygiene and Epidemiology for testing people who present with
dengue-like symptoms at local cities and big towns.

Since the beginning of this year [2009], 6750 people in Hanoi have
been admitted to hospital with dengue symptoms, 14 times more than in
the same period last year [2008], according to the Ministry of Health.

[Chikungunya is a viral infection, caused by the bite of infected
mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ (the Asian tiger
mosquito). Symptoms of chikungunya infection include fever, headache,
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and joint pain. The
incubation period is usually 3 to 7 days.

The disease typically lasts a few days to a few weeks. However,
incapacitating joint pain, or arthritis may last for weeks or months
in some patients. There is no specific treatment for chikungunya
virus infection, and treatment is based on symptoms. It can be
prevented by using of insect repellent, protective clothing, and
staying in areas with screens.

As the clinical symptoms of chikungunya virus infection are similar
to those of dengue fever, main laboratory tests to diagnose
chikungunya are virus isolation, serological tests and molecular
technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). More detailed
information on laboratory diagnosis of chikungunya is available from
the Regional Office for South-East Asia, World Health Organization
(WHO/SEARO) website at
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section2246_12902.htm>.

The chikungunya virus was 1st isolated in 1952-53 from both man and
mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania. In Asia, virus strain was
isolated in Bangkok in 1960s. Chikungunya virus was 1st reported in
Thailand in 1958, the 1st serologically-proven case in 1960, and the
last case was reported in 1991. After a long period without reported
outbreaks, chikungunya reoccurred in Narathiwat Province in Thailand
on 5 Oct 2008. Since then, the outbreaks have been spreading in
neighboring southern provinces (see prior PRO/MBDS postings).

The chikungunya virus situation in Thailand can be obtained from the
Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance Report (WESR) of the Bureau of
Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, dated 6 Oct 2009,
and available in Thai language at
<http://203.157.15.4/wesr/file/y52/F52405.pdf>. A total of 43 238
chikungunya cases are reported from 55 provinces in Thailand as of 6 Oct 2009.

However, the newswire above is the 1st report on suspected
chikungunya infection in Viet Nam. ProMED-mail and PRO/MBDS would
highly appreciate more information from reliable sources on the
suspected chikungunya infection reported from Hanoi in Viet Nam.
