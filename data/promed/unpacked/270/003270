ProMED awaits further information about results of laboratory testing with considerable interest.

Although the epidemiological week 47 [week ending 24 Nov 2013] report of this suspected hemorrhagic fever case is not yet an active link on the Uganda Ministry of Health website (http://health.go.ug/mohweb/?page_id=1294), it has been published, as cited above.

Bombo is located approximately 33 km (21 mi), by road, north of Uganda's capital, Kampala, in the Luwero district of Central Uganda region. Maps can be accessed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombo,_Uganda and http://healthmap.org/r/9p57. - Mod.TY]
