An updated map, showing the BTV-8 outbreaks in the above countries from 17
Aug to 15 Nov 2006, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pdf/bt-europemap.pdf >.
The presented new cases, recorded between 10 and 15 Nov 2006, demonstrate
some geographic extension of the affected areas. A new outbreak of BT was
reported from France this week -- more than a month after the previous one.

[Prior to this one, Portugal has not had an outbreak of Bluetongue since
2004, when the serotype was the same BT-4. The previous outbreak was also
in November and was due to spread from the Extremadura and Andalucia
provinces of Spain. An earlier outbreak of BT-4 had occurred in Morocco.
