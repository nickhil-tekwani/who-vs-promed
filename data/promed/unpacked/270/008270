A holidaymaker is launching legal action against a travel company claiming his break to Tunisia was ruined after he contracted cholera. The man was on a romantic getaway with his partner when he claims to have been hit by the infection, which is usually confined to developing countries.

The 47-year-old alleges he suffered diarrhea throughout the 12-day break at the Sol Azur Hotel, and was doubled over in pain throughout the trip. He believed it to be food poisoning but visited a doctor when the symptoms continued after he returned home to be diagnosed with cholera -- a bacterial infection caused by eating food which has been in contact with feces.

The architect, from Telford, Shropshire, said the 1st thing the couple noticed when they arrived at the 3-star hotel in September 2013, was the smell of 'raw sewage'. 'We arrived in the middle of the night, and the 1st thing we noticed was the smell of raw sewage -- it was absolutely unbelievable,' he said.

[This case is not likely to be cholera, based on the complaint of abdominal pain (cholera is usually painless) and in reviewing WHO statistics on worldwide cholera, there has not been a case officially reported from Tunisia in the past 10 years. It is possible that a non-O1, non-O139 _Vibrio cholerae_ was involved or a non-cholera vibrio such as _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2012, it was reported (http://allafrica.com/stories/201208030056.html) that systematic analyses of the wastewater samples detected in the presence of _Vibrio cholerae_ in one single sample from the Rades Meliene-based wastewater treatment station. The Public Health Ministry reassured the public that such germs represent no risk for the people's health, which is confirmed by the epidemiological situation characterised by the absence of human cases of cholera since 1982. However, cases of cholera were reported in travelers to Tunisia in 1997 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=1038) in a German vacationer in Mahdia, Tunisia which was identified as an O1 _V. cholerae_. The Sol Azur Beach Hotel is in Hammamet, Tunisia about a 2-hour drive from Mahdia. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Nigeria
Date: Sat 12 Apr 2014

A new wave of cholera epidemic blowing across the country may have claimed hundreds of lives since January 2014 and does not seem to be abating anytime soon with the onset of the rainy season, Weekly Trust findings reveal.

The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has confirmed an outbreak of the infectious disease in 14 states, where it said 9006 cases were reported, with 106 deaths in the 1st quarter of 2014, adding that the situation was not this critical in 2013. But state health officials say the casualty figures for the last 3 months could be much higher as deaths that happened outside health facilities, which are many, are not officially reported, while many others do not even know the cause of death.

The NCDC report shows that Bauchi, where 6910 cases were reported with 48 deaths, is the worst hit of the 14 states; Kano had 1270 cases with 16 deaths, while 3 of the 28 cases in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) ended in fatalities.

In Kaduna State, 350 cases were recorded with 19 deaths, while 4 died from the 97 cases reported in Benue, 6 died in Taraba from the 190 cases reported and 6 again in Ebonyi from 16 recorded cases.

The NCDC report said the lot of the country turned for the worst in the 12th week [week of 17 Mar 2014]. Between weeks 1 and 12 of 2014, 9006 cholera cases with 81 lab-confirmed and 106 deaths from 58 local government areas (13 States and the FCT -- Federal Capital Territory, the home of Abuja, the capital of Nigeria) were reported.

But Bauchi State Commissioner for health, Dr Abubakar Sani Malami, told a news brief on Thu 10 Apr 2014, that 59 people died of cholera in the state in the last 3 months. He said 54 of them died in their homes and 5 in hospital. "The state recorded a high casualty figure because some of the victims were treating themselves at home," he said.

Local health workers and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) told Weekly Trust in Zamfara that over 1117 cholera cases were reported in at least 5 local government areas of the state within 2 weeks. These are Gusau, Durumi, Gukkuyum, Sakura, and Maradu. At least 72 of the victims died of the infection, not including those who died before they could get medical help, local officials said. But reports by MSF indicate that the death toll from the epidemic could be as high as 350 people in Zamfara alone. Hospital sources said about 90 fresh cases were reported at the Shagari Primary Health Care Center among other health facilities in the state this week alone. Many more are being expected.

One of the worst hit communities in Plateau State is Anguwan Yashi, in Namu area of Qua'an Pan Local Government Area, which recently saw the influx of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Nasarawa State fleeing from communal crisis, putting pressure on the only source of drinking water and other facilities in the village. The Plateau State government has confirmed that 11 people died of cholera while the community puts the casualty figure at more than 30. None could, however, dispute that over 100 people had been infected and treated from the disease.

"Both indigenes of the village and the displaced have been affected because we now live together. And I can count over 10 of the indigenes that have died from this disease, including my brother's wife, my neighbor, and her daughter," said Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq, the district head of Namu. Cholera outbreaks were reported in several other parts of the state with no official records of cases, sometimes due to the remote nature of such locations or just because of the attitude of the people to health issues.

At least 2 local areas of Sokoto State have experienced an outbreak of cholera in 2014, Tambuwal and Kebbe, where scores of people have died of infection, investigations by Weekly Trust revealed. But the state government said only 13 out of the 152 cases reported there ended in fatalities. In Barkeji alone, a village located along Sokoto-Jega road in Tambuwal local government area where the disease was said to have first surfaced, 31 cases and 5 deaths were recorded between 10 and 21 Oct 2013 officials said. In Kebbe local government area, about 20 kilometres [12.4 mi] from Tambuwal, the disease resurfaced in 6 riverine communities, including Bakin Dutse, Tuna, 'Yar-Romo, Nabasa, Fakku, and Bashi, with 8 deaths out of 121 cases reported.

Scores of people in Kano metropolis are now bedridden and agonizing as a result of the sudden outbreak of cholera in some parts of the state. The cholera epidemic struck the communities 10 days ago and has so far claimed the lives of over 12 persons.

In Lagos state cholera outbreak in 5 local government areas has so far claimed at least 3 persons, while scores of victims were treated and discharged, state commissioner for health, Dr Jide Idris, said. "Although, many of the cases have been treated and discharged in several health facilities, 3 have been confirmed dead. Most of the suspected cases are from Ajeromi, Apapa, Lagos Island, Oshodi-Isolo and Surulere local government areas," Idris said.
