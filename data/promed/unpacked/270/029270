A national regulator has approved a vaccine to treat Hendra virus -- a virus potentially deadly to both horses and humans -- despite possible links to horse deaths.

The Hendra virus vaccine for horses was registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) on [Tue 4 Aug 2015]. The registration came after ABC Rural [News] earlier this year [2015] reported concerns over alleged side effects including death.

During the permit period, vets and owners were required to report any reactions their horses faced after receiving the injection.

The APVMA found possible links between 7 horse deaths and the vaccine, developed by US company Zoetis. Its website states a "possible" rating is given when the vaccine is one of several possible and equally plausible explanations for the death or other adverse reactions.

A spokeswoman said that meant the use of the vaccine could not be differentiated from other possible causes as the cause of death in the horses.

In all, the APVMA found 633 probable links between the vaccine and reactions and another 125 possible links out of more than 340 000 doses administered. Less than 0.8 per cent of horses suffered a possible or probable reaction.

Side effects included oedemas (watery fluid build-up), lethargy, pain, and anorexia but almost half were reactions at the injecting site.

In approving the vaccine, the APVMA found it was an effective aid to prevent the disease, but wasn't foolproof.

"The potential for a vaccinated horse to pass on the Hendra virus cannot be ruled out," the regulator states on its website. "As a precaution, it is recommended people take the same steps to protect vaccinated horses from exposure to infection -- and to prevent humans being infected by horses -- as are recommended for unvaccinated horses.

"Personal protective equipment should be worn whenever infection is suspected even in vaccinated horses." It recommended a booster dose every 6 months.

Four Queenslanders have died from Hendra virus and 73 horse deaths nationwide have been confirmed to have stemmed from the disease.

[Hendra virus] was first discovered in a horse in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in 1994.

A horse in north Queensland was put down in July [2015] after catching the virus, sending a farm on the Atherton Tabelands into lockdown. Biosecurity Queensland was expecting test results back on other horses at the farm by the end of August [2015].

In horses, the rapid onset of illness, increased heart rate, and increased body temperature are all associated with the disease.

In humans, it can present with symptoms including a fever, headache, dry cough, unusual sleepiness, and confusion.

Trials for a treatment of the virus affecting humans are underway in Queensland.

[A reaction rate of 0.8 percent strikes me as pretty small. I think we would all be surprised if we knew the failure rate of our common vaccines, such as the flu.

Swelling at an injection site, while perhaps painful and annoying, happens with many species and many different vaccines.

To vaccinate or not to vaccine is what this article is all about. Lets rephrase it: to live or not to live! The rate of adverse reactions is small compared to the risk in unvaccinated horses of dying from this disease. - Mod.TG
