Senecavirus A confirmed in Ontario
----------------------------------
U.S. turns away at least 8 truckloads of pigs

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is testing all swine at federal processing plants that are symptomatic of Senecavirus A as it has been confirmed in Ontario.

Senecavirus A (formerly called Seneca Valley virus or SVV) has been confirmed in Ontario. Clinical signs of this disease closely resemble foot-and-mouth disease, so the U.S. authorities have turned away at least 8 truckloads of pigs which apparently showed signs of the disease.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is testing all swine at federal processing plants that are symptomatic. Processing plants can be shut down up to 72 hours while testing is being conducted, which immediately stops the flow of hogs and shipping of pork products from that facility. If a plant is shut down, its customers and suppliers will be notified of pending production and product delays/cancellations.

Manitoba producers should take the following biosecurity measures.

- Know the symptoms of Senecavirus A (blisters/vesicles or ulcers of the snout, mouth, and/or just above the hoof; lameness, fevers, lack of energy and/or appetite; lesions; 4 to 10 day-increase in piglet mortality with/without diarrhea).

- Ensure your transporters exercise biosecurity and know the symptoms of Senecavirus A.

- Ask your plant, marketer and/or assembly yard about their processes to address this disease.

[There appears to be an upsurge in Senecavirus A, formerly Seneca Valley virus, in both the US and Canada. As autumn is coming on, this virus appears to be making a comeback in both countries.

"Canadian Pig Farmers on Alert Following Upsurge of Seneca Valley Virus in US
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Veterinary Epidemiologist with Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development is encouraging pork producers be watching for signs of Seneca Valley virus and to report any signs of the infection immediately, writes Bruce Cochrane.

Seneca Valley virus in swine is not considered to be a production limiting disease and any infection tends to run its course quickly; however, the resemblance of its symptoms to foot-and-mouth disease is cause for vigilance.

Dr Julia Keenliside, a Veterinary Epidemiologist with Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, told Alberta Pork's August Telephone Town Hall last week, there has been an upsurge in Seneca Valley virus in the United States over the last few weeks.

Dr Julia Keenliside-Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development:

'Last year [2015] at this time we saw the big upsurge in cases in the US and Seneca Valley virus, to remind you, is a virus that looks like foot-and-mouth disease.

'It causes blisters on the mouth and the feet of pigs.

'Because foot-and-mouth disease is one of these huge scary reportable trade diseases where we shut down plants and farms, we have to [be] really diligent in reporting blisters of any kind and making sure we can differentiate that it is Seneca Valley virus and it's not foot-and-mouth.

'One of the 1st signs of Seneca Valley virus is either blisters on the mouth or the feet but often you see lameness 1st, before you get close enough to check.

'I know it's hard to check the feet of pigs, especially in assembly yards or on trucks but it's something we should all do if we suspect that our pigs are a little more lame than they should be and keep our eyes peeled certainly for any signs of Seneca Valley virus at this time of the year.'

Dr Keenliside acknowledges there is a lot to be learned about Seneca Valley virus, including how it's spread and how the blisters show up.

Although the infection itself does not cause major health issues in pigs, she encourages anyone who observes blisters of any kind to report the situation."

Although this outbreak is occurring in Canada, there are good recommendations coming from the USDA [US Department of Agriculture].

The recommendations to follow when a herd is suspected of having Senecavirus A (SVA) are to follow the USDA guidelines regarding animals with vesicular lesions. Those guidelines from USDA may be found on the American Association of Swine Veterinarians document: https://www.aasv.org/documents/VSG7406.2_SVA_Guidelines_4516.pdf. The article is USDA's recommendations for handling herds suspected of having SVA to ensure that foreign animal disease investigations occur per agency guidelines.
