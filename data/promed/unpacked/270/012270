HANTAVIRUS ECOLOGY

A few comments about hantavirus ecology:
1. Hantaviruses can and do infect hosts other than the primary reservoir
hosts, even in nature. Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection for example, has
been found in hosts that differ from _Peromyscus maniculatus_ at the
specific (_P. boylii_, _P. truei_, etc.), generic (_Reithrodontomys_),
subfamilial (_Mus musculus_), and familial (_Tamias_ spp.) level. In
addition, primates (humans) are most certainly infect-able!
2. While the infectiousness of hantaviruses for a variety of mammalian
hosts is evident, it appears to be most uncommon -though perhaps not
impossible, see (3) below- for hantaviruses to adapt permanently to new
hosts, or to pass readily among mammals other than their primary reservoir
hosts. Thus, there is no evidence that _Rattus_ can serve as a host for
SNV, for example, with natural passage of SNV among rats.
3. Many papers (including some from my lab) have suggested that the
observed close correspondence between host-rodent and viral phylogenies
indicate that individual hantaviruses have achieved a long-term adaptation
to individual rodent species. This notion may require some revisions,
since exceptions are gradually piling up. For example, the close
relationships between _Sigmodon hispidus_-borne hantaviruses and the
_Oryzomys_-borne Bayou virus are not predictable from rodent phylogenetics,
nor is the close relationship between the _Calomys_-borne Laguna Negra
virus and the oryzomine Rio Mamore and Andes viruses.
The new findings may indicate that host-switching can occur with
hantaviruses, even if such events are not observed in real time. By and
large, however, it would seem that once a hantavirus has achieved a stable
ecological niche in a particular host, it is very uncommon for it to switch
to other hosts.
4. Infected animals (and humans) most certainly make neutralizing
antibodies to hantaviruses. The ability of viruses to persist in reservoir
hosts in the face of neutralizing antibodies is fascinating. A whole range
of immune escape mechanisms are being uncovered for other virus families
(herpesviruses and poxviruses, for example, provide some fascinating
models) and some interesting ideas are under investigation for the
Bunyaviridae as well.
5. Segment reassortment is a source of much confusion. So far, proven
natural reassortment events in the hantaviruses have been restricted to
different genotypes of a single viral species (SNV). The proteins encoded
by the swapped segments are virtually identical, so opportunities to
generate something really new by this mechanism appear to be very limited
indeed. The lack of reassortment between hantavirus species is compatible
with previous studies of other members of the family Bunyaviridae. It
would appear that a particular genomic segment of virus 'A' is not happy
with a different segment from virus 'B', at least in nature.
I hope all of the above clarifies more than it obscures!
