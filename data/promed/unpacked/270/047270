Foot and mouth disease [FMD] update
-----------------------------------
Initial blood tests on clinically healthy sheep on a farm within the
Protection Zone suggest exposure to FMD. These animals were identified as
part of the surveillance work that is being carried out in the area. All
animals on the premises are being slaughtered on suspicion. Further
laboratory tests are ongoing.

Foot and mouth tests "positive"
-------------------------------
Blood tests on sheep on a Surrey farm suggest exposure to FMD, officials
have said. The preliminary tests were undertaken on premises within the
protection zone near to where the outbreak began.
Earlier, initial tests for the disease in pigs culled on another farm
proved negative. The full test results will become available on Tuesday [18
Sep 2007]. The pigs were on a farm near 2 premises infected by FMD and were
culled as a precaution.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed [that]
the tests on the sheep suggested the presence of the disease on Monday [17
Sep 2007] night.
Britain's biggest sale of breeding lambs has been cancelled because of
animal movement restrictions because of the Surrey outbreak. Some 30 000
young sheep were due to be sold in the annual 2 day auction in Hawes, in
the Yorkshire Dales. The event usually sees 2 million pounds sterling [USD
4m] change hands and is the biggest pay day in the calendar for about 500
local farmers. But since the latest outbreak of FMD, livestock cannot be
traded or moved unless it is for slaughter.
The BBC's Richard Wells said farmers would be left desperately short of
money. Hotels, guesthouses and pubs would also suffer, he said.
The movement ban -- described by farmers as "heartbreaking" -- was put in
place across Britain when a case of the disease was discovered in cattle on
land in Egham last Wednesday [12 Sep 2007]. It was later confirmed on a
second farm.
Organisers of the Masham Sheep Fair, in North Yorkshire, have said they are
to go ahead with their event on the 29 and 30 Sep 2007, despite the FMD
restrictions meaning sheep cannot attend.
On Saturday [15 Sep 2007], the government's chief vet lifted a ban on
farmers across most of England from taking livestock to slaughter,
considered by farmers to be an "encouraging signal". But a full ban on any
movement remains in place in the surveillance zone around the 2 infected
sites in Surrey. A 3km (1.8 mile) protection zone has been set up around
the farmland, with a 10km (6.2 mile) surveillance zone encircling it.
Laboratory results have established the virus found at the latest outbreak
to be the same strain as the one in August.
Reports suggested last month's outbreak was connected with the Pirbright
laboratory site, shared by 2 occupants - the government's Institute for
Animal Health (IAH) and Merial Animal Health.
Estimates of the cost of the latest outbreak have been put at almost 10
million pounds sterling a day. Police and trading standards officials were
continuing to monitor the area following reports that closure signs on
footpaths had been torn down and people had been side-stepping disinfectant
mats.
A spokesman for Surrey trading standards said although no arrests had been
made over the weekend, officials were looking into reports that horses had
been moved illegally in and out of the protection zone. [Though horses are
not susceptible to infection with the FMD virus, they can carry the virus
on their surface, similarly to humans, dogs, vehicles, fomites etc. Such a
transmission is called "mechanical", in contrast to biological
transmission. - Mod.AS]

[The surveillance which has led to the detection of infected sheep may be
part of an effort to establish a "containment zone".
Article 2.2.10.7 in the International Terrestrial Animal Health Code
addresses situations where a limited outbreak occurs within an FMD free
country, allowing the establishment of a single "containment zone" for the
purpose of minimizing the impact on the entire country. For this to be
achieved, the Veterinary authority should provide documented evidence that:
"1. the outbreak is limited based on the following factors:
a. immediately on suspicion, a rapid response including notification has
been made;
b. standstill of animal movements has been imposed, and effective controls
on the movement of other commodities mentioned in this chapter are in place;
c. epidemiological investigation (trace-back, trace-forward) has been
completed;
d. the infection has been confirmed;
e. the source of the outbreak has been identified;
f. all cases have been shown to be epidemiologically linked;
"2. surveillance in accordance with Appendix 3.8.7 demonstrates that there
are no undetected cases in the containment zone;
"3. a stamping out policy has been applied;
"4. increased passive and targeted surveillance in accordance with Appendix
3.8.7. in the rest of the country or zone has been carried out and has not
detected any evidence of infection;
"5. measures to prevent spread of the infection from the containment zone
to the rest of the country or zone, including ongoing surveillance in the
containment zone, are in place.
The free status of the areas outside the containment zone would be
suspended pending the establishment of the containment zone. The suspension
of free status of these areas could be lifted irrespective of the
provisions of Article 2.2.10.8 [namely at least 3 months after the stamping
out of the last case in a country without vaccination. - Mod.AS] once the
containment zone is clearly established, by complying with points 1 to 5
above."

DISEASE), go to
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_3.8.7.htm#chapitre_3.8.7.>
The UK authorities have a complex and laborious undertaking on their hands,
should they wish to accomplish the establishment of a containment zone
which fulfills the above requirements; passive and active surveillance is
one of the main components thereof. - Mod. AS].
