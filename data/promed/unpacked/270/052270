England: Outbreak of Suspected Viral Gastroenteritis at Holiday Park
---------------------------------------------------
A holiday park where up to 100 guests have been infected with a [suspected
viral gastroenteritis] says it is business as usual despite the outbreak.
Managers at Center Parcs in Longleat, Wiltshire, said the [illness],
thought to be a [viral] gastroenteritis, was under control. They said 3500
new guests had checked in on Fri 5 Mar 2004 and the 400-acre leisure park
is now fully booked.

The outbreak is [presumed to have been caused by a norovirus infection]
similar to that which affected hundreds of passengers on a cruise ship (the
Aurora) during November 2003. That outbreak sparked a diplomatic row
between Britain and Spain.

Managers said the [norovirus-like infection], which causes vomiting and
diarrhoea, had not deterred holidaymakers. "We are informing everyone of
the situation on arrival, so they have all the information," a spokesman said.

"We've had a few concerned calls to our medical centre, but it's really
business as usual. "We've been in constant contact with the Environmental
Health Agency and it was their advice for us not to shut. "It's a mild form
of a very common virus and hopefully it's now on the decline."

[Information on the course of this outbreak, the measures instituted to
contain it, their effectiveness, and the advice offered to intending guests
would be of interest to others in similar circumstances. Any informed
comment from those dealing with this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
