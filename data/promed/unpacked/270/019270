[1] Pakistan WPV1 AFP: 12th case
Date: Thu 14 Jul 2022

Pakistan has reported the [12th] polio case of this year [2022] as the health authorities detected 1 more case in the country's North Waziristan tribal district. This time, a 21-month-old boy has been diagnosed with the polio disease in Mir Ali Union Council 7, reports said.

According to preliminary investigations, the child has been paralysed in the right leg. Health authorities said that the total number of cases in Mir Ali has reached 9. They said that new cases surfaced due to parents' refusal during vaccination drives. Earlier, the South Asian nation had made tremendous success against polio over the past few years.

The southern districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, namely North and South Waziristan, DI Khan, Bannu, Tank and Lakki Marwat, are at the highest risk of wild poliovirus, per reports.

Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease that is usually spread through contaminated water or food. Invading the nervous system, the disease can cause total paralysis within hours. The contagious virus thrived in the borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan where militants attacked and even killed anti-polio teams.

[Another report mentions the date of onset of paralysis as 18 Jun 2022 (https://www.geo.tv/latest/427467-north-waziristan-reports-12th-polio-case). According to Pakistan official reports there have been 11 cases (https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces) but I suspect this page will be updated shortly.

Transmission in North Waziristan continues.

This case now makes a total of 14 cases of WPV1 associated AFP confirmed in 2022.

[At the global level looking at confirmed cases to date comparing 2022 to 2021, there is a significant increase in both WPV1 associated AFP cases (13 vs 2) and cVDPV associated AFP cases (173 vs 139).

In the past week, there was a positive environmental sample for WPV1 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (and while not in this report, a newly confirmed AFP case due to WPV1 infection in North Waziristan (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). There were also 6 countries reporting cVDPV2 activity -- 5 with AFP cases (Algeria, Benin, Eritrea, Ghana and Niger) and 1 with positive environmental samples (DR Congo). Note that this is the 1st report of cVDPV2 in Algeria, with a virus related to the Zamfara outbreak in Nigeria.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]
