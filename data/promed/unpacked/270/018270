A horse in the town of Highgate was euthanized after it became ill from the mosquito-borne illness Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday [4 Sep 2013].

The death of the horse indicates that the virus that causes the disease, known as EEE, is now present in Franklin County.

"People who live in Highgate are now considered to be at high risk for EEE, and people in Swanton are at increased risk as well," Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Harry Chen said in a statement. "I strongly recommend that people living in the area take every precaution to avoid bites while mosquitoes are still active -- until the 1st killing frost."

The horse was euthanized on 30 Aug 2013.

The disease is transmitted to humans and some animals by the bite of an infected mosquito. Last year, 2 people who lived in the southern Addison County and northern Rutland County died of EEE.

Chen said it's important to keep taking precautions against mosquitoes until the 1st hard frost, which may not take place for another month in some parts of the state.

The state is monitoring swamps favored by mosquitoes that carry EEE in the Addison-Rutland county areas. There is limited surveillance in Franklin and Chittenden counties, so it's possible that EEE and West Nile virus are present in other parts of the state.

State health officials have confirmed a case of mosquito-borne Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in Tyngsborough, the 3rd case in a horse this year [2013].

The health department said Wednesday [4 Sep 2013] it is raising the mosquito threat level to "critical" in the north central Massachusetts community. Nearby Chelmsford, Dracut, Dunstable, Groton, Lowell, and Westford have been raised to "moderate" risk.

Belchertown in western Massachusetts has already been "critical" after EEE was found in 2 horses there, and nearby Amherst is rated "high." Several southeastern Massachusetts communities are considered at "high" risk. Areas rated "critical" or "high" are urged to cancel outdoor events in the evening when mosquitoes are most active.

A Weymouth woman in her 80s who died last month [August 2013] is the only confirmed human EEE case this year. There were 7 last year [2012].

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito borne viral disease of all equine species such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders.

Clinical signs in EEE-infected equines may include one or more of the following signs: fever; depression; anorexia (loss of appetite, not eating); weakness; central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing, "sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions); irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers; blindness; excitability; abnormal sensitivity to light and sound; in some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal [or bird] and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

There are fly and mosquito sprays for horses that are helpful in repelling the mosquitoes. However, the most effective prevention is vaccination. Vaccination usually comes in a combination vaccine for other viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Vaccination is usually required to be repeated in 2-4 weeks for effective immunity. EEE immunity wanes rapidly, and animals should be revaccinated approximately every 4-6 months depending upon location.

It should be emphasized that humans may contract this disease but only from mosquitoes. Equine owners cannot get the disease from their equine companions.
