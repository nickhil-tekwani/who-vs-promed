INFECTION CONTROL - KANSAS/MISSOURI, USA
========================================
Date: Thu, 06 Jun 96 11:21:00 CDT
From: "Olson, Lloyd, MD" <lolson@cmh.edu>

I am a member of the Infection Control Team of The Children's Mercy
Hosptial, the children's hospital with serves the Kansas City metropolitan
area. The Kansas City metro area combines both Kansas and Missouri sides;
the hospital is actually located on the Missouri side of the state line.
As you know, some of my fellow infectious disease specialists have
expressed an opinion that antibiotic resistant organisms represent the
biggest threat to human health in the coming decade. Specifically:
1) multiple drug resistant tuberculosis which has emerged in the past year or
so -- strains of _M. tuberculosis_ which are resistant to virtually all
available
antibiotics;
2) organisms which you have already heard about, such as gram
negative enteric organisms resistant to many antibiotics;
3) strains of enterococci resistant to most antibiotics except vancomycin;
4) growing resistance of _S. pneumoniae_ to commonly available antibiotics.
This
particular problem has grown in our area from less than 1% penicillin
resistant in
1992 to 42% of strains isolated from usually sterile sites being resistant
to penicillin in the past 6 months. Many such strains are showing
increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and macrolides (70%
are resistant to erythromycin), also;
5) the ever present threat of
methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_, again resistant to all available
antibiotics except vancomycin. We have even had one strain of _S. aureus_
which caused endocarditis which was resistant/tolerant to vancomycin.
The major factor responsible for resistance as we see it is the
inappropriate use of antibiotics in the general community.
I find items from ProMed of considerable interest and commend your efforts.
