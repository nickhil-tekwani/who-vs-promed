An outbreak of equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV1) has been reported in Tasmania.

The recent outbreak of the strain, which can trigger abortions and
cause neurological signs, involved a herd of homebred mares in which
more than 30 percent were affected. One death and several abortions
resulted. EHV1 is thought to be uncommon in the Tasmanian horse
population, although abortions that are highly suspicious of EHV1 are
regularly reported in mares introduced from the mainland.

EHV1 can be excreted by previously infected horses when they are
stressed by the likes of transport or entering a new group.

The Australian Horse Industry Council said care must be taken to keep
introduced horses isolated from pregnant mares. "This includes not
sharing water troughs, feed bins and other gear and not permitting
over-the-fence contact," it said.

EHV1 can be easily spread by contact with aborted foetuses and
associated materials, so cleaning up after an abortion is a priority.
Vaccination is available to aid in the control of EHV1 abortion, but
a vaccine alone will not prevent them.

"Your veterinarian should be consulted as a matter of urgency if you
suspect EHV1 infection on your property so a management plan can be
initiated as soon as possible to limit losses."

EHV1 is a notifiable disease in Australia.

[Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4.

The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are
determined by immune status and horse population. In individual
horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune
status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant
mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion.

Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or subclinical
infection with EHV-1. A clinical sequela of EHV-1 infection is
development of neurologic disease. The natural reservoir of both
EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent infections and carrier states
occur with both virus types. Transmission occurs by direct or
indirect contact with infectious nasal secretions, aborted fetuses,
placentas, or placental fluids.

The incubation period of EHV is 2-10 days. Susceptible horses develop
fever of 102-107F (38.9-41.7C), neutropenia and lymphopenia, serous
nasal discharge, malaise, pharyngitis, cough, inappetence, and/or
submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. Horses infected
with EHV-1 strains often develop a diphasic fever, with
cell-associated viremia coinciding with the 2nd temperature peak.
Secondary bacterial infections are common and manifest with
mucopurulent nasal exudate and pulmonary disease. The infection is
mild or inapparent in horses immunologically sensitized to the virus.

Mares that abort after EHV-1 infection seldom display premonitory
signs. Abortions occur 2-12 weeks after infection, usually between
month 7 and 11 of gestation. Aborted fetuses are fresh or minimally
autolyzed, and the placenta is expelled shortly after abortion. There
is no evidence of damage to the mare's reproductive tract, and
subsequent conception is unimpaired. Mares exposed late in gestation
may not abort, but give birth to live foals with fulminating viral
pneumonitis. Such foals are susceptible to secondary bacterial
infections and usually die within hours or days.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in
neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination and
posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss
of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in
the perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis
may progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity
of signs and the period of recumbency. Neurologic disease associated
with EHV-1 is thought to occur more commonly in mares after abortion
storms, but it has been reported in barren mares, stallions,
geldings, and foals after an outbreak of EHV-1 respiratory infection.

There is no specific treatment for EHV infection. Rest and nursing
care are indicated to minimize secondary bacterial complications.
Antipyretics are recommended for horses with a fever greater than
104F (40C). Antibiotic therapy is instituted upon suspicion of
secondary bacterial infection evidenced by purulent nasal discharge
or pulmonary disease. Most foals infected prenatally with EHV-1
succumb shortly after birth despite intensive nursing and
antimicrobial medication. If horses with EHV-1-associated neurologic
disease remain ambulatory, or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the
prognosis is usually favorable. Intensive nursing care is necessary
to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel
atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have
neurologic sequelae.

Some veterinary texts may argue that the neurological sequela to
EHV-1 is an occasional or rare occurrence. In the USA especially and
some other locations in the world, it appears the strains have
evolved to where this is the norm rather than the exception.

For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases,
management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New
horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated
for 3-4 weeks before commingling with resident horses, especially
pregnant mares. Management-related stress-inducing circumstances
should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant
mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings,
yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory
disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and
appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises.
No horse should leave the premises for 3 weeks after recovery of the
last clinical case.

Parenterally administered modified live vaccines are licensed in some
countries but banned in others. An inactivated vaccine is the only
product currently recommended by the manufacturer as an aid in
prevention of EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during
moths 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Humoral immunity induced by
vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 generally persists for only 2-4
months. Antigenic variation within each virus type means that
available vaccines do not cover all strains to which horses can be
exposed. Vaccination should begin when foals are 3-4 months old and,
depending on the vaccine used, a 2nd dose given 4-8 weeks later.
Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 3-6 months
through maturity. Vaccination programs against EHV-1 should include
all horses on the premises.

Just a little over a month ago Tasmania was warned to be on the look
out for EHV-1. While 30 percent is a fairly high rate to have mares
affected, it is not uncommon in barns and stables for this virus to
sweep through and affect more than 30 percent.
