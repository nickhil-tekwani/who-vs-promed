New cases of polio surface: WHO
-------------------------------
A child in Balochistan contracted the virus after his parents reportedly refused campaigns.

At least 2 children were diagnosed with polio on Friday [19 Oct 012], the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported.

A 38-month-old [male child] resident of village of Killi Lawara from UC [Union Council] Danasar, district Sherani [was diagnosed with polio in Balochistan]. The boy apparently missed immunisation because his parents reportedly refused all campaigns owing to religious issues.

A 2nd child -- [a 26-month-old female child resident of village Batlasai Wand, UC Kotha Tehsil Topi] was diagnosed with type one polio in Swabi.

This brings the total number of cases in the country to 47.

[The continued spreading of rumors under the guise of religious objections in the 3 remaining countries endemic for polio (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria) remains a major obstacle for polio eradication efforts in these countries. It is unfortunate that there are power seeking individuals and groups that are manipulating uneducated populations into sacrificing their children in their pursuit of power. There are small pockets of religious sects around the world that do not accept vaccinations based on their beliefs, but many of these groups have accepted polio vaccine during the eradication efforts and during campaigns initiated during polio epidemics, and transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) has been interrupted in these areas.

For a map of Pakistan showing administrative divisions, see http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html.

UC Kotha Tehsil Topi, Swabi district is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It borders with Afghanistan to its northwest, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to its west and south, Gilgit-Baltistan to its northeast, Azad Kashmir to its east and Punjab and the Islamabad Capital Territory to its southeast. There are 2 Afghani refugee camps located in the district. For an interesting discussion on Swabi district, its population and a map showing its location bordering on Punjab province, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabi_District.

Balochistan can be seen bordering with Afghanistan. Sherani is located in the northeast of the Balochistan plateau and is surrounded on all sides by mountains. For a very interesting discussion on the tribal cultures in this district, as well as a map showing the location of the district, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherani_District.

Pakistan polio drive hit by ban
-------------------------------
Gunmen have killed a member of a polio vaccination team in the western Pakistani city of Quetta [Balochistan].

The team were administering polio drops to under-5s on the city outskirts when attackers on a motorcycle opened fire.

One worker was fatally injured and died on the way to hospital. It is not clear who the gunmen were.

The Taliban have issued threats against the polio drive in Pakistan, where polio is still endemic.

In July [2012] a doctor who was administering polio vaccines was shot dead in the southern city of Karachi.

Officials say the vaccination programme has been suspended in several areas of Quetta following Tuesday's [16 Oct 2012] shooting.

"We are investigating if the dead man had any dispute with the attackers or the shooting was carried out by opponents of the campaign," a senior local official, Tariq Mengal, told AFP news agency.

There has been opposition to such immunisation drives in parts of Pakistan, particularly after a fake CIA vaccination campaign helped to locate Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

Militants have kidnapped and killed foreign NGO [non-governmental organization] workers in the past in an attempt to halt the immunisation drives which they say are part of efforts to spy on them.

Pakistan is one of only 3 remaining countries where polio is still endemic. The others are Afghanistan and Nigeria.

Killing polio workers
---------------------
Polio eradication has come a long way, according to President Asif Ali Zardari. However, on [16 Oct 2012], a worker from a team of polio vaccinators was killed in Quetta [Balochistan], after the team came under attack by motorcyclists armed with guns. The attack came one day after the president launched a 3-day polio vaccination campaign on [15 Oct 2012]. While expressing his contentment with progress on the issue, the president said he regretted the fact that the disease is still prevalent in Pakistan, while neighbouring India is now polio free. Though Pakistan and China signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in polio vaccine manufacturing, the fight to overcome polio in the country is impeded by other obstacles.

In efforts to carry out widespread polio vaccination campaigns, workers remain threatened in areas like Fata and parts of Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where militants have warned parents not to allow their children to be vaccinated. Polio has resurfaced in the areas but the fight to eliminate it there still remains difficult. While the president said that we cannot allow extremists from stopping vaccinations, it remains to be seen how this can be achieved. Unless the state provides adequate security to health personnel, we will lose our precious doctors, health care workers and volunteers, who the country so desperately needs.

Furthermore, people need to be educated about the seriousness of the condition. In one example, a woman working as a maid reported that her only son, out of 5 children, got a fever after receiving the polio vaccination. Out of fear that the fever was life-threatening, she discontinued his vaccination failing to understand the seriousness of the consequences. Despite recent monetary donations by the Islamic Development Bank and by the World Bank and Japan, unless there is a proper security plan in place, polio will prevail. Now that the gravity of the situation has been recognised by the president, the next step is to implement security measures, perhaps by involving the military. Additionally, we must also spread awareness and educate the public on what the ramifications are if children are left unvaccinated.

[The 2 preceding newswires ([2], [3]) highlight the seriousness of the challenges faced by the polio eradication effort in Pakistan. When health care workers providing vaccinations are now targets of violence by groups seeking to control areas through power struggles with the government rather than viewed as providers of helpful preventive measures and assisted by the local populations in carrying out their missions, it is a sad addition to the challenges faced by the public health sector. With the risk of sounding melodramatic here, this moderator views these actions as "crimes against humanity" and wishes the world courts would intervene against the perpetrators of these acts -- both the individuals carrying out these acts as well as the individuals sponsoring these acts. - Mod.MPP]

Afghanistan
- 4 new cases were reported in the past week. All cases were type WPV1. These cases occurred in Kandahar, Khost, Kunar, and Paktya provinces. This brings the total number of cases for 2012 to 25. The most recent case was the one in Paktya Province, with onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2012].

Nigeria
- 4 new cases were reported in the past week. All were type WPV1. The cases occurred in Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, and Sokoto states. The most recent case was the one from Kaduna State, with onset of paralysis on [22 Sep 2012]. The total number of cases for 2012 is 97.

Pakistan
- One new case of WPV was reported in the past week, WPV1 in the Bajour District of Federally Administrated Tribal Areas. This brings the total number of cases for 2012 to 44. This was the most recent case, with onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2012].

- National immunization Days were held during [15-17 Oct 2012], excluding North and South Waziristan. In Quetta, Balochistan, investigations have begun into the fatal shooting of a volunteer vaccinator. Apart from parts of Quetta, the campaign continued in the rest of the province.

- 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in Quetta and Pishin districts of Balochistan province, the 1st 2 detected cVDPV2s in Pakistan. Campaigns are taking place with trivalent OPV.

Angola
- No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The country reported a total of 5 cases in 2011, and the last case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2011] in Uige in the country's north.

Chad
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The most recently reported case occurred in the Lac region (WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012]. The total number of cases for 2012 remains five.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- No new cases were reported in the past week. No wild poliovirus cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 is 93 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2011] in Maniema province.

- Although the country has not reported a WPV case since December 2011, it has been affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Katanga province in 2012, with 17 cases reported (most recent case: [4 Apr 2012]). Efforts are focused on ensuring the cVDPV2 is fully stopped.

Horn of Africa
- Following recent confirmation of 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2 (cVDPV2) cases in a Somali refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya and one cVDPV2 case in Kismayo, south-central Somalia, linked to last year's cVDPV2 in south-central Somalia, an immunization response is currently being planned. More than 800 000 children in eastern Kenya will be targeted, including in the Dadaab refugee camps (target age groups in the camps will be less than 15 years).

- Serious problems remain to access children in south-central Somalia; however, a response campaign will be launched targeting 30 000 children in 2 recently-accessible Somali districts adjacent to the Kenya border. Options to extend the response immunization activity in Somalia are being considered.

- 2 cVDPV3s have been detected in Alhudaidah and Hajjah provinces in Yemen with dates of onset of [27 Apr 2012 and 24 Aug 2012] respectively. Response activities with trivalent OPV are being planned.

West Africa
No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of cases for 2011 in West Africa remains 51 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 5 from Niger). The most recent case from the region (WPV1 from Niger) had onset of paralysis on [22 Dec 2011].

[In addition to the continued transmission of WPV in the 3 remaining polio endemic countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria), it appears as though there are increases in the countries in which circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) are being identified. In the above report there is mention of the 1st 2 cVDPV associated polio cases in Balochistan province Pakistan (type 2 cVDPV), 3 cases cVDPV2 in a Somali refugee camp in Kenya, and 2 cases of cVDPV3 in Yemen -- all countries presenting with cVDPV polio cases for the 1st time this year. For a good overview of the global situation with confirmed cVDPV polio by year, country and type of cVDPV identified, see the table at
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx. It is important to note that the data presented in this table represent cases where "Circulating Vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is associated with 2 or more cases of AFP." Hence, sporadic/isolated cases of polio in which VDPVs are identified are not represented in this table.
