Viet Nam: No Confirmation of Reported New Human Cases of Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------
The Vietnamese authorities have not provided the World Health Organization
with any information about 6 reported new human cases of avian influenza in
that country, the director of the WHO's influenza branch said Wed 15 Jun
2005. Dr. Klaus Stohr warned that unless the WHO receives case information
on a more rapid basis, hopes of trying to extinguish an emerging pandemic
at source will be jeopardized.
"We want to use this window of opportunity for early intervention
.....(but) we have to start moving when the window is opening and not when
it's closing," Stohr said from Geneva, adding that he world would have
perhaps 20 to 30 days in which to launch a full-scale response.
Biostatisticians have been developing mathematical models to try to assess
whether it would be feasible to stop an emerging pandemic in Southeast
Asia, using a combination of the antiviral drug oseltamivir and strict
quarantine. The models, expected to be published in scientific journals
within weeks, suggest it might be possible, Stohr said, calling the need to
at least try to avert an emerging pandemic "a moral obligation."
One of the models was produced by Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics
at Emory University in Atlanta. With his work under consideration by a
journal, Longini wouldn't reveal many details of his findings. But he said
the work suggests there might be a chance of averting disaster if all the
right conditions are met. Those conditions include a sputtering start in a
rural setting, with a virus that doesn't transmit well in the first few
generations of cases. "In a rural area, you could intervene within say 3
weeks of the 1st symptomatic case. At that point, containment is still
possible," Longini said. But both he and Stohr stressed the plan could only
work if the world moves quickly.
And the recent lengthy delays between the 1st media reports of human cases
of H5N1 influenza and official confirmation from the Vietnamese government
do not bode well for an early intervention strategy. For instance, despite
media reports of 6 "newly detected" human cases being treated in Hanoi
hospitals -- and word that a doctor treating the patients might also have
become infected -- authorities in Vietnam were silent Wed 15 Jun 2005. WHO
staff in the country attempted to speak with Ministry of Health officials
about the reports but were not successful, Stohr said.
"If the objective is to attempt at eliminating the virus at its source, as
the models say is possible, then we have to consider the conditions under
which that would be feasible," he noted. "And the conditions would be
that one would not only have to reach a relatively large proportion of
people in a given area but also to move fast."
