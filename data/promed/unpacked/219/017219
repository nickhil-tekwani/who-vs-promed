--------------------
Information received on 28 Dec 2016 from Dr Malek Zrelli, Directeur General, Direction Generale des Services Veterinaires, Ministere de l'Agriculture, Tunis, Tunisia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 1 Nov 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 13 Dec 2016
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: bluetongue virus
Serotype: 3
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Beni khalled, Hannous, Nabeul
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Nov 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)

Epidemiological unit: farm

Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 8 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats 7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 46 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: This is a Barbarine ewe over 3 years old. It showed dejection, fever, loss of weight, salivation, facial and submandibular oedema, nasal discharge, tachycardia and dyspnoea.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0 / 0 / - / 0
Goats / 0 / 0 / - / 0
Sheep / 2.17 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis shows that the isolated strain probably comes from Africa.

Epidemiological comment: There are wet areas around the farm. Climatic conditions before incubation were favorable for the vector's activity (_Culicoides_). But now the climate is not favorable to its spread. The 2 farms neighboring the outbreak were sprayed with an insecticide.

Control measures:
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestations; dipping/spraying; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (Symptomatic treatment with spraying)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tunisia Veterinary Research Institute (National laboratory) / Sheep / real-time PCR / 13 Dec 2016 / Positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Abruzzo and Molise "G. Caporale" (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Sheep / nucleotide sequencing / 21 Dec 2016 / Positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Abruzzo and Molise "G. Caporale" (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Sheep / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 21 Dec 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.1.3 "Bluetongue (Infection with Bluetongue virus) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.03_BLUETONGUE.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted

"Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope and various other Artiodactyla as vertebrate hosts.

BTV is a member of the Orbivirus genus of the family Reoviridae, one of the 22 recognised species or serogroups in the genus. The BTV species, or serogroup, contains 26 recognised serotypes.

Clinical signs of disease in sheep vary markedly in severity, influenced by the type or strain of the infecting virus, husbandry factors, as well as by breed. In severe cases, there is an acute febrile response characterised by hyperaemia and congestion, leading to oedema of the face, eyelids and ears, and haemorrhages and erosions of the mucous membranes. The tongue may show intense hyperaemia and become oedematous, protrude from the mouth and, in severe cases become cyanotic. Hyperaemia may extend to other parts of the body, particularly the coronary band of the hoof, the groin, axilla and perineum. There is often severe muscle degeneration. Breaks in the wool may occur associated with pathology in the follicles. A reluctance to move is common, and torticollis may occur in severe cases. In fatal cases, the lungs may show interalveolar hyperaemia, severe alveolar oedema and the bronchial tree may be filled with froth. The thoracic cavity and pericardial sac may contain varying quantities of plasma-like fluid. Most cases show a distinctive haemorrhage near the base of the pulmonary artery.

BTV is not known to cause disease in humans under any conditions."
