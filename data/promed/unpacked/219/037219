During the Chinese New Year, there was a sudden outbreak of swine 5th
disease, causing pigs to die. Some industry experts forecast that the
current outbreak will continue.

This outbreak is primarily 5th disease (Class 1 Disease, actually
FMD) [The said comment in brackets appears in the original Chinese
text. - Mod.AS]. The disease does not have high mortality among large
and mid-size hogs but can cause deaths among piglets. Owing to [the
lack of] information released nationally, we still do not know the
exact extent of the outbreak. But from what we understand, the
outbreak covers a relatively large area, including Sichuan, Henan and
other large swine producing provinces, and is not limited to backyard
farms. Since mortality from this disease is not high, a large number
of hogs are sent for slaughter, and the short-term expansion of
supply puts downward pressure on hog prices (information from the
Ministry of Commerce price forecasting and alert system shows that
the total number of hogs sent for slaughter among 1000 pig producers
in January 2010 was 14.56 percent higher than December 2009. Looking
regionally, in the key production areas of Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang
and Henan, the volume of hogs sent for slaughter increased 42.47,
32.45, 22.74, and 17.51 percent, respectively).

Also, the price of piglets fell to 15.83 yuan [USD 2.32]/kg; stocks
are remaining lower among most breeders due to their worry over
potential outbreaks and losses.

[We are grateful to Dan Silver for his efforts in screening the local
agro-business Chinese press and translating the above items. More
information on the spread of the so-called "5th disease" among pigs,
apparently said to be FMD (probably of the serotype O, which
reportedly affected porcine and bovine) is anticipated, as well as
about the disease situation in small ruminants (sheep and goats).

Could somebody explain the background to the "5th" terminology?

According to China's reports to the OIE, FMDV serotype O has been
reported, during 2010, from the provinces Guandong, Gansu, Shanxi and
Jiancxi (summary and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>).

Information is requested on the 2010 situation in other territories,
such as the ones mentioned in the above newswires, namely "Sichuan,
Henan and other large swine producing provinces." - Mod.AS]
