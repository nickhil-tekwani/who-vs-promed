Venezuela: equine case of EEEV infection in Yaracauy State
----------------------------------------------------------
The Animal Health Service, Ministry of Agriculture, has reported a case of
central nervous system (CNS) disease in an equine from Yaracauy state,
district Bol√≠var, as positive for eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV]
(serology) [in the 12th epidemiologic week 21-27 Mar 2004].
Another suspected case [reported in the 6th epidemiologic week 8-14 Feb
2004 from the state of Barinas] was negative for EEEV and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus.
Ministries of Health and Agriculture suggested that regional health
authorities increase epidemiological surveillance (serology and entomology).

[Eastern (EEEV), Western (WEEV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV)
viruses are mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses that cause severe
neurological disease in humans and equines, although infection often may be
sub-clinical or mild.
Progressive systemic disease and death with limited neurological
manifestation is commonest in VEEV infection. Neurological disease is most
severe in EEEV infections. In horses the case fatality rate may reach 50 to
90 per cent. Humans and equines are considered to be dead-end hosts for
EEEV; the virus being maintained by several mosquito vectors through
complex endemic and epidemic cycles in wild animals and birds. EEEV is
endemic in coastal regions of North America, throughout the Caribbean and
Central America, and along the north eastern coast of South America. EEEV
was first isolated in Venezuela from sentinel hamsters in 1973. - Mod.CP]
