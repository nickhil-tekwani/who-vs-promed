Egypt saw a new focus of malaria a month ago [May 2014]. All information referred to cases imported to Aswan, which borders Sudan. However, the Egyptian ministry of health identified 21 cases which harbor the malaria parasite. The results revealed the presence of 21 cases positive for malaria in El-Sheikh Mostafa, and El Adwa villages, Edfu, Aswan. Two species were identified as responsible for the malaria cases identified: _P. vivax_ (20 cases), and _P. falciparum_ (one case).

Mosquito surveillance revealed the presence of _Anopheles sergenti_ in the areas sampled. The presence of _A. sergenti_ was 1st reported in Aswan by Cope et al in 1995, who collected the species from the same areas. With this situation, Egypt must pay attention and keep tracking the disease in the future to avoid outbreaks that may be expected to emerge at any time, especially with the issue of global [climate?] change.

[ProMED-mail thanks Abdallah Samy for these comments.

Without further information, it must be assumed that the cases are transmitted locally. The single _P. falciparum_ case is difficult to understand, but there are 3 possibilities: 1. The case is imported; 2. More cases exist but have not been diagnosed, and 3. The diagnosis is wrong.

It is not correct that _A. sergenti_ was 1st described in 1993. _A. sergenti_ and _A. pharoensis_ are the traditional malaria vectors in Egypt according to MacDonald (MacDonald G. The Epidemiology of Malaria. Oxford University Press 1957).

It is very important to know whether _A. gambiae_ has invaded Southern Egypt, as happened in 1942-44. ProMED will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
