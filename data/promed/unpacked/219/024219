ProMED-mail readers may be interested in this message, which has been
discussed
within TropNetEurop today.
At our outpatient department we have recently seen a following
patient:
Male, 29y, German national, travelled for 20 days in Thailand (whole
country including jungle areas in the North), return on 15 Nov 2001,
first symptoms on 17 Nov 2001: fever (up to 39.9 degrees C, massive
headache and myalgia). First presentation on 20 Nov. 2001.Clinical
examination was normal, malaria smear repeatedly negative, moderate
leukocytosis, CRP, creatinine and liver enzymes elevated,
macrohematuria. Ultrasound of abdomen showed splenomegaly. Serological
tests for leptospirosis were initially negative but became highly
positive during further clinical course. Full recovery under
[treatment with ciprofloxacine plus ampicillin.
The patient did no rafting, nor did he swim in fresh water, [but he
hiked in jungle areas of North Thailand and did some wading in rivers
there.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution,
caused by the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_ . Transmission is
via contact with water or soil contaminated with urine from infected
animals/rodents. According to GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease
Network: <http://www.cyinfo.com/>), _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar.
bataviae predominates in Bangkok, and serovar. autumnalis in rural
areas. Serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and javanica are also encountered.
Clinical presentation can include a febrile syndrome with asceptic
meningitis, nephritis, hepatitis, myositis, and conjunctivitis. Case
fatality rates of 5 to 40 percent have been reported. Disease rates
increase during the rainy season as a result of wading through
contaminated water.
Reported disease rates per 100 000 were 0.3 during the period 1982 to
1995; 3.3
in 1997 (16 in Nakhornratchasrima Province). Rates in the
northeastern region
were 0.30 in 1995; 3.9 in 1998. There were 270 cases reported in
1988. 776
patients were hospitalized for leptospirosis in 1992. 2349 cases
(111 fatal)
were reported in 1997; 2229 (102 fatal) in 1998 -- including several
hundred cases
(22 fatal) in the area of Prae and Surin provinces. These data (from
GIDEON) are
suggestive of increased reporting and may not reflect a true increase
in disease,
but rather improvements in disease reporting throughout the country.
In a prior ProMED-mail posting on leptospirosis in Thailand in 1998
(Leptospirosis: Rapid tests 19981216.2381), Dr. Henk Smits
<H.Smits@kit.nl>
provided an interesting comment relevant to this current report:
"Finally,
contrary to an opinion [in a prior ProMED-mail posting that
leptospirosis is
episodic in Thailand and should pose no threat to tourists, I would
like to
mention that we have had several cases of tourists who contracted
leptospirosis
while traveling in tropical countries including Thailand. For this I
refer to
the paper by Crevel et al. "Leptospirosis in travelers" published in
Clin. Inf.
Dis, 19, 1994, 132-134." The case reported in today's posting is a
good example
of this observation. As prior outbreak reports in Thailand have also
occurred
during October and November, this period probably coincides with
increased
surface water during and following a rainy season. Hiking upcountry
in the
jungle areas during the rainy season would classify as high risk for
exposure to
leptospirosis. Information on this year's reported incidence of
leptospirosis in
Thailand would be of interest. - Mod.MPP
