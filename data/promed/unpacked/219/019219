The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has coordinated an investigation to trace food items connected with a multinational outbreak of hepatitis A. Since January 2013, more than 1440 hepatitis A cases have been reported in 12 European countries, with 331 cases confirmed by genotyping.

Laboratory testing of food items and interviews with affected people identified consumption of mixed frozen berries as the source of the outbreak. Bulgarian blackberries and Polish red currants have been identified as the most common ingredient in the contaminated lots and in the food consumed by affected people. No single point source of contamination could be identified, but 12 food operators were identified that were linked to cases and lots in 5 of the affected countries. Further investigations at the local level are needed to identify where the suspect berries were harvested and the conditions at these harvest or production sites.

In May 2013, Germany reported cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype IA infection in persons with a travel history, and Italy reported a national increase in the number of HAV cases and declared an outbreak. Confirmed cases (outbreak strain KF182323) have been reported in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (331 in total). HAV contamination was detected in frozen mixed berries (14 lots) and mixed berry cakes/pastries (2 lots) in Italy, France and Norway. In Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden, analysis of food histories and questionnaires identified suspect berries and berry products consumed by confirmed cases. Tracing began with 38 lots/cases from Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands; an additional 5 lots/cases were added from France, Norway and Sweden in spring 2014.

The tracing data were exchanged via the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. The final dataset comprises 6227 transactions among 1974 food operators. Bulgarian blackberries and Polish red currants were the most common ingredients in the traced lots/cases; however, Poland is the largest producer of red currants in Europe, and Bulgaria is a major exporter of frozen blackberries. No single point source of contamination linking all 43 lots/cases could be identified. HAV cases/lots in 5 countries could be linked to 7 Polish freezing processors and/or to 5 frozen berry suppliers in Bulgaria. This indicates that HAV contamination could be occurring at the freezing processor or in primary production of berries, and, therefore, compliance with Good Hygiene Practice, Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Agricultural Practice is recommended for countries producing berries for freezing. It is possible that contaminated product related to this outbreak could still be circulating in the food chain. Hence, for the public health domain, enhanced surveillance, risk communication, vaccination and further research are recommended.

Further investigations at the local level are needed to identify from where the suspect berries were harvested and the conditions at these harvest or production sites.

As contaminated berries could still be circulating in the food chain, EFSA re-emphasises the need for enhanced surveillance, risk communication, vaccination and further research in the area of public health. EFSA also recommends good hygiene, manufacturing and agricultural practices in berry producing countries.

The working group was composed of microbiologists, public health and food safety experts from France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden, specialists on tracing analysis from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and experts on food-borne outbreak investigations from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

This scientific report follows several Rapid Outbreak Assessments on the status of hepatitis A published by EFSA and ECDC:

[This has been a difficult outbreak to evaluate, and it may well be still ongoing.

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by faecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

In developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions, prior to the availability of the hepatitis A vaccine, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups, and [because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic] higher disease rates and large foodborne outbreaks may occur. - Mod.LL
