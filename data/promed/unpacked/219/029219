Chikunguya [virus] has attacked between 10 and 20 residents in RT 02,
Banjar Yeh Sumbul, Yeh Sumbul, Mendoyo over the past 2 weeks. Most
residents claimed that they did not know the cause and regarded it only as
a normal fever. Symptoms occurred in residents in several households.

Affected individuals reported fever and pain, especially of the hands and
feet, characteristic of chikungunya [virus infection]. An official from the
Kesehatan Service of the Jembrana Regency reported last Wednesday (16 Jul
[2008]) [of positive confirmation for chikungunya virus inection] and
afterwards did fogging the same day.

Jamhuri, the chairman (mayor) of RT 02 said that the conditions between
adjacent houses in the complex enabled mosquitoes to breed in this
settlement. He was also confused, asking how come now chikungunya [was
being transmitted] because, in fact, they always were routinely given abate
and cleaned the environment, he said. [Abate is a larvacide often used to
control _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito breeding in water catchments in and
immediately around houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY] He indicated that
in his area about 24 residents had experienced [chikungunya virus
infection] symptoms, but had partly recovered.

[A chikungunya outbreak has been reported in Java, Indonesia, earlier this
year (see ProMED post no. 20080528.1733 of 28 May 2008). Now there is a
newly-recognized focus with this current report from Bali. Since Bali is a
major tourist destination, if the outbreak intensifies, it could have a
negative impact on tourism.
