California: first human case of West Nile virus infection probably imported
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Alameda County woman is the first Californian to test positive this year
for the West Nile virus, but health officials said on Thu 14 Aug 2003 that
they believe she picked up the virus on a recent trip to Colorado, where
the disease has hit hard.
There is no evidence yet that infected mosquitoes or birds have turned up
in California, but health officials say it is just a matter of time since
infected mosquitoes have moved steadily west ever since they first showed
up in New York City in 1999. With the peak season for West Nile disease now
under way, federal health officials announced Thursday that the number of
cases nationwide doubled over the past week, to nearly 400. Last year, the
virus infected 4156 Americans and killed 284. Recently, Arizona officials
said they detected the virus in a mosquito pool there, leaving only Oregon,
Nevada, and Utah as states that have yet to detect it in either humans or
animals.
"I think people have no cause for concern at this time, but we should keep
in mind that West Nile has been making a steady push across the country,
and it will eventually end up in California, if not this summer, then
certainly next year," said Dr Anthony Iton, a health officer for Alameda
County. The 47 year old Alameda County woman is in hospital with severe
muscle weakness in her legs, according to state and county health
officials. An outdoor sports enthusiast, the woman reported being bitten by
mosquitoes in late July while traveling in north eastern Colorado, which
health officials describe as a West Nile "hot spot." On Thursday, Colorado
officials reported a sixth death due to West Nile, and a total of nearly
200 cases statewide so far this year. The woman returned from Colorado 26
July. Her symptoms first struck on 30 July and she was admitted to hospital
on 7 August, but it wasn't until Thursday that California health officials
said they had enough laboratory proof to announce the case.
It remains classified as "probable" until more sophisticated tests can be
run to confirm it, which will take another week or two, according to Lea
Brooks, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Health Services. The
woman is in a stable condition and is expected to recover.
A Los Angeles County woman who recovered last year was the state's first
case. But because no animals in the state have yet tested positive, health
officials believe she may have been infected by a mosquito that caught a
ride on a plane or in a car, rather than arriving through natural migration.

[The origin of the previous human case of West Nile virus infection in
California (in 2002) was not determined, whereas in the present case there
is a clear history of travel to area of high risk. There is no confirmation
yet that West Nile virus has penetrated as far west as California. - Mod.CP]
