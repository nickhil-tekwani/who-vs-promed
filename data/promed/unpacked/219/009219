Bees (hives) / 51 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 13.73 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: the reported outbreaks follow findings during active surveillance carried out every year by AGROCALIDAD [Ecuadorian Agency for Agro Quality Assurance] in order to detect the presence and/or absence of bee diseases. The outbreaks were monitored according to the guidelines established in the Procedure Manual for bee diseases of the National Beekeeping Programme. Active surveillance will go on. These 3 findings are located in 3 different provinces.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/ disinfestation; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Laboratory of the Directorate for Animal Diagnosis/AGROCALIDAD (national laboratory) / Bees / bacteriological examination / 1 Jun 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["American foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval stage of the honey bee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp, and occurs throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus larvae_, the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The bacterium is a round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which varies greatly in size (0.5 microns wide by 1.5 to 6 microns long), occurring singly and in chains and filaments; some strains are motile. The sporangia are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal, central to subterminal spores, which may swell the sporangia, are often found free. The spores are extremely heat stable and resistant to chemical agents. Only spores are capable of inducing the disease." See the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.2 on AFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

"The causal organism of European foulbrood (EFB) of honey bees is the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_. The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable organism. Recurrences of disease can therefore be expected in subsequent years." For additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.3 on EFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.03_EUROPEAN_FOULB.pdf.

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to infection of honey bees with _Paenibacillus larvae_ (American foulbrood) and _Melissococcus plutonius_ (European foulbrood) are spelled out in chapter 9.2 and chapter 9.3 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, respectively. The chapters are available at, http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_paenibacillus_larvae.htm and http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_melissococcus_plutonius.htm respectively.

The fact that these 2 diseases of bees were detected demonstrates the importance the bee industry in Ecuador has given to surveillance. The country has developed a good active surveillance program to monitor for certain diseases affecting bees.
