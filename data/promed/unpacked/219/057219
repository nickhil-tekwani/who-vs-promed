- 1 new probable case in Butembo (deaths having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case but which could not be tested in the laboratory before burial).
- 5 new confirmed deaths, including 4 community deaths: 3 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo. One death reported at the ETC of Beni.
- 3 new recovered people, including 2 discharges from the ETC of Butembo and 1 from the ETC of Mabalako.

News of the response
Evolution of the epidemic
------------------------
We see a positive evolution of the epidemic in Beni, which is at its 12th day without a new confirmed case. However, because of the high mobility of the population, there is a risk of importing cases from neighboring health areas, including Mabalako, Butembo, Katwa and Oicha. It was the importation of cases from Beni that caused the resurgence of the epidemic in the health zone of Mabalako after 7 weeks without new confirmed cases.

Vaccination
-------------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 59 453 people have been vaccinated.

- 14 Jan 2019. Uganda: WHO orders for mandatory Ebola screening at Entebbe airport
[AllAfrica, edited]
https://www.observer.ug/news/headlines/59640-who-orders-for-mandatory-ebola-screening-at-entebbe-airport

The World Health Organization (WHO) has ordered mandatory Ebola screening of all passengers entering the country through Entebbe international airport. Initially, airport authorities were screening only passengers returning on flights from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, according to Simon Ebachu, the head of Ebola screening, WHO has instructed that all passengers entering the country to be screened.

The mandatory screening comes at a time when the DRC is struggling to contain an Ebola outbreak that broke out in August 2018 in the North Kivu Province, along the border with Uganda. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health in the DRC, at least 700 people have been infected with the Ebola virus since it broke out. Of those infected, 370 have died.

As part of the mandatory screening, more than 40 health workers have been stationed at the airport to screen all passengers. Ebachu says that the passengers will be screened using an automatic thermal stand that screens people's temperatures as soon as they arrive at the airport. He also indicated that as soon as one is detected, he or she is taken to an isolation centre at Entebbe referral hospital.

Bonny Natukunda, the district health educator, Wakiso district, says that the government is training different Village Health Teams (VHTs) to handle Ebola cases in case they occur in the community. In May [2018], the Ministry of Health reinstated Ebola screening at all border posts.

In the context of the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces of the DRC that was declared on 1 Aug 2018, Uganda, South Sudan and Rwanda as priority one countries based on proximity, insecurity and high population across the border, the Rwandan Ministry of Health, supported by partners, has developed and is implementing an Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness and contingency plan. The objective: strengthen preparedness capacities for the prevention, earlier detection, response and containment of a potential case of EVD in Rwanda.

The plan prioritized 10 districts bordering DRC, Uganda, as well as districts in Kigali city. Several drills and functional exercises have been conducted. The Full SIMEX exercise (FSIMEX) was organized by the Rwandan Ministry of Health and the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) in collaboration with WHO Country Officer, government stakeholders and technical partners.

- Mon 14 Jan 2019. Comment [edited]
Submitted by KM Johnson, MD <microcaddis@gmail.com>

I note that WHO attributes whatever control they have to the current Ebola outbreak to the Canadian ZEBOV live virus vaccine. Why then is the organization not doing the small amount of work needed to gather data that can make efficacy and safety legal everywhere? And if the vaccine is so good quickly, why are workers in new health centers still garbed in expensive restrictive suits to prevent contact with patient bodily fluids? Sure, get valid antibody tests post-vaccination, but then let people treat people sans this extra prevention.

KM Johnson, MD
(named the virus in 1976)

[ProMED thanks Dr. Johnson for his comments, which are always welcome. It is completely true the PPE is cumbersome and restrictive, but I am not sure anyone is ready to risk their lives even more than they already are doing by forgoing wearing a protective suit when in direct contact with patients. The reusable units (Biosecure Emergency Care Unit for Outbreaks [CUBE]) which are cube-shaped mobile units with transparent walls and gloved access, have helped relieve health workers from the PPE to some extent when treating patients. Confirmatory antibody testing of those who are vaccinated should be done whether or not suits are worn, but this may be a challenge to add to the current burden of testing. - Mod.LK]

- 14 Jan 2019. Fighting Ebola is hard. In Congo, fake news makes it harder
[Science, abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/fighting-ebola-hard-congo-fake-news-makes-it-harder
[Byline: Laura Spinney]

The Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is providing a natural experiment in fighting fake news. Occurring in a conflict zone, amid a controversial presidential election, the epidemic has proved to be fertile ground for conspiracy theories and political manipulation, which can hamper efforts to treat patients and fight the virus's spread. Public health workers have mounted an unprecedented effort to counter misinformation, saying the success or failure of the Ebola response may pivot on who controls the narrative.

"I usually tell my teams that we fight 2 outbreaks, Ebola and fear," says Carlos Navarro Colorado of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in New York City. "It is all about information." For the 1st time in an Ebola outbreak, UNICEF and other agencies have joined forces as a single response team, which answers to the DRC's Ministry of Public Health and includes dozens of social scientists, who use the airwaves, social media, and meetings with community and religious leaders to fight misinformation. Responders also foster trust by making their work more transparent -- in some cases literally. A new biosecure tent, called the Biosecure Emergency Care Unit for Outbreaks (CUBE), allows relatives to visit and see Ebola patients during treatment.

Opposition organizations called for the Ebola response to be protected -- which health workers saw as a small but significant victory. "We've managed to get communities to separate in their minds Ebola control from the broader political agenda," says Michael Ryan, who directs the World Health Organization's role in the campaign in Geneva, Switzerland. "That's been really helpful." Ryan hands much of the credit to social scientists working for the various agencies involved in the response. Along with community engagement workers, they make up one-third of the workforce.

Part of their role is to chart the social networks through which the virus spreads, but they also gather information about communities' perceptions, which is entered within days into an online "dashboard" created by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Geneva. The government has also recruited young people to report misinformation circulating on WhatsApp, a major information channel in the DRC, says Jessica Ilunga, a spokesperson for the DRC's Ministry of Public Health in Kinshasa.

As rumors surface, communications experts rebut them with accurate information via WhatsApp or local radio. They take care not to repeat the misinformation; research has shown this is the best way to help the public "forget" false news and reinforce the truth. The vocal support of Ebola survivors has helped as well. Grateful for their care, some have become volunteers at Ebola treatment centers (ETCs).

- 14 Jan 2019. Ebola virus infection associated with transmission from survivors
[Emerg Infect Dis 2019; 25(2), abridged, edited]
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/2/18-1011_article

Den Boon S, Marston BJ, Nyenswah TG, et al. Ebola virus infection associated with transmission from survivors. Emerg Infect Dis 2019 Feb [in press]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2502.181011

Abstract
---------
Ebola virus (EBOV) can persist in immunologically protected body sites in survivors of Ebola virus disease, creating the potential to initiate new chains of transmission. From the outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2016, we identified 13 possible events of viral persistence-derived transmission of EBOV (VPDTe) and applied predefined criteria to classify transmission events based on the strength of evidence for VPDTe and source and route of transmission. For 8 events, a recipient case was identified; possible source cases were identified for 5 of these 8. For 5 events, a recipient case or chain of transmission could not be confidently determined. A total of 5 events met our criteria for sexual transmission (male-to-female). One VPDTe event led to at least 4 generations of cases; transmission was limited after the other events. VPDTe has increased the importance of Ebola survivor services and sustained surveillance and response capacity in regions with previously widespread transmission.

Article extracts
-----------------
Infectious virus has been isolated from semen of Ebola survivors 82 days after symptom onset [11], and EBOV RNA has been detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in semen 531 days after symptom onset [10]. Other body fluids, such as vaginal fluids, breast milk, urine, feces, sweat, and saliva, also have been shown to be RT-PCR-positive for short periods after recovery of the patient [11]. Some evidence indicates that transmission could occur through breast milk [12], but confirmed transmission from viral persistence in the other body fluids has not been described [13]. Before the West Africa EVD outbreak, one case of Marburg disease [14] and one possible case of EVD [15] attributed to sexual transmission had been reported. From the EVD outbreak in West Africa, several incidents of possible sexual transmission of EBOV from EVD survivors have been described in detail [10,16-19], as have viral persistence-derived transmission of EBOV (VPDTe) events for which the mode of transmission was unknown [12,20,21,22].

WHO's interim advice on the sexual transmission of EBOV is that male EVD survivors should continue to practice safer sex (i.e., correct and consistent condom use or abstinence) for at least 12 months after symptom onset or until their semen has twice tested negative [27]. This case series highlights 2 events of VPDTe that occurred more than 1 year after recovery by the source case. This information, along with information about the duration of persistence of EBOV RNA in the semen of survivors and data showing that EBOV RNA can be detected intermittently [7,28], needs to be considered in the development of recommendations for EVD survivors. Furthermore, recommendations on semen testing and safer sex practices, including timely updates if recommendations are revised in light of new evidence, must be clearly communicated to EVD survivors and to the public.
