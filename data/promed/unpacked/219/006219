This Thursday, 21 Jul [2022], The General Directorate of Public Health of the Community of Madrid confirmed a case of monkeypox in a baby of only 7 months who contracted the disease at home. His parents were infected before him, and due to the contagiousness of this virus, he has ended up infected.

The good news is that both the child and his parents are at home, complying with home isolation, and without serious symptoms. Although babies are one of the risk groups for monkeypox, in this case, the disease has not attacked the child virulently and he will be discharged in the coming days.

The Ministry of Health of the Community of Madrid believes that it is an isolated case that has coincided in time and space with the infection of his parents, hence the transmission to the baby occurred during his care.

In total, to date, the Community of Madrid has registered 1577 cases of monkeypox, a high figure that represents more than 35% of all infections in Spain.

Between 2018 and 2021, there had been 7 cases of monkeypox in the UK. Of these, 4 were imported, 2 were cases in household contacts, and 1 was a case in a health care worker involved in the care of an imported case. There was no documented community transmission in previous outbreaks.

Current epidemiological situation as of 18 Jul 2022
---------------------------------------------------
Cases of monkeypox infection were confirmed in England from 6 May 2022. The outbreak has mainly been in gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men without documented history of travel to endemic countries. Further details on the epidemiology are available in the monkeypox technical briefing.

Up to 18 Jul 2022, there were 2137 laboratory confirmed cases in the UK. Of these, 51 were in Scotland, 13 were in Northern Ireland, 23 were in Wales, and 2050 were in England.

Please note that today's increase in case numbers in England since the last report (Table 1) includes positive tests with result dates between 12 and 17 Jul 2022. This is a longer timeframe than is usually reported, so should not be interpreted as a sudden rise in the rate of cases. These were included in externally published surveillance data for the first time on 18 Jul [2022] after an NHS diagnostic laboratory's monkeypox testing was assured. All individuals received their test results at the time.

Table 1: Number of laboratory confirmed cases by UK nation of residence, 6 May to 18 Jul 2022
UK Nation / Confirmed cases / Changes since 14 Jul 2022
England / 2050 / +272
Northern Ireland / 13 / +1
Scotland / 51 / +5
Wales / 23 / +3
Total / 2173 / +281

A high proportion of England cases were London residents (73%, 1492 of 2034 with location information). For confirmed cases in the UK, where gender information was available, 2004 (99.3%) were male and 14 were female. The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 37 years (interquartile range 31 to 44).

Table 2: Number of laboratory confirmed monkeypox cases by region of residence, England, 6 May to 18 Jul 2022
Region of residence / Total confirmed / Changes since 14 Jul 2022
East of England / 82 / +13
East Midlands / 25 / +5
London / 1492 / +179
North East / 21 / +3
North West / 115 / +10
South East / 172 / +28
West Midlands / 51 / +11
Yorkshire and Humber / 35 / +10
