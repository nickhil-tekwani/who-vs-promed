At least 25 people were bitten by a rabies-infected dog at South Goa's Cansaulim village, 30 km [18.6 mi] from [Panaji] following which they were hospitalised, sources said today [18 Aug 2014]. The incident occurred last evening [17 Aug 2014] when the stray dog went on a rampage, biting passers-by. The canine was later killed by villagers.

Sources in Goa Medical College (GMC) said that 15 people were administered anti-rabies injection in their hospital while rest were treated at cottage hospital Chicalim and Hospicio hospital at Margao.

There has not been time for the results from any canine brain pathology, so we can presume that there was a logical presumption of canine rabies. - Mod.MHJ]
