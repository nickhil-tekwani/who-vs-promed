The death of more than 250 goats in rural areas of Maicao and Uribia has raised alarms among the community about a possible epidemiological outbreak. According to the complaints, there are 4 impacted communities. The deaths have been registered in the municipality of Uribia, in the Winpeshi sector, and 3 in Maicao.

In the latter, one of the identified communities is Jisemana, located at the kilometer 82 marker of the road to Paraguachón, in whose sector -- according to the social leader Henry Peñalver -- about 40 animals have died without any cause.

Officials from the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA), together with the Umata de Maicao, will be carrying out a follow-up visit to the property, with the purpose of extracting samples and sending them to the laboratory to establish the real causes of death. "The idea is to do a clinical physical examination and rule out control diseases," said veterinarian Jhon Urbay, head of the Maicao del Ica office.

He also assures in the visit made the week before to the Whinpeshi corregimiento with personnel from the Umata de Uribia, control diseases were ruled out, for which reason management recommendations and sanitary issues were made.

In Uribia some 200 lambs have died; it is estimated about 15 have been due to hypothermia and respiratory problems, according to what was determined by the ICA, and others drowned by the rains. "There is no suspicion of any outbreak there, something vesicular or neurological as such, only respiratory problems, which increased due to the rainy season," Urbay said.

On the other hand, the community has warned about findings of donkey remains near a stream, on the edge of the national highway connecting Maicao with the south of La Guajira, which has drawn attention to a possible Venezuelan equine encephalitis, which occurs in equines (horses, donkeys and mules).

The fear of the community is due to the fact on the Venezuelan side, in several border towns including Paraguaipoa, in the Guajira municipality, in Zulia State, several deaths of goats and cows have been reported. Therefore, the epidemiological doctor Carmelo Fuentes warns the Wayús indigenous communities to refrain from consuming the meat of goats having died.

However, James Aragón, director of the ICA in La Guajira, ruled out that it was encephalitis and rejected the statements of Doctor Fuentes, "who came to diagnose without taking a sample; it would be irresponsible to generate such a panic."

Also in La Guajira some 2500 equines have been vaccinated against Venezuelan equine encephalitis, in the areas generating the greatest risk of this type of disease, according to the characterizations carried out.

The community is paying attention to the laboratory results, which will determine the cause of death of these animals.

[It is entirely possible these young animals died from exposure. Sudden changes in weather, especially from warm to cold, can cause young animals to develop hypothermia and die. It is also possible a toxic plant could have been consumed.

We look forward to more information regarding the cause of death of these animals. If you have any information as to the cause of death of these animals, please let us know. - Mod.TG]

[Uribia and Maicao are both municipalities in the department of La Guajira. The Department is the northernmost Department of Colombia and shares it's eastern border with Venezuela. (see https://www.worldometers.info/img/maps/colombia_political_map.gif. - Mod.MPP
