Even as the State Government has turned a deaf ear to the marketing problem
of sugarcane growers, the Congress has decided to take up the issue by
launching an agitation throughout Nabarangpur district [Orissa] from next
month [February 2008] protesting government apathy.

Announcing the party decision, Kodinga legislator Sadan Naik said that
sugarcane was cultivated in 12 000 acres (4856 hectares) in the district
this year [2008]. To add to the misery, red rot disease has damaged
cultivation in more than 3000 acres (1214 hectares).

For the sugarcane farmers of the district, marketing of their produce has
been a problem for some years now as no agencies have come forward for
procurement. Giving an ultimatum to the Government, the party leaders
demanded immediate measures to procure sugarcane from farmers of the
district at the government support price.

[Red rot disease of sugarcane is caused by the fungus _Glomerella
tucumanensis_ (previously _Colletotrichum falcatum_). It is one of the
oldest known diseases of the crop occurring in most cane growing countries,
but continues to be a threat in a number of regions. In India, red rot is
considered a very serious disease in different states and has caused
extensive damage in the recent past. The disease was responsible for the
elimination of many elite sugarcane varieties in this country.

Early symptoms are difficult to recognise and may include discolouration,
red streaks on midribs, lesions and drooping of young leaves. These
symptoms expand until all stalks of the plant wither, die and collapse
within 4 to 8 days. When splitting the stalks, they show an internal dull
red discolouration interrupted by occasional white patches characteristic
for the disease, and may also contain large cavities. Seed pieces may rot
completely. Symptoms are highly variable depending on the host variety and
environmental conditions. In tolerant varieties, the infection remains
largely confined to the internodes.

Several pathogenic strains of the fungus have been reported from many
countries, including India. Climatic factors affect both the spread and
severity of red rot. The disease is favoured by excessive soil moisture,
drought conditions, and low temperatures. In addition, the nutritional
state of the host may affect fungal growth. The pathogen can be spread by
wind, rain, irrigation water, infected planting material, and crop debris.
Spores may survive in the soil to infect planted seed pieces. Hosts other
than sugarcane are not considered important inoculum sources.

Disease management includes use of clean planting material, phytosanitary
and cultural methods. Quarantine measures must be applied to prevent
movement of infected cane setts to new areas. Hot water or fungicide
treatments can be applied to setts before planting, but foliar fungicides
have proven ineffective. The use of resistant varieties is the most
effective method of control. Host factors determining resistance to red rot
are not fully understood, but breeding programmes using inter-generic and
inter-specific crosses of _Saccharum_ spp. are being used successfully to
develop economically viable red rot resistant or tolerant varieties.
Research on biocontrol agents is also being undertaken.
