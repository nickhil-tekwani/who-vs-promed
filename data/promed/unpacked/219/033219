There are some numbers published from Japan.
The following was extracted from GIDEON software:
Anisakiasis is caused by nematode parasites, most commonly _Anisakis
simplex_ and _Pseudoterranova decipiens_. The life cycle includes marine
mammals and fish, with man as an accidental host. Between a few hours to
two weeks following ingestion of undercooked fish, the patient develops
acute or chronic abdominal pain, often with signs of peritoneal irritation
or hematemesis. Diagnosis is made through endoscopic identification of
larvae. The latter may be removed through the endoscope; however, surgery
may be required for complications.
In the United States, anisakiasis is most common in Hawaii. Gulf Coast
fish and North Atlantic cod have also [been implicated. Over 1,000 cases
are registered each year in Tokyo - most from mackerel. 4,296 of 4,682
cases reported nationwide prior to June, 1987 were characterized by gastric
infection, 375 intestinal and 11 extraintestinal.
Sardine-related infections are common in southern Japan.
