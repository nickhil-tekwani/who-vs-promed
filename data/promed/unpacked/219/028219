Last night [Wed 10 Mar 2021], Keshet 12 TV News magazine aired an article by Guy Varon, which covered the closure of [a family's] dairy operation in Kinneret colony, following the infection with bovine tuberculosis of their herd of nearly 200 cattle. In recent months we have accompanied the family and other affected dairy farms, helping them in dealing with the crisis that befell them. Among other things, we led the change in regulations to allow farms in a similar situation to take part of the quota into foster care, and we were in close contact with the veterinary services to perform frequent inspections and provide a horizon of care and certainty to the family.

We hope that in the near future, they will be able to reactivate the dairy operation and continue their glorious heritage, dating back to more than 100 years ago. The bovine tuberculosis issue is a major concern to us. This week we have held discussions on the subject with the DG Ministry of Agriculture, director Veterinary Services, director of "Hachaklait" [see comment] and its head veterinarian in order to formulate an action plan that will monitor and control bovine tuberculosis in cowsheds.

Your health and the general public's health, and the security and economy of the Israel's dairy cattle industry, are our top priority. Therefore, we will continue to work resolutely with the Ministry of Agriculture and Veterinary Services to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.

[The above announcement, circulated to Israel's dairy cattle farmers and other stakeholders, was signed by the directors of the Israeli Dairy board (https://www.israeldairy.com/), Israel Cattle Breeder's Association (http://www.icba-israel.com/), and "Hachaklait" (Mutual Society for Cattle Insurance & Veterinary Services in Israel, serving about 80% of the country's dairy farms; https://hachaklait.org.il/en/).

Israel dairy cattle, kept exclusively in a zero-grazing system, became free of bovine TB in 1973, following the termination of a multi-annual eradication project based upon the "test and slaughter" policy. In 1990, a single case was detected on a dairy operation on the Golan Heights; this was followed by a countrywide project that led to the discovery of 5 contact farms, all eventually cleared of infection after several test-and-slaughter interventions, followed by the slaughter of a total of 457 head (most suspected-not-confirmed) and leading to the event declared as resolved, in 1991. The source of initial infection was not detected. At that time, imports were negligible; suspected reservoir in wild animals prevailing in the region, such as _Spalax_, rock hyrax, and wild boar, remained unconfirmed.

The last outbreak in grazing (beef) cattle was reported in 1999 on the Golan Heights.

In March 2019, after its absence on dairy farms for 28 years, bovine TB recurred, infecting a large dairy operation in northeastern Israel (ProMED archive no. 20190319.6374410, 20190403.6402973). After several unsuccessful attempts to eradicate the infection by test and slaughter, the entire herd's population had to be culled. The current event has undergone a similar history. There are currently additional infected dairy cattle farms, under test-and-slaughter regime.

Until the end of 2014, tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. After the many years of disease absence, it was decided that from 1 Mar 2015, the monitoring and surveillance of bovine TB on the cattle holdings, where periodic tuberculinations were performed by the veterinarians of the State Field Veterinary Services, would be moved to the sole responsibility of the slaughterhouses. Meat inspection of mammals in Israel's slaughterhouses is, according to state legislation, carried out by official (municipal) veterinarians, not by (accredited) lay meat inspectors as the policy would be in many countries. It is within the framework of the new policy that the current cases have been detected in routinely slaughtered cattle.

An advisory (in-house) committee, appointed by the CVO, has recently delivered its report. Details will be posted if/when available.

Identification of the source of recurred infection (initially suspected to be import related; see ProMED archive no. 20190209.6307221) is crucial for the efforts to prevent further spread of the zoonotic bacterium. - Mod.AS
