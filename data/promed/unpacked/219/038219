Do you believe the story of tularemia in Tasmania? Has the organism
been sequenced? The reason I ask is we did have a so-called case in an
HIV positive patient but the organism turned out to be _F.
philomiragia_.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Spencer for his comment. Indeed, ProMED does not
have any additional information regarding the identification of the
isolate as _F. tularensis_.

The species of _Francisella_ mentioned by Dr. Spencer, _philomiragia_
was initially _Yersinia philomiragia_ after being isolated from an
ill muskrat and from surface water in Utah, USA (1). The specific
epithet, derived from the Greek combining form philo (loving) and the
plural of the Latinized English word mirage, was chosen because of the
spectacular mirages that are seen in the area where the isolations
were made.

The organism was linked to human disease and renamed _F. philomiragia_
in 1989. Dannie Hollis and her colleagues at the CDC (2,3) reported
14 human isolates of _F. philomiragia_ over 16 years grown primarily
from blood (n=8) but also from cerebrospinal fluid, lung, pleural, and
pericardial and peritoneal fluids. Clearly the isolates were invasive
and none were associated with an ulceroglandular or glandular
presentation found in noninvasive tularemia as well as the Australian
cases. The best way to identify an isolate as _F. philomiragia_ is by
analysis of the organism's 16S ribosomal RNA. However, good growth
(_F. tularensis_ is a fastidious, slow grower) of the isolate suggests
_F. philomiragia_.

The ulceroglandular nature of the illnesses of the 2 Australian
patients, given the more invasive nature of _F. philomiragia_,
suggests that the isolate was _F. tularensis_ but ProMED still awaits
further information.
