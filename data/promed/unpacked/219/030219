The Ministry of Public Health [MSP] is working on a multisectorial
strategy that involves the ministries of Agriculture, Environment,
Economic and Social Inclusion, National Defense, Foreign Relations,
Telecommunications, the Eco-Development Institute for the Amazon
Region (ECORAE), Secretariat of Peoples, National Secretariat of
Communication, and local authorities, among others. The objective is
to avoid the spread of the outbreak of sylvan rabies transmitted by
the bite of hematophagous bats (that feed on blood).

On Wednesday afternoon, 7 [Dec 2011], the Mayor of Taisha, Celestino
Wizum, met with the intersectorial team to orient the actions for
response in the affected communities. Later, in a meeting of the
various ministers, the recommendations of the community were taken
into account, as well as those of the technicians working in the
affected areas, to implement integrated and planned solutions. Also,
they worked on a proposal for a Presidential Decree with the objective
of declaration of a state of health emergency for the Taisha de Morona
Santiago canton, which will permit a more rapid intervention.

Among the immediate actions taken is antirabies vaccination in the
affected populations of the Wampuik, Tarimiat, and Tsurik Nuevo
communities, in Huasaga parish, Taisha canton, Morona Santiago
province.

The provincial epidemiological team initiated activities to deal with
the rabies outbreak, which include:
- Provision of 5600 doses of rabies vaccine.
- Immunization with human rabies vaccine of all the inhabitants of
high risk communities.
- Distribution of awnings [screening curtains?] to all the families of
the affected communities [whose rustic houses are probably very open.
- Mod.TY]
- Strengthening of health posts of Wampuik and neighboring
communities.
- Training of people from their communities to provide primary
healthcare.
- Education and communication based on dialogue and intercultural
synergy [the affected populations are indigenous people].

Agroquality of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment are in the
process of capturing bats for diagnosis and population reduction, as
well as taking samples for diagnosis of dead cattle. They have
captured a total of 170 bats and applied diphenadione [warfarin-like
anticoagulant pesticide], with which they anticipate a population
density reduction of between 2000-3000 [bats].

As well, they are working on a sustainable livestock plan, which
implies rabies vaccination of high risk bovines and strengthening of
controls for continuous monitoring.

The Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion has made available 2
living shelters in the area, distribution of food rations, and
assistance brigades for the families, with an intercultural focus.

The armed forces are donating air transportation for mobilization of
vaccination brigades and community people if needed, in addition to
that available from MSP through its agreement with ECORAE.

The Secretariat of Risks is making available trained personnel to
collaborate in the Amazon region. Meanwhile, the Secretariat of
Peoples carries out work on dialogue with the families and mediation
with the community.

The Secretariat of National Communication is helping with the
transmission of educational messages in Achuar and Shuar [indigenous
languages] through community radio stations.

In Ecuador, no cases of urban [dog-origin] rabies have been registered
since 2001 due to campaigns for vaccination of dogs and cats; however,
small outbreaks or isolated cases of sylvan rabies have been
documented.

In the Amazon Basin (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru),
increasingly there are more sylvan rabies cases due to ecological
disequilibrium. The population of bats that feed on blood has
increased in recent years mainly due to deforestation and introduction
of cattle, which has provoked an increased risk of [bat] attacks on
humans.

Up to 7 Dec [2011], the deaths of 11 people confirmed as sylvan rabies
have been registered in the 3 communities where the outbreak is
reported.

[The bats involved in the outbreak are most likely the vampire
_Desmodus rotundus_. Although the bat feeds most commonly on bovine
and equine animals, they will feed on humans, especially if domestic
animals are not readily available. These bats are very susceptible to
poisoning with warfarin and related compounds. If these compounds are
applied externally as a jelly to the bats, when they return to their
day-time roosts, mutual grooming will expose the roosting colony to
the pesticide.

It is good to see a well-integrated approach to the outbreak being
planned and initiated. Cultural considerations are essential when
dealing with these indigenous peoples, as previous reports indicated
that they often seek treatment from local traditional healers rather
than health posts that provide western medicines (in this case, post
exposure vaccination). Although this report does not mention it, 10 of
these fatalities are children and one is a pregnant woman. One hopes
that the campaign successfully brings the outbreak to a halt with no
more fatalities.
