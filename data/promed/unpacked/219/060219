[re: ProMED-mail Avian influenza (155): Chile, turkeys, H7 20171101.5419276
This note is old. The LPAI H7N6 outbreak in turkeys was closed on January [2017] and this note informs about the 2nd case on [Tue 17 Jan 2017]. Chile was self-declared free of avian influenza on [Fri 9 Jun 2017], to OIE.

Currently, Chile does not have any cases of avian influenza.
