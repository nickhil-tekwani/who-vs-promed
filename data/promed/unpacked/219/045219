I would point out that there are no major game parks or wildlife
preserves located along the flyway between southern Nigeria and
Zambia's Victoria Falls. The one major forest area -- the Tai Forest,
which spans portions of Cameroon, Gabon and Congo, is undergoing
major logging operations and deforestation. The massive forest
regions, rivers and lakes of the DRO Congo are no longer tourist
destinations, due to ongoing violence in the region. Northern Zambia
is consumed by the Copperbelt region, which involves large-scale
mining operaitons. So the first piece of territory to which migrating
birds heading south from Nigeria might make their way and be noticed
by international tourists, is in fact Livingston, or Victoria Falls.
If this is confirmed as H5N1, it is likely there are infected birds
along the flyway from Nigeria, but, for the reasons above, were not
noted by any outsiders.
If this turns out to be H5N1, it is virtually 100 percent guaranteed
the virus is in birds immediately across the Zambezi in Zimbabwe
where political repression and violence have brought tourism to a
virtual halt. Birds that carry the virus would no doubt appear soon
in South Africa and Madagascar, if the Zambia sightings turn out to be H5N1.

[A lot of "ifs." Wild and domestic birds die of many conditions
besides H5N1. We can only wait and see what emerges. In the meanwhile
there have been calls for calm in the region, reminiscent of the
concerned elderly character in "Dad's Army." In February 2006 there
was a local over-reaction in the lower Zambezi which resulted,
apparently, in hundreds of villagers killing their domestic poultry
and goats on the rumour of an avian flu outbreak in the country.

A major wetlands and National Park complex were missed in this
analysis in the Luangwa Valley of eastern Zambia.
The Kafue National Park is the size of Wales and located on a direct
line between the headwaters of the Congo watershed and Victoria Falls
<http://www.go2africa.com/zambia/zambia-map.asp>
<http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/nationalparks/kafue.htm>
Also, the Luangwa Valley in eastern Zambia is another natural
ecological corridor into the Zambezi valley from central Africa and
would be used by many species that might move between these areas.

[This 2nd commentary was in response to the comment contained in [1]
above. - Mod.MPP]
There is an error in the [above comment] regarding the supposed
absence of any National Parks or major game reserves between southern
Nigeria and Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River.
The Kafue National Park (22 400 sq km) in central Zambia is located
on the direct line drawn between southern Nigeria, the headwaters of
the Congo watershed, and Victoria Falls. The Kafue Flats marshes and
seasonal wetlands cover an area of approximately 6500 sq km in the
central region of the park. The area serves as an important regional
tourist destination and wildlife research area.
<http://www.go2africa.com/zambia/zambia-map.asp>
According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Kafue Flats ecosystem is
situated along major migration routes that carry birds migrating from
the Arctic as well as other areas of Africa. A total of more than
470 species of birds have been recorded in the area, and the Kafue
Flats are the home of the Kafue lechwe, an endemic species of wetland
antelope found nowhere else in Africa.

[Most likely these parks were overlooked because they are probably
not large tourist attractions. However, that does not exclude them
from being in the migratory bird pathway, or subject to birds
introducing disease in those regions. We appreciate Joe helping us
understand where the parks are and their size and importance. - Mod.TG]
