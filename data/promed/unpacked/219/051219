French agriculture officials ordered the destruction of a herd of 170
cattle after the discovery of a new case of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) also known as mad cow disease, the Agriculture
Ministry said Sunday.
The new case comes amid concerns about 18 cases discovered in 1998. The
infected cow was discovered last week in Normandy and represents the third
case of BSE so far this year (99) and the 52nd case in France since 1990,
said Bertrand Hervieu, an adviser to Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany. The
Agriculture Ministry has launched an investigation to determine why the
disease persists. Glavany suggested the surge in cases in France may be the
result of problems with animal feed.
First detected in 1985, BSE causes holes in the brain, making cattle
stagger and drool. There is no known cure. Scientists believe BSE may be
linked to an equally fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD).
