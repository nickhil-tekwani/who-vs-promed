Gunungkidul Health Office (Dinkes) in Yogyakarta has noted that in 2022 there [have been] 22 cases of leptospirosis, of which 4 sufferers [have] died. "Until June [2022] there have been 22 cases of leptospirosis, 4 of whom died (data is up to 17 Jun 2022)," said the head of the Gunungkidul Health Office, Dewi Irawaty, when telephoned by reporters on Sunday (19 Jun 2022). This [total] is quite high, although 2017 is still the highest with 64 cases with 16 deaths.

"Indeed, now there is an upward trend and the number of cases could still increase," said Dewi. "The details of the case are in the field, I don't memorize it. What is clear, the cases are dominated in agricultural areas," he said. Dewi said cases of leptospirosis have increased, and as long as it rains, this disease can still increase. Like the current phenomenon of wet drought, especially residents who work in the agricultural sector to be more careful about the spread of this disease.

Moreover, the transmission medium [is] water which is thought to be mixed with rat urine.

Data from the Health Office of leptospirosis cases in 2017 were 64 cases with 16 deaths. In 2018 there were 16 cases with one death. In 2019 9 cases and 2 deaths. In 2020 there were 6 cases and one death.

[Yogyakarta (population 388 627 residents in 2010) is the capital city of the Special Region of Yogyakarta, which is also the Yogyakarta Sultanate, the only officially recognized monarchy within Indonesia, located in the south-central part of the island of Java (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta). Tourists come to Yogyakarta because of its proximity to Borobudur, an impressive 9th-century Buddhist temple complex, and Prambanan, a 9th-century Hindu temple compound. Gunungkidul (pop 747 161 residents in 2020) is an administrative division in the eastern part of the Special Region of Yogyakarta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunung_Kidul_Regency#Climatology). A map showing the location of Gunungkidul can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gunung+Kidul+Regency,+Special+Region+of+Yogyakarta,+Indonesia.

The wet season/rainy season in Yogyakarta takes place in January, February, March, November, and December, each year.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed worldwide. Although more common in tropical areas of the world, leptospirosis is also found in temperate areas. Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against leptospira infection is predominantly serovar-specific.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with leptospira. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospira-infected animals. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research, testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis, found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped." (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2).

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of leptospira and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the United States. - Mod.ML
