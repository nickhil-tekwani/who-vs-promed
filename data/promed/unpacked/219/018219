Child Dies of Bird Flu in Bali
------------------------------
Radar Bali reports the death of a 12-year-old child from South Bali due to Bird Flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection). The child, identified only with the initials WM, died in the isolation ward of Denpasar's Sanglah General Hospital at 3:00 a.m. on Tue 21 Feb 2012.

The child was transferred to the Bird Flu Unit at Sanglah Hospital only 5 hours prior to death after being warded for 5 days at the Puri Raharja Hospital, also in Denpasar.

Dr. Ken Wirasandshi, the head of the Bird Flu Team at Sanglah Hospital, said the child was suffering from respiratory distress with laboratory tests showing the virus [to be] avian influenza.

The child's parents, however, deny any contact with poultry prior to the onset of the disease. Initially misdiagnosed, the child was admitted to the Puri Raharja Hospital as a case of typhus.
