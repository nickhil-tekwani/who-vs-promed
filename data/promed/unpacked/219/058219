Influenza update 123
--------------------
Introduction: The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza
activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates
are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources,
including FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance
Network), FluID and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and
Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability
and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

Summary
-------
Since the last update [3 Dec 2010], increasing influenza activity has
been observed across parts of Europe, most notably in the United
Kingdom, indicating the start of wintertime influenza epidemics in
several countries. Influenza activity is also increasing in other
temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including East Asia and
North America where there is evidence of the beginnings of the local
winter influenza season. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2), B, and H1N1
(2009) viruses are co-circulating with significant regional
heterogeneity in the predominant circulating influenza viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In the United Kingdom (UK), the winter influenza epidemic is under
way, particularly across England. Since mid to late November 2010
there have reports of increasing numbers of community outbreaks of
influenza (due to both influenza H1N1 (2009) and B viruses),
increasing proportions of sentinel respiratory specimens testing
positive for influenza (56 percent in England during the second week
of December; of which 67 percent were H1N1 (2009) and 33 percent were
influenza B viruses), and increasing numbers of severe influenza cases
requiring intensive care.

Available data indicate that the currently circulating strain of the
H1N1 (2009) virus in the UK is epidemiologically and virologically
similar to that observed last year during the influenza H1N1 2009
pandemic. All influenza viruses characterized to date have been found
to be similar to the strains currently included in the seasonal
influenza trivalent vaccine. (see below in Virologic Surveillance for
details on the characterization of the virus) It is too early to tell
what the overall impact of the current epidemic will be in the UK in
comparison to the 2009 season.

During the 1st week of December 2010, small to moderate increases in
the levels of ARI [acute respiratory infection] or ILI [influenza-like
illness] were reported in at least 13 countries across European
region, particularly among children <14 years of age. Among 11
countries who have established seasonal baseline levels for ILI or
ARI, at least 2, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, reported
levels of ILI or ARI above the seasonal baseline. During the last week
of November and the 1st week of December 2010, the proportion of
sentinel respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza
increased from 5.9 percent to 9.8 percent; among the latter, 48
percent and 52 percent were influenza A and B viruses, respectively.
Of the influenza A viruses that were further subtyped, 90 percent were
H1N1 (2009) and 10 percent were A(H3N2) viruses.

In East Asia, several countries, notably Mongolia and the Republic of
Korea, have seen substantial recent increases in influenza activity.
In Mongolia, rates of ILI have continued to rise above the seasonal
baseline since mid to late November 2010 and were associated with
increasing detections of influenza A(H3N2) virus, suggesting that the
local winter influenza epidemic is under way. During the same time
period in the Republic of Korea, influenza virus detections (of
primarily H1N1 (2009) virus) increased substantially, however, overall
levels of ILI in the population increased only slightly during the
same period. Since mid to late October 2010, levels of ILI in northern
(but not southern) China have increased slowly and have been
associated with only low levels of circulating influenza A(H3N2)
viruses.

Increasing rates of ILI are also noted in North America. In Canada,
ILI activity has been geographically variable but overall within
seasonal baseline levels; however, during the past 2 reporting weeks,
both the number of influenza virus detections and the proportion of
respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza viruses
(predominantly A(H3N2) have increase substantially. In the United
States, levels of ILI remain at the seasonal threshold in the
southwestern region but are otherwise below threshold in other parts
of the country; during the past month, influenza B viruses have been
detected most frequently, followed by A(H3N2) viruses, and to a much
lesser extent, H1N1 (2009) viruses. Persistent, low to moderate, and
over time, geographically heterogeneous, circulation of influenza
A(H3N2) viruses has been reported in Mexico since early August 2010.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
In the tropics of the Americas, overall influenza activity remained
low. Although influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been predominant across
the region during recent months (most notably in Cuba, Paraguay, and
in the eastern parts of Bolivia), low levels of H1N1 (2009) virus (in
Colombia) and influenza B (in Costa Rica) have also been reported.

In tropics of South and Southeast Asia, overall influenza activity
remained low, except in Sri Lanka, where active circulation of H1N1
(2009) along with other influenza viruses, continues to be reported.
The current influenza epidemic in Sri Lanka, which began during early
October 2010, appears to have recently peaked during the 1st week of
December 2010. To date, there have been no reports from Sri Lanka to
suggest an unusual epidemiological or virological pattern of H1N1
(2009) virus infection as compared to last year.

In sub-Saharan Africa, little influenza activity has been reported
during the past month, except in Cameroon (central Africa), where
there has been a recent surge in the number of detections of H1N1
(2009) viruses. The extent to which the surge in virus detections has
been associated with increases in community levels of ILI is not yet
known. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, persistent low to moderate
level circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses continued to be
detected in several countries of East and West Africa, notably in
Ghana and Kenya. During early December 2010 in Madagascar, an increase
in the proportion of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for
influenza virus was reported. Influenza A(H3N2), H1N1 (2009), and B
viruses have co-circulated in Madagascar since early November 2010.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Overall, only sporadic spring and summertime influenza activity is
being reported in countries of the temperate Southern Hemisphere,
except in Uruguay, where there is persistent but declining levels of
influenza A(H3N2) virus circulation associated with declining indices
of severe clinical respiratory diseases in the population.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network is constantly monitoring
the evolution of influenza viruses.

Human Infections with swine-origin triple reassortant A(H3N2) viruses.

On 7 Dec 2010, an additional case of human infection with swine-origin
triple reassortant A(H3N2) viruses in Minnesota USA was reported
through IHR. The Minnesota virus was confirmed by the WHO
Collaborating Center in CDC Atlanta. Sequence analysis has shown that
the virus is closely related but not identical to the previous
swine-origin triple reassortant A(H3N2) viruses from Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania in November 2010. To date a total of 6 sporadic cases of
human infection of A(H3N2) triple reassortant swine viruses have been
reported by CDC since 2005. No known unusual severity has been
reported associated with the infection of the A(H3N2) triple
reassortant swine virus in humans.

Outbreaks of influenza A H1N1 (2009) and influenza B viruses in the
United Kingdom:

A number of severe and fatal cases of influenza A H1N1 (2009) and
influenza B have recently been reported by the United Kingdom.

-- Influenza A H1N1 (2009) viruses characterised to date, in samples
from the community, hospitalised patients and fatal cases in the
United Kingdom, are antigenically homogeneous and similar to the
vaccine virus A/California/7/2009.

-- Genetically these H1N1 (2009) viruses have several amino acid
substitutions relative to the vaccine virus but these do not affect
the antigenicity of the virus and have also been seen in viruses from
other parts of the world.

-- The B viruses analysed in the United Kingdom to date are B/
Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses and are antigenetically and genetically
closely related to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 vaccine virus.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 47 to 48 (21 Nov to 4 Dec 2010), National Influenza
Centres (NICs) from 59 countries reported data to FluNet*. A total of
2309 specimens were reported as positive for influenza viruses, 1671
(72.4 percent) were typed as influenza A, 638 (27.6 percent) as
influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses reported, 31.3
percent were influenza H1N1(2009) and 68.0 percent were influenza
A(H3N2).

[The winter influenza epidemic is now underway in parts of the
Northern Hemisphere with some regional variation. Worldwide, influenza
A(H3N2), B, and H1N1 (2009) viruses are co-circulating with
significant regional heterogeneity in the predominant circulating
influenza viruses. The previous seasonal A/H1N1 strain has been
replaced generally by the the A/H1N1 (2009) strain, accompanied by B
type virus in the UK and A/H3N2 in the USA. At present thee is not
sufficient information available to assess the relative severity of
the circulating strains.

So far the A/H1N1 (2009) viruses characterised genetically have
several amino acid substitutions relative to the vaccine virus but
these do not affect the antigenicity of the virus and have been seen
previously in the preceding pandemic. No known unusual severity has
been reported associated with infection by the A(H3N2) triple
reassortant swine virus in humans.

Overall the current seasonal vaccine seems to be well matched to the
epidemic strains currently in circulation. - Mod.CP]
