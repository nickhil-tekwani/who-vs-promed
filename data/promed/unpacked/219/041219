African swine fever [ASF] has spread into Russia's Bryansk Oblast [region] and Tula Oblast, according to information posted at the website of Russia's federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance "Rosselkhoznadzor", informs LETA/Nozare.lv.

The information posted at the website today [5 Feb 2014; http://fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/8914.html in Russian] says that ASF has been found on a farm in Bryansk Oblast, where the necessary quarantine measures are now being taken [see OIE notification in item 2 below].

Russian authorities believe that the disease has been caused by pork brought into Bryansk Oblast from Tula Oblast, where an outbreak of ASF was reported on a large pig farm. There, too, precautionary measures are continuing [see comment below].

The virus has been spreading in Russia since 2007; hundreds of thousands of pigs have had to be slaughtered in Russia so far.

Yesterday [4 Feb 2014] "Rosselkhoznadzor" head Sergei Dankvert said that Russia's ban on pork imports from the European Union in the wake of the swine fever outbreak in Lithuania could be lifted in 2 months at the earliest, whereas the ban on pork imports from the Baltic countries could continue for 3 years.

The Latvian government has allocated a total of EUR 1 352 949 [about USD 1 840 000] from the state budget's emergency funds to the Finance Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry and the Interior Ministry for ASF prevention measures.

African swine fever has never been registered in the territory of Latvia.

[The previous Russian ASF outbreak, in Tula Oblast, reported to the OIE in follow-up report no 2 dated 3 Feb 2014, took place on the "breeding factory" "Lazarevskoye", Shchekinsky. Reportedly, it had started on 15 Jan 2014. The report's data on the affected animals was the following:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 57 047 / 370 / 370 / 119 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost
Swine / 0.65 / 0.65 / 100 / 0.86

Notably, in both outbreaks, the morbidity rate was strikingly low (0.65 per cent in Tula and 6.7 per cent in Bryansk), while in the latter, no mortality has been recorded at all, an exceptional phenomenon in relation to ASF. The number of animals destroyed, under the "modified stamping out" policy, is very low: in the Tula outbreak, 119 killed out of the remaining 56 677 swine.

ASF virus has been circulating in Russia, in wild boar and domestic pigs, since the end of 2007 (introduced from Georgia). According to OIE's data: 2007 - 1 outbreak; 2008 - 48; 2009 - 46; 2010 - 78; 2011 - 54; 2012 - 66; 2013 (Jan-Jun, last available periodic report) - 29 outbreaks. Could such a situation be regarded as having become endemic in the western, European parts of the Russian Federation? This is illustrated in OIE's interactive map, available at http://tinyurl.com/otcdpnq (select African swine fever and the period starting 1 Jan 2007, re-centre by clicking on the target territory and zoom in). The map presents outbreaks in domestic swine (circles) and in wild boar (triangles).

The current outbreak in Bryansk Oblast, bordering Belarus, is the 1st one in this region. Tula has suffered several previous outbreaks.

Information on the considerations for partial culling and about the further handling/maintenance of the remaining animals on the infected premises, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
