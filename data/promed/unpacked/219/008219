This week's issue of the SCIEH Weekly Report (11/03/97) notes:
(SCIEH - Scottish Centre for Infection & Environmental Health, Ruchill
Hospital, Glasgow)

"The laboratory at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, has reported a case of
meningitis in a female neonate with a CSF isolate of _Enterobacter sakazakii_.
This is the first time this type of meningitis has been reported to SCIEH,
at least since computerisation of records in 1986. There have been two cases
of _E.sakazakii_ septicaemia in 1997 and eight in 1996, all in adults and but
one aged over 65. From 1986 to date we have received 42 reports of
septicaemia, of which only three were before 1991. PHLS
[Public Health Laboratory Service]
reports no infant cases of septicaemia or meningitis in 1997 in England &
Wales. Local investigations in Ayrshire & Arran are underway.
_E.sakazakii_ was designated a distinct species in 1980 and has been
associated with a rare but severe meningitis (mortality of 40-80%)
associated with contaminated dried infant formula in two USA outbreaks. This
species appears to be highly thermoresistant in comparison with other
Enterobacteraciae.
