Officials reported 5 more illnesses and 3 more deaths in a new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to figures reported today [Mon 15 Jun 2020] by the country's multisectoral Ebola response committee (CMRE; see above).

The new developments raise the outbreak total to 17 cases, 14 of them confirmed and 3 listed as probable. The new deaths raise the fatality count to 11.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week in its latest situation report that the outbreak has affected 6 health areas in 3 health zones: Mbandaka, Wangata, and Bikoro. Sequencing suggests that it is not related to the larger ongoing outbreak in the eastern part of the country, where the total stands at 3463 cases, 2280 of them fatal. If no new cases are reported by 25 Jun 2020, the larger outbreak will be declared over.

WHO says lessons learned from previous outbreaks of Ebola in the DRC and effective therapeutics will allow it to more quickly contain a new outbreak of the deadly disease in Equateur Province.

UN health officials report there is no link between the Ebola outbreak declared 1 Jun 2020 in Mbandaka, Equateur Province, and the epidemic, which broke out nearly 2 years ago in DR Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces. They say the experience gained, however, and lessons learned from tackling this deadly disease in eastern DRC will help them to more quickly stop the spread of the virus in Equateur Province in the western part of the country.

WHO emergency operations manager Michel Yao says WHO has more than 20 staff on the ground and is ready to send in more, if necessary. He tells VOA that WHO is working with partners to set up treatment centers, to monitor risks and respond promptly to identify and trace new cases. "Our objective this time is to work through local authorities that were already trained," Yao said. "They had some experience. So, we have just to refresh and we have to remain behind coaching them. Lesson learned remain the critical one is to work through the community."

The epidemic in eastern DRC, which has infected more than 3460 people and killed 2280, finally appears to be winding down. The latest reports from western DRC, where the outbreak has just started, put the number of confirmed and probable cases at 12, including 9 deaths.

Two years ago, the same region was stricken with Ebola. It took less than 4 months to contain the outbreak with the help of an experimental vaccine, which provided protection against the virus.

Yao says the vaccines, which since have proven to be safe and effective, will help to speedily contain the virus. So far, he says, more than 600 people have been vaccinated in Mbandaka and Wangata health zones. He says 3000 doses of the vaccine are in place and more are expected to be delivered soon.
