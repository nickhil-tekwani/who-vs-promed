CHOLERA - SUDAN
===============
Date: Tues, 4 June 1996
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
Source: News Services

Medicins sans Frontieres has reported more than 1800 cases of cholera
in the Sudan. At least 700 have died, including 360 from the Adok
region alone. The first cases appeared in fishing camps along the Nile River
near Adok in mid-April. Adok is in the Upper Nile province, south Sudan.
Other districts hit by the epidemic are Jagai, Jikany, Leek, Bahr el Ghazal and
the Western Upper Nile. Full information is difficult to obtain because of
the civil war being fought between the government of Sudan, the South Sudan
Independence Movement and factions of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army.
