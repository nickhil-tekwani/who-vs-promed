The 1st 2 cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) [virus infection] in Vermont have just been confirmed by the Health Department. Both are adults from the Addison and Rutland County area where mosquito pools recently tested positive for EEE and West Nile viruses. Both are hospitalized.

Like West Nile virus, EEE [virus] is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Health and agriculture officials are considering an aerial spraying program for the area. If weather conditions allow, this could be done as early as next week.

"The severe form of EEE is a terrible disease, and we want to take every reasonable action to prevent people from becoming infected," said Health Commissioner Harry Chen, MD. "These viruses will continue to circulate until the 1st freeze. Although spraying will help reduce the risk of infection, it's important that we all take personal precautions to avoid mosquito bites no matter where we live."

This is the 1st time EEE has been confirmed in humans in the state. In September 2011, emus were the 1st and only confirmed cases of EEE [virus infection] to date in animals.

"Mosquito surveillance is limited. Although we've detected EEE and West Nile [viruses] in one area of the state, we want Vermonters to know that these viruses could be circulating anywhere," said Erica Berl, infectious disease epidemiologist with the Health Department.

People who are infected with EEE [virus] can develop 2 types of illness. One has a sudden onset and is characterized by chills, fever, malaise, joint and muscle pain, and lasts about 1-2 weeks. The more severe illness affects the central nervous system and causes fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, convulsions, and coma. Approximately one-third of people with severe EEE [virus infections] die from the disease.

The Health Department reminds Vermonters to avoid mosquito bites:
- Wear long sleeves and pants.
- Avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.
- Get rid of standing water to reduce mosquito breeding habitats.
- Use repellants that are labeled as effective against mosquitoes.
- Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.
- Make sure your horses, emus, llamas, and alpacas are vaccinated.
- There is no vaccine for humans.

[This has been an active season for EEE virus transmission in the eastern USA, from Maine, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the north-northeast to the southeastern states. Most of the cases of EEE virus infection have occurred in unvaccinated equine animals, but there have been reported human neurological cases reported in Massachusetts, Florida and now, Vermont this year (2012). The transmission season in Vermont and the northeastern states can be expected to continue another 4-8 weeks, until 1st killing frosts occur eliminating vector mosquitoes. It would be prudent for people living in these areas of the USA to heed the advice about avoiding mosquito bites, as this is the only way for individuals to prevent severe infection and death. - Mod.TY
