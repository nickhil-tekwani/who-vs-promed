Thai shrimp production is on track to halve from its peak this year [2022] as disease sweeps through the country's farms, ramping up pressure on the government to secure enough supply for consumers at home while supporting small-scale producers.

Shrimp is critical to Thai society, not just as a key ingredient in local dishes like tom yum soup but as an economic driver. Farmed black tiger and whiteleg shrimp are among the country's key exports.

The industry has suffered heavily from illnesses like early mortality syndrome over the past 10-plus years. Thai shrimp production is expected to fall to 270 000 metric tons this year [2022] from a peak of over 600 000 around 2011. The country was the world's top exporter of shrimp until 2012 but had fallen behind India and Ecuador by 2016, according to the Central Bank of Thailand.

In August [2022], the Thai government made the unusual decision to import around 10 000 metric tons of shrimp from Ecuador and India in response to the growing shortage at home.

"All stakeholders agreed to allow imports," Chalermchai Suwannarak, director general at the Thai Department of Fisheries, said early last month [September 2022].

In addition, the government and shrimp farmers in August [2022] set a guaranteed minimum price of 119 to 180 baht (USD 3.16 to USD 4.75) per kilogram to protect local production.

Still, there is concern that increasing the domestic shrimp supply through exports could drive prices down. Many of Thailand's roughly 30 000 shrimp farmers run extremely small operations and have less bargaining power than processing companies, which have been buying at or around the floor price. Worries are rising that more shrimp farmers could exit the industry, hindering a recovery in domestic production.

Ensuring a stable supply will require significant spending on research, including ways to prevent the spread of diseases.

"Long-term assistance, like sharing know-how on better farming practices, is crucial," said the head of the producer group Thai Shrimp Association.

The largest portion of Thai shrimp exports goes to the US, followed by Japan, according to the association. Shrimp is a common ingredient in frozen food items in Japan, and a shortage in Thailand could drive up their prices.

Thailand aims to produce 400 000 metric tons of shrimp a year as early as 2023. Addressing concerns among producers will be key to achieving this goal.

["Early mortality syndrome" (EMS), more technically known as acute hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome (AHPNS), is a new disease that appeared in shrimp farms located in southern China and Hainan Island in 2010. By early 2011, it was also detected in Viet Nam and Malaysia.

The disease appears within 20 to 30 days of stocking ponds with postlarvae.

Mortalities can approach 100% in severely affected ponds, where diseased shrimp become lethargic and anorexic. Upon simple dissection, the hepatopancreas organs of the shrimp may appear atrophied and whitish with black streaks. Other signs include a soft, generally darker shell and mottling of the carapace.

In early 2013, the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory at the University of Arizona was able to isolate the causative agent of AHPNS in pure culture. AHPNS has a bacterial etiology, which has been identified as a member of the _Vibrio harveyi_ clade, most closely related to _V. parahemolyticus_. This bacterium is infected by a virus, known as a phage, which causes it to release a potent toxin. - Mod.PMB
