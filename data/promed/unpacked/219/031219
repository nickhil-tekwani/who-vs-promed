Text of a fax received on 5 March 1998 from Dr T.C. Bamusonighe, Director of
Animal Resources, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Resources and Fisheries,
Entebbe:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 6 February 1998.
Estimated date of first infection: 1 February 1998.
Description of affected population: zebu (Bos indicus) of all ages and
either sex. These animals are highly susceptible to the disease.
Diagnosis: preliminary field investigations were carried out by the
Veterinary Department of Uganda.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: OIE World Reference Laboratory for
foot and mouth disease (Pirbright, United Kingdom).
B. Diagnostic tests used: cell culture and virus isolation.
C. Causal agent: FMD virus serotype O.
Epidemiology: in December 1997, infection similar to this was reported at 1o
9' N - 33o 8' E.
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the current epizootic is related
to animals moved from 2o 4' N - 34o 5' E.
B. Mode of spread: direct contact (aerosol respiratory mode). Wind
transmission is unlikely in tropical conditions and under normal weather
conditions.
C. Other epidemiological details: foot and mouth disease in Uganda has in
recent times been limited to 1o 15' N to 1o 3'S and 29o 6' E to 32o 5' E
(Southern and Central provinces). Restocking in the East and El Nino weather
conditions have provided a favourable environment for disease spread.
Control measures during reporting period: quarantine and movement control
inside the country; testing; vaccination.
