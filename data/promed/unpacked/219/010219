Eight Afghans who ate an infected camel as part of a religious
celebration died of what health experts suspect is a rare case of
naturally occurring anthrax, officials said Saturday [29 Dec 2007].
The deaths, in the southwestern province of Nimroz, included 2 women
and an infant, said Dr. Abdullah Fahim, an adviser to Afghanistan's
health minister. Ten others fell sick. Officials cannot say
positively that the deaths were anthrax related until laboratory
results "expected in the next 2 days" are completed, said Fahim.

The outbreak began when 2 men in a remote area of southwest
Afghanistan along the border with Iran tried to sell a sick camel,
said Ghulam Dastagir Azad, the governor of Nimroz province. Nobody
bought the camel, and the men instead killed it and distributed the
meat to needy families, as is the custom during the Muslim holiday of
Eid al-Adha.

The 2 men "were the 1st victims. They cooked the meat, and 12 hours
later they were dead," said Azad. "Then some of the families who
cooked (the meat) in their homes became victims."

Fahim said there is no evidence to suggest terrorism played any part
in the outbreak.

It is in the far southwestern corner of Afghanistan.

This disease is infrequently reported in camels. For example, in
Kazakhstan there have been 8 reported cases of anthrax in camels from
1955 to 1977, against hundreds of bovine cases. Presumably, they get
infected from grazing contaminated soils, but it is not an
over-investigated event. In the 'Stans, it is not unusual to see
cases of this disease late in the year. Why is not known, but with
cattle, it is associated with trailing animals down from the upland
summer grazing, and they get exposed on the over-grazed trails. But
camels and their management are different.

This disease is extensively under-reported in Afghanistan. My sources
tell me that it is seen most frequently in the northern provinces
bordering Tajikistan. But as the country presently has an ineffective
infrastructure, the current reality is unknown. Annual reports to OIE
have been consistently of poor quality. Enquiries are being made to
see whether more information can be obtained. - Mod MHJ]
