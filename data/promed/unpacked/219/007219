Czech Republic: Woman Dies of Suspected New Variant Creutzfeldt-jakob Disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 46-year-old woman, who has been hospitalised in the Hradec Kralove
Teaching Hospital, east Bohemia, since April 2003, apparently died of new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail], the fatal brain-wasting illness. New variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is the human form of mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The information, carried by Czech
Television today, was confirmed by the Chief Doctor of the Hradec Kralove
hospital's neurological clinic, Radomir Talab.
"The woman showed signs of mental disorder and involuntary movements of the
limbs, and the electroencephalograph tests which have been performed
recorded signs characteristic of [new variant?] Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,"
Talab said. The Hradec Kralove doctors sent the woman to Prague's Thomayer
Hospital for observation, but specialists there did not confirm the
diagnosis. "They maintained that they were the signs of another illness,"
Talab said. Finally, the woman was transferred in the middle of June 2003
to a hospital in Sedlcany, east Bohemia, where she died several days later.
"Tissue samples that could not be taken when the patient was still alive
for safety reasons have been examined by specialists from Prague's Thomayer
Hospital, who will also make the definitive diagnosis," Talab said, adding
that the results could be known in about 3-4 weeks after the tissue samples
were taken.
The woman suspected of having new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease had
been treated in an intensive care ward, and according to Talab, no danger
of infection for other patients and the staff was imminent. "In addition,
she was treated under the so-called protective regime, which means that all
materials used in her treatment such as syringes, for instance, were
immediately destroyed without anyone coming into contact with them," Talab
said. If lab tests confirm the diagnosis, it will be the first case of this
disease in the Czech Republic.
Many experts believe bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the formal name for
the cattle disease, can be transmitted to people who eat meat from infected
animals. More than 100 people in Britain, France, and Ireland have died
from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease since the mid-1990s, mostly in
Britain, where the first case of BSE was detected in 1986. Since the
beginning of July 2003, 5 cases of mad cow disease have been detected in
the Czech Republic.

[The diagnosis of this patient's illness was disputed while she was still
alive, and the outcome of laboratory testing of tissue samples taken after
the death of the patient is still awaited. Consequently this report must be
treated with caution. The report contains no information which supports a
diagnosis of vCJD as opposed to any other form of CJD. The detection of BSE
in cattle in the Czech Republic clearly indicates that the potential for
human cases of vCJD exists, and fatal cases of CJD-like neurological
illness must be carefully evaluated. Further information on the accuracy of
the diagnosis would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
