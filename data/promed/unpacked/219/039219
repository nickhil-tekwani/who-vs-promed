Scrub typhus has killed 4 people in Himachal Pradesh while 241 others have tested positive. Scrub typhus is an acute illness caused by a bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected mite larva [chigger] present in the soil having scrub vegetation. Himachal Pradesh is an endemic region as it has a large scrub vegetation.

Of the total deaths reported this year [2019] so far, 1 death has been reported from Mandi district, while 3 deaths have been reported from Shimla district. An 8-year-girl from Lakkar Bazar in Shimla died on [Mon 5 Aug 2019]. She was admitted to the hospital on [Sun 4 Aug 2019] with the complaint of high fever and was in serious condition.

Of the total cases that have so far tested positive, 91 cases have been reported from Bilaspur district, followed by 47 cases from Hamirpur district and 43 cases from Kangra district. Mandi district has reported 31 positive cases while Shimla and Solan districts have reported 10 positive cases each. Chamba district has reported 6 positive cases while Kullu, Kinnaur, and Sirmaur districts have reported 1 positive case each.

Senior medical superintendent of Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla, Dr. Janak Raj said that people should observe some precautions while going to the fields including wearing full-sleeved clothes as scrub typhus spreads during monsoon. He added that people should also cut grass around the houses and in case of fever, they should go for medical examination to the nearest health institute.

[Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Rodents (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated in the news report above. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely not available in endemic regions.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Himachal Pradesh is a state in the mountainous northern part of India, situated in the Western Himalayas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh). The predominantly mountainous region.
