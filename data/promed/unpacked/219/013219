7500 cattle will be slaughtered because of anthrax in Romania
-----------------------------------------------
The Romanian authorities plan to slaughter and incinerate around 7500
horses and cattle infected with anthrax living in the wild in the
Danube delta biosphere reserve. The health authorities consider these
animals a public health threat for the general population, the Danube
delta ecosystem and its agricultural production.
"Almost half of the domestic animals in the area live in the wild.
They are not registered, nor vaccinated, nor receive any veterinary
treatment," Alina Monea said, speaking for the Food and Veterinary
Safety Authority.
Monea said that many of these animals are infected with the anthrax
bacillus, very active this summer [2005] due to the frequent rains,
and that they can transmit the disease to humans.
The animals will be captured and slaughtered if nobody claims them.

[This is an indirect report of outbreaks in the Danube DBR which
needs confirmation. Anthrax is not a chronic infection, so the risk
is not as described, nor is it contagious.
In July 2000, there were widespread outbreaks in the Danube Delta,
and some 29 people were hospitalized. The government spent USD 230
000 in emergency control activities.
Semi-feral populations like this can readily maintain a range of
problems, especially if not routinely rounded up, vaccinated and
treated for parasites. However, it would be unlikely that these
animals are not owned and, thus, will be branded if only to limit
rustling. If that is the case, there will be annual collections to
brand new young stock, culling to meet family debts and to sell
selected unbroken horses. Farmers there are reluctant to vaccinate
animals, preferring to let them graze at large on the extensive wild
expanses of the Delta. Thus, it would seem that the problem may be
wider than claimed by the Romanian authorities. On the other hand,
they may just have lost all patience with the owners' lack of
responsibility. - Mod.MHJ]
