_Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) was confirmed by the [University of Massachusetts] on pepper [capsicum] seedlings grown in a greenhouse. Symptoms of INSV on pepper include leaf distortion and tan or brown lesions that may or may not be circular. Wilting and necrosis of meristems may also occur.

Management starts with discarding infected plants. Monitor and manage thrips populations in the greenhouse. Carefully inspect all incoming plant material for disease symptoms and thrips. Vegetable transplants and susceptible ornamentals should be grown in separate greenhouses. Keep the greenhouse free of weeds, as many species can harbor both INSV and the thrips that transmit it.

[_Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) was considered a strain of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus _Orthotospovirus_, previously _Tospovirus_) but has since been classified as a separate species in the genus. It has a wide host range and is of significant economic importance for many crop and ornamental hosts. The virus is widely distributed in Europe and North America and has also been identified in a few locations elsewhere. Both INSV and TSWV are transmitted by the western flower thrips vector _Frankliniella occidentalis_.

Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species, which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs, and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, as well as use of resistant crop cultivars. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.
