LOUGHREA, Ireland: Noel Garner, a farmer raising cattle in the
verdant hills of western Ireland, was stunned when BSE disease struck
his small herd a couple months ago. An even bigger shock came a few
days later, when the carcass he had buried at the edge of a pasture
showed up back on his doorstep. Neighbors had driven a mechanized
digger to the grave, unearthed the cow and carted it back to Garner's
place in an old oil barrel. They were afraid that diseased particles
would seep into their water supply, said Gus Egan, who runs the
livestock mart in Loughrea, County Galway. "The people were right,"
he said. "I'd do the same thing."
The case highlights the problem facing European countries as they
initiate mass slaughters to stop BSE and revive collapsed markets: what
to do with the bodies?
The "purchase for destruction" program launched by the 15-nation
European Union this month foresees buying and incinerating up to 2
million head of cattle by the end of June, at an estimated cost to
governments of $1 billion. But implementation has been stymied in
places by logistics as well as ethical concerns about sending so much
prime beef up in smoke. "It's an awful shame and a disgrace," Egan
says, echoing a sentiment heard across Europe. "With all the people
starving all over the world, to destroy perfectly good meat ..."
New evidence that mad cow disease had spread from Britain to
continental herds prompted EU leaders last month to adopt mandatory
testing for cattle over 30 months. Any animal that isn't confirmed free
of BSE can't go to market.
Germany, which started testing 3 weeks early, has found only 16 cases
out of more than 112 000 tests conducted. Belgium found 2 in 7550
tests. Ireland has had more cases -- almost 600 since 1987 -- than any
country outside Britain. But of 17 500 tests so far this month, not one
revealed BSE, according to Irish Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh.
Yet the wide-scale testing has led to isolated discoveries of BSE in
places that had considered themselves pristine, including an Italian
slaughterhouse that supplies McDonald's. Thus, a measure meant to
reassure Europeans has actually heightened fears of eating infected
meat and contracting the fatal, brain-wasting, new variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease. Beef sales have tumbled by 27 percent across the EU --
and as much as 50 percent in some countries. Many non-EU countries
have suspended imports altogether. Because sales are down, vast
numbers of healthy cattle must be slaughtered just to prevent
oversupply.
Ireland, a country with twice as many cows as people, usually exports
90 percent of the 550 000 tons of beef it produces annually to countries
like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states -- all of which
have enacted temporary bans.
"Farmers have to regularly bring their old cows that are ready for
slaughter to the slaughterhouse, but right now no one is buying them,"
Franz Fischler, the EU agriculture commissioner, explained in an
interview with the German weekly Die Zeit.
Yet the sheer numbers are making even slaughter and disposal difficult.
Lacking enough abattoirs and incinerators, authorities in Portugal's
Azores Islands on Monday postponed the slaughter of some 5000
cattle. They plan to send some of the doomed cattle to the Portuguese
mainland.
Ireland has only a handful of small, private incinerators that handle
hospital and pharmaceutical waste. Since 1997, Irish slaughterhouses
had been shipping the potentially infectious animal parts -- brain,
spinal cord and parts of the intestines -- to the only plant in the country
licensed to deal with it: Monery By-Products in County Cavan. The
plant turns the material into powdery meal and liquid tallow. Until last
month these were shipped to Germany for incineration. But now EU
rules require the entire intestine to be treated as "specified risk
material," trebling the weight of material Monery has to process. The
plant, which is licensed to handle 1000 tons a week, had to stop
accepting shipments last week because of backlogs. Officials made
emergency arrangements to blast-freeze and store the guts until Monery
can catch up.
Meanwhile, the thousands of carcasses slaughtered under "purchase for
destruction" are also waiting to be processed. In the first week, Ireland
slaughtered 4000 cattle under the scheme, and expects to cull 300 000
of its national herd of 7.5 million. Currently they are being frozen until
they can be rendered into meal. That will then have to be warehoused
until an incinerator is built -- something that could take years given
traditional opposition from environmental groups and neighbors.
Walsh, the Irish agriculture minister, predicts the 50 000 tons of meal in
storage will swell to 200 000 tons in 6 months. And the cost to Irish
taxpayers -- not counting building an incinerator -- will likely approach
$170 million, he said.

New French Testing Scheme Yields First Case
-----------------------------------
PARIS: France reported 4 new cases of mad cow disease on Monday,
including the first detected under a new testing scheme for all cattle
aged over 30 months that are destined for the food chain.
The first case unveiled by the testing programme, which the
government launched earlier this month to calm consumer fears about
the fatal, brain-wasting illness, involved an animal born in 1995 in the
Ain region of eastern France. Since the new system began on 2 Jan,
laboratories have conducted more than 71 000 tests. The new findings
brought to 10 the total number of cases of mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), found this year in France. A total
of 162 cases were found in 2000. Concern over the disease, which
scientists believe can be passed to humans via infected meat products,
sparked consumer panic last year in France. The government then
banned meat and bone meal in animal feed, took T-bone steaks off
menus and instituted health tests for cattle.

Madrid: In Northern Spain, 2 new suspected cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- commonly known as Mad Cow
Disease -- were detected, Navarra regional Agriculture and Livestock
advisor Ignacio Martinez Alfaro said Monday. Post-mortem testing on
2 Pyrenean cows slaughtered in the town of Orcoyen "almost certainly"
proved that the animals were affected with BSE, he said. The cattle --
two cows aged 6 and 7 [years -- came from farms in northern Navarra.
The initial test results will have to be confirmed by the official national
regulating laboratory, he noted.
Martinez Alvaro said the cases concern a native Navarra cattle breed.
He emphasized that if these cases, which if verified would raise the
number of confirmed BSE cases in Spain to 9, were detected, it is
because "the controls are working."
The final results on the 2 [prior suspected cases in Castilla-Leon and
Cantabria will be released Wednesday. The Cantabria case has
triggered controversy in the beef sector since the affected animal was
[only just over 2 years old. National BSE laboratory director Juan Jose
Badiola said Monday that it was not "convenient" for the time being to
reduce the age of required testing for cattle in Spain from 30 months.
Badiola noted that since the affected animal came from France and
arrived in Spain shortly before the ban on French cattle imports went
into effect, from the point of view of
prevention the case "doesn't belong to Spain: we presume she was
infected when she was a calf."

FDA Advisers Urge 'Mad Cow' Rules for Tissue Donors
-----------------------------------------------------
BETHESDA, MD: A slight majority of advisers to the US Food and
Drug Administration (news - web sites) (FDA) on Friday urged the
agency to come up with rules to describe whether, or when, people
exposed to "mad cow'' disease could donate bodily tissues. "Our
marginal, but definitive decision is that the FDA should have deferral
criteria," said Paul Brown, chairman of the Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, and an expert on bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease from the National Institutes
of Neurological Disorders and Strokes. But the committee did not
make any more specific recommendations, saying it did not have
enough data.
The concern is that someone who had eaten beef contaminated with
BSE might harbor the human form of mad cow disease, called variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and transmit it through donated tissues such
as skin or corneas. The panel was not asked to consider organ
donation.
It is possible that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) can be
passed through blood. But so far, there have been no documented
cases of a tissue recipient contracting vCJD. "Clearly, the committee is
at a loss because we simply don't know," said Brown, adding, "the
question is whether the FDA wants to get involved in anything with so
little scientific data."
The agency usually follows its panels' recommendations. Some
physicians on the panel suggested that transplant surgeons could
discuss the tissue's origin with the patient. For instance, if it is known,
the surgeon could disclose that a cornea donor had lived in the United
Kingdom -- a high-risk area for exposure to BSE.
The committee also discussed requiring testing of deceased donors'
brain tissue for evidence of vCJD when they are being considered for
tissue donation. But an FDA official pointed out that there is no vCJD
test approved by the agency. When that test, in development, is
approved, the agency would consider requiring it to be used, said Jay
Epstein, director of FDA's Office of Blood Research and Review.
