A 40-year-old woman died of H5N1 avian flu in Upper Egypt's governorate of Sohag Tues [23 Jun 2015], undersecretary of the Ministry of Health for preventive medicine Amr Qandil told Youm7.

During the past 3 months, 3 new human cases of H5N1 infection were detected, of which 1 was fatal and the other 2 are being hospitalized, Qandil said.

Most avian flu cases in Egypt have been detected in impoverished rural areas, where villagers are accustomed to raising poultry on the rooftops of their homes to supplement their diet, Ahmed Abdel Hamed, a former Health Ministry official previously told Youm7.

On 29 Mar 2015, a 27-year-old woman died of bird flu in Upper Egypt's governorate of Sohag, marking the 15th death in the country from the disease in 2015, Youm7 reported.

The Health Ministry has repeatedly urged citizens who deal with poultry and livestock to be cautious and take preventive measures to avoid infection. It also called on those who suffer from symptoms of the flu to head to the nearest hospital within 24 hours to increase chances of their recovery.

According to the State Information Service (SIS), around 2 million Egyptians directly deal with poultry; either by working in the poultry industry or raising poultry in their homes. In both cases, they are outside the scope of supervision by the ministries of agriculture and health.

The disease initially appeared in Egypt in 2006. The death toll from bird flu in the country reached 10 in 2014. From 2003 until October 2014, there were 686 cases testing positive for H5N1 globally, of which 393 people have died, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report published in October [2014].

[The last report on H5N1 in Egypt posted by ProMED mail -- Avian influenza, human (107): WHO assessment 20150521.3376485 -- stated that "From 2003 through 1 May 2015, 840 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 16 countries. Of these cases, 447 have died." See the ProMED post for more.

FluTrackers [https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/egypt/h5n1-tracking-egypt/720309-egypt-2015-who-moh-provincial-health-depts-h5n1-confirmed-case-list] accounts for 145 cases in 2015 alone in Egypt, clearly a dramatic increase in human cases of H5N1 avian flu in this country, 152 cases including China. The number of cases since November 2014 has exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. The number of deaths is unclear, ranging from reports 15 H5N1 deaths in Egypt as of 29 Mar 2015 (according to this report) to 33 deaths as indicated by WHO numbers 9 April [2015]. A panel of experts feels this is likely not related to virus mutations or changing epidemiology but rather to more people becoming exposed to infected poultry. While the warmer months this time of the year dampen transmission, it appears cases of H5N1 continue to occur, or at the least are being reported. This level of avian-to-human influenza virus transmission must be closely monitored because of the public health threat it presents, yet reports have been sparse and difficult to follow.
