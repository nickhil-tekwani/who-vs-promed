Pathanamthitta has reported the 3rd largest number of leptospirosis cases in the State [Kerala] as of Thursday [12 Jul 2018]. Prolonged waterlogging and callous dumping of waste in public places have made the situation worse.

Health Department sources told The Hindu that 109 cases had been reported from different parts of the district between [1 Jan and 11 Jul 2018]. Of these, 74 cases have been clinically confirmed as leptospirosis, and the remaining 35 are suspected leptospirosis cases.

Leptospirosis claimed 5 lives in the district this year [2018]. In the same period last year [2017], 63 leptospirosis cases and 4 deaths due to the disease were reported. Thiruvananthapuram district also has reported 164 leptospirosis cases and 14 deaths this year [2018], and Kozhikode has had 178 cases and 7 deaths, sources said.

Most of the leptospirosis cases have been found in persons who work in waterlogged areas. Experts say the increasing number of leptospirosis cases in the district is due to the absence of any proper waste-disposal mechanism. Irresponsible dumping of waste in public places and the polluted water in clogged canals and other stagnant water bodies have made many parts of the district a breeding ground for rodents and flies.

Contamination of fresh water sources like rivers and canals because of callous dumping of waste from chicken corners, slaughter houses, hotels, and markets has become a major pollution problem in many parts of the district. Dumping of all sorts of waste by the panchayats [village councils in India] and municipalities in the towns and heavily populated areas is testimony to the criminal negligence of the authorities concerned toward public health, alleges Thomas P. Thomas, academic and environmentalist.

It should be noted that Pathanamthitta was the worst hit by chikungunya virus 14 years ago, and the promise given then by the health authorities and the government to initiate effective preventive steps against the outbreak of any vector-borne disease has proved to be hollow, further alleged Dr. Thomas.

[The news report says that the diagnosis of leptospirosis was "confirmed" clinically in most patients, implying that the diagnosis was not based on laboratory testing. Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of the leptospirosis, that is, many of the symptoms and signs can also be seen with other diseases, the diagnosis of leptospirosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can provide _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a disaster (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

Pathanamthitta is a city and capital of Pathanamthitta district, with a population of 37 538 residents, located in the Central Travancore region in the state of Kerala, southern India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathanamthitta).
