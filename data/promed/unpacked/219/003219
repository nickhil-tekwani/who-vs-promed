The moderators' apt comments in this post reiterate the need to address rabies as a regional transboundary disease One Health challenge. And urgently too.

As we approach World Rabies day [28 Sep 2022], the post reminds us of the complex challenges in the path to achieve zero dog-mediated rabies death by 2030. Having observed rabies trends in the region for more than 20 years, and given the current backdrop of pandemic COVID-19 and globalized monkeypox, this wake up call is being made to reflect over our commitment to combat 'lower hanging fruit' old timers like rabies.

Uncontrolled stray dog populations, war-linked or not, are growing in disturbing numbers almost everywhere in the region especially in the Arabian Peninsula where avoidable human-stray dog clashes inclusive of gun violence took place as recent as last July [2022].

The outlook is grim. Recent, repeated fox sightings in various urban areas (including personal sightings) point to continued anthropogenic ecological disruptions creating more wildlife-human interface and spillover event opportunities. Even grimmer: unlike the jackals mentioned in the post, huge numbers of commensal hamadryas baboon (_Papio hamadryas_) are migrating and have reached cities far from their original Southern base. While the authorities are addressing the ensuing human-baboon conflicts, especially on farms, pathogen spillover can occur: the interaction of these baboons with foxes, stray dogs and cats at garbage dumps and farms where they compete for food provide the interface for such possible events. Rabies positive baboons, as well as a rock hyrax (_Procavia capensis_) have been reported. Prior to this new migratory trend, these baboons traditionally occupy niches in large swathes of the Southwest of the Arabian Peninsula.

More permutations, albeit even more discouraging, can be written. We have shown that bats with potential spillover pathogens (e.g. rotaviruses) interact with humans through swimming pools and trees built literally in modified desert settings. Bats are endemic in the region, and despite being classical reservoirs of lyssaviruses (and other pandemic candidate pathogens) that interact with the above mentioned fauna and more, they remain poorly researched and integrated into a One Health response.

The excellent reference in the post (https://tinyurl.com/3mup3rek) re-emphasizes that molecular characterization of strains involved in animal and human outbreaks is crucial in deciphering spillover trends, used to fine-tune prevention and control interventions. Molecular characterization of rabies strains from baboons, rock hyrax and a sandcat [see comment], will provide information on how these first-time rabies positive wild fauna, in Saudi Arabia, became spillover victims.

With huge numbers of baboons in the Southwest of the Arabian Peninsula (estimated to be between 350 000 and over 3 million, depending on source) and even greater numbers of stray cats, we may be having a ticking bomb scenario. To avoid this, a true One Health approach is required urgently. One group of collaborators that should not be excluded are volunteer animal rescuers active in the region. These volunteers, bring much needed passion, dedication and expertise into the direly needed but humane control of animal populations (TNR or Trap-Neuter-Release is a classic example) but not at the expense of animal welfare. I have been privileged to work with some of them. Positively, the tourism inertia in some countries in the region could drive the One Health paradigm needed to avert a monkeypox-like rabies crisis. The time to act is now.

Back to this specific case: was the child bitten and/or scratched? Some people, including health care workers, assume scratches (especially from cats) are harmless -- not requiring post exposure prophylaxis. In one such case, such an assumption precluded a scratch victim from getting post exposure prophylaxis, with an eventual fatal outcome.

[Dr Shamsudeen Fagbo is thanked for his insightful complementary comments.

Information on animal rabies in Saudi Arabia is included in a 2019 open-access paper. (Kasem S, Hussein R, Al-Doweriej A, et al. Rabies among animals in Saudi Arabia. J Inf & Pub Health 12 (3), May-June 2019, 445-447. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034118301564?via%3Dihub)

With few exceptions, rabies circulation among domestic, stray and wild animals in the Middle East has been considered, since decades, to be underreported. This is also reflected in ProMED's reporting. Since ProMED-mail's inauguration (1994), there have been no rabies reports from Jordan. Lebanon's 1st report has been just published. There were 2 reports from Egypt (both in 2021) and Syria (2013, 2015); one from Iraq (2004; 2 additional reports addressed cases originating in Iraq, identified in the USA in 2008) and just one case, identified in Canada in February 2022, originating/infected in Iran.

Hopefully, the exemplary recent media-derived information from Lebanon, and the above first-hand background/information from Saudi Arabia, kindly provided by Dr Fagbo, will be followed by others. - Mod.AS
