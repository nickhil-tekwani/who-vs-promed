Minister Closes Auckland And Campbell Islands
Conservation Minister Nick Smith today formally closed the Auckland and
Campbell Islands to visitors in response to potential risks to human
health, from the mystery illness that has caused mass fatalities of New
Zealand (Hooker) sea lions.
"It is wise to take a cautious approach, given that scientists have not yet
identified the cause of the sea lion deaths. I have sought and received
advice on the potential risks to humans. The advice from public health
authorities, including the Ministry of Health, Massey University and
Southern Public Health, is that the risk is low, particularly if the cause
of death is a virus or biotoxin. There is a greater uncertainty however, if
the cause is bacteria. They have recommended that until more information is
known, access for all non-essential persons be restricted".
The Minister said that one domestic and two international tourist boats
were planning visits to the island nature reserves this month, and the
Department has been advised to not permit landings. This will also reduce
the risk of tourists spreading any disease from one island to another.
"Advice has also been sought on the potential risks to scientific staff
working on the problem and squid fishermen who may come into contact with
sick or dying sea lions. Suitable precautions are being taken to minimise
these risks".
"It is our desire that tours be able to resume as soon as possible. Every
effort is being made to identify the cause of the fatalities and as more
information becomes available, the situation will be reviewed. When the
situation has returned to normal, tours will be allowed to return".

It might lead up a blind alley, but I wondered if the researchers were
testing for chemical pollutants in the waters around these islands? I am
currently a masters student at Tulane's School of Public Health, but
previously was a consultant in hazardous and nuclear waste disposal policy.
Some of the symptoms rang a bell, especially the skin lesions and lymphatic
pus. I have no idea what chemicals or toxic substances might affect sea
lions in such a way, but I remember that many old mining sites had similar
associated health problems whenever water runoff was involved (rainwater
leaching the tailings from the mining site).
I also remember a similar story running around 1989, involving Amazonian
Indians who had strange lesions (boil-like) after mining leachate was
dumped in their area of the river.
So far, I cannot put my hands on any articles about this subject. I will
continue to look (I have just moved, and all my files are still in boxes).
