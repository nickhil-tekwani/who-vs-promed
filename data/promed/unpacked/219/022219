The anthrax death toll [in hippos] in Liwonde has risen to 48 from 45, and officials say the situation is now under control. Director of parks and wildlife Brighton Kunchedwa says that, although the death toll has risen by three, the situation on the ground is that everything is under control. "We have managed to contain the disease. Death is not a daily occurrence as was the case before. There has not been an outbreak of anthrax outside the Liwonde National Park," Kunchedwa said.

Anthrax attacks hippos and is transmitted to people through consumption of the hippo food.

There are at least 2000 hippos in the national park. Kunchedwa said the disease has mainly been contained because of the ban of consumption of bush meat as well as the ban on the movement of the bush meat in the south and eastern regions.

"We are also doing daily surveillance by air to identify hippo carcasses; this is helping a lot," he said. The parks and wildlife director added that the onset of the rains has reduced the spread of the disease drastically, saying the over-flooding water helps to wash away the bacteria that causes the disease.

[Let us hope that the director of parks and wildlife Brighton Kunchedwa is correct that there will be no more hippo deaths in the Liwonde National Park. Experience has taught me that one must not relax when the deaths seem to have stopped. You must remember that nature is illiterate and does not know what she should be doing. With 48 carcasses bleeding and scavenged before they were buried, there will be a lot of bloody, salty soil out there for hungry animals to lick. It happens. Fortunately, the rainy season has started, and this will help. I am glad to see that they followed the Canadian wood bison custom of aerial surveillance to check for any new carcasses. This allows one to search wide and more efficiently. Now to work out how and why this outbreak started, and from where.
