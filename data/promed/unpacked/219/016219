[If the source of the infection in this outbreak was a contaminated site in the pasture, I hope that this may be confirmed by sampling the soil at that presumed (grave?) site. Also as mentioned previously the gene strain should match those of previous cultures for this area if they have them archived. In my experience with _B. anthracis_ recovered from contaminated soil sites, the gene strains are almost perfect indicators of where it is happening. In Texas we found it matched ranch for ranch or neighboring ranch.

How this outbreak occurred suggests that there was possibly a soil disturbance on the farm, bringing spores to the surface. Rain can also do this.

I hope that the veterinary authorities are initiating a vaccination programme for this farm and its neighboring farms so that there are no recurrences. This should be for a minimum of 3-5 years, with strict and active surveillance. With thanks to my colleague Cristina. - Mod.MHJ
