The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Concord infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on bacteria isolated from ill people showed that they were closely relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 28 Nov 2018, 5 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Concord have been reported from 3 states.

State / Number of ill people
Hawaii / 1
Michigan / 1
New York / 3
--------
Total 5

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 16 Jun 2018 to 18 Oct 2018. Ill people range in age from 17 to 52 years, with a median age of 30 years. Sixty percent of ill people are male. Of the 5 people with information available, no hospitalizations or deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis did not predict any antimicrobial resistance in _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from 3 ill people. Testing of clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Investigation of the outbreak
------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that tahini products from Achdut Ltd. are the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. All 5 ill people were interviewed and reported eating tahini or hummus made with tahini. Of the 5 ill people, 3 ate tahini or hummus made with tahini in Hawaii and New York. The other 2 ill people traveled to other countries where they ate tahini or hummus made with tahini.

The FDA identified _Salmonella_ Concord in a sample of tahini collected at the point of import. The tahini was Baron's brand manufactured by Achdut Ltd. WGS results showed that the _Salmonella_ strain identified in imported tahini was closely related genetically to the strain identified in the ill people. These results provide more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating tahini products from Achdut Ltd.

On 27 Nov 2018, Achdut Ltd. recalled tahini products because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. The FDA website has a list of the tahini products that were recalled. Consumers who have any recalled tahini products in their homes should not eat them. Return them to the store for a refund or throw them away. Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell recalled tahini products or products made with them, such as hummus.

This investigation is ongoing, and the CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from sesame seeds include hummus and halvah. Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products produced from sesame seeds. As reported in a previous ProMED posting (Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between 1985 and 2001 the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia has recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and halvah, on 30 occasions. Sesame seed products should be always be considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
