FMD suspected in gaur (Nawegaon National Park, Maharashtra, India)
------------------------------------------------------------------
New Delhi: We have learnt of an ongoing outbreak, suspected to be foot and
mouth disease (FMD), affecting wildlife populations, especially gaur
[species of wild ox, _Bibos gaurus_] in Nawegaon National Park, in
Maharashtra, India. Forest department sources have informed that about 25
gaur have died in the past 3 months. Biological samples for investigation
have been collected and sent to various laboratories for confirmation of FMD.
An outbreak suspected to be FMD was also reported in livestock in villages
on the fringes of the park, before clinical signs were noted in the gaur.
Surprisingly, gaur is the only hoofstock reported to be affected during
this outbreak. The national park is also a refuge for sambar, spotted deer,
nilgai, and a host of other ungulates, which apparently have not shown
signs of disease.
We would appreciate information on vaccination strategies to handle the
outbreak. Are livestock that have already suffered from the outbreak and
recovered a suitable target for vaccination? Note: Vaccination of gaur is
not being contemplated.

[Vaccination of recovered animals might be advised in case more than one
FMD virus strain is involved in the outbreak. We would recommend making the
decision on the vaccination strategy only after laboratory confirmation has
been made and the the virus(es) have been subtyped. Experienced subscribers
are invited to post their comments. - Mod.AS]
