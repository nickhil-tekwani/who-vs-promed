[The identification of HPAI H5N8 in an open range poultry holding in the state of Kano, northwestern Nigeria, reflects the spread of this highly infectious virus strain, already circulating in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, in a southwestern direction into West Africa. In view of the information about the possible source of this outbreak in an animal market, it may be assumed that the virus is already widely circulating. In case it follows the footsteps (or rather areal path/flyway) of the recent HPAI events in Nigeria, namely the HPAI H5N1 epizootics, the H5N8 spread into central Nigeria and in other countries in the region should not be a surprise.

Two HPAI H5N1 epizootics have been circulating in Nigeria during the last 2 years. The larger one started on 2 Jan 2015 in northern Nigeria, spreading to the central parts of the country. A total of 395 (submitted) outbreaks have been reported as of 28 Nov 2016, the date of Nigeria's most recent follow-up report (No. 43) to the OIE on this event. According to the summarised archived data on OIE's WAHID interface, the accumulated statistics at that date were the following:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered Birds / 2 154 929 / 161 169 / 158 731 / 1 911 605 / 258.

Data on all reported outbreaks of this event and a map with their respective locations are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000021700_20161128_193307.pdf.

Another epizootic of HPAI H5N1 started on 24 Dec 2014 in southwest Nigeria, causing, as of 21 Nov 2016, a total of 104 outbreaks. According to the summarised archived data on OIE's WAHID interface, the accumulated statistics at that date were the following:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 867 298 / 108 470 / 107 716 / 668 049 / 0

See archived OIE summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000021616_20161121_160012.pdf.

HPAI H5N1 has been spreading in other West African countries, on the western and eastern sides of Nigeria; for a map showing the outbreaks reported since the start of 2015, see OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/hkepfvp (click on the west African cluster, zoom in).

Now, with the identification of HPAI H5N8, this highly infectious strain may cause additional, serious losses regionally. Luckily, H5N8 has not been found to be zoonotic so far. - Mods.AS/CRD
