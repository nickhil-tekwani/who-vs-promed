[The total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in South Korea is now 180, including 29 deaths -- representing an increase of 1 newly confirmed case and 2 newly reported fatalities in the past 24 hours. The reported case fatality rate is now at 16.1 percent. If one reads the daily updates, the numbers of "unstable" patients are listed, and presumably these are the patients who are in critical condition - as of the time of this report, the number of such patients is 15.

The newly confirmed case is a 4th generation case. The range of dates during which there was probable exposure to another MERS-CoV infected individual was 8-12 Jun 2015 -- a later date than previously described for other cases, suggesting continued transmission in healthcare environments longer than previously hoped for.

Of note is that Samsung hospital and Konkut University Medical Centre have both closed their services to new patients in an attempt to interrupt transmission related to contact with MERS-CoV infected patients.

[2] South Korea: non-hospital based transmission - media report

South Korea reported 4 more cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome Wednesday [24 Jun 2015, see MERS-CoV (76): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, WHO 20150624.3459401 for details], while announcing that it has placed 298 more people under quarantine to prevent possible infection.

The Health Ministry also reported the nation's 1st MERS case that occurred outside of hospitals, which may be a sign that community transmissions of the disease have taken place in the country.

As of Wednesday [24 Jun 2015] afternoon, the virus has killed 27 people and infected 179. No death was reported on the same day, although 16 patients are currently in unstable condition. Meanwhile, 13 more patients have been discharged from hospitals, raising the total number of recovered individuals to 67.

According to health authorities, the nation's 175th patient is believed to have been infected by his late wife, the 118th patient, who died from MERS on [13 Jun 2015], while staying at home together.

His late wife was infected by the 14th patient while caring for her husband, who had been hospitalized at the Good Morning Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, for pneumonia from [23-29 May 2015]. After being discharged, he and his 67-year-old wife were placed under quarantine together at home until [10 Jun2015], the day the wife was officially diagnosed with MERS. She died 3 days later.

The 175th patient, 75, had been asymptomatic even after his wife's death, but started experiencing fever on [21 Jun 2015]. He was officially diagnosed with MERS earlier this week. Considering the maximum incubation period of MERS is 14 days, the Health Ministry said it is most likely that the 175th patient was infected by his late wife at home, not at the hospital in Pyeongtaek.

While concerns are rising over the possibility of community-transmission of MERS, the World Health Organization assured on Friday [19 Jun 2015]that the risk to the general public is low.

"Even if transmission spills over into the general community, such cases are not likely to sustain further transmission," Dr. Margaret Chan, the director-general of WHO, told reporters in Seoul last week.
