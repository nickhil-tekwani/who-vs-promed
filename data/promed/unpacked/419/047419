Eight people were allegedly infected with anthrax in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region due to a suspected outbreak of the sheep and cattle disease, which has killed 9 cows. Authorities in Horqin district, Tongliao, announced on [Sun 12 Aug 2018] that since [7 Aug 2018], 9 cows have died in Shengli village, which were diagnosed with an alleged anthrax infection, the Xinhua News Agency reported on [Mon 13 Aug 2018].

The 8 infected people were taken to a hospital for treatment and are in stable condition, the report said.

The immunization and disinfection at Shengli village were completed and the dead cattle were properly treated. The suspected outbreak has been contained, Xinhua reported.

Like cow and sheep, cattle could easily get infected by the anthrax bacteria, while people can develop cutaneous anthrax when people handle infected animals or contaminated animal products like meat or hair, Horqin authorities were quoted as saying in the report.

Inner Mongolia province of China lies along the southern border of Mongolia; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_pol01.jpg. There are 5 cities named Horqin, 5 places named Shengli, but Tongliao can be found at: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/20/Tongliao.html.

Anthrax is sporadic in Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol) with outbreaks in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, and the suspect -- vaccine outbreak in 2015 (see Unexplained death, livestock - China: (NM) vaccine suspected, RFI 20151106.3772562). It is not unusual for the outbreaks to involve cattle and sheep. If you are running both species it would not be unexpected for a couple of sheep to be curious about a dead cow and lick some of the salty extravasated blood, and thus get infected. - Mod.MHJ]
