[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States, most reports on West Nile virus
infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at
regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the
volume of such reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range, and events of
special significance will be posted immediately on receipt. - Mod.CP]

Illinois: Kane County Bird Positive for West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------------
SPRINGFIELD: A dead crow collected in northwestern Kane County has been
confirmed as the first bird in the Midwest to test positive this year for
West Nile virus (WNV), Dr. John R. Lumpkin, state public health director,

McHenry, and Will) tested positive for the virus last year. In addition, 2
