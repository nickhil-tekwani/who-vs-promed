----------------------------------------------------------------------
The report of confirmed cases of chikungunya (CHIK) viral infection on the island of Niolam (Lihir) is certainly of interest and concern. Lihir is a relatively, isolated and small volcanic island (about 240 sq km) [about 93 sq mi] near the furthest edge of the Bismarck Archipelago, east of New Ireland Island. It is also the site of a large mining operation that employs many people from outside the immediate region and PNG. The site's relative isolation obviously speaks to a recent introduction of the virus from returning workers or residents.

The island is also home to dense populations of _Aedes (Stegomyia)_ mosquitoes, particularly _Aedes albopictus_, a species capable of transmitting CHIK virus. What is unclear from the report is whether the 2 infections were acquired locally or were possibly imported. A follow-up epidemiological investigation of recent travel history of both patients as well as possible undetected infections near the index cases would be welcomed information.

The 2012 outbreak that occurred in Vanimo, a town located along the northern coast (West Sepik District) on the main island of New Guinea, is very near the border with Papua (formerly Irian Jaya) Province, Indonesia and the city of Jayapura, the administrative capital. The regular traffic into and out of Jayapura from elsewhere in Indonesia (known CHIK virus endemic areas) and the regular cross-border exchanges with PNG may have likely been the original source of the virus into Vanimo. However, there have been no reported confirmed cases of CHIK in Papua Province.

The ability to more accurately/conveniently diagnose infection and derive phylogenetic profiling of viral isolates adds greatly to our ability to determine likely origin of introduced CHIK virus into previously virgin territory.

[It would be interesting to know the travel histories of the 2 individuals who became ill on Lihir Island, and if their chikungunya virus infections were acquired locally or elsewhere. ProMED-mail thanks Michael Banks for his comments, pointing out that the area's population is very mobile with individuals coming into Papua New Guinea from CHIK virus endemic areas.
