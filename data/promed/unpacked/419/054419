The United States has been experiencing a record number of measles cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Authorities have confirmed 592 cases between 1 Jan and 29 Aug 2014, a jump caused mainly by parents refusing to vaccinate their children, according to the latest monthly report from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest figures from summer continue a troubling trend reported in May 2014 when the US recorded 288 cases of measles since January 2014, the most in a 5-month period since 1994.

18 outbreaks have accounted for 89 percent of the cases this year [2014]. Outbreaks are being driven by unvaccinated people, primarily US residents, contracting measles in other countries, bringing the virus back to the US and spreading it to others in communities with relatively low vaccination rates. California parents are deciding against vaccinating their kindergarten-age children at twice the rate they did 7 years ago, according to the Los Angeles Times. The growth in personal-belief exemptions was particularly prevalent at private schools, it reported.

"Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa; travellers with measles continue to bring the disease into the US," said a release from the CDC's National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases. "Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the US where groups of people are unvaccinated." Around the world, about 20 million people are infected each year, and 122 000 die, according to the CDC. Before vaccines were introduced, nearly every child in the US contracted the disease by the age of 15. About 3 million to 4 million people were infected annually. Of those, the disease killed between 450 and 500 people each year, put 48 000 in the hospital, caused 7000 to have seizures and left 1000 with permanent hearing or brain damage. Infants and children under one-year-old are at greater risk of developing serious cases of measles. The CDC recommends children over 12 months old receive what is known as the "MMR," or measles, mumps and rubella, vaccinations. The CDC recommends children older than 6 months old who will travel abroad receive the vaccines.

Measles Outbreak in an Unvaccinated Family and a Possibly Associated International Traveler, Orange County, Florida, December 2012-January 2013. (By Tania A. Slade, et al.)

[Interested readers are recommended to read the full text at the source URL.]

High population immunity to measles, which has been achieved through vaccination, combined with rapid public health responses to cases, have resulted in the elimination of endemic measles in the United States since 2000. Failure to vaccinate is one of the most frequent preventable causes of measles outbreaks among U.S. children. Unvaccinated persons continue to be at risk for measles infection.

Four children in a Florida family were diagnosed with measles in January 2013. None of the 4 were vaccinated against measles, and none had traveled outside of Orange County, Florida during the periods when they likely had been exposed. A 5th case of measles was later reported in a Brazilian citizen who had become ill while vacationing in Florida at the same time as the 1st Florida patient. The genotype was determined for 3 of the siblings and the Brazilian case; all were identical. The investigation detected no additional cases and suggested that visits to the same theme park might have resulted in an unknown, common exposure.

What are the implications for public health practice? Sources of measles exposure can be difficult to identify for measles cases. Destinations popular among domestic and international visitors might serve as important sources of exposure. Children should be vaccinated against measles routinely. Clinicians should be educated on the recognition and diagnosis of measles and should consider measles diagnoses in persons with no or unknown vaccination history and compatible symptoms. Rapid identification is critical to effective public health response.

The Ohio outbreak that helped push the annual number of U.S. measles cases to its highest total since 1996 appears to have ended, according to state health officials. The state logged 377 cases of the highly contagious viral respiratory illness in 9 counties since March 2014 in the outbreak, and 9 people were hospitalised. The end of such an outbreak is measured 42 days after the onset of the most recent case, a window based on 2, 21-day incubation periods. Ohio has passed that mark because the most recent onset date was 23 Jul 2014.

"In [a viral disease] like this, it could appear anytime, so we're not looking to say it's over," Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman Melanie Amato said. "We're just saying the incubation period has passed, so it's a great sign that measles has moved on."

Health officials determined the Ohio outbreak started among Amish in Knox County who had traveled to the Philippines, which has had a measles epidemic. At least 592 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year [2014], and many of those cases have a connection to the Philippines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Local public health officials are investigating a confirmed case of measles infection in a traveler who was at Sea-Tac Airport [Seattle International airport] during the contagious period. The traveler was likely exposed to measles outside of the United States.

Most people in our area have immunity to the measles through vaccination, so the risk to the general public is low. However, all persons who were in the following locations around the same time as the individual with measles should: Find out whether they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously; Call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash between 13-27 Sep 2014. To avoid possibly spreading measles to other patients, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling 1st to tell them you want to be evaluated for measles.

Before receiving the measles diagnosis, the traveler was at Sea-Tac Airport and the Courtyard Seattle Federal Way Hotel's restaurant, The Bistro. Anyone who was at Sea-Tac Airport or The Bistro during the following times was possibly exposed to measles. [The times can be determined by accessing the original report at the source URL]. If you were at either of these locations during the times listed and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between 13-27 Sep 2014.

Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from approximately 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age and those with weakened immune systems.

[5] USA (Vaccination deficit)

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection and one of the leading causes of childhood death globally, despite the wide availability of an efficacious vaccination. What's more disturbing is that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) say measles in the United States has hit record numbers in 2014, and the blame lies directly with unvaccinated individuals.

"The current increase in measles cases is being driven by unvaccinated people, primarily U.S. residents who got measles in other countries, brought the virus back to the United States, and spread it to others in communities where many people are not vaccinated," Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement. "Many of the clusters in the U.S. began following travel to the Philippines, where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013."

While travel may be to blame for the start of measles outbreaks in the U.S., it's unvaccinated individuals who are fueling the spread. Some of those individuals do not know the importance of vaccination, but others are against vaccines for themselves and their children. A report from IFL Science indicates in 2014, more parents opted out of vaccinating their children than any other year, and now measles cases have hit a 20-year record.

"We have schools in California where the percent of children who exercise the personal belief exemption is well above 50 percent," Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the California Department of Public Health's Center for Infectious Diseases, told the LAT. "That's going to be a challenge for any disease that is vaccine preventable." Approximately 950 kindergartens in California have vaccine exemption rates exceeding 8 percent, which experts indicate is the critical number to maintain herd immunity. Herd immunity is vaccinating the majority to also protect the small number of those who are not immunized. When the numbers hit 8 percent or higher, the number of unprotected children is too large for herd immunity to be effective. To make matters worse, the CDC states that most doctors don't know what measles presents like in clinic, because for so many years, measles was considered an eradicated disease.

People planning to travel to China or Southeast Asia should take precautions against measles amid a surging number of cases of the viral infection being reported in those regions, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Monday [8 Sep 2014]. Taiwan confirmed the year's [2014] 19th case last week in a 24-year-old man who had visited the Philippines in mid-August 2014, the CDC said. Besides that Southeast Asian country, cases have been reported in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam, the CDC said, urging travelers to these areas to pay close attention to their personal hygiene.

In China, the Philippines and Viet Nam, the epidemic is especially severe this year [2014] compared with 2013, the CDC warned, adding that there have been tens of thousands of cases documented in the 3 countries. Travelers to affected areas should seek medical treatment if they develop symptoms such as fever, nasal inflammation or rash, the CDC said.

The measles virus infects the respiratory system, immune system and skin. Symptoms usually occur 7 to 14 days after exposure to an infected person.

Health authorities in Papua New Guinea's Madang Province are urging people to seek medical assistance immediately if they think they might have measles. At least 10 children in the area have died from the virus already, while there have been more than 1700 confirmed cases. Madang's Director of Health, Marcus Kachau, says the provincial health department is already doing a lot to contain the situation, but he's worried the outbreak will only get worse if it's not managed properly.
