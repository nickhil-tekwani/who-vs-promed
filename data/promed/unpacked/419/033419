The dengue fever epidemic is continuing into its fifth month throughout
Fiji, with 24,780 suspected cases and 1,708 hospitalisations reported from
Ministry of Health facilities since it began in late December. Three
percent of the population has been affected to date. While the epidemic
seems to have slowed down considerably in the past month, the virus
continues to be transmitted at a high rate in some areas. The most recent
death due to dengue occurred on 11 April on Kabara Island in the Lau Island
group, bringing the total to 13 since the first death was reported on
December 25th, 1997.
Transmission in the Western Division appears to have slowed greatly thanks
to well organised control efforts. However, dengue cases continue to be
reported and there have been 42 hospital admissions in the last three weeks
for dengue haemorrhagic fever.
The Central Division reports a rise in cases from Naitasiri, a rural
province outside of Suva, and the Eastern Division has noted rises in cases
from Vanua Balavu, Kabara and some other islands. Notably, Kadavu island
has reported very few cases in recent weeks.
In the Northern Division, Labasa Hospital has reported 40 admissions in the
last three weeks, many with at least 34 infections confirmed by laboratory
tests. Unfortunately, other areas in the Northern Division have not
submitted reports during that time period, making the exact picture unclear
in areas of Vanua Levu outside of Labasa and Taveuni.
The public is advised to avoid complacency, to continue activities to
destroy mosquito breeding sites, and to cooperate with government officials
responsible for helping to control the epidemic. Only sustained effort will
effectively reduce the impact of dengue in Fiji, and prevent more avoidable
deaths and hospitalisations.
