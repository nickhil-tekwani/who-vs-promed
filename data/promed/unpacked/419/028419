_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) on tomato plants
---------------------------------------------------------
This report concerns the 1st official findings of TYLCV recorded in
the Netherlands. TYLCV is listed as a harmful organism for the
European Community, which is known to occur in the Community and
specifically regulated on tomato plants intended for planting, other
than seeds. The outbreak was 1st suspected at one company in the
beginning of September [2007] and officially identified at the end of
September [2007]. Currently, findings concern a small number of
companies and a very low number of infected plants (varying between 3
and approximately 20 plants per company). Thus far, no findings have
been recorded at companies producing plantlets intended for sale to
professional growers. The source of the outbreak has not been
identified. A nationwide specific surveillance has been planned to
determine the extent of the outbreak.

Detection has been carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
tests for begomoviruses. The virus was identified as TYLCV by
analysis of the PCR products. Measures at companies are ongoing in
the Netherlands, whereby affected plants are removed and destroyed.
Furthermore, relevant companies have to apply insecticide treatments
aimed at eradicating populations of _B. tabaci_. A hygienic protocol
is required at affected companies for preventing further spread.
Trace-back has been initiated for determining the possible source of
the outbreak.

First report of _Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus_ (TYLCTHV) in Taiwan
------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2006 winter and 2007 spring seasons, tomato lines carrying
the Ty2 gene, which confers resistance to the _Tomato leaf curl
Taiwan virus_ showed severe yellowing, leaf curl, and stunting
symptoms in several locations in Tainan County, Taiwan. Whiteflies
were found to be associated with symptomatic plants, and disease
incidences of almost 100 percent were observed. The presence of a new
resistance breaking begomovirus was suspected.

A total of 6 symptomatic leaf samples of 3 different tomato plants
from each infected field were collected in Liouying (LY3, 7, and 8)
and Sigang (SG9, 13, and 18) townships in Tainan County. Viral DNAs
were extracted and begomoviral DNA-A was detected in all tested
samples, which was 2744 base pairs for both the Liouying and Sigang
isolates. On the basis of their 99.5 percent nucleotide identity,
they are considered isolates of the same species.

The 2 isolates had the highest nucleotide identity (more than 98.4
percent) with the DNA-A of the _Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand
virus_ (TYLCTHV). All samples, except the LY3, were also found to be
infected with _Tomato leaf curl Taiwan virus_ (ToLCTWV).

A pure TYLCTHV isolate of LY3 was obtained in _Lycopersicum
esculentum_ [tomato] TK70 by transmission with _Bemisia tabaci_
biotype B. The isolated TYLCTHV was found to infect _L. esculentum_
H24 (resistant to ToLCTWV) and induce typical yellow leaf curl
symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the presence of
TYLCTHV in Taiwan.

[TYLCV (genus _Begomovirus_, family, _Geminiviridae_) originates from
the Middle East and is one of the most damaging viruses of tomato
(current name _Solanum lycopersicum_, see link below for previous
names and synonyms) worldwide. It can also affect a number of other
solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Infection of tomato causes plants
to be stunted with small chlorotic puckered leaves. Yield losses of
up to 80 percent have been reported, and field cropping of tomatoes
has been abandoned in some areas due to TYLCV. The virus is
transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ in a persistent
manner. It can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation (poorly)
and by grafting, but is not transmitted by contact between plants.
Disease management relies on control of the vector but may cause
problems of chemical residues on the fruit. Tomato cultivars with
increased resistance are available. Transgenic tomato plants
incorporating TYLCV capsid protein genes have been found to be
resistant to the virus.

A number of related begomoviruses exist in the tomato yellow leaf
curl and tomato leaf curl disease complexes, including _Tomato yellow
leaf curl Thailand virus_ and _Tomato leaf curl Taiwan virus_. These
were isolated from different areas and sources and were first thought
to be strains of TYLCV. However, they are now considered separate
species.

Whiteflies are widely distributed and have a very wide host range of
more than 600 plant species. Weed species can serve as reservoirs
making control difficult. The insects cause serious crop damage not
only by direct feeding, but also through transmission of viruses.
They have been reported to transmit over 100 virus species, including
many begomoviruses. _B. tabaci_ is believed to be a species complex
with a number of recognised biotypes varying in their distribution
and vector activities.

Both TYLCV and its whitefly vector are included on the quarantine
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
