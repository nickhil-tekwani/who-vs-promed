NYC HEALTH DEPT. WARNS AGAINST CONSUMPTION OF SOME IMPORTED MEXICAN CHEESES
Products may lead to infection with Mycobacterium bovis, a form of TB found
in cattle; 35 cases including, one infant death in 2004, attributed to M.
bovis tuberculosis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several types of cheese imported from Mexico may be contaminated with
_Mycobacterium bovis_, which causes tuberculosis, according to the New York
City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). The types of cheese,
including queso fresco, may be unpasteurized and may also be illegally
imported from Mexico and sold without approval by the New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets.
The Health Department has identified 35 cases of tuberculosis caused by _M.
bovis_ in city residents between 2001 and 2004. In one of those cases, a
15-month-old child who died in March 2004 was later determined to have died
from complications due to _M. bovis_ infection.
"As a rule, people should not eat food products that are unlabeled or not
labeled in English, as is required by law," said DOHMH Commissioner Thomas
R. Frieden. "Illegally imported food products may not be manufactured or
packaged in compliance with the FDA's strict regulations; consuming these
products may endanger your health. Some people are at higher risk than
others, including pregnant women, newborn babies and children, seniors, and
those with weakened immune systems. If you believe that you or someone you
know has symptoms of TB infection �- including coughing that lasts for 3
weeks or longer, fever or chills, night sweats, loss of appetite and weight
loss -� please see your physician or call 311 to find a Health Department
Chest Center, where we offer free, state-of-the-art TB services."
"Tuberculosis is a serious problem for our children, our families, and our
city," said Brother Joel Magall� Executive Director of Asociacion Tepeyac
de New York, an umbrella group comprising 40 community-based organizations
serving the city's Latin American communities. "By eating illegally
imported foods, we are endangering our health and possibly putting our
lives at risk. We will work with the Health Department to get the word out
in the city's Latin American community: Do not buy or eat these products,
and if you have them in your home, throw them out with the trash."
The Health Department is currently working with the federal Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets, and the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention on an investigation to determine the source of
products associated with this illness in New York City �- targeting stores
that serve the city's Latin American communities, and Mexicans in particular.
Unlabeled or improperly labeled cheese has been obtained for testing from
Mexican grocers in Brooklyn and Queens, as well as directly from Mexico
through a courier. Consumers should avoid eating cheese that is not labeled
or does not have the word "pasteurized" stated clearly on the label. People
who have these products in their homes should not consume them and
immediately dispose of them in the trash.
DOHMH has also alerted physicians and medical institutions to consider the
diagnosis of tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_, and to report suspected
cases to the Health Department's Bureau of TB Control.
Facts about _M. bovis_
--------------------
_M. bovis_ commonly causes disease in cattle and other animals but may cause
illness in humans through eating unpasteurized milk products made from
infected cattle. It is more likely than other TB-causing bacteria to cause
tuberculosis in parts of the body other than the lungs. General symptoms of
_M. bovis_ tuberculosis may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss.
Other symptoms may manifest themselves depending on the part of the body
affected by the disease: e.g., infection of the lungs may be associated
with coughing; lymph node infection may cause swelling in the neck; and
gastrointestinal infection may cause abdominal pain and swelling, as well
as diarrhea. In rare instances, a person may die if the disease is left
untreated.
Symptoms generally appear months to years after infection with _M. bovis_,
but some people may never show signs of illness. A fact sheet on _M. bovis_
can be found at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/tb/tb-mbovis.html.
FDA'S Advisory Concerning Imported "Soft" Cheeses
-------------------------------------------------
According to the FDA, some imported "soft" cheeses originating from Central
American countries, including Mexico, Nicaragua & Honduras, are made from
unpasteurized milk and can cause infectious diseases in addition to TB,
including listeriosis, salmonella poisoning and brucellosis. These products
may then be sold at stores, at flea markets, from the back of trucks, or by
door-to-door salespersons. The FDA's advisory can be found at

Tuberculosis Cases Prompt Warning on Raw-Milk Cheese
----------------------------------------------------
One infant has died and dozens of New Yorkers have contracted tuberculosis
from 2001 through 2004 by eating cheese made from raw milk that was
contaminated with bacteria, city and federal officials said yesterday.
In an alert sent last night to all medical providers in the area, the
city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene warned that several types of
cheese imported from Mexico, particularly queso fresco, might be
contaminated with _Mycobacterium bovis_, which causes tuberculosis.
Alerted about the outbreak by city officials, the federal Food and Drug
Administration issued a warning against eating "any unripened raw-milk soft
cheeses from Mexico, Nicaragua, or Honduras."
Investigators from the city's health department believe that over the 4
years, at least 35 people -- 22 adults and 13 children -- have gotten
tuberculosis from contaminated cheese or raw milk. 7 of the children were
younger than 6 years old. A 15-month-old child who died in March 2004 was
later determined to have died of complications of the disease.
All the adults with tuberculosis were born outside the United States, most
in Mexico. Health officials began an investigation 4 months ago after
determining that all the younger children who had tuberculosis had been
born in the United States, raising the possibility that contaminated
products were crossing the border.
Thomas R. Frieden, the commissioner of the city health department, cited
the surge in the city's Mexican population, to 186 872 in 2000 from 61 722
in 1990, in suggesting that many more New Yorkers today could be exposed to
tainted cheese. "Don't buy or eat or consume milk or cheese products unless
they are clearly labeled in English," Dr. Frieden said.
Cases of tuberculosis from contaminated cheese have been found in all 5 [New
York City] boroughs, and health inspectors are focusing on stores that cater
to Hispanic customers. So far, health officials said, they have taken
improperly labeled or unlabeled cheeses from Mexican grocers in Brooklyn
and Queens.
Health officials are also worried about courier services called paqueter�
that transport food to and from Mexico without going through any inspection
process. The patients interviewed said they also received the food from
family and friends who traveled from Mexico.
The tuberculosis organism is primarily found in cattle but can infect other
animals, including deer, pigs and goats, as well as humans. In people, the
bacterium usually affects areas outside the lungs, but then it cannot be
transmitted through the air.
While tuberculosis is curable, it often goes unrecognized when it is not in
the lungs, which is part of the reason the department issued its alert, Dr.
Frieden said. And, in some cases, _Mycobacterium bovis_ can infect the lungs.
Health investigators in New York City have found that the disease affected
the lungs of 14 patients. So far, their investigation has not found that
any of those patients passed the disease through the air.
Dr. Philip Lobue, a tuberculosis expert at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, said there was a debate in the medical community
about whether the form of the disease now seen in New York can be as easily
transmitted as the more common form of tuberculosis.
Health officials have long warned of the health risks posed by drinking
milk that is not pasteurized. The use of raw milk to make cheese has been
associated with several serious infections, including listeriosis,
brucellosis and salmonella. Eating cheese made from raw milk is common in
Latin America, and immigrants remain attached to the product, health
officials said. Queso fresco, or fresh cheese, is soft, moist and mild,
crumbling easily over dishes like enchiladas.
Daphne Zepos, an official at the Artisanal Cheese Center in Manhattan [New
York City], said professional cheesemakers used products that are tested for
disease and let cheese made from raw milk age for 60 days. Typically, the
Hispanic cheeses the health department is worried about are aged for only [a
few] days. Homemade cheese, she said, is often derisively called "bathtub
cheese."
Ms. Zepos, who helped found the Cheese of Choice Coalition, which advocates
the use of raw milk, said, "It is detrimental to the whole industry when
these outbreaks happen." She said that it was important to use milk only from
healthy cattle.
The United States program to eradicate _Mycobacterium bovis_ in livestock
began in 1917, and Joe Baca, a spokesman for the Food and Drug
Administration, said it was now rare for cattle here to be infected with
the bacteria.
