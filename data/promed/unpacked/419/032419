Toxic dermatitis outbreak reported in south Ukrainian village
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of dermatitis has been registered in the village of
Boleslavchyk in the Mykolayiv Region. A total of 35 people, including 22
children, have been admitted to the Pervomayskyy District hospital with the
diagnosis of toxic dermatitis of unknown etiology. We learned at the
Ministry of Emergency Situations (and Protection of Population from
Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster) that 95 more people have been
diagnosed with the disease, including 35 children.
Experts believe that the scrap metal dump which is situated near the
village and is a former site of the Ministry of Defence could be the
possible cause of infection. Another possible cause is the low quality of
water.
