A virus that usually causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is linked to a serious outbreak of meningitis on Sydney's northern beaches. The Northern Sydney Local Health District has confirmed a spike in cases of meningitis, encephalitis and transverse myelitis has been caused by this enterovirus. The health district confirmed that since December last year [2012], there have been 15 cases of encephalitis, 3 cases of viral meningitis and one case of spinal myelitis. The diseases cause inflammation of the brain or spinal cord and, in serious cases, brain damage or death. Symptoms can be similar to someone coming down with the flu and include fever.

"There were reports this week of a possible increase in the incidence of viral meningitis in children from Northern Sydney Local Health District due to enterovirus infections," NSW Health reported. "The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit has asked GPs in the area to have a heightened awareness for this condition and refer suspect patients directly to their local hospital for further assessment and management. "New South Wales Health said although meningitis cases across the state had peaked in January [2013], in the past week, the number of meningitis/encephalitis presentations has increased slightly and remained above the usual range for this time of year."

Sydney North Shore and Beaches Medicare spokesman Dr Stephen Ginsborg said parents should not be alarmed as enterovirus [infection] was common. Dr Ginsborg said hand hygiene (particularly after going to the toilet), cough and sneeze etiquette, and thorough cleaning were important to control the spread of infection.

[Most viral meningitis cases, especially during the summer months, are caused by enteroviruses; however, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections actually develop meningitis. Other viral infections that can lead to meningitis include: mumps virus, measles, influenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and several arboviruses. Most enteroviral infections are inapparent or are associated with hand, foot and mouth disease, a mild childhood illness. Viral meningitis occurs mostly in children under 5 years of age or in individuals with impaired immune systems. The symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and people with normal immune systems usually recover completely. There is no specific treatment for viral meningitis. Antibiotics do not help viral infections, so they are not useful in the treatment of viral meningitis.

Usually, there are no long-term complications from the mild illnesses or from "aseptic" meningitis. Some patients who have paralysis or encephalitis, however, do not fully recover. Persons who develop heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy) from myocarditis may require long-term care for their conditions. For further information see: http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/viral.html.

It will be useful to identity the specific enterovirus responsible for the outbreak of viral meningitis in North Sydney to determine its relationship to the enteroviruses responsible for the common hand, foot and mouth disease in young children. Further information is awaited.
