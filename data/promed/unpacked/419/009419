The deaths of hundreds of chickens in various barangays in Labrador town, Pangasinan have raised fears of a possible Avian Influenza outbreak in the area.

But an investigation by the Labrador local government of the chicken deaths in Barangay Magsaysay led to discovery of a Newcastle Disease (ND) outbreak, not the Asian Avian Influenza (H5N1).

Dr. Joel Abalos, municipal veterinarian (OMVet) for Labrador town said they received reports from Barangay Magsaysay on [4 Mar 2022].

His office immediately took blood and swab samples and sent these to the Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Sta. Barbara town.

He said the results, which came in on Monday [7 Mar 2022], confirmed the presence of Newcastle Disease.

Abalos said 600 other chickens have since died in big poultry farms in Barangays Bolo, Gonzalo, Poblacion, and Dulig. Abalos said the number does not yet include backyard poultry farms. He said the losses amount to P120 000 [USD 2297].

Both ND and Avian Flu cause high mortality and drastic drop in egg production, Abalos said. But ND does not affect humans, unlike Avian Flu.

The OMVet said they would no longer consider culling the chickens as disinfection and vaccination can control outbreaks.

The OMVet will conduct a mass [ND] vaccination on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], in affected Labrador town poultry farms.

Abalos said the ND could have been brought about by migratory birds, while hinting that local transmission was also possible.

Abalos urged poultry farms and backyard raisers to vaccinate their chickens annually [against ND] to prevent losses.
