World health officials agree to report all major disease outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
Health ministers and senior officials from 192 countries today [20 May
2005] agreed to new rules requiring all major public health events of
international concern to be reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO). Up until now, outbreaks of only 3 diseases -- cholera, plague and
yellow fever -- had to be notified to the WHO, but not world's biggest
fear: the start of a global flu pandemic.
The revised International Health Regulations adopted today [20 May 2005] at
the World Health Assembly mean that the WHO will be notified of all major
disease outbreaks, and also notified of suspected bio-terrorism events,
such as the deliberate release of biological pathogens.
The revised regulations require the WHO to assist its members in responding
to such threats and provide a basis for greater international cooperation
in this field. The new rules should come into force in 2007.
International cooperation against infectious disease outbreaks will be
strengthened by the new notification rules, said Markos Kyprianou, European
Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection. Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has shown how quickly infectious diseases can
spread around the globe, he said.
Kyprianou said, "The drive to strengthen international cooperation against
future epidemics complements our efforts to reinforce Europe's defenses
against disease. The quicker we are alerted to a disease outbreak, the
greater the chances we can successfully contain it."
"If international cooperation can help stop an epidemic before it really
gets started, the whole world will be better off as a result," he said.
The International Health Regulations were adopted in 1969, and have been
updated twice since then, in 1973 and 1981.
In May 2003, the World Health Assembly agreed to launch a review of the
regulations. The European Commission and the 25 EU member states have
played a central role in negotiating the revision to the regulations agreed
by the World Health Assembly today Kyprianou said.
A system of Europe-wide surveillance and an early warning and response
system against infectious disease has been operational in the European
Union since 1998, but now the EU is acting to reinforce its own defenses
against infectious diseases. Later this month [May 2005] in Stockholm, a
new EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC), will be officially launched.
On 27 May [2005], Commissioner Kyprianou, the Swedish Minister for Public
Health and Social Services, Morgan Johansson, and Minister Mars Di
Bartolomeo, on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, will inaugurate the
ECDC. The inauguration ceremony will be held at the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm.
This new EU agency will reinforce and develop Europe's disease surveillance
system and will also provide EU policy makers with authoritative scientific
advice on new and emerging health threats.
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt put the prevention
of a global flu pandemic at the top of his priority list and told reporters
at a briefing in Geneva that implementing the U.S. plan for HIV/AIDS relief
in 15 focus nations is another important U.S. concern.
Completing the eradication of polio worldwide, improving the response to
bioterrorism and developing a better global system for communicating health
information were also cited as priorities.
Leavitt's concerns about a global flu pandemic arise from the widespread
outbreak of bird flu now plaguing 11 Asian nations. Hundreds of millions of
birds have been destroyed to prevent further spread of the H5N1 flu virus.
This strain has also caused illness among about 90 people.
"What concerns us greatly is the fact that there is virtually no human
immunity to this particular strain," Leavitt said. "We're working
feverishly to develop a vaccine. The vaccine is now in clinical trials."
U.S. health officials acknowledged that the vaccine in development might
not provide complete protection from a still-unknown mutation of the H5N1
strain of bird flu virus that could spread among humans and set a pandemic
in motion.
Still, they said, the vaccine now being manufactured provides a head start
should the need arise to develop massive numbers of doses for use in
response to a global pandemic.
Dr. Julie Gerberding, who heads the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, told reporters, "We agree that the question is not if a
pandemic will occur, it is when will the pandemic will occur."
"We don't know when, but right now, the situation that we see in South East
Asia is one that is characterized by a very large amount of virus
circulating widely among poultry and waterfowl and evidence of transmission
to people with a very bad outcome," Gerberding said. "So it is a very
virulent, deadly form of the virus, and we can't afford to take the chance
that this is the one that will become more transmissible to people, so
we're taking all the steps now that we can to try to prevent it from
evolving, but also to be prepared to contain it if it should emerge and
protect people more broadly if that becomes necessary."
The World Health Assembly continues through 25 May 2005.

Stronger global defenses against epidemics: EU Commissioner welcomes new
WHO agreement
-----------------------------------------------
Markos Kyprianou, European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection,
has welcomed the agreement reached at the World Health Assembly today [21
May 2005] to strengthen international cooperation against infectious
disease outbreaks. SARS in 2003 has shown how quickly infectious diseases
can spread around the globe. Health ministers and senior officials from 192
countries agreed to new rules requiring all major public health events of
international concern to be reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO). This would include major disease outbreaks and also suspected
"bio-terrorism" events (i.e. the deliberate release of biological
pathogens). Cooperation in responding to such events will also be
strengthened by the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) adopted
today. The EU has helped lead the drive to strengthen the IHR. In 2003, the
European Commission was given a mandate to negotiate for this in the WHO
(see IP/03/1282). The EU is also acting to reinforce its own defenses
against infectious diseases. On 27 May 2005 in Stockholm, a new EU agency,
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), will be
officially launched.
Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "The
drive to strengthen international cooperation against future epidemics
complements our efforts to reinforce Europe's defenses against disease. The
quicker we are alerted to a disease outbreak the greater the chances we can
successfully contain it. If international cooperation can help stop an
epidemic before it really gets started, the whole world will be better off
as a result."
The IHR were adopted in 1969 and have been updated twice since then (in
1973 and 1981). In May 2003, the World Health Assembly agreed to launch a
review. The European Commission and the 25 EU Member States have played a
central role in negotiating the revision to the IHR agreed to by the World
Health Assembly today.
Up until now, outbreaks of only 3 diseases -- cholera, plague and yellow
fever -- had to be notified to the WHO. The revised IHR requires national
authorities to notify the WHO of all major public health threats with the
potential to spread. They also require the WHO to assist its members in
responding to such threats and provide a basis for greater international
cooperation in this field. The new rules should come into force in 2007.
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
A system of Europe-wide surveillance and an early warning and response
system against infectious disease has been operational in the EU since 1998
(see MEMO/03/155).
On 27 May [2005], Commissioner Kyprianou, the Swedish Minister for Public
Health and Social Services, Morgan Johansson, and Minister Mars Di
Bartolomeo, on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, will inaugurate the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This new EU
agency will reinforce and develop Europe's disease surveillance system. It
will also provide EU policy makers with authoritative scientific advice on
new and emerging health threats. The inauguration ceremony will be held at
the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

[Acceptance of the revised International Health Regulations (IHR) by the
World Health Assembly (WHA) has been long awaited. While full
implementation is not mandated until 2007, one hopes that earlier
implementation will be effected.
The text of the draft of the revised IHR that was passed by the WHA can be
found at:
<http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/A58_4-en.pdf>.
Supporting documents that were presented to the WHO included a report by
the Secretariat
<http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/A58_41-en.pdf>,
a revision commenting on a member state abstention on articles 7 and 44
<http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/A58_41-en.pdf>,
and proposed changes to the Health Part of the Aircraft General Declaration
as recommended by the Intergovernmental Working Group on Revision of the
IHR at the 2nd session in February 2005
<http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/A58_41Add2-en.pdf>.
(This section addresses the required reporting of suspected illnesses of
international import from airline crews if such illness is observed in
passengers or crew members on a commercial airline flight and reads:
"The following signs and symptoms in a passenger or crew member appearing
obviously unwell, other than those resulting from airsickness or injury,
should be regarded as a reason to suspect the existence of an infectious
disease. The signs and symptoms of illness as described below, as well as
any deaths occurring during the flight, must be reported to the designated
public health authority at destination:
(a) fever accompanied by:
(i) extreme weakness (prostration);
(ii) decreased consciousness;
(iii) glandular swelling;
(iv) yellow color of skin and eyes (jaundice);
(v) persistent cough or shortness of breath;
(vi) unusual bleeding;
(vii) paralysis.
(b) with or without fever:
(i) recent skin rash or eruption;
(ii) persistent or severe vomiting;
(iii) persistent or severe diarrhea;
(iv) convulsion.")
These new regulations markedly expand mandated international collaboration
with respect to disease surveillance, international reporting of disease
occurrence, and investigation and control of outbreaks through
international collaboration.
Article 6 on Notification (page 11) mandates member States to "assess
events occurring within its territory by using the decision instrument in
Annex 2. Each State Party shall notify WHO, by the most efficient means of
communication available, by way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within
24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which
may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within
its territory in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any
health measure implemented in response to those events. If the notification
received by WHO involves the competency of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), WHO shall immediately notify the IAEA."
Annex 2 (pages 45 - 47) provides a algorithm to be used in the decision
tree for what constitutes a public health emergency of international
concern. The diseases specifically singled out for immediate notification
have been markedly expanded from the preexisting IHR and include: smallpox,
poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by a new
subtype and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It also highlights
any event of potential international public health concern, including those
of unknown causes or sources and those involving other events or diseases
than those listed above; and an event involving the following diseases
shall also lead to the utilization of the algorithm, because they have
demonstrated the ability to cause serious public health impact to spread
rapidly internationally: cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, viral
hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Lassa, Marburg), West Nile fever, other diseases
that are of special national or regional concern, e.g. dengue fever, Rift
Valley fever, and meningococcal disease.
Examples of a "suggested" (but not binding) use of the decision tree for
what events should be reported immediately is presented as part of Annex 2:
"Does the event meet at least 2 of the following criteria?
I. Is the public health impact of the event serious?
1. Is the number of cases and/or number of deaths for this type of event
large for the given place, time or population?
2. Has the event the potential to have a high public health impact?
The following are examples of circumstances that contribute to high public
health impact:
- Event caused by a pathogen with high potential to cause epidemic
(infectiousness of the agent, high case fatality, multiple transmission
routes or healthy carrier).
- Indication of treatment failure (new or emerging antibiotic
resistance, vaccine failure, antidote resistance or failure).
- Event represents a significant public health risk even if no or very
few human cases have yet been identified.
- Cases reported among health staff.
- The population at risk is especially vulnerable (refugees, low level
of immunization, children, elderly, low immunity, undernourished, etc.).
- Concomitant factors that may hinder or delay the public health
response (natural catastrophes, armed conflicts, unfavorable weather
conditions, multiple foci in the State Party).
- Event in an area with high population density.
- Spread of toxic, infectious or otherwise hazardous materials that may
be occurring naturally or otherwise that have contaminated or have the
potential to contaminate a population and/or a large geographical area.
3. Is external assistance needed to detect, investigate, respond and
control the current event, or prevent new cases?
The following are examples of when assistance may be required:
- Inadequate human, financial, material or technical resources, in
particular:
- Insufficient laboratory or epidemiological capacity to investigate the
event (equipment, personnel, financial resources)
- Insufficient antidotes, drugs and/or vaccine and/or protective
equipment, decontamination equipment, or supportive equipment to cover
estimated needs
- Existing surveillance system is inadequate to detect new cases in a
timely manner.
Is the Public Health impact of the event serious?
Answer "yes" if you have answered "yes" to questions 1, 2 or 3 above.
II. Is the event unusual or unexpected?
4. Is the event unusual?
The following are examples of unusual events:
- The event is caused by an unknown agent or the source, vehicle, route
of transmission is unusual or unknown.
- Evolution of cases more severe than expected (including morbidity or
case-fatality) or with unusual symptoms.
- Occurrence of the event itself unusual for the area, season or population.
5. Is the event unexpected from a public health perspective?
The following are examples of unexpected events:
- Event caused by a disease/agent that had already been eliminated or
eradicated from the State Party or not previously reported.
Is the event unusual or unexpected?
Answer "yes" if you have answered "yes" to questions 4 or 5 above.
III. Is there a significant risk of international spread?
6. Is there evidence of an epidemiological link to similar events in other
States?
7. Is there any factor that should alert us to the potential for cross
border movement of the agent, vehicle or host?
The following are examples of circumstances that may predispose to
international spread:
- Where there is evidence of local spread, an index case (or other
linked cases) with a history within the previous month of:
- international travel (or time equivalent to the incubation period if
the pathogen is known)
- participation in an international gathering (pilgrimage, sports event,
conference, etc.)
- close contact with an international traveler or a highly mobile
population.
- Event caused by an environmental contamination that has the potential
to spread across international borders.
- Event in an area of intense international traffic with limited
capacity for sanitary control or environmental detection or decontamination.
Is there a significant risk of international spread?
Answer "yes" if you have answered "yes" to questions 6 or 7 above.
IV. Is there a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions?
8. Have similar events in the past resulted in international restriction on
trade and/or travel?
9. Is the source suspected or known to be a food product, water or any
other good that might be contaminated that has been exported/imported
to/from other States?
10. Has the event occurred in association with an international gathering
or in an area of intense international tourism?
11. Has the event caused requests for more information by foreign officials
or international media?
Is there a significant risk of international trade or travel restrictions?
Answer "yes" if you have answered "yes" to questions 8, 9, 10 or 11 above.
States Parties that answer "yes" to the question whether the event meets
any 2 of the 4 criteria (I-IV) above, shall notify WHO under Article 6 of
the International Health Regulations."
Article 9 (page 12) supports the use of unofficial reports on the part of
WHO, which has been in practice since passed by the WHA during the SARS
outbreak in May 2003.
With respect to verification of such unofficial reports of outbreaks,
Article 10 (page 13) has the following provision:
"4. If the State Party does not accept the offer of collaboration, WHO may,
when justified by the magnitude of the public health risk, share with other
States Parties the information available to it whilst encouraging the State
Party to accept the offer of collaboration by WHO, taking into account the
views of the State Party concerned."
With respect to dissemination of information received by WHO, Article 11
(pages 13 and 14) has the following provision:
4. When information received by WHO under paragraph 2 of this Article is
made available to States Parties in accordance with these Regulations, WHO
may also make it available to the public if other information about the
same event has already become publicly available and there is a need for
the dissemination of authoritative and independent information."
This provision should permit WHO to put out clarifications when there are
reports appearing in the lay press or on publicly available listserves,
such as ProMED-mail.
With respect to differences of opinion between WHO and a member State on
what constitutes a public health emergency, the IRH permits the Director
General to establish an expert committee composed of experts from the IHR
Expert Roster and representation of the member State to review the
situation (description of this committee, composition, terms of reference
and procedures can be found in Articles 47, 48 and 489 pages 32-33). This
section provides for a formal process of public review and discussion of
possible differences of opinion on what constitutes a public health emergency.
Hopefully, these new IHRs will lead to more rapid international
notification and more rapid investigation and control of disease outbreaks,
keeping in mind that we do live in a global village, and these communicable
diseases have not required Visas to cross borders, extending the geographic
boundaries of outbreaks. - Mod.MPP]
