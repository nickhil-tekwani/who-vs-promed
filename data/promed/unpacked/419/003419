New bird flu outbreak in Swabi
-------------------------------
Pakistani authorities Sunday [22 Jun 2008] reported a new outbreak of
avian flu at a commercial poultry farm in the country's north west,
killing thousands of birds, officials said.

Tests conducted at a government-run laboratory in Islamabad confirmed
the presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu at a farm in Swabi
district, local livestock department chief Ibrahim Khan told AFP.
"The virus was detected after the owner of the farm informed us on
Friday [20 Jun 2008] that some 4000 birds had died within the past
few days," he said.

"We got the confirmation on Saturday [21 Jun 2008], sealed the farm
and culled around 2000 birds," he said. All workers on the affected
farm were examined by the ministry of health but none was found to
have been affected by the virus, he added. Local health officials are
monitoring surrounding farms and advised them to take precautionary
measures including vaccination of birds, he said.

Pakistan's 1st H5N1 cases were detected in March 2006 at 2 chicken
farms in North West Frontier Province, prompting consumer panic and a
mass slaughter of birds at several sites.

The virus resurfaced in early February last year [2007] among
chickens in Rawalpindi, adjoining Islamabad, and in peacocks in the
north western city of Mansehra. In February this year [2008]
Pakistani officials sealed off several farms and culled around 10 000
chickens after an outbreak in the southern port city of Karachi.

Bird flu prompts cull in north west Pakistan
--------------------------------------------
Authorities have culled nearly 2000 broiler chickens following
confirmation of a fresh outbreak of avian influenza in Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province (NWFP), media reports said Monday [23 Jun 2008].

The culling was carried out in the Swabi district on Sunday [22 Jun
2008] after samples taken at a poultry farm tested positive for
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu at a laboratory in the capital
Islamabad, English-language The News daily said.

Two-third of the birds at the farm, which had more than 6000
chickens, died during the last few days while the rest were killed
and buried under the supervision of local authorities and UN's World
Health Organization (WHO) staff.

According to the newspaper, people settled within a 3-km (2 mi)
radius of the farm had been put under observation to monitor possible
bird-to-human transmission.

The News said another farm in the proximity of the infected facility
had also been sealed off, and health officials posted at various
checkpoints were examining birds being transported out of Swabi district.

Pakistan's poultry population has seen multiple outbreaks of the H5N1
strain since 2006, with almost 80 outbreaks taking place last year [2007].

The 1st human-to-human transmission of bird flu in Pakistan was
reported last November [2007] in the NWFP capital Peshawar, where a
man passed on the deadly virus to 2 of his brothers, one of whom died.

[Pakistan submitted on 16 Jun 2008 its 13th and "final" report on
HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health); it included the following
epidemiological comments:

"The 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza
(HPNAI) was reported in February 2007 while the last one was observed
on 3 Mar 2008. The event involved a total of 225 238 commercial
poultry of various categories. Stamping out policy was adopted. All
poultry on the index farms were culled and disinfection operations
were completed as per OIE guidelines. All culling and disinfection
operations in the last reported outbreak were completed on 4 Mar
2008. All sero-surveillance results obtained within a 10-km (6 mi)
radius zone around the outbreak were negative. Monitoring and
sero-surveillance will continue.

Therefore, since no further outbreaks of HPNAI have been observed in
the country since 3 Mar 2008, Pakistan declares itself free of HPNAI
with effect from 4 Jun 2008".

The event summary, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4758>.

If the current outbreaks are officially confirmed -- as they appear
to be -- this is disappointing and a blow to the Pakistani poultry
industry and indeed to the veterinary services which have,
reportedly, invested considerable efforts and skill to control and
eradicate the epizootic; the declaration of freedom above may have to
be reconsidered. Possibly, the current event is due to the unstable
situation along the borders with Afghanistan, allowing introduction
of infected animals and their products, contaminated feed, etc.
