Israel: West Nile Virus Antibodies in Recently Fledged Arctic Little Stints
(_Calidris Minuta_)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The following report has been submitted by Reuven Yosef, Mertyn Malkinson,
Caroline Banet-Noach and Roni King of The International Birding and
Research Centre in Eilat (IBRCE), Israel - Mod.CP]
West Nile virus (WNV) was first identified in the West Nile region of
Uganda in 1937 and has since been identified as a major flavivirus that
affects human populations extensively (Rappole et al. 2000). Mosquitoes
have been identified as the major vector for the active spread of the virus
at the local level, and migratory bird populations as the major vector
transporting the virus between continents in the course of their natural,
annual migrations. Most researchers imply that the major spread of the
virus is from Africa to Europe (e.g., Hannoun et al. 1972).
Israel, the only land bridge between 3 continents, is at a junction for
birds migrating south from Eurasia to Africa in autumn and north to their
breeding grounds in spring. In spring the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aqaba/Eilat act as a long deflection barrier diverting many northbound
migrants to Eilat (Shirihai and Christie 1992). Eilat is strategically
located at the northern edge of almost 2000 km of continuous desert regions
of the Sinai, Sahara and the Sahel and many of the avian migrants land here
to rest and refuel after having crossed the inhospitable deserts to the
south (Safriel 1968, Yosef 1998).
Since 1984 a trapping and ringing has been conducted by the IBRCE at Eilat.
Following the recent interest in migratory birds as vectors of WNV in the
region we sampled birds migrating to Africa in autumn 2001 and upon their
return to Europe in spring 2002. The species that stood out as having one
of the highest levels of antibodies was the Little Stint (_Calidris
minuta_). In spring, of 82 individuals sampled only 2 (2.4 percent) were
positive. In contrast in autumn 2001 we sampled 177 individuals of which 18
(10.2 percent) were positive. This reversal of results is further
confounded by the fact that 16 of the 18 Little Stint were 1st year birds,
i.e., individuals that had recently fledged and were on their 1st migration
south. Hannoun et al (1972) also found that one (20 percent) of the 5
Little Stint they sampled in Tunisia was seropositive.
The Little Stint is a monotypic species in which it is easy to separate the
juveniles from adults based on plumage. The Little Stint breeds on
high-arctic coastal mainland tundra and winters mainly in Africa, around
the Indian Ocean and on coasts of the Indian sub-continent, with variable
numbers also in the Mediterranean basin and the Persian Gulf (Cramp 1983).
In conclusion, based on our data, and the lack of any other studies on the
species or other tundra breeding avian species, we suggest that the arctic
region has a greater level of viremia and for the transfer of WNV between
organisms than has previously been realized. We suggest that future
studies not assume blindly that the virus is out of Africa alone.
