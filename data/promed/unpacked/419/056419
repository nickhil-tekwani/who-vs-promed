Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Vaccine Prototype to be Distributed to Manufacturers
--------------------------------------------------
A high-security laboratory has created a prototype avian influenza virus,
the first step toward making a human vaccine [against the potentially
deadly avian influenza virus currently widespread in East Asia], a World
Health Organisation (WHO) spokesman said on Thu 1 Apr 2004. [Presumably
this refers to production of an H5N1 type influenza virus by reverse
genetics endowed with low egg lethality and consequently suitable for use
as a seed stock in vaccine production. - Mod.CP]
The WHO will give the prototype virus next week to 3 drug makers who have
expressed interest in producing small sample vaccine batches and carrying
out clinical trials, WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said. The clinical trials
are expected to take several months, but large-scale vaccine production
would only begin if a deadly pandemic broke out, he added. Since avian
influenza erupted in Asia, the WHO has been racing to develop a vaccine to
protect humans against the H5N1 type avian influenza virus. Avian influenza
has killed 26 [23 confirmed by WHO] people in Viet Nam and Thailand and
decimated poultry stocks across Asia.
"One laboratory has produced the prototype virus. We have sent a note to
vaccine manufacturers that the virus would be ready next week," Thompson
told Reuters. In January, WHO asked 3 high-security collaborating centers
to produce a prototype. The spokesman declined to say which had succeeded,
but he added that a formal announcement was expected next week.
The 3 are: the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, St. Jude
Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and Britain's National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control. Initially 11 drug manufacturers had
contacted the WHO about producing the vaccine, but only 3 have confirmed
they want to proceed, according to Thompson. "Avian influenza seems to have
faded as a concern among manufacturers. They are unwilling to spend a lot
of money to make up the clinical batch," he said.
Clinical trials will be conducted in the United States, under the
sponsorship of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, according to the WHO
spokesman. This meant that drug makers required a U.S. license, he added.
