Infectious intestinal disease on rise in NE China, causing 3 deaths
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of infectious intestinal disease were on the rise this summer
in Jilin Province, northeast China, and 3 children were confirmed
dead as a consequence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in the
period from 1 May to 23 Jul 2008.

There were 6590 cases of infectious intestinal disease from 1 May to
23 Jul 2008, a rise of 170.2 percent from the same period last year,
said the provincial health department at a news briefing held on
Thursday [24 Jul 2008]. The news briefing was organized to give a
roundup report of disease control in the province in the past 3
months. Of the total, HFMD cases made up 4141. And 3610 children who
fell ill with the diseases were under the age of 5. Medical
examinations found enterovirus 71 (EV71) was responsible.

Local health officials refused to provide more details regarding the
3 deaths. HFMD can be caused by a host of intestinal viruses, but
EV71 and the coxsackievirus A16 (Cox A16) are the most common. It
usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in
the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. Those sickened by EV71
often show serious symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis,
encephalitis, pulmonary edema and paralysis in some children. There
is no vaccine.

There was a HFMD outbreak in parts of south China in the spring. In
Fuyang, the worst hit area, 22 children died of intestinal virus
[infection] clinically diagnosed as EV71 infection, among tens of
thousands of non-fatal infections.

[It appears from this delayed report that HFMD may have affected the
northeastern province of Jilin somewhat later than in south and
central China. It is not clear from this report, however, whether the
outbreak has passed its peak, as in some other parts of China, and is
now in decline. As elsewhere throughout Asia, human enterovirus 71 is
the predominant cause of HFMD in children this year (2008).
