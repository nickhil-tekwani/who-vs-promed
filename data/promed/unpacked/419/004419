[C] Epidemiologic links

A mapping of the cumulative number of SARS cases reported to WHO (and
contained in the above table [A]) as of 9 Apr 2003 can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/map2003_04_09.jpg>

Epidemic curves of the SARS cases reported to WHO (as of 8 Apr 2003) can be
found at: <http://www.who.int/csr/sarsepicurve/2003_04_08/en/>. There are
multiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by
country for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and
the European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic
curve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may
have already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of
actual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for
2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr
2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the
epidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be
consistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked
increase in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the
delayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported
cases on 8 Apr 2003.

The epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a
large peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during
the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam
suggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent
interruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period
pending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the
appearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic
curve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during
the period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the
week 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a
clear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission
but at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of
onset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset
(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak
periods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar
2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was
9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the
few healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported
cases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States
were in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section
[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset
since 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In
contrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is
more consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2
cases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary
transmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]


[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main
SARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003

Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]


China
------
The WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak
in Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and
Vice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in
Guangdong on 3 Apr 2003.

The team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to
the outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at
every level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore
concluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a
hospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.

However, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the
countryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further
concerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a
particular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the
adequacy of contact tracing.

In addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of
other provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in
Guangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.

In Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of
SARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not
appear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact
tracing will allow the disease to spread.

The team observed that many of Chinas poorer provinces may not have
adequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of
SARS, and underscored that Guangdongs capacity was exceptional among
Chinas provinces.

In Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health
care system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8
Peoples Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily
during the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response
of the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication
and bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.

Microbiological findings
----------
Large banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,
from case contacts as well as from normal controls exist at the
institutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed
information about the numbers and types of these specimens are available
and were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on
each of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the
very detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in
Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.

These specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from
which the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as
paired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during
the acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will
allow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that
once a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be
tested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,
less sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was
already sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed
elsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested
assistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer
sequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental
tests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.

Main recommendations
---------
The interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:

- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model
that all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures
that all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing
this system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for
evaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by
technical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent
standards are achieved and maintained.

- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards
throughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care
facilities.

- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak
under control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by
trained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but
potential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs
to be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with
detailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.

- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is
required, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,
and reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a
national SARS laboratory network within China:
- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing
- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing
- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou
- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou
Laboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be
included. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided
to ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance
activities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.
Chinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within
China to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.

- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the
world and their experience should be shared with the international
community through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for
the management of SARS patients.

Priority actions
Priority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:

- early recognition and treatment of cases

- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics

- prompt reporting of suspected cases

- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public
awareness campaigns and education.


Hong Kong: heavy burden on the health system
---------
With todays cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong
continues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on
health services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of
infection control may be needed.

The isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at
midnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that
residents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats
have been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Singapore: role of "super-spreaders"
----------
Singapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals
following an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include
mandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and
isolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital
outbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses
and doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as "probable" SARS cases. The
distribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker
considered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth
"super-spreader" identified in Singapore.

A "super-spreader" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,
infected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS
remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such
"super-spreaders" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks
around the world.

Until recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links
to their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links
for the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show
that transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very
ill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers
continue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation
of the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community
spread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.
However, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.

Viet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission
--------
Vietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases
have been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58
cases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope
that the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.
However, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.

This male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient
at the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nams index case. This contact
continued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughters husband,
who attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile
illness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.
It is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his
father-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists
maintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.
Nor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently
assumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is
being taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for
case 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.
Cases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who
provided considerable care for case 59.

WHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the
contacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will
be linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.

Of the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in
hospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although
slightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.

Canada: one new probable case reported
--------
Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10
deaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in
persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the
household or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in
British Columbia (3).

Update on cases and countries
-------------
As of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been
reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3
deaths when compared with yesterday.

New cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),
Singapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case
reported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported
in Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).

[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from
WHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the
reports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look
forward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from
the outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with
respect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a
bank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to
conduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned
regarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from
the clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.

From today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports
are coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be
transmission, as continuation of the original importations and further
generations of transmission related to those original importations from
Hong Kong. The notion of "super spreaders" is further highlighted by the
Singapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of
these reported "super spreaders". The experience in Viet Nam seems to
suggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or
during the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical
illness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in
Hanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that
newly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS
patient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control
procedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile
patients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection
control procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?

The addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS
outbreak is appreciated, as "a picture is worth 1000 words" (as was
evidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the
significance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are
easier to interpret when graphically represented.

Prof. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod
Griffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about
attack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of
probable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good
question, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive
diagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing
crude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of
attack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,
recognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these
calculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic
infections).

The removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is
a further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a
definitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and
that there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same
clinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]
