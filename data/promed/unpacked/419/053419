What do mosquitos have in common with all that saliva you've been spitting into your COVID-19 test vial? Not a lot. But they are both analyzed for the presence of viruses by the same type of machine, called a RT-PCR for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

This machine is a recent addition to the public health arsenal at the Southwest Mosquito Abatement and Control District (SMACD) and could come in handy in response to an alarming late August [2021] discovery of a new type of invasive mosquito in the Springdale area.

_Aedes aegypti_ is a species of day-biting mosquito that typically shows up in urban areas and can reproduce quickly in small containers of standing water. It is black with distinctive white stripes. Commonly dubbed the 'yellow fever mosquito,' this species is also known to carry the viruses that cause tropical fevers including Zika, dengue and chikungunya, though none of these have yet been detected in Washington County.

The risk of these new viruses showing up in southwest Utah's human population as a result of this mosquito invasion is, according to Sean Amodt, District Administrator at the SMACD, fairly small. For Washington County residents and visitors to contract diseases like Zika, _Aedes aegypti_ would have to be allowed to reproduce into a sizable population and then also pick up and spread these tropical fever viruses by biting already-infected humans, likely travelers from regions where these diseases are prevalent.

[The appearance of _Aedes aegypti_ in far southwestern Utah is not surprising. This mosquito was found in 2019 in Moab, Grand County in eastern Utah in 2019. It seems unlikely that this mosquito will become established in either location. However, the CDC map showing the states where this mosquito is very unlikely, unlikely, likely or very likely to become established, shows the only area depicted in Utah as likely is the far southwest corner of the state in Washington County, far [about 360 mile] from Moab. Moab is in an area shown as very unlikely (see https://bit.ly/3m28ab3). Very low _Ae. aegypti_ populations make the probability of ongoing transmission of Zika, dengue or chikungunya viruses very low should a viremic individual come into the areas where the mosquitoes were collected. Ongoing mosquito surveillance is wise, to be sure that the newly discovered _Ae. aegypti_ in Washington county do not become established or new introductions of this mosquito do not occur in southern Utah. The mosquito has been found in the nearby states of California, New Mexico and Arizona. - Mod.TY
