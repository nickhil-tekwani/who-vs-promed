Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is usually considered a mild
disease in calves and is rarely associated with severe disease
problems. We would like to report a case in which this virus was
acquired from a calf and caused severe disease in one of its
handlers.

A 6-week-old Aberdeen Angus suckler calf with chronic scour had been
treated by the owner and the owner's assistant for over a week before
it was euthanized and submitted to Animal Health and Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) - Shrewsbury under DEFRA's cattle scanning
surveillance programme. The treatment involved daily manual restraint
of the calf, bottle feeding and administering oral medication. One
week after the calf had been euthanized the assistant developed
multiple discrete, raised, erythematous, circular lesions, which
became ulcerative and extended to approximately 50 per cent of the
dorsal surface of both hands. The owner developed a single lesion on
one finger. The lesions persisted for over 4 weeks before regressing.

Oral lesions had been noticed in the calf's mouth while it was being
bottle-fed. Verrucose lesions on the upper dental pad around the
incisors and focal erosions in the reticuloruminal groove were
identified at postmortem examination. Histopathology,
immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the bovine lesions
were consistent with a parapoxvirus infection. PCR analysis of samples
from the human and bovine cases were both positive in a pan-parapox
PCR. Subsequent sequence analysis showed the 2 samples to have the
same sequence, and that this sequence shared 98 per cent identity with
the corresponding BPSV gene and 85 per cent identity with the
equivalent genes of both pseudocowpox virus and orf virus. On this
basis, we concluded that BPSV had been transmitted from the calf to
the human patients.

It has been known for some time that parapoxviruses, including BPSV,
can be zoonotic. However, virus characterisation was limited since
molecular techniques were not available. More recently, papular
stomatitis virus was confirmed by molecular techniques in an American
patient. However, in contrast to the case presented here, the lesions
were minor. Mild clinical signs were also reported in a study of
veterinary students, although this predated molecular characterisation
of the virus and so the exact aetiology of these infections is not
known.

The present investigation highlights that parapoxvirus infection can
be spread to people by routine handling of infected calves and cause
severe skin lesions. When discussing disease caused by this virus,
veterinary surgeons should make farm personnel aware of the potential
for zoonotic transmission and advise that routine measures are
implemented to minimise this risk.

BPSV is a benign, wide-spread disease of cattle, caused by an
epitheliotropic double-stranded DNA poxvirus of the genus
_Parapoxvirus_ (PPV), which also includes the closely related
Contagious ecthyma of sheep and goats (orf, scabby mouth) and other
diseases. It may, at times, be confused with early signs of vesicular
diseases in cattle such as FMD and vesicular stomatitis: more than 100
"false alarms" due to BPS reportedly reached in the past the Plum
Island labs annually for differentiation from other vesicular diseases
in bovines.

The above described signs of human infection resemble those of orf
(contagious ecthyma) cases, resulting from physical contact with
infected sheep or goats. Orf infections in humans can include the
finger, hand, arm, face and even the penis (caused by infection from
the hand during urination). The same guidelines to animal
keepers/caretakers, in relation to orf, are applicable in relation to
BPSV: good personal hygiene should be observed and gloves used when
treating infected calves.

Pictures of orf in sheep and humans, and BPSV in a calf, can be seen
in the chapter '2. Orf (parapox infection; "sore mouth") - sheep and
people' at
