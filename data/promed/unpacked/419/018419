Menu Foods pet food recall
------------------------------
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE (ACVIM) <http://www.acvim.org>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 24 Mar 2007
PET FOOD RECALL: UPDATED INFORMATION FOR VETERINARIANS
In response to the recent national pet food recall, the American
College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) has collected the
following information for veterinarians in regards to the treatment
of animals that have ingested the recalled food.
* On Fri 23 Mar 2007 a press release from the New York State
Department of Agriculture and Markets
<http://www.agmkt.state.ny.us/release> stated that the New York State
Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker and Cornell University's
College of Veterinary Medicine Dean Donald F. Smith announced that
scientists at the New York State Food Laboratory identified
Aminopterin as a toxin present in cat food samples from Menu Foods,
the manufacturer of the many brands of dog and cat food that are
currently the subject of a nationwide recall.
* The Food Laboratory received the pet food samples from a
toxicologist at the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center at
Cornell University, where testing has been underway to try to
identify the cause of kidney failure in dogs and cats that consumed
the recalled brands of pet food. At Cornell's request, the Food
Laboratory tested the samples for poisons and toxins, and identified
Aminopterin in the pet food samples at a level of at least 40 parts
per million.
* Aminopterin is a folic acid inhibitor found in some rodenticides
available outside the USA. It is not available in the US as a
rodenticide. Aminopterin is a 4-amino analog of folic acid. It was
originally used as an antineoplastic agent in the late 1940's but has
been superseded by methotrexate, a related but less toxic folic acid
analog. At high doses, methotrexate results in acute renal failure
and crystalluria due to deposition of 7-hydroxymethotrexate in the
renal tubules. Aminopterin toxicity is thought to be similar and dose
dependent.
* These findings and any relationship to recent pet deaths have not
been confirmed by the Food and Drug Administration. An announcement
from the FDA is forthcoming. We need to be cautious, as the finding
of Aminopterin is significant, but there could be other compounds yet
unknown in the diet as well.
* Recommendations for testing animals have essentially not changed.
There is no blood test available for Aminopterin. Pets that have
eaten the recalled food whether showing signs of illness (lethargy,
vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, etc.) or asymptomatic should be seen by
their veterinarian and have a complete blood count, biochemistry
panel and urinalysis performed. Additional testing may include
assessment for significant proteinuria, urine culture, imaging, etc.
* Treatment recommendations have not changed. According to Dr.
Richard E. Goldstein DVM DACVIM DECVIM-CA, Associate Professor of
Medicine at Cornell University, azotemic pets should be treated with
fluids to promote hydration, and diuresis in order to dissolve and
flush out crystals from the tubules. Aminopterin produces crystals
within the renal tubules that are most soluble in an alkaline urine
pH thus a target urine pH above 7 (achieved with fluid therapy and
alkalinizing agents including sodium bicarbonate) might be beneficial
in managing these patients. Several medications such as antioxidants
and folic acid may be administered, but their true beneficial affects
are unproven when given long after the initial exposure to the toxin.
* Bone-marrow suppression is a concern with any folic acid inhibiting
agent, and a complete blood cell count should be monitored in these
patients as well as renal function.
* If a patient with anuric or oliguric acute renal failure is not
responding to appropriate therapy, veterinarians should promptly
consider contacting a small animal internist with the American
College of Veterinary Internal Medicine <http://www.ACVIM.org> in
their local community for case consultation and possible referral.
Hemodialysis can be utilized for severely affected patients and is
available at a limited number of veterinary teaching hospitals.
* Duration of treatment in patients which may have renal failure due
to ingestion of the recalled food is unknown at this time and
obviously will vary between patients. Long term effects on renal
function are unknown but based on limited experience to date, at
least partial renal recovery is anticipated. Patients succumbing to
illness should be necropsied and tissues saved in formalin for
histopathology to determine cause of death.
* Samples for histopathology can be submitted to The Iowa State
University Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory <http://www.vdpam.iastate.edu>
or The Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University
<http://www.diag.center.vetcornell.edu>.
* Samples of the recalled food should be held for possible analysis.
Opened food should be disposed of so there is no chance of further
consumption. Pet owners can contact the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Consumer Complaint Coordinator at:
<http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/complain.html>.
* The FDA has provided the following case definition for field
investigation/cases: veterinary-documented renal failure, necropsy
results if animal died, food consumed within one week of death
(illness), and intact, unopened cans of the food. If veterinarians
suspect that a case meets this general case definition, FDA has
requested that you contact them at the following e-mail address:
<www.emergency.operations@fda.hhs.gov>.
* Please continue to advise that your clients consult
<http://www.menufoods.com/recall> for a list of the recalled food.
They should stop feeding the food immediately.
* Also consult <http://www.avma.org> for the most up-to-date information.

Rodent poison found in pet food linked to deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Tests turned up rat poison in the pet food suspected of causing
kidney failure in dogs and cats across the country and killing at
least 16, state officials and scientists announced Friday [23 Mar 2007].
The toxin was identified as Aminopterin, which is used to kill rats
in some countries, state Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker
said. Aminopterin is not registered for killing rodents in the United
States, though it is used as a cancer drug, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
State officials did not say how they believe Aminopterin got into the
now-recalled pet food, though they said no criminal investigations
had been launched.
The Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation was
focusing on wheat gluten in the pet food. Wheat gluten itself would
not cause kidney failure, but the common ingredient could have been
contaminated, the FDA said.
The pet deaths led to a recall of 60 million cans and pouches of pet
food produced by Menu Foods and sold throughout North America under
95 brand names. There have been several reports of kidney failure in
pets that ate the recalled brands, and the company has confirmed the
deaths of 15 cats and one dog.
Menu Foods last week recalled "cuts and gravy" style dog and cat
food. The recall sparked concern among pet owners across North
America. It includes food sold under store brands carried by
Wal-Mart, Kroger, Safeway and other large retailers, as well as
private labels such as Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba.
Menu Foods is majority owned by Menu Foods Income Fund of
Streetsville. The company also makes foods for zoo cats, but those
products are unaffected by the recall.
The company's chief executive and president said Menu Foods delayed
announcing the recall until it could confirm that the animals had
eaten its product before dying. Two earlier complaints from consumers
whose cats had died involved animals that lived outside or had access
to a garage, which left open the possibility they had been poisoned
by something other than contaminated food, he said.
Menu Foods planned a media teleconference for later Friday [23 Mar
2007], a spokesman said.
A spokesman for New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said he was
not aware of any criminal investigation involving the tainted food.
FBI spokesman Paul Holstein in Albany said Friday [23 Mar 2007] he
was not aware of any FBI involvement in the case. "I don't know where
we'll go from here," he said.
Aminopterin, also used as a cancer drug, is highly toxic in high
doses. It inhibits the growth of malignant cells and suppresses the
immune system.
A complete list of the recalled products along with product codes,
descriptions and production dates was posted online by Menu Foods and
is available below. The company also designated 2 phone numbers that
pet owners could call for information: (866) 463-6738 and (866) 895-2708.

The pet food linked to the deaths of 16 animals has shown no signs of
contamination, the manufacturer says, and the company cannot explain
why the cats and dog developed acute kidney failure and died.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Paul Henderson, the chief
executive and president of Menu Foods, said Wednesday [21 Mar 2007]
the company was looking at a single ingredient. He wouldn't identify
it, but the Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation
was focusing on wheat gluten.
"Our hypothesis is that it is that ingredient that in fact represents
the highest probability as to the cause," Henderson said. "But we
have been unable to prove that through scientific information."
The animal deaths have led to the recall of 60 million cans and
pouches of pet food sold throughout North America under 95 brand names.
"This is a puzzling and troubling experience for everybody within
this organization," Henderson said in an interview from company
headquarters in Streetsville, Ontario. "It is extremely disheartening
that we haven't been able to find the causative agent."
There have been tests on 10 cats that died, performed by an outside
company for Menu Foods. The results show only that the cats died of
acute kidney failure.
There have been widespread reports of kidney failure, some fatal, in
pets that have eaten the recalled brands. The company has confirmed
the overall deaths of 15 cats and one dog.
The FDA has sent investigators to New Jersey and Kansas plants
operated by Menu Foods.
Wheat gluten is a source of protein and was used to thicken the gravy
in the pet food, sold in both cans and pouches, according to the FDA.
A complete list of the recalled products along with product codes,
descriptions and production dates was available from the Menu Foods Web site:
<http://www.menufoods.com/recall>.
Wheat gluten itself would not cause kidney failure, but the common
ingredient could have been contaminated by heavy metals or mold
toxins, the FDA said.

Purina, and Science Diet), go to <http://www.menufoods.com/recall>;

<http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=2975912&page=1>

Investigators have determined that a rodent-killing chemical is the
toxin in the tainted pet food that has killed several animals.
A source close to the investigation tells ABC News that the
rodenticide, which the source says is illegal to use in the United
States, was on wheat that was imported from China and used by Menu
Foods in nearly 100 brands of dog and cat food.
A news conference is scheduled for this afternoon [23 Mar 2007] by
experts in Albany, New York, where scientists at the state's food
laboratory made the discovery a week after a massive recall of 60
million cans and pouches was issued. The chemical is called Aminopterin.
What investigators can't say so far is whether this is the only
contaminant, if it is in all of the recalled food, or if it's in
enough quantity to sicken more animals.
There is some good news according to the source. Knowing the chemical
should aid veterinarians who are treating animals that have been
sickened by the pet food.
Aminopterin is used in the United States in, of all things, a cancer
drug, according to the source.
For a week, investigators have been looking for a cause behind the 15
confirmed pet food deaths tied to contaminated pet food. Many animal
doctors, including those at New York's Animal Medical Center, suspect
there will be a much larger rash of cases after they learned about an
additional 200 reported cases of kidney failure in animals.
Doctors at the hospital, which is considered the Mayo Clinic of
veterinary medicine, say they noticed the kidney failure while
studying sick animals from last Friday to Monday [16-19 Mar 2007] and
traced the cases back to the 60 million cans and pouches of recalled
food from Menu Food.
"I was shocked and surprised; acute kidney failure is not a common
problem," veterinarian Cathy Langston told ABC News. "I've already
heard about 200 cases, and so I bet that there are probably going to
be thousands."
So far, the government and the pet food maker, which sells food under
91 brand names, have confirmed 15 deaths. But the investigation to
locate the toxic contaminant that caused the kidney failure in
animals had not pointed to a cause until today [23 Mar 2007].
"This is very much like finding a needle in a haystack," Don Smith of
the Cornell Veterinary School said earlier this week. "We're going to
keep working at this until we find the cause."
Investigators had already begun looking at the possibility that a
pesticide or chemical may have been on the wheat used to produce the
Menu Foods dog and cat food.
The Food and Drug Administration, which was notified of the tainted
food one day before the recall, said it's frustrated and realizes the
growing crisis is an emotional one.
"This is tragic," said Stephen Sundolf of the FDA's Veterinary
Medicine group. "It is certainly uncommon. We expect pet food to be safe."
And it's a crisis, if the New York hospital is right, that may not
end for weeks.
"I'm worried that there are more deaths to come from chronic renal
failure over the next several months," Langston said. "It's not over."

[Indeed the deaths are tragic. The recall profoundly affects the
entire Menu Foods Company.
It is important to bring some clarity to this. Wheat gluten came from
China. Wheat gluten is used to thicken the gravies in the moist
foods. There is not a huge amount of gluten in these foods.
Aminopterin, a derivative of folic acid, is an antineoplastic drug
not approved for use in the USA. It would be interesting to know what
the evidence is that indicates this drug causes kidney failure.
It is recognized as a teratogen in human beings, but the
corresponding studies for kidney failure seem to be scare.
Pet owners should be careful of blaming the company for a pet's
health problems unless there is some very compelling evidence
according to a veterinarian. If you believe your pet is ill or may be
having health difficulties, take your pet to the veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
