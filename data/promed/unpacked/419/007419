"Would anyone be able to tell me how community acquired Legionnaires' disease
is differentiated from nosocomial Legionnaires' disease?"
DIAGNOSIS
Both cases that were presented first need to have a
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease before issues of
nosocomial acquisition can be entertained. Legionnaires' disease can be
confirmed by:
1. culture of respiratory secretions using media specific for the growth of
Legionella,
2. detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens in urine by
radioimmunoassay or enzyme immunoassay,
3. a fourfold rise in Legionella antibody titers to a level greater than or
equal to 1:128 in paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens by
indirect fluorescent antibody assay,
4. direct fluorescent antibody testing of respiratory secretions or tissue,
5. polymerase chain reaction testing of respiratory secretions or tissue
(not yet commercially available).
The most rapid of the above listed tests is the urine antigen test. The test
has high sensitivity and specificity and can be ordered through most
commercial reference laboratories. A diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease can
be made in 24-48 hours in many instances. Direct fluorescent antibody
testing is also rapid but does not have the specificity of urine
testing for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Single elevated titers of
Legionella antibodies obtained during acute illness should not be used alone
to diagnose Legionnaires' disease (see references below).
DEFINITIONS
The incubation period for Legionnaires' disease is generally 2-10 days, thus
for epidemiologic purposes, the Hospital Infection Control Practices
Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has defined "definite" nosocomial Legionnaires'
disease as "laboratory-confirmed legionellosis that occurs in a patient who
has spent greater than or equal to 10 days continuously in the hospital prior
to onset of illness. Laboratory-confirmed infection that occurs 2-9 days
after hospitalization is considered "possible" nosocomial infection."
These definitions and a detailed explanation of prevention and control
measures can be found in the reference:
HICPAC. Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia. Respiratory Care
1994;39:1191-1236.
Further information on diagnostic testing can be found in the recently
published reference:

Legionnaires' disease: use of the urinary antigen assay. Clinical Infectious
Diseases 1995;20:1286-91.

I would add to the query re nosocomial vs community acquired source, look
for other time related cases. If nosocomial, there may be some other
similar cases to suggest the source of infection. And if community
acquired, there may also be some other cases. Granted that sporatic cases of
Legionnaire's disease are the most frequently type reported,
this could also represent the lack of adequate investigations for
additional cases.
