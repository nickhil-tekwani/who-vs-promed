SOCIAL NETWORK THEORIES (3)
===========================
[In response to the RFI of the same title]
There is a field within Public Health which deals almost entirely with social
networks, being Sociomedical Science (SMS). I am a graduate student at the
Columbia University School of Public Health in the SMS division. You may
want to check out such journals as Medical Anthropology as well as the
American Journal of Public Health, both of which provide a variety of
articles related to the significance of social networks in the health status
of populations.
If you want anything specific, please feel free to contact me as I may be
able to point you toward some useful information...
