New Florida rust report
-----------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR] has spread to a new county in Florida, the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a soybean rust alert.
According to USDA's rust web site, Asian soybean rust was discovered in
Jefferson County, FL. An alert from USDA said ASR is "set to be confirmed"
there sometime today [18 Jun 2005], though no other information was given.
Burleson Smith, special assistant for pest management policy for USDA, told
DTN that ASR was found on kudzu. Rust has previously been confirmed on
kudzu in Dade, Hernando, Pasco and Marion counties in Florida and Seminole
County in Georgia. Jefferson County is in the panhandle of the state along
the Georgia border.

[The spread of ASR is very slow to date. The new find in Jefferson County,
FL was detection on kudzu leaves and was confirmed by microscopy (UF/IFAS)
and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Science, Division of
Plant Industry, ELISA (UF/Plant Path), and real-time PCR (UF/Plant Disease
Clinic). The site is limited in size (under 1/4 acre). Monitoring for ASR
continues in several southern states.
