Out of the spotlight, foot and mouth rages on
---------------------------------------------------
Since just before the election, when the numbers [of cases of foot and
mouth disease, as predicted by the scientists, fell to only a handful a
day, there have been more than 200 cases - not what was predicted. In the
last week there have been 12 in Cumbria, 17 in Yorkshire, and a handful in
Powys. [Over the past 75 days there has been a steady 3-6 new outbreaks
each day. See the following websites for more information:

"The numbers are around 3 and 5 a day in the 3 hotspots," says the
Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It blames
the farmers for the continuation of the disease. "These cases are due to
people and equipment. Being vigilant is the only way it will be eradicated.
Sunshine should kill the virus, but it is the movement of people which
spreads it."
Even in places which the disease has supposedly left, the slaughter of
animals continues. In Devon, there have been just 7 confirmed cases since
the election, but there have been 8 cases in that time where blood tests on
sheep have found positive antibodies, suggesting the sheep had the disease
at some point, 4 of which have been classed as "direct contacts" and the
flocks have been quietly culled.
Only one is regarded as a full outbreak. There are no official figures,
said MAFF in Exeter, on how many Devon sheep have been culled in the past
month. But the overall figures are staggering. Including the slaughter of
more than 1.2 million animals in the welfare scheme for animals at risk of
not being fed, the total is now more than 4 787 447 with 4000 more being
killed each week. On top of this, there is now the likelihood that up to 2
million lambs born in the past 6 months around Britain may have to be
killed due to the export ban and the fact that there is no market for them
in Britain.
Privately, DEFRA admits that the disease could leap easily and start over
again in new areas. Publicly, it is not even talking about the autumn, when
the weather conditions are more likely to spread the disease. On the ground
there is growing belief that it is now effectively endemic.
How crisis escalated:
20 Feb 2001- First case at an abattoir at Orchard farm, Essex, with more
at two nearby farms in 2 days.
23 Feb 2001 - Fourth case confirmed at a pig farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Northumberland, now thought to be the root of the epidemic.
6 Mar 2001 - Total of 80 cases confirmed. Most of the countryside declared
no-go area. At the end of the month there are 50 new cases a day. One
outbreak in France and 4 in the Netherlands. Army is called in to help
contain the spread.
Easter - As the bank holiday approaches there are 1262 cases. Epidemic is
thought to have peaked.
3 May 2001 - Tony Blair announces "the end is in sight" but delays general
election.
20 Jun 2001 - Government announces future inquiry.
16 Jul 2001 - DEFRA figures show 3 575 000 animals slaughtered or
identified as being for slaughter with 22 000 pending an appeal.

[It is interesting that DEFRA blames the farmers for the continuing
outbreaks. A number of reports have indicated that the infection was only
found on some of these farms when cattle were mixed with the sheep and came
down with disease, indicating a prior ovine chronic infection. Across the
country there are a large series of serious animal welfare problems
affecting cattle, pigs and sheep because of movement restrictions and
related events. The situation is not made easier by delays in government
compensation payments, which presently take a minimum of 3 months.
