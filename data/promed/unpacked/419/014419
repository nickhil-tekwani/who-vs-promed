The Ministry of Health has implemented an action plan to locate passengers who shared a flight to Punta Cana [Dominican Republic] with a woman who died of meningitis.

Passengers shared LAN flight no 592, which departed from Santiago [Chile] at 9:55 pm last Sunday [16 Dec 2012], bound for the Dominican Republic.

The health authority began by giving preventive treatment to direct contacts of the passenger who died, while travel agencies are trying to locate the rest of the passengers.

An estimated 200 passengers were exposed to infection during the 7 hour long trip.

[LAN is the flag carrier of Chile and it is based in Santiago, Chile, serving Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Europe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_Airlines).

ProMED-mail has been posting reports of an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in Chile this year (2012) (see postings listed below). According to a recent news report posted by ProMED-mail (Meningitis, meningococcal - Chile (03): (VS, RM) update 20121110.1403844), there have been a total of 98 cases of meningococcal meningitis. The outbreak is centered mainly in 2 Chilean regions: the Metropolitan Region (RM), which includes Santiago, and the region of Valparaiso. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 predominates in the Metropolitan Region and serogroup B predominates in Valparaiso.

Although the microbe that caused meningitis in the passenger on LAN flight 592 was not stated in the news report above, presumably it was the meningococcus, _N. meningitidis_. Meningococcal infection is spread primarily through direct contact with respiratory droplets from a nasopharyngeal carrier or an infected person. The incubation period between infection and appearance of symptoms is generally 3 to 4 days, but may range from 2 to 10 days.

While this risk of secondary transmission among household members is estimated to be low (4 cases per 1000 household members at risk), it is 500 to 800 times higher than in the general population. Other at-risk contacts include attendees at the same child-care center, or anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions (such as, through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or endotracheal intubation). Risk is also high in travelers who have prolonged contact with local populations in the Africa meningitis belt during an epidemic. The Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia has been associated with outbreaks of meningococcal disease in returning pilgrims and their contacts.

Antibiotics are recommended to prevent secondary infection in close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease. Because the risk for illness is highest during the 1st few days after infection, chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) after contact with an index case-patient. Chemoprophylaxis administered after 14 days is probably of limited or no value. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for people in the same household, roommates, child-care/preschool contacts, and people who have been exposed directly to a patient's oral secretions through close social contact (such as kissing or sharing of eating utensils) during the 7 days before onset of disease in the index case. Antibiotics that effectively eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ include rifampin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin and these drugs are appropriate for chemoprophylaxis. In areas of the United States where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of _N. meningitidis_ have been detected, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm and http://www.unboundmedicine.com/redbook/ub/view/RedBook/187078/7/meningococcal_vaccine_for).

From February 1999 through May 2001, the US CDC reported it received 21 reports from local health departments of suspected cases of air travel associated meningococcal disease, on average 1.9 days (range: 0--10 days) between the completion of the flight and the onset of illness; CDC reported that 5 of these passengers had symptomatic meningococcal disease before their arrival (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm). No cases of secondary disease occurred among air travel contacts of persons with meningococcal disease; nevertheless, CDC noted that passengers who are seated next to a person with meningococcal disease for a prolonged flight are more likely to be exposed directly to the patient's oral secretions and are probably at higher risk for developing meningococcal disease than those seated farther from the index case-patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).

CDC, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, developed procedures for the management of air travel associated exposure to the meningococcus. The assessment of risk to passengers and flight crew members is based on the flight duration and seating proximity to the index case-patient. In the absence of data about increased risk to other passengers, they recommend antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be considered for passengers who are seated immediately next to an index case-patient for flights of more than 8 hours, including ground time (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5023a2.htm).
