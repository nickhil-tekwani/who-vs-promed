Regarding the recent pestivirus outbreak in Spanish chamois: we have found a
high pestivirus prevalence in Italian chamois too; also a possible new strain.
This has been published in Vet Microbiol. 2005 Jul 1;108(3-4):297-
303 "Seroprevalence of pestivirus in 4 species of alpine wild ungulates in the
High Valley of Susa, Italy" by R.G.M. Olde Revering, A. Dominici, H.W. Barkema
and A.J. de Smit.

[Contrary to the observations from the Pyrenees, this paper does not mention
observed clinical problems or increased mortality in Italian Chamois. For
subscribers' convenience, we present the (edited) abstract:
"The goal of this study was to investigate seroprevalence of pestivirus in 4
alpine wild ungulates in the High Valley of Susa, north-west Italy: red deer
(_Cervus elaphus_), roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_), wild boar (_Sus scrofa_)
and chamois (_Rupicapra rupicapra_). A further goal was using virus
neutralisation tests (VNT) for 4 strains of pestivirus in chamois and wild
boar. 375 serum samples collected during the hunting season of 1999 were
tested for pestivirus-specific antibodies. Positive sera of chamois and wild
boar were subsequently tested in a VNT with 4 major subtypes of pestivirus,
and virus isolation was performed. No antibodies were found in the 73 samples
of roe deer, while 7 (12.5 percent), 8 (5.9 percent) and 28 (25.5 percent) of
56, 136 and 110 samples of wild boar, red deer and chamois were ELISA-
positive, respectively. Different ranges of titers were found in the VNT and
no pestivirus was isolated in the ELISA-positive wild boar and chamois
samples. Seroprevalence was particularly high in chamois. Further
investigation is needed to characterise the pestiviruses that circulate in
these animals." - Mod.AS]
