Abstract
----------
Recent reports from Europe and the USA described Seoul [SEOV] orthohantavirus infection in pet rats and their breeders/owners, suggesting the potential emergence of a "new" public health problem. Wild and laboratory rat-induced Seoul infections have, however, been described since the early 80s, due to the omnipresence of the rodent reservoir, the brown rat _Rattus norvegicus_. Recent studies showed no fundamental differences between the pathogenicity and phylogeny of pet rat-induced Seoul orthohantaviruses and their formerly described wild or laboratory rat counterparts. The paucity of diagnosed Seoul virus-induced disease in the West is in striking contrast to the thousands of cases recorded since the 1980s in the Far East, particularly in China. This review of 4 continents (Asia, Europe, America, and Africa) puts this "emerging infection" into a historical perspective, concluding there is an urgent need for greater medical awareness of Seoul virus-induced human pathology in many parts of the world. Given the mostly milder and atypical clinical presentation, sometimes even with preserved normal kidney function, the importance of simple but repeated urine examination is stressed, since initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria are rarely lacking.

Current situation [excerpt]
------------------------------
Human SEOV-HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] has until recently (2012) been underestimated in the West [1,16-19,68,165]. The reasons for this are not clear, but differences in the degree of exposure and the availability of diagnostic testing probably play a role: in China, virtually all HFRS cases are serologically screened with HTNV [Hantaan virus], which cross-reacts with SEOV. In contrast, in Europe, serologic screening relies primarily on PUUV [Puumala virus] antigens [7,19], while in the Americas, SNV [Sin Nombre virus] and/or ANDV [Andes virus] antigens are most frequently used, and HTNV and/or SEOV antigens are not [16,18,22,94], thus probably missing some isolated SEOV cases. In parts of Europe, Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus (DOBV), another murid pathogen isolated in 1988, can cause important cross-reactions with SEOV in IFA and ELISA serology [22]. Serologic analysis using 2 commercial European immunoblots was misleading in the 1st reported SEOV-HFRS case in Germany. The commercial Hantavirus Profile 1 Immunoblot (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) lacked a SEOV antigen, and the recomLine HantaPlus IgG and IgM blot assays (Mikrogen, Martinsried, Germany) showed reactivity for the 3 murid pathogens DOBV, HTNV, and SEOV, but yielded the weakest result for SEOV nucleocapsid protein. The final diagnosis was only possible after RT-PCR examination on the earliest available acute serum sample after hospitalization in Hamburg, Germany [22]. In this aspect, it is useful to remember that if the IgG IFA screening of the 1sDrt British series of North-Irish farmers with acute hantavirus-induced AKI had been performed only with the then classical antigens PUUV and HTNV, but without the Chinese SEOV antigen R22, 13/15 (86.7%) of the cases would have been missed in 1994, which is unacceptable [94].

[Dr. Clement is thanked for forwarding this report to us. The full article, including figures and references, is available at the source URL above.

This report provides a worldwide overview of Seoul hantavirus occurrences in domestic and wild brown rats and clinical pictures region-by-region with helpful maps and an extensive bibliography. Interested ProMED-mail readers are urged to read the entire report.

On a practical note, Dr. Clement has cautioned ProMED readers about the risk of underreporting of SEOV infections in the west and in Africa. Concerning the lack of SEOV infections reported in the Americas, he commented that there is a need to be able to differentiate Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) as a causative agent, but that is hampered by the fact that most current commercial ELISA or WB formats no longer contain a SEOV antigen, so that a preliminary presumption of a hantavirus infection can even be missed in non-research laboratories (ibidem, and: Reynes JM, Carli D, Bour JB et al. Seoul virus infection in humans, France, 2014-2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6): 973-7; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-0927_article).

One hopes that the above review will prompt clinicians to include SEOV infections in their rule-outs and supporting laboratories to include the reagents required to detect that virus and its corresponding antibodies. The paucity of reporting of SEOV in Africa and the Americas brings to mind the saying that, "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." - Mod.TY]
