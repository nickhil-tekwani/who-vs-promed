The Karnataka Forest Department is on 'high alert' following the death of an 8 year old tusker, suspected of anthrax, at Urigam reserve forests in Tamil Nadu on Monday last [14 Oct 2013].

Principal chief conservator of Forests (Wildlife) GS Prabhu told Express that the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary is situated adjacent to Krishnagiri Forests of Tamil Nadu and this was one of the major worries for them. Officers concerned had been asked to intensify patrolling within the sanctuary as well as to have an eye on elephants.

He said the Department of Veterinary Sciences has agreed to vaccinate cattle for anthrax in villages all along the sanctuary border after 8-10 days as they had vaccinated them for foot-and-mouth disease recently.

The forest officials have sealed all entry points for cattle into the sanctuary as a precautionary measure. Villagers have also been asked not to enter forests, he added.

Prabhu said the surveillance units are kept on high alert and the department has taken all precautionary steps to make sure that the disease does not spread to wild animals in the Cauvery Wildlife sanctuary. "We are closely monitoring the situation and we will take appropriate steps regularly."

Death of tusker sparks off anthrax scare in Krishnagiri
-------------------------------------------------------
KRISHNAGIRI: The unnatural death of an 8 year old tusker, suspected of anthrax, at Urigam reserve forest here [in Krishnagiri] on Monday [14 Oct 2013] has raised fears of an epidemic outbreak. Forest and veterinary officials suspecting anthrax causing the death of the animal have sent samples of its viscera to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Chennai for detailed tests. "A final confirmation will be made only after the test results are out. Meanwhile, we will start vaccination work in all the hamlets and villages surrounding the reserve forest," AK Ulaganathan, district forest officer (DFO), Krishnagiri district told TOI.

On Monday [14 Oct 2013], a male elephant was found dead at Thakkatti forest in Urigam forest range. Since anthrax was suspected, the forest and veterinary officials took out vital organs such as liver, kidney, lungs after post-mortem. The carcass was then burnt. "Samples were sent to the laboratory at Chennai. The results will be out in a couple of days," the DFO said.

Forest officials said the anthrax virus [sic; bacterium] is usually alive for over 30 years. "Even if it is anthrax, the virus must have been alive in the soil for such a long time. We don't think there is the possibility of an epidemic outbreak in the wake of this incident. At the same time, we don't want to leave this issue normally," the DFO added.

According to the forest department sources, the carcass of the elephant was found on Monday morning at Thakkatti forest. During examination, veterinary doctors found that blood had oozed out of the nose and mouth of the animal that sparked panic which has sparked panic among foresters.

While anthrax is a possibility, nothing can be said for sure until the test reports for viscera samples are received, said forest department sources. The elephant carcass was disposed the same evening.

The forest department has started a thorough screening of the forests in the region to find out whether any other elephant or animal had died in the past few days. Foresters said the last case of anthrax was reported from Hosur forest region several years ago and there were no symptoms of anthrax after that. "So far, we have not spotted any other carcass in the forest. Had the disease spread, there would have been more deaths. We are taking every necessary step to arrest the disease from spreading. We have also asked the animal husbandry department to check whether any case of anthrax was reported among the cattle in forest villages," said Ulaganathan.

The department is working with the veterinary department to vaccinate cattle belonging to villagers living in fringe areas of different forests. "We are keeping a close watch on the elephant population as well. Besides, we have stopped cattle from grazing inside the forest, especially where the carcass of the elephant was found," forest officials' said.
