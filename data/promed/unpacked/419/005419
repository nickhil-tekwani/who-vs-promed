A growing body of University of Liverpool data shows ovine Johne's disease (OJD) is present on 59-65% of farms surveyed in academic and industry trials, Dr Peers Davies, University of Liverpool, told the National Sheep Association event in Malvern last week (27 Jul 2022). More than half of UK flocks could have elevated culling rates because of Johne's disease.

He said eradication of OJD -- caused by _Mycobacterium avium_ subspecies paratuberculosis -- was "at best difficult and at worst impossible." However, he stressed the negative impact of the disease could be mitigated if shepherds knew it was there.

"Johne's infects lambs very early on in life, as it does in calves," said Dr Davies. "As lambs get older, they are less susceptible to infection."

He said infection routes were mainly from the environment as newborn lambs but also included through colostrum and in utero. This marked OJD out as slightly different from the other iceberg diseases (caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), maedi visnae (MV), jaagsiekta/ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), Jaagsiekte, border disease), which do not persist in the environment.

He said researchers suspect many ewes have been infected with OJD as lambs and live with the subclinical disease, spreading it to others before being culled due to being thin and barren.

"A key step is identifying whether the environment in which the young lambs are in is contaminated," said Dr Davies.

Dr Davies said OJD is unreported and often undiagnosed because:
- infected lambs have a long, latent infection;
- as adults they start shedding the bacteria into the environment themselves;
- some of these sheep will develop clinical disease, but some will be removed before they show clinical symptoms and are instead subclinically affected.

A definitive diagnosis has never been achieved in a very high proportion of cases.

[Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease, ParaTB), a WOAH-listed disease, is a chronic enteritis of ruminants caused by _Mycobacterium avium_ subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Infection mostly occurs at a young age, eventually expressed clinically months/years later. Clinical signs in cattle include slowly progressive wasting and diarrhoea, which is intermittent at first, becoming progressively more severe until it is constantly present. In sheep, the principal symptom is a progressive loss of weight which results in extreme emaciation after a course of several weeks. Diarrhoea is less common in sheep than in cattle, though may be severe in certain breeds. Appetite remains good. Finally, weakness increases and the animals go down some days before death.

Diagnosis of ParaTB is made on clinical grounds confirmed by the demonstration of MAP in the faeces by microscopy, culture, or by the use of DNA probes and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Diagnosis is made at necropsy by the finding of the pathognomonic lesions of the disease in the intestines, either grossly with the demonstration of typical acid-fast organisms in impression smears of the lesions or histologically, and by isolation of MAP in culture. Control of PraTB is difficult because of the prolonged course of infection, the predominantly subclinical nature of the disease, and lack of tests for accurate detection of subclinically infected animals. Isolates from sheep have different characteristics from those in cattle, but the laboratory detection and diagnostic methods are the same.

The (slightly abridged) abstract of a 2019 review paper addressing the control of PraTB in livestock, in 48 countries, follows:

"Paratuberculosis was found to be very common in cattle and sheep. In about half the countries more than 20% of herds and flocks were infected with MAP. Most countries had large ruminant populations (millions), several types of farmed ruminants, multiple husbandry systems, and tens of thousands of individual farms, creating challenges for disease control. In addition, numerous species of free-living wildlife were infected. ParaTB was notifiable in most countries. Formal control programs were present in 22/48 countries; generally, these were the more highly developed countries with advanced veterinary services. Of the countries without a formal control program for PraTB, 76% were in South and Central America, Asia, and Africa while 20% were in Europe. Control programs were justified most commonly on animal health grounds, but protecting market access and public health were other factors. Prevalence reduction was the major objective in most countries, but Norway and Sweden aimed to eradicate the disease, so surveillance and response were their major objectives. Government funding was involved in about 2/3 of countries, but operations tended to be funded by farmers and their organizations and not by the government alone. The majority of countries (60%) had voluntary control programs. Generally, programs were supported by incentives for joining, financial compensation, and/or penalties for non-participation. Performance indicators, structure, leadership, practices and tools used in control programs are also presented. Securing funding for long-term control activities was a widespread problem. Control programs were reported to be successful in 16 (73%) of the 22 countries."
