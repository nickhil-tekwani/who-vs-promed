Suspected Anisakiasis in Israel
--------------------------------------
A 31-year-old, previously healthy Israeli male patient developed on 17 Jun
2003, severe, sudden-onset, and prolonged abdominal symptoms (including
abdominal pain and subsequently diarrhoea) as well as extreme eosinophilia
(80 percent of 43.7 x 10x3/micl WBC's), 2 weeks after consuming salmon roe
in Belgium and hours after ingesting a tuna sandwich in Israel. The patient
works as a food engineer in a large fast-food international company, and
eats only Kosher food. Liver function tests showed mild abnormalities. No
parasites were found in stool specimens.
Serologies for toxocariasis and strongyloidiasis were negative. A
gastroscopy showed only active chronic superficial gastritis due to _H.
pylori_ infection but no eosinophilic infiltration or other evidence of
parasitic infection. Colonoscopy revealed mild signs of inflammation in the
right colon, and mucosal biopsy showed marked eosinophilic infiltration.
Over a period of several weeks, the patient's clinical status partially
improved, while the eosinophilia decreased progressively to a level around
25 percent of 12x 10x3/micl WBC's, and remained static at this level for
several weeks. The patient then received a 3-week course of albendazole,
800 mg/day (Lancet 2002; 360:54), which resulted in resolution of all
symptoms, the eosinophilia, as well as the liver function abnormalities.
Using western blot, serological tests for anisakiasis were done by
Sung-weon Cho, MD, Ph.D at the Department of Parasitology of the Korea
University College of Medicine (Parasite Immunol 2003; 25:1-7). Though
there were several bands with the patient's serum, the intensity of
staining was weak. The serological result indicates the probability of
anisakiasis, but the probability of cross-reaction by another species of
nematode was not completely ruled out.

[Human anisakiasis was first recognised in Japan more than 40 years go,
with a clinical picture of abdominal pain, eosinophilia, and eosinophil
infiltrations into the intestinal wall. 2 species are very common in
saltwater fish: _Anisakis simplex_ and _Pseudoterranova decipiens_, with
the latter typical in temperate and arctic climates. We have for instance
found it in 80 percent of herrings from the Baltic sea. The larvae live in
the abdominal cavity between the intestines of the fish, but when the fish
dies, the larvae migrate into the muscles. Prevention of anisakiasis
therefore depends on immediate cleaning of caught fish or cooling of the
fish on ice. The patient described above has all the characteristics of an
anisakis infection, but whether he was infected in Belgium or Israel cannot
be determined. Another interesting clinical picture attributed to
anisakiasis is urticaria and food allergy, primarily described in Spain
[Audicana MT et al., Trends in Parasitology 2002,18(1):20-25], in which
even dead larvae may be responsible. Again, proper cleaning of the fish
will prevent exposure to the allergens. - Mod.EP]
