DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs] has released a
document on what they plan to do were BSE found to be in the national
flock. Essentially it is to slaughter all 40 million sheep.
"CONTINGENCY PLAN for the emergence of naturally occurring BSE in sheep in
the United Kingdom National Flock"
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/sheepbse/sbseplan.pdf>
On 1 Oct 2001 a consultation exercise was begun seeking views on the
Government's draft contingency plan setting out the actions that would need
to be taken if BSE is found in the UK sheep flock. The deadline for
comments is 21 Dec 2001.

[I suspect that DEFRA came out with this coat-tailing proposal so as to
have the decks clear if such a situation arose and that there would be
consensus in advance on what to do. As the reality of ovine BSE has yet to
emerge, this thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ]
