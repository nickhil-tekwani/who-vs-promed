The cholera outbreak in Iraq has continued to decline over the past 3 weeks with a few cases being reported from the affected districts or governorates. A total of 4858 laboratory-confirmed cases tested at provincial laboratories have been reported from the country, with 2 related deaths as of 17 Nov 2015.

Currently, 17 out of the 19 governorates in Iraq have reported laboratory-confirmed cases. The central public health laboratory has identified that the causative strain of this outbreak is _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Inaba. The strain has been found to be sensitive to commonly-used antimicrobials, including tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. A total of 16 isolates have been sent to the Pasteur Institute in France for genotyping and other advanced testing.

Since the 1st laboratory-confirmed case of cholera in Iraq was notified officially to WHO on 15 Sep 2015 in Alshamiya district in Diwaniya governorate, the Ministry of Health has collected 119 983 stool samples for suspected cholera. The positive stool samples were re-tested at the central public health laboratory in Baghdad for quality purposes and only 2745 stools samples were found to be positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Inaba.

Nearly 10 districts within Baghdad, Babylon, Diwaniya, and Muthana governorates have reported over 89 percent of all laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, and most of these districts receive their water supply solely from the Euphrates river. Figure 1 [for figure, see source URL above. - Mod.LL] shows the declining trends in the number of laboratory-confirmed cholera cases reported daily in Iraq between 30 Aug 2015 and 17 Nov 2015.

The trends in cholera cases in the 4 most affected governorates and 5 most affected districts have been declining significantly in recent weeks. Likewise, district and governorate's specific attack rates have clearly shown a downward trend in the last few weeks.

Considering the available surveillance data, there is no evidence that cholera is spreading to new communities or districts. According to the Ministry of Health none of the internally displaced persons and refugee camps across Iraq reported any laboratory-confirmed cholera cases.
