Headlines
- In an extraordinary joint statement by the chairs of the main independent, advisory, and oversight committees of the GPEI, the chairs urge everyone involved in polio eradication to ensure polio will finally be assigned to the history books by 2023. The authors are the chairs of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE), the Independent Monitoring Board, the emergency committee of the International Health Regulations (IHR) regarding international spread of poliovirus, and the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC). The Endgame Plan through 2018 has brought the world to the brink of being polio-free. A new strategic plan 2019-2023 aims to build on the lessons learned since 2013. The joint statement urges everyone involved in the effort to find ways to excel in their roles. If this happens, the statement continues, success will follow. But otherwise, come 2023, the world will find itself exactly where it is today: tantalizingly close. But in an eradication effort, tantalizingly close is not good enough. The statement therefore issues an impassioned plea to everyone to dedicate themselves to one clear objective: to reach that very last child with polio vaccine.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 2 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Afghanistan - 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - one case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and 8 VDPV2-positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- No WPV1 case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 was 21.
- 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: 3 from Kandahar province, 2 from Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province, and 2 from Lashkargah district, Hilmand province. All samples were collected on [26 Dec 2018].
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.

Pakistan
- 2 cases of WPV1 were reported this week from Bajour districts in Federally Administered Tribal Area. The onset of paralysis was [29 and 31 Dec 2018], respectively.
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 from Peshawar district in Khyber Pakhthunkhwa province, 1 from South Waziristan district in FATA, 1 from Killa Abdullah district in Balochistan province, and 2 from Site and Saddar union councils in Karachi district, Sindh province. Samples were collected from [18 Dec 2018 to 7 Jan 2019].
- Pakistan has an ongoing nationwide bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) campaign targeting 39 million children by the end of the week.

Nigeria
- 1 case of cVDPV2 in Baruten LGA in Kwara state (close to Benin border). The case had an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 was 34.
- 3 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 from Maiduguri LGA in Borno state, collected on [11 Dec 2018]; 1 from Zaria and 1 from Ikara LGAs in Kaduna state, collected on [30 Nov 2018] and [11 Dec 2018], respectively.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Niger was 9, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from the Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [30 Oct 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 was 20.
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1, a coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 was 26.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018] in a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province) and a community contact of the case.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2.

[The above weekly report confirms that the 2 newly confirmed WPV1-associated cases reported in Pakistan had dates of onset of paralysis during December 2018 and therefore are being counted as 2018 cases (in the last report, we mentioned the End Polio Pakistan website had dates of onset of paralysis in 2019).

The above report confirms the media reports on the WPV1 cases identified in Pakistan and the cVDPV2 case identified in Kwara state, Nigeria, covered as an advance notification in last week's global update. Perhaps I have missed this, but the report on Nigeria discusses the newly confirmed case in Kwara state near the border with Benin but does not mention to which of the 2 ongoing outbreaks this virus is associated, Jigawa vs Sokoto. While there is a suggestion that the outbreak in Jigawa has been associated with both intra-Nigeria spread as well as international spread (to Niger), it is not explicitly mentioned in the discussion of this new case.

In summary, 2018 was a year with increases in WPV1-associated cases (33 cases) and cVDPV-associated cases (102 cases). As an optimist, I'd like to think we can attribute this increase in cases to improved surveillance and detection of poliovirus-associated disease.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Mozambique [25 Jan 2019]
--------------------------
On [17 Jan 2019], 2 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were reported from Molumbo district, Zambezia province, Mozambique. The 1st one was from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, and the 2nd isolate was from a community contact of the 1st case, a child aged one year old.

Public health response
WHO and partners at the regional and country level are assisting the Ministry of Health and local public health authorities to conduct a thorough field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) to assess the extent and original source of circulation of this virus more clearly and to further plan and support the implementation of an outbreak response as appropriate, in line with internationally agreed outbreak-response protocols.

While national routine oral polio vaccine type 3 (OPV3) immunization coverage in 2017 was estimated at 80%, population immunity gaps remain at subnational levels, especially in Zambezia province (with 60% OPV3 coverage).

WHO risk assessment
WHO assessed the overall public health risk at the national level to be high due to a decline in population immunity to type 2 poliovirus and the risk of international spread to be medium due to ongoing population movements.

The detection of cVDPV2 underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation and underscores the risk posed by any medium to low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniform high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's international travel and health recommends that before travelling to areas with active poliovirus transmission, travellers from polio-free countries should ensure they have completed the age-appropriate polio vaccination series, according to their respective national immunization schedule. Travellers to polio-infected areas who completed an OPV or IPV vaccine series more than 12 months previously should be given another one-time booster dose of polio vaccine. Before travelling abroad, persons of all ages residing in polio-infected countries (i.e., those with active transmission of a wild or vaccine-derived poliovirus) and long-term visitors to such countries (i.e., persons who spend more than 4 weeks in the country) should have completed a full course of vaccination against polio in compliance with the national schedule. Travellers from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel to boost intestinal mucosal immunity and reduce the risk of poliovirus shedding, which could lead to reintroduction of poliovirus into a polio-free area. For persons who previously received only IPV, OPV should be the choice for the booster dose, if available and feasible. In case of unavoidable last-minute travel, travellers who have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the previous 12 months should still receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure. Updates on currently or recently infected countries can be found on the website of the GPEI.

As per the advice of the emergency committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to temporary recommendations. To comply with the temporary recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and implement all required measures to support polio eradication, such as adequate vaccination of international travellers, and intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data and intensify cross-border efforts.

In addition, the committee emphasized that states infected with cVDPV2 should encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV (if available in country) 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel. States should ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status. The Committee also noted the existence of a separate mechanism for responding to type 2 poliovirus infections and recommended that states should consider requesting vaccines from the global mOPV2 stockpile based on the recommendations of the Advisory Group on mOPV2. The full statement of the Emergency Committee Polio is available from the WHO website.

[In the global weekly update found above (section [1]) there is mention that "in January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2." This is suggestive that the origin of this current cVDPV2 may be related to the campaign conducted using the mOPV2 in early 2017. If there is a relationship between the use of the mOPV2 and the later development of cVDPV2-associated cases in a country with suboptimal poliovaccine coverages, this will make the 2nd such incident reported in the past month, with the 1st event being the identification of a 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 in the DRC: "The recent emergence of the 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program's current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner" (taken from the WHO update on the outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the DRC (see Poliomyelitis update (02): DR Congo, cVDPV, WHO, China, vaccine challenges 20190109.6250155).

It is curious there is no mention of the use of IPV and coverages with IPV following the removal of the OPV2 virus from the OPV used globally in 2016. It is also unclear of the bivalent coverages - OPV1 and OPV3 viruses.

Repeating my comment when the 1st suspected cVDPV2 cases suspected to be related to the use of mOPV2 were reported: "The disturbing part of the above report is the sentence, 'The recent emergence of the 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program's current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner.' This may be a presage of future events with cVDPV2 outbreaks in other areas with suboptimal vaccination infrastructures and resultant suboptimal coverages during vaccination campaigns for other cVDPV outbreaks."
