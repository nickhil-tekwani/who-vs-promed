White nose syndrome appearing in caves across Eastern US
--------------------------------------------------------
A bat in southern Indiana has tested positive for a deadly fungus
believed to have killed more than 1 million of the animals across the country.

Researchers doing bat counts at Endless Cave in Washington County
[Indiana] discovered 2 little brown bats that exhibited the white
fungus characteristic of white nose syndrome [WNS], said officials
with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources [DNR].

Tom Melius, the Midwest regional director for the US Fish and
Wildlife Service [USFWS], said officials expected WNS, as the fungus
is known, to reach Indiana caves this year [2011].

"Nonetheless, it is devastating to actually confirm the presence of
the fungus and witness the signs of WNS in bats," he said. "While
there is currently no cure and no treatment for this disease, we will
put all our energies into contributing to the ongoing efforts to
understand and combat WNS."

Researchers associate WNS with a newly identified fungus that thrives
in the cold and humid conditions characteristic of caves and mines
used by hibernating bats.

Physical signs associated with WNS are a white fungus on the bat's
nose, wings, ears, or tail membrane, officials said. Bats afflicted
with WNS often exhibit unusual behavior in winter, including
clustering near hibernacula entrances. Affected bats also may leave
their hibernacula during the day and may be observed flying or
clinging to rocks outside or on nearby buildings.

Experts believe WNS is transmitted primarily from bat to bat, but
they also caution it may be transmitted by humans inadvertently
carrying fungal spores from cave to cave on their clothing and caving gear.

The DNR closed public access to all caves on state-managed properties
2 years ago in an effort to thwart the spread of the fungus. "We will
continue to keep all of our caves closed, and we are urging private
cave owners to either not allow access to their caves or require
visitors to follow USFWS decontamination procedures," said DNR deputy
director John Davis. "The whole effort is to slow the spread and have
movement of the disease not be exacerbated by human interference."

The fungus has been discovered in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia,
and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada.

[White nose syndrome (WNS) has been attributed to a fungus,
_Geomyces_ spp. There remain many unknown issues with this fungus,
including how it is spread, what makes a bat susceptible to it, or is
there some other debilitating illness that allows the bats to be
susceptible to the fungus.

Regardless of what remains unknown about this disease, caution
regarding biosecurity around caves remains extremely important. - Mod.TG]
