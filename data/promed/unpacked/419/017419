Cases of HFRS recorded in the Voronezh Oblast
---------------------------------------------
In the first 10 months of 2008, 11 cases of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) have been recorded in the Voronezh Oblast. HFRS
cases were reported in the Borisoglebskiy (1) Verkhnemamonskiy (1)
and Ramonskiy (2) regions of the Oblast, and in Voronezh city (7).
The increased incidence of HFRS is being attributed to the autumn
migration of the murine vector of HFRS from the countryside into
human habitations. Preventative measures comprise the rodent control
procedures adopted throughout the Russian Federation.
