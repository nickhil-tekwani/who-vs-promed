Tororo district agricultural officer Mr Patrick Okware has said the
district has been hit by the banana wilt disease. Over 15 rural
sub-counties, 2 town councils of Malaba and Nagongera, and the municipality
have all been affected.
Banana wilt attacks banana plantations and ripens them prematurely and
unevenly, and eventually they rot. It also makes the male bud dry out.
Mr Okware said there isn't any drug that can kill banana wilt and that all
banana types can be infected. "We only advise farmers to use the only known
control methods that include cutting off the male bud of every stem as soon
as the last bunch of bananas start curving upwards," said Mr Okware. "Every
banana plantation has evidence of the disease, but the intensity varies
according to management practice of the plantation." He said his office had
embarked on a sensitization program.

Banana farmers in Rukungiri District have petitioned the district
agricultural officer and the National Agricultural Advisory Services to
intervene in the spread of the dreaded banana bacterial wilt which has
attacked their plantations and which may be wiped out if no interventions
are made. The chairman of the District Farmers Forum, Mr Alfonse Kasigaire,
said on Monday [10 Dec 2007] that the disease has been reported in all sub
counties in the district and poses a big threat to the farmers who mostly
depend on the banana for staple food and for sale. "We need to be helped to
combat the spread of the disease, because if nothing is done, then in the
near future, we shall have no banana trees here," Mr Kasigaire said.
The most hit areas are in Kisharara parish in Buyanja sub-county, Rushasha
parish in Nyakagyeme sub-county, and in Kihanga village in Buhunga
sub-county. The disease has also been reported in Kigiro, Garubunda
parishes in Kebisoni sub-county and all the 6 parishes in Kagunga sub-county.
When contacted, the District National Agricultural Advisory Services
(Naads) coordinator, Mr Zepher Karyaija, said his office has already
started sensitizing farmers in the affected areas on how to control the
spread of the disease. "We have already put aside some funds to ensure that
the disease is eliminated. The banana multiplication component is one of
the major activities we have been promoting, so we can't allow it to be
destroyed," Mr Karyaija said. He said farmers were being encouraged to work
in groups so that they can learn from each other to minimize the spread and
added that the farmers who were not cooperating will be singled out and be
fined.
The district agricultural officer Mr Gad Kasigazi, however, blamed the
spread of the disease on some farmers who fail to report to the authorities
so that they can be helped with measures to combat the spread before it
becomes rampant.
The disease has led to scarcity of bananas, and the price of the crop has
doubled within one week.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) in Uganda and other East African countries. It also
causes a wilt disease of enset (_Ensete_ species, family _Musaceae_), a
root staple food used, for example, in Ethiopia. The pathogen affects all
banana types and causes wilting and premature ripening of the fruit. An
incidence of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to
90 per cent have been reported.
In Uganda, the disease started in Mukono district (Central Region) in 2001
and has been spreading since. BBW has inflicted damage by reducing cropped
area by 13 per cent between 2001 and 2004, causing production to decline by
between 65 and 80 per cent in the affected areas. Conservative estimates
indicate an annual USD 4 billion loss if BBW is not controlled. The disease
is a significant concern in the region jeopardizing food security.
The pathogen survives in soil and plant debris and is mainly spread via
infected planting material, insects, mechanical means, and contaminated
farm tools. A range of alternate crop and weed hosts including cereals,
cabbage, tobacco, and ornamentals may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management techniques such as removal and burning of all diseased plants,
removal of spent male flowers and use of clean tools have been successful
in reducing the number of new infections on individual farms. Nevertheless,
BBW continues to spread in the region. The 2 districts mentioned in these
reports were still reported to be free of BBW in 2006.
