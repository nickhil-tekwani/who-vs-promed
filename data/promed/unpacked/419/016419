Malaysia: hand, foot & mouth disease alert in Penang
----------------------------------------------------
All 334 Sentinel Centers nationwide have been reminded to be on alert for
any outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), Health Ministry
Communicable Disease Control Division director Dr Ramlee Rahmat said today
[Tue 22 Feb 2005]. The Centers include 106 private and 119 government
health clinics, and 109 treatment centers. Since HFMD is an endemic disease
in Malaysia, he said, they had been told always to be on the alert for an
outbreak, especially among children aged under 10 years. Some 352 children
were hospitalized for HFMD within the 1st 50 days of this year [2005]. No
deaths have been reported.
Penang recorded 309 cases, followed by Pahang (30), Selangor (8), and Johor
(5). For the whole of last year [2004], Penang recorded 364 cases, Selangor
(36), Johor (31), and Pahang (12). Dr Ramlee said reports had yet to be
obtained from other states.
A statewide alert in Pahang was issued following the hospitalization over
the past week [3rd week of February 2005] of 15 children from Jengka and
Jerantut. The children, all below 5 years of age, were admitted to the
Jengka Hospital with symptoms of the disease, which include high fever,
cough, mouth ulcers, and a rash on the palms and soles of the feet.
Symptoms also include sore throat, running nose, vomiting and diarrhea.
Deputy Menteri Besar Datuk Tan Mohd Aminuddin Ishak has instructed the
State Health Department to check the cleanliness of places frequented by
young children, such as kindergartens and daycare centers, as children were
the most prone to the viral disease. Dr Ramlee said all HFMD cases reported
so far this year [2005] were isolated cases and had been brought under control.
