Turkey's Health Ministry said on Monday that a 4th person had died of the
avian influenza virus infection that has swept the country over the past 2
weeks, the state-run Anatolian news agency reported. "The test results on
[the girl] who died yesterday [Sun 15 Jan 2006] were found to be positive,"
the Health Ministry's bird flu coordination centre stated. "The total
number of laboratory-confirmed positive cases is now 20," the statement
said. 3 infected children from the same family had already died but most of
the patients are not in life-threatening condition.
The Ministry had previously said that initial tests on [the deceased girl]
from eastern Turkey had been negative although doctors suspected she had
contracted the disease. Her brother has also tested positive for the H5N1
strain and is in critical condition in a hospital in eastern Turkey, the
region hardest hit by the outbreak.
The H5N1 virus has been found in wild birds and poultry across large parts
of Turkey, particularly in poor villages stretching from Istanbul at the
gates of Europe to Van near the Iranian and Iraqi borders. The World Health
Organization says it believes human victims have contracted the disease
from close contact with infected poultry, in most cases children playing
with birds or helping families kill them for food or sale.

Laboratory tests conducted at Turkey's National Influenza Centre in Ankara
have confirmed 2 additional cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The 1st newly confirmed case is a 5 year old boy from the
district of Dogubayazit in Agri Province in the eastern part of the
country. He remains in hospital in a stable condition.
His 14 year old sister died on 15 Jan 2006 of a respiratory disease with
clinical features similar to those seen in H5N1 infection. Test results
received today have confirmed her infection.
As with all other cases seen in Turkey to date, both children developed
illness following direct exposure to diseased poultry. Ducks began dying in
the family's household flock on 1 Jan 2006. On that day, the girl, assisted
by her brother, slaughtered a duck for food. Both children developed
symptoms on 4 Jan 2006 and were admitted to hospital on 11 Jan 2006. No
other family members have developed signs of illness. These newly confirmed
cases bring the total in Turkey to 20, of which 4 were fatal. Of the 20
cases, 18 have been children in the age range of 4-18 years.
A large number of patient samples have been sent to a WHO collaborating
laboratory in the United Kingdom for verification of diagnosis and further
analysis. WHO will adjust the number of cases and deaths in Turkey in its
cumulative table of laboratory-confirmed cases upon receipt of results from
the UK laboratory.
New outbreaks in birds continue to be reported across the country. To date,
poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza have been
confirmed in 12 of the country's 81 provinces. Outbreaks in an additional
19 provinces are under investigation.

[The 4 fatal cases of H5N1 avian influenza recorded in Turkey have
comprised 2 pairs of siblings. None of the remaining 16 cases (14 of whom
are children) has developed serious disease. The peculiar vulnerability of
children in Turkey to H5N1 virus infection, in contrast to the situation in
East Asia, has yet to be explained. The nucleotide sequence data derived
from patient samples indicates that the H5N1 virus circulating in Turkey is
closely related to Chinese isolates, suggesting that social and
environmental factors -- rather than virus strain difference -- may
determine the susceptibility of Turkish children to infection. - Mod.CP]
