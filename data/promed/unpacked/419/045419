Outbreak of mumps reported in central Nebraska
----------------------------------------------
The state is monitoring an outbreak of mumps in central Nebraska, where
several cases have been linked to a basketball tournament in Columbus. The
Department of Health and Human Services reported on Fri 7 May 2010 it's
been notified of 20 confirmed or probable cases of mumps. So far, 6 of
those cases have been confirmed by the state through lab testing. The
Department says 18 of the cases were traced to an alumni basketball
tournament held on 26-27 Mar 2010 at Columbus Scotus High School. One of
the cases involved an Arizona resident, and one a Colorado resident.

On Wed 5 May 2010, Iowa health officials issued a warning about a small
outbreak of mumps in the north west part of that state. Nebraska officials
say it's not yet known whether the outbreaks are related.

[Despite virtually universal MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination in the
USA outbreaks of mumps occur repeatedly wherever young adults congregate
together, in this case by reason of a basketball tournament.
