Second fox in the Williamsburg-area tests positive for rabies
-------------------------------------------------------------
A fox responsible for an attack on a cat in James City County has tested positive for the rabies virus.

According to the Hampton and Peninsula Health Districts, the fox, which is now deceased, was sighted in the area of Canvas Back Run and the Warhill Sports Complex in James County on 26 Aug 2022.

This is the area's 2nd fox to test positive for rabies in just over a week. The night of 22 Aug 2022, a wild gray fox bit 5 people, a dog and a cat in Williamsburg near Mimosa Drive, Boundary Street, Counselor's Way and Griffin Avenue. That fox also tested positive for the rabies virus. [This was reported in Rabies (37): Americas (USA) animals, human exp Archive Number: 20220903.8705380]

Health officials said Wednesday [31 Aug 2022] they will be contacting the immediate neighbors, as well as any civic or homeowner's associations near where the fox was spotted.

Rabies is a fatal, but preventable, disease carried by mammals and has been in the wild animal population on the Peninsula since the mid 1980s, according to the health districts.

Those with information about an exposure to any fox are asked to contact the health districts' Williamsburg Environmental Health Office. Exposures include a bite, scratch or contact with saliva by open wound, eyes, nose or mouth, as well as direct contact between your pet and the rabid animal. For after-hours calls, contact animal control.

Health officials remind people to follow important rabies prevention guidelines, including getting pets vaccinated, reporting all exposures to animals to your doctor and to the local health department and only enjoying wildlife from a safe distance.

5 kids bitten by fox in Lakewood, New Jersey
--------------------------------------------
A possibly rabid fox bit 5 kids in Lakewood, NJ this week and may have attacked a 6th child, according to officials and reports.

The scary string of incidents unfolded Tuesday (30 Aug 2022) at a playground in John Street Park in the central New Jersey town and in several backyards, the Ocean County Health Department said.

A 5-year-old boy on the playground was bitten around 10 a.m., 6ABC reported, citing police reports. Another child was pounced on at their home but escaped unhurt, while a different family told cops 3 kids were bitten in their yard.

Just before 7 p.m., an 8-year-old boy was also bitten on the playground, according to Patch.

At least 1 kid got rabies shots and 1 was treated at a local hospital and released [This is concerning. The child was bitten but did not receive post exposure prophylaxes? If he was treated it must have been from a wound, perhaps falling on the pavement but not necessarily bitten by the fox. This simply does not make sense. - Mod.TG]. Authorities have not released information on the injuries, and Lakewood Police did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Animal control is searching for the fox, a spokesman for the Ocean County Health Department said.

Locals are so freaked out by the kid-chomping animal attacks they're scrambling to get home before dark so they don't become fodder for the fox, one area pastor told The Post.

Two of the kids were bitten by the fox at the playground in John Street Park.

Parishioners at Greater Bethel Church of God, just around the corner from John Street Park, are nervous because the attacks took place in an area where so many families and children gather, and where the church hosts its barbecues.

"That's very alarming because you have so many children out there and that's terrible when the kids get attacked or get hurt," said Rev. John Jones. "Anything can happen."

The animal or animals may still be on the loose, said Daniel Regenye, Ocean County's public health coordinator.

At least 1 of the kids was given a rabies shot and treated at a hospital.

WPVI reported; "There is the possibility they [the fox or foxes? - Mod.TG] would still be roaming," he said.

A day earlier [29 Aug 2022], another New Jersey fox reportedly attacked 2 people and a dog at Double Trouble State Park, about 20 minutes south of the heavily Orthodox community of Lakewood. The Monday [29 Aug 2022] attack in the 8000-acre [3237 hectares] park prompted officials to shut down the green space for at least 3 days.

A dead fox was found this week in the park and later tested positive for rabies but officials don't believe it was the same animal responsible for Monday's [29 Aug 2022] attack.

Regenye said there have been 7 documented cases of rabies in animals so far this year [2022] in Ocean County: the dead fox, 3 bats, 2 cats and a raccoon. There were 17 cases for all of 2021.

[3] Florida (Miami County): bat, human exposure

Bat captured in Miami County tests positive for rabies after biting person
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials have confirmed a bat captured in Miami County tested positive for rabies after it bit a person.

Miami County Public Health says it was informed of the positive test on Wednesday [28 Sep 2022].

According to Public Health, the bat had bitten a person in the county over the previous weekend. In response to the bite, the bat was sent to the Ohio Department of Health Laboratory to be tested for rabies and a positive result was confirmed.

The person bitten began post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (rabies shots) in a timely manner, Public Health said.

Miami County last had a confirmed case of rabies in an animal in 2015, according to Public Health.

Miami County Public Health released the following tips for preventing the transmission of rabies:
*Leave all wildlife alone
*Know the risk: contact with infected bats is the leading cause of rabies deaths
*Wash animal bites or scratches immediately with soap and water
*If you are bitten, scratched or unsure, talk to a healthcare provider about whether you need post-exposure prophylaxis. Rabies in people is 100% preventable through prompt medical attention.
*Vaccinate your pets to protect them and your family.

Oklahoma: Horse contracts rabies in Cotton County
-------------------------------------------------
The Oklahoma State Veterinarian Office reports on a rabies case in a Quarter Horse in Cotton County in the southern part of the state.

The unvaccinated mare experienced signs of being uncomfortable, frequent urinations, biting at flanks, progressed to hyperexcitability, hypersalivation, and self mutilation last week.

The animal was euthanized and confirmed positive for rabies.

One additional horse with potential exposure is currently quarantined.

Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite wound from an infected animal but the virus can also enter through open wounds, cuts in the skin, abrasions, or direct contact with the mucous membranes (mouth or eyes) of infected animals.

Oklahoma veterinarians see recent rise in horses being diagnosed with rabies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's been an alarming number of Oklahoma horses diagnosed with rabies in the past month [September 2022].

Statewide, veterinarians typically only see an average of 2 or 3 cases of rabies per year.

"So far, we've had 7 cases. But 4 of them have been in the last month," State Veterinarian Rod Hall said. "This seems to be a little excessive."

Hall said the disease usually is spread by other wildlife.

"The 2 species that carry rabies in Oklahoma are skunks and bats," he said. "So, it's almost 100% of the time going to be from a skunk or a bat."

The best way to stop the spread is to vaccinate your animals, according to Hall.

"They can either get their veterinarian to do the vaccinations for them, for the animals they're around a lot," Hall said. "Or, they can purchase the vaccine and give the vaccine themselves to their livestock."

Unfortunately, horses don't survive once they get rabies [Most animals do not survive rabies. - Mod.TG].

People who think their horses have been exposed should not stick their hands in the horse's mouth. Instead, they should call a vet.

[6] Update: human pre-exposure vaccination guidelines
Date: Tue 4 Oct 2022

https://www.avma.org/news/cdc-updates-recommendation-human-rabies-vaccination


CDC updates recommendation for human rabies vaccination
-------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its recommendations for rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for humans to replace the 3-dose rabies vaccination schedule with a 2-dose vaccination schedule which will provide protection for at least 3 years.

The updated PrEP recommendations, published in the 6 May 2022 edition of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (PDF), were developed by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The group of medical and public health experts provides advice and guidance on controlling vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. civilian population.

The recommendations were last updated in 2008. The CDC noted barriers affecting adherence to the recommendations since then, according to the report, "including out-of-pocket costs of rabies biologics (3-dose PrEP vaccination series is currently estimated at ≥ USD1100), confusion about which activities fall within different risk categories, and noncompliance with recommendations for repeated titer checks."

Along with switching to the PrEP schedule of 2 doses 7 days apart, the revamped recommendations list 5 groups categorized according to their risk of rabies exposure. Risk category 1 is the highest risk and meant for people who work with live or concentrated rabies virus in laboratories. Veterinarians and veterinary technicians join animal control officers and wildlife biologists in risk category 3, defined as "people who interact with, or are at higher risk to interact, with mammals other than bats which could be rabid, for a period longer than 3 years after they receive PrEP."

Those who fall in risk category 3 and are seeking PrEP for the 1st time should receive the 2-dose series and obtain either a 1-time titer check 1 to 3 years following the 2-dose vaccination or a 1-dose booster between 3 weeks and 3 years following the 1st vaccine in the 2-dose PrEP vaccination series.

Serial titer testing every 2 years is no longer recommended, including for those who previously received a 3-dose PrEP series because recognized rabies exposures should always prompt evaluation for post-exposure prophylaxis, according to the report. The minimum acceptable laboratory value used to determine whether booster doses of rabies vaccine are needed was revised and standardized to 0.5 IU/mL, which aligns with current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The AVMA Trust offers 2 packages including a rabies benefit: the Member Basic Protection Package and Student Basic Protection Package. Both packages provide a financial reimbursement for rabies vaccination and titer testing.

"Rabies exposure does occur in veterinary practice and because of this risk, it is recommended to follow CDC guidelines and medical professional recommendations for prophylaxis and post-exposure management," said Dr. Linda Ellis, director of trust veterinarians for the AVMA Trust.

The AVMA Trust also offers the on-demand webinar "Rabies Liability: Is Your Practice Protected?" with information on ways to reduce rabies exposure and which types of coverage practices need to ensure they are protected from liability in the event of a rabies exposure.

[It seems like it is fox rabies season with 3 reports involving the fox. It is not necessarily unusual to see more animals at a particular time of year. Drought as well as other adverse weather can affect the movement of all wild animals, and bring them into closer contact with human beings and their pets.

Perhaps one of the most significant pieces here is the change in pre-exposure prophylaxis vaccination. Veterinarians, as well as other people associated with various animal industries, should be aware of this change.

Above all, we all should be on the alert for animals acting strangely. Recall rabies has a furious form and a dumb, or sedate, form. This less aggressive form can transmit the deadly rabies virus just as easily with saliva or a bite. Recall saliva in the eye or mouth or a scratch can transmit the virus.

If you have large animals, please vaccinate those horses and cattle, sheep and goats against rabies. These animals are larger and more powerful than we are and can damage the human body severely. We have posted on horses and cattle having rabies and there are horror stories most veterinarians are aware of, likely plenty on the internet. Please protect yourselves and your animals by vaccinating against the rabies virus. - Mod.TG
