------------------------------------------------------------------
_Sugarcane streak mosaic virus_ (SCSMV) is a new virus affecting sugarcane plantation in Indonesia. Since the 1st report [in Indonesia] in 2005, the virus was widely distributed across Java Island. A field survey was conducted to monitor the expansion of SCSMV distribution in sugarcane plantation and to estimate the impact of SCSMV infection on cane yields.

The survey revealed that there was widespread occurrence of SCSMV. SCSMV infection rate increased with disease incidence ranging from 0.4-87 per cent. The rapid distribution of SCSMV was due to the transmissibility of SCSMV through cane cuttings and transportation of planting materials from one area to other areas regardless [of] the health of cane cuttings. The widespread occurrence of SCSMV was also related with the dispersal of [cane] variety PS 864, which is highly susceptible to SCSMV.

Infection of SCSMV caused a significant reduction to cane yields and also affected cane growth particularly on stalk diameter and number of stalks per stool. To control and prevent further virus distribution, the use of virus-free cane cuttings and planting resistant variety is recommended. Some promising varieties such as PS 05-103, PS 06-181 and PS 04-526 could be projected to replace the susceptible varieties.

[_Sugarcane streak mosaic virus_ (SCSMV) and the closely related _Triticum mosaic virus_ are so far the only species in the newly established genus _Poacevirus_ in the family of Potyviridae. SCSMV can affect only hosts in the family Poaceae (grasses), including sugarcane, maize, and sorghum. Symptoms include chlorotic streaks on leaves leading to loss of photosynthetic ability and with it stunting of plants. Yield losses of up to 20 per cent have been reported in sugarcane, but symptom severity depends on host variety and viral strains. Some grasses can be asymptomatic hosts and serve as virus reservoirs for nearby crops.

The virus is spread easily with infected cuttings to new areas, and by mechanical means (such as harvesting knives) within a field. Potential insect vectors are suspected, but so far, none have been identified. Hot water treatment (used to eliminate some viruses and viroids from germplasm) does not appear to be effective in eliminating SCSMV from cane cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitary measures (including removal of virus reservoirs, disinfecting tools) and use of certified clean planting material. Some resistant sugarcane varieties have been identified for certain areas.

Several other potyviruses (for example, _Sugarcane mosaic virus_, _Sorghum mosaic virus_, _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_) can cause similar symptoms in sugarcane. In different regions or even different fields, mosaic disease in the crop may be caused by one or several strains of either of these viruses alone or in combination.
