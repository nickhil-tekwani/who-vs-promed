This report is in response to several recent ProMED-mail items that have
commented on meningococcal disease in New Zealand.
New Zealand is now in its sixth year of a meningococcal disease epidemic
which began in mid-1991. The background incidence of meningococcal disease
was about 50 cases a year in 1989-90 (1.5 per 100,000). Rates have increased
steadily since then with 473 cases in 1996, a rate of 14.0 per 100,000.
Disease incidence increased by a further 27% during the first 6 months of
1997. Most cases (73% in 1996) occur in the winter and spring months.
As expected, highest rates are in the young (142.0 per 100,000 in those
under one year of age, 72.9 for those 1-4 years). There are also marked
ethnic differences in incidence with Maori having rates that were 1.5 times
higher than Europeans in 1996, and Pacific Islands people having rates that
were 5.3 times higher. This disease is particularly concentrated in young
Pacific Island children (570.7 cases per 100,000 for Pacific Island children
under one year of age). The case fatality rate has been about 5.0% for a
number of years.
Serogroup B accounted for 77.6% (215/277) of isolates obtained in 1996, with
serogroup C accounting for most of the rest (18.8% or 52/277). One
serosubtype (P1.4) has become dominant among the serogroup B cases,
accounting for 87.4% (188/215) in 1996. A serogroup B vaccine which
effectively targets this antigen (P1.4) could have a major role in
controlling this epidemic.
Monthly updates on meningococcal disease incidence are published in the New
Zealand Public Health Report, which can be accessed on the New Zealand
Ministry of Health's Web site <http://www.moh.govt.nz/pubs_on.htm>
