On Tuesday afternoon [20 Jan 2009] veterinarians will verify one more
case of a monkey dead of suspected yellow fever [YF] in Sao Borja.
That was the 29th to have been found dead in the region of coverage
of the Region 10 Coordinating Health unit, based in Alegrete. The
other cases were recorded in Sao Borja, Alegrete, Itaqui, Macambara,
and Manoel Viana.

According to the regional delegate of the Coordinating unit, Saionara
Marques Almeida dos Santos, none of these counties was included in
the [YF] risk area since no [YF] cases have been confirmed [there].
When the monkeys were found, they were beyond the latest time, about
8 hours after the death, suitable for carrying out laboratory tests.

Because of the proximity to cities considered to be at risk [of YF],
Sao Borja, Macambara, and Manoel Viana are assigned priority for the
yellow fever [virus] vaccination.

[Concern about sylvan (jungle) YF virus transmission in this area of
Rio Grande do Sul continues. This suspected case is near Corrientes
Province, Argentina, where sylvan YF in monkeys has been suspected
recently (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090105.0035).
