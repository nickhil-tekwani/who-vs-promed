[In spite of the 9 Dec 2005 OIE report (posted 12 Dec) stating that
"Samples will be sent to an OIE Reference Laboratory for highly pathogenic
avian influenza to confirm the diagnosis", as of midday today they had not
arrived at Weybridge, and therefore confirmation is still awaited, though
the in-country serology is persuasive. - Mod.MHJ]

Please be informed that the VLA Weybridge UK has so far not received any
samples from Ukraine. [Though] I have been advised that they left the
Ukraine laboratory on Thursday and have been sent by courier to our
laboratory, as of 12:30 pm today no samples have been received. We are
trying to trace the whereabouts of the samples.
