Australias EPA on Undiagnosed Ovine Deaths
---------------------------------------------
About 40 sheep have died recently of an unknown cause. The Environment
Protection Authority (EPA) says it is doing all it can to identify the
cause of sheep deaths near the Holbrook rubbish dump in the New South
Wales' south-west.
The EPA's regional manager, Rob Monteith, said in addition to the
approximately 40 dead sheep, abnormalities in lambs have been detected for
2 years, on a property neighboring the tip of the dump site.
Mr. Monteith says drainage water from a nearby sawmill has been tested, but
so far they have found nothing to explain the problem.
"We've been looking at other likely sources and there may be an explanation
having nothing to do with the water flow at all," he said. "But certainly
the landfill is not managed as well as it should be and we'll make sure
it's rectified. The council has committed to do that."
