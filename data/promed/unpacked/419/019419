Public health officials estimate 2100 Utahns have been sickened with
salmonellosis from home-made 'queso fresco' since 2009.

The Salt Lake Valley Health Department has tracked down one source of
the outbreak, an unnamed man dubbed "Mr. Cheese," who was making the
product with raw milk and selling it to a Salt Lake City
restaurant/deli.

The health department has confirmed that 73 people were sickened with
the illness, which causes diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. But
they estimate that hundreds more were ill and never reported it to the
health department. They are still investigating whether there are
other sources behind the outbreak.

Officials hope the scope of the outbreak -- it affected people in Salt
Lake, Tooele, Davis, Utah, Weber, and Morgan counties -- will remind
people to be cautious when buying food. "They should not be purchasing
food products in shopping center parking lots, [from people]
distributing it out of their trunks or door to door," said Royal
DeLegge, director of environmental health at the health department.
"When you go into a retail setting, a deli or a store, you're looking
for labeling on the products."

The cheese probe took 3 years, involved a criminal investigator, and
extended to a fast-food franchise where Mr. Cheese's wife worked.

People began to get sick in 2009 with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Newport, and the health department warned people not to buy the
Mexican-style soft cheese from unapproved sources. Another 22 Newport
cases popped up in 2010. The health department couldn't find a common
cause but heard of a woman selling cheese in a parking lot. By June
2011, another 32 people were sick with the strain. They commonly
identified 4 restaurants and a market, where the local and state
health department took samples of queso fresco and samples from
preparation areas. It found a positive DNA match from the cheese in
the restaurant/deli.

A criminal investigator for the county's District Attorney's Office
put together a photo lineup for the restaurant owner, who identified
his queso fresco source and called him "Mr. Cheese." The health
department later learned the man made the cheese in his home using raw
milk. The man also is not licensed to manufacture cheese, according to
the department. Agriculture investigators are still determining where
he obtained the milk he used.

"We're looking at what, if any, violations occurred there. There is a
cottage industry law, where you are allowed to make food in your house
and sell it ... under certain conditions," said Larry Lewis, spokesman
for the Utah Department of Agriculture. It is still investigating Mr.
Cheese.

There could be other sources of the raw milk and other manufacturers
of contaminated cheese.

Raw milk apparently produces a creamier cheese and is preferred in
making queso fresco. Unpasteurized milk is allowed to be sold in Utah,
but dairies and sellers must have a permit. Health officials warn
against consuming raw milk because it can be contaminated with
bacteria that would be killed in the pasteurization process.

Mr. Cheese's wife may have contaminated her workplace with the queso
fresco. 4 customers and a food handler at 4 locations of a fast-food
chain were sickened in 2011. "There's no reason for us to believe the
franchise sold any of the cheese," DeLegge said. "There's a link we're
still trying to pursue and find out how the transmission took place."

[ProMED-mail has previously posted outbreaks of serotype Newport
associated with queso fresco -- literally, fresh cheese -- (archive
numbers 20010503.0855, 20020401.3855, and 20070324.1027) as well as
with other vehicles (archive numbers 20040920.2604 and 20061202.3409).
In 2010, ProMED also posted (archive no. 20100709.2287) an outbreak of
_S._ Newport in Utah associated with unpasteurized milk. It would be
useful to know if the genetic analysis of this outbreak strain matched
that of the cheese-associated outbreak. - Mod.LL]
