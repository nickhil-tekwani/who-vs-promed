1st report of _Plum pox virus_ in Montenegro
--------------------------------------------
In Montenegro, studies on the presence of _Plum pox virus_
(_Potyvirus_, PPV -- EPPO A2 List) were conducted in 2006, in both
extensive and intensive plum orchards (_Prunus domestica_) near
Niksic (west of the country). Mild to severe symptoms were observed
in 15 orchards, usually on a few trees only. In total, 19 samples
were collected and tested (ELISA [immunological test] and molecular
tests). Results showed the presence of PPV-D, PPV-M, and PPV-Rec.
This is the 1st published report confirming the occurrence of PPV in
Montenegro. The situation of _Plum pox virus_ in Montenegro can be
described as follows: Present, its occurrence was confirmed in 2007.
PPV-M, PPV-D, and PPV-Rec were detected.

1st finding of _Plum pox virus_ in Pakistan
-------------------------------------------
In Pakistan, several apricot trees (_Prunus armeniaca_) showing virus
symptoms were observed in a small orchard in the Baltistan District
(northern Pakistan) located at an altitude of 2400 m (7874 ft). Dried
leaf samples taken from one symptomatic tree were tested (ELISA) for
the presence of _Plum pox virus_ (_Potyvirus_, PPV -- EPPO A2 List)
and gave positive results. Molecular studies showed that 2 different
PPV isolates were present: PPV-D and PPV-Rec. Further studies are
needed to better understand the situation of PPV in Pakistan, but
this is the 1st indication that PPV occurs in this country. The
situation of _Plum pox virus_ in Pakistan can be described as
follows: Probably present, 1st detected in 2006 in one tree,
Baltistan District (north), confirmation studies are needed.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus)
causes serious losses of up to 100 percent in many stone fruit
species in the genus _Prunus_. It affects both leaves and fruits.
Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible including hops, pea,
tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants. Resistant stone fruit
cultivars are available and some strains of PPV do not infect certain
_Prunus_ species. PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species,
mechanical inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but
is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact.
The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is
still being debated. PPV is widely distributed in Europe. It is also
present in some parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas, but
absent from Australia and New Zealand. Cuttings of stone fruit trees
pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area.
Disease management includes control of the vector insects, use of
certified planting and grafting material, and use of resistant host varieties.
According to their serological and molecular properties, PPV isolates
have now been grouped into 6 types or strains: PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-EA,
PPV-C, PPV-W, and PPV-Rec (recombinant between D and M strains). M
and D are the main strains; W has been eradicated from the field but
is held in collections. (Reference: Capote N, Cambra M, Llacer G,
Petter F, Platts LG, Roy AS, Smith IM (eds) (2006): A review of _Plum
pox virus_. Bulletin OEPP/EPPO Bulletin 36(2), 201-349.)
ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is a highly specific,
sensitive diagnostic technique widely used for the identification of
plant viruses. It is usually based on antibodies to viral coat
proteins linked to markers detectable by colourimetric methods, which
allows a quantitative detection of the target.
