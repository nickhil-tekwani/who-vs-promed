With the start of the 2007 cane harvest only weeks away, it will be the 2nd
year the Queensland industry in the Bundaberg/Isis, Mackay, and Ingham
districts have to face dealing with smut infected cane.
And the "doom and gloom" prophets have been proved correct, at least in the
southern Queensland cane growing areas, where infestations of cane smut
have exploded due to 3 months of dry weather and the numbers of infected
properties have risen to 100 in the Isis and 20 in the Bundaberg area. That
prompted Isis grower Norm Anderson to comment that if growers in his area
thought their crops were free of the disease, it was only because they
hadn't yet discovered it.
Isis productivity supervisor Bruce Quinn said they were having difficulty
finding smut infected plants last December [2006], but by May [2007], there
were thousands of whips, some up to 60 cm (23.6 in) in length. As examples
of the spread, he cited a block of 1st ratoon Q205 where in September
[2006] one infected stool was found, by January [2007] there were 5, and by
April [2007], that had blown out to 422. In another block of autumn planted
Q205, 76 plants were infected last November[2006], but by April [2007],
there were 2705.
In the Mackay and Plane Creek mill areas no infestations had been found on
any properties not identified in the initial outbreak, although the number
infected blocks has risen to 15.
In the southern areas there were 3 months of dry warm conditions, ideal for
smut spread, while in the Mackay/Sarina and Herbert River districts a good
wet season with high humidity didn't provide good conditions for the spread
of the disease.
In the Herbert, 25 farms have smut on 37 blocks, with 5 already having been
ploughed out. With the crush scheduled to start on [19 Jun 2007], Herbert
River farmers will be carrying out thorough inspections of the ratooning
cane and have agreed to spray out any blocks with more than 5 per cent
infection. That way, they are hoping to minimise the production of spores
and avoid any production losses from the disease in the short term.
However, the rapid spread of smut infection in the south shows the only
long-term solution is to replant with smut resistant varieties, a process
cane growers have done twice in the past 20 years, when their most popular
varieties were decimated by disease. The 1st was Fiji disease in NCo310 in
the 1980s and the 2nd, orange rust in Q124 in 2000.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_
(previously _Ustilago scitaminea_). It is highly infectious and can be
spread by wind or carried on clothing and machinery. Symptoms are a black
whip-like structure emerging from the central core of meristematic tissues.
It contains spores covered with a thin membrane which ruptures easily to
release the spores.
The best control method is to use resistant cultivars, which are widely
available for different cane growing regions. Careful removal of infected
plants after covering the whip may help prevent secondary spread of the
disease. Smut spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris.
Thus, the disease is also managed by burning of infected fields after
harvest and the use of healthy seedcane setts from disease-free nurseries
for replanting. Soaking of setts in a solution of triadimefon fungicide or
short hot-water treatment can also control smut.
Sugarcane smut appears to be present in every sugarcane-growing country
worldwide. Australia was the last country considered to be free of this
disease until smut was found in 1998 in Western Australia (a minor cane
growing area) and in Queensland in June 2006. The locations mentioned in
the text above are located in the Queensland areas near (north to south)
Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, and Bundaberg, which include the main
Australian sugar growing regions. The movement of sugarcane and sugarcane
machinery is now restricted in Queensland by a Plant Protection Act.
Fiji disease is caused by _Fiji disease virus_ (FDV, genus _Fijivirus_,
family _Reoviridae_), which is insect-transmitted (plant hopper) causing
leaf galls and stunting. FDV affects sugarcane, millet, and maize, but
resistant varieties are available. Significant yield loss has been recorded
in Queensland in the 1970s and in cultivar NCo310 in the 1980s. Due to the
intensive management programme put in place, there have been no reports of
the disease since.
Orange rust (_Puccinia kuehnii_) has been present in Australia for over 100
years. In 1999-2000, sugarcane crops were affected by an outbreak of orange
rust severely damaging the most widely grown commercial cultivar, Q124. A
new promising cultivar of high yield and resistance to orange rust (Q205)
was developed.
