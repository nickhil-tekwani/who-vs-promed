As an early warning against dengue fever, the Department of Health (DOH)
called on the public yesterday to start taking steps to stop the mosquito
vector from transmitting the disease. [Meaning that the government wants
people to empty containers that might provide places where the _Aedes_
vector can lay its eggs. - Mod.CC]
The DOH reported 508 dengue patients treated at the state-owned San Lazaro
Hospital from Jan 1 to May 12. Majority were children 10 years and above
[shouldn't it be below? - Mod.CYC]. One fourth of the patients were Metro
Manila residents while the others came from nearby provinces - Bulacan,
Cavite and Nueva Ecija.
Fifteen people, mostly children, have already died of dengue since the
start of this year. Last year, 13 of the 595 dengue patients recorded
during the period, succumbed to the disease.
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said the number of cases this year is
expected to be lower than the figure for the same period last year.
Usually, he said, the peak of dengue outbreak is in the middle of June and
July when rains are heaviest.

[As there have already been more deaths this year than last, I do not
understand how the Secretary can expect fewer cases this year than last.
Could be there was a large number of cases last year and that the Secretary
is being optimistic. - Mod.CC]
