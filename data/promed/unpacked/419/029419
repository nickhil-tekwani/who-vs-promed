A Utah man died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after apparent
exposure to rodent droppings, health officials said Thursday [11 Sep
2008].

The last confirmed hantavirus infection in Utah occurred in 2004, the
Utah Department of Health said.

The man, a resident of Duchesne County between the ages of 19-29
years, appeared to be otherwise healthy before he became ill. He was
hospitalized on 2 Sep [2008] and died the next day.

Health officials are investigating the death but suspect the man was
exposed to a hantavirus while cleaning up rodent droppings.

Hantaviruses are shed in the urine and fecal droppings of rodents.
Humans can become infected by inhaling dust that contains dried
contaminated rodent urine or feces.

The health department said extreme care should be taken when cleaning
up rodent droppings. Clean up rodent droppings using a wet method
such as spraying disinfectant (diluted bleach) prior to cleaning,
then use a wet mop or towel moistened with disinfectant to clean, the
agency said in a release. Do not clean up rodent droppings using a
dry method, such as sweeping and vacuuming.

hantavirus infection was not specified in this report, most likely it
