A Clark County man is the first ever confirmed case of Lyme disease in
Nevada, health officials reported Monday. The middle-aged man had lived for
several months in the Lee Canyon area of Mount Charleston, Clark County
Health District epidemiologist Rose Bell said. No other details about the
person were available because of confidentiality laws, she said.
"This is the first laboratory-confirmed case," Bell said. "It's the first
I'm aware of."
The man reported his symptoms within the past month but did not have the
characteristic bull's eye rash [erythema migrans -DS, Bell said.
The man worked as a camp host in Lee Canyon this summer, Don Eastis, U.S.
Forest Service recreation officer, said.
State Health Officer Randall Todd said 27 people have reported symptoms of
Lyme disease in Nevada since 1994, but none of the cases were confirmed in
a laboratory.
"We don't see very much of it in Nevada," Todd said. In most of the cases,
exposures from a tick bite occurred out of state, he said.
One of those cases was reported in Clark County in 1997 through the Nellis
Air Force Base Hospital, Todd said. Nationwide, there were 3,446 cases
reported in 1999, most in northeastern states. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported 2,141 cases so far this year.
"When you look at a map of Lyme disease, Nevada kind of disappears," Todd said.

[Unfortunately, the report does not provide the details on the laboratory
methods used to establish the diagnosis of Lyme disease in this patient.
The laboratory diagnosis of this infection is one that is the subject of
much debate among researchers and clinicians. Clinical laboratories vary
greatly in their ability to perform serologic testing, including Western
blots, for Lyme disease and one must interpret with caution a positive
laboratory test result in an area with no known endemic disease. In a
population in which the prevalence of a given disease is low, the positive
predictive value of a test for that disease may be quite low as well since
the rate of false-positive tests does not ordinarily fall in a low
prevalence population.
ProMED-mail would be interested to hear details on how this diagnosis was
established. -Man. Ed. DS
