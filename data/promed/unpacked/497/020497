Michigan officials are investigating an egg producer in connection with a salmonellosis outbreak linked to Hollandaise sauce made with unpasteurized raw eggs and served at an unidentified restaurant.

Marquette County, MI health officials announced their investigation into the June 2017 outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis on Friday, 7 Jul 2017, but did not include any specific details.

Instead, the news release from the Marquette County Health Department reminded the public that "many foodborne illnesses increase during the warm summer months as people picnic and have outdoor family gatherings," and offered tips for avoiding food poisoning at such events.

But the outbreak, which includes 4 confirmed victims and at least 4 probable victims, is linked to food served at a restaurant, said Patrick L. Jacuzzo, Marquette County director of environmental health. Jacuzzo described the outbreak as "restaurant associated" and said the assumption as of Friday [7 Jul 2017] afternoon was that raw, unpasteurized eggs served in Hollandaise sauce with eggs Benedict were the source.

Six of the 8 victims dined at the restaurant, and 5 of them specifically recall eating the Hollandaise sauce. Three of the 4 lab-confirmed victims were among the restaurant diners. Jacuzzo said the 4 confirmed victims all had the same Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern, meaning they were infected with the same strain of _Salmonella_.

"The Michigan Department of Agriculture is investigating the egg producer and testing their eggs, but the test results aren't back yet," Jacuzzo told Food Safety News on Friday, 7 Jul 2017. Jacuzzo did not volunteer the name of the egg producer or the name of the restaurant. He said the health department did not have access to any food samples served at the restaurant during the outbreak time frame to test.

On Friday afternoon, 7 Jul 2017, officials at the state agriculture department were not immediately available for comment on the investigation.

Anyone who has eaten Hollandaise sauce at any restaurant in Marquette County, MI and developed symptoms of salmonellosis should immediately seek medical attention and tell their doctor of the possible exposure so that the proper diagnostic tests can be performed. Symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping and sometimes fever and usually develop 12 to 72 hours after infection, according to the CDC.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient if pasteurized.

Hollandaise sauce (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollandaise_sauce) is an emulsion of egg yolk, liquid butter, water and lemon juice (or a white wine or vinegar reduction), whisked together over the low heat of a double boiler. Additional salt, white pepper and/or cayenne pepper is used for seasoning. Hollandaise is one of the 5 sauces in the French haute cuisine mother sauce repertoire. These types of sauces are considered "mayonnaise sauces" as they are, like mayonnaise, based on the emulsion of an oil in egg yolk. Hollandaise sauce is well known as a key ingredient of eggs Benedict, and is often paired with vegetables such as steamed asparagus. - Mod.LL
