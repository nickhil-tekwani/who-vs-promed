[1] Philippines - vaccination program halted

The Philippines suspended its school-based dengue immunization program on [Fri 1 Dec 2017] after the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi warned that its flagship vaccine, Dengvaxia®, had been found to pose health risks in people not previously infected.

The suspension came after health experts expressed worries about Sanofi's announcement this week.

The company said further clinical studies had revealed that, in those who had previously had dengue, the vaccine could prevent repeat infection. But for those who had not had dengue, and were vaccinated and later became infected, "more cases of severe disease could occur," Sanofi said in the advisory.

With more than 740 000 elementary school students in the Philippines having already received Dengvaxia vaccinations, the government decided to halt the program for the time being.

The Philippine health secretary, Francisco Duque, said the program would be "on hold while review consultations are on the way." He added that the government would seek help from medical experts outside the Philippines, including from the World Health Organization.

Dengue is the most widespread mosquito-borne disease in the world, with nearly 400 million people infected every year. There are 4 dengue viruses, or serotypes, and most people who are infected recover and become immune to the 1st serotype they had. In some cases, a later infection with a different serotype can lead to a severe hemorrhagic fever. About 25 000 people die every year from hemorrhagic fevers arising from the disease.

What are the recommendations for dengue vaccine?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Directions for use of the Sanofi dengue vaccine was updated for the people never infected by dengue.

Last week [end of November 2017] the manufacturer of the dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, Sanofi-Aventis, reported on a complementary study comparing vaccination of people with known prior infection with dengue to people with no known prior infection with dengue. The groups were followed for 6 years after the 1st dose.

Preliminary data showed that people not infected with dengue before receiving the vaccine, may be more likely to develop more severe forms of the disease when bitten by mosquitoes infected with dengue.

The recommendation of Anvisa is: seronegative people (those who never had contact with the dengue virus) should not take the vaccine.

The updated package insert text of Dengvaxia has been filed by the company and is now available in the Electronic Bulário (http://portal.anvisa.gov.br/bulario-eletronico1).

Access the recommendations of Dengvaxia (http://www.anvisa.gov.br/datavisa/fila_bula/frmVisualizarBula.asp?pNuTransacao=24360682017&pIdAnexo=10358289).

To clarify the case, we have prepared some questions and answers on the subject.

What the recommendation of Anvisa regarding dengue vaccine?
----
The recommendation is: people who have never had contact with the [dengue] virus should not take the vaccine.

This is a precaution because the preliminary data of this additional study are not conclusive. In other words, statistically not confirmed as to whether there is an increased risk in the age range for which the vaccine is indicated (9 to 45).

For those who live in areas where dengue epidemics have never been reported, the recommendation is not to take the vaccine because the people in these areas are likely to be seronegative (never had contact with the dengue virus).

Residents of areas where there have been dengue epidemics [known dengue transmission] should evaluate, together with your doctor, the vaccine recommendation to define the risks of the disease and the potential risks and benefitsvaccination.

Why are these studies only surfacing now?
----
All new drugs (and vaccines) continue to be monitored and studied after they are officially released to the general population/market. This phase is called "post-marketing" and serves precisely to identify situations that are not originally identified during the clinical research stages pre-marketing where the number of subjects receiving the drug/vaccine are low compared to much larger numbers once a drug is released to the general market. In addition, it provides long term follow-up on the use of the drug/vaccine continuing through the initial phases of study of the drug/vaccine. In this case, the data from following 6 years of use of the vaccine were released by the manufacturer as soon as they were available.

In the case of dengue vaccine, the research phase, prior to registration, brought together about 40 000 people from different parts of the world, including Brazil. But even with this amount of people some cases appear only when the drug begins to be used by a larger group of people.

"Having had contact with the virus" is the same as having been sick?
No. Most people who have been infected by the dengue virus do not know it. That is, there are people who were infected with the virus but did not develop symptoms of the disease.

What is the risk for those who took the vaccine?
----
First, it is important to clarify: the vaccine does not cause dengue, infection with the dengue virus cases the disease and the virus is present in most of Brazil.

People vaccinated or not, by being bitten by infected mosquitoes, may or may not have symptoms of the disease.

The study found that those who took the vaccine and never had previous contact with the virus may have a 0.5% increased risk of hospitalization and 0.2% for severe dengue, compared to previously infected people vaccinated.

I took the 1st dose of the vaccine, should I take the other doses?
----
There is no data on the risk of serious illness and hospitalization according to the number of doses received.

People already vaccinated with one or two doses, should seek a health professional to assess the characteristics of the disease in the region where the patient lives, transmission intensity and age to evaluate the benefit of completion or not of the vaccination schedule.

But if I've ever had dengue why should I take the vaccine?
----
Dengue is a disease caused by 4 different serotypes, so it behaves as though there are 4 types of dengue. So even if you have had dengue in the past, you can get sick again with another strain. Furthermore, the vaccine is not 100% effective against the virus, as stated in the instructions.

I think I never had dengue, what I do?
----
If you live in areas where dengue epidemics have never been registered, the recommendation is not to take the vaccine because the people in these areas are likely to be seronegative (never had contact with the dengue virus).

If you live in areas where dengue epidemic has occurred it is important to assess, together with your doctor, the recommendation of the vaccine to discuss the risks of the disease and potential benefits and risks of vaccination.

I've already been vaccinated, now what?
----
The instructions are the same for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, that is, everyone should use preventive measures against mosquito bites [even] after vaccination and should seek medical attention if they develop signs of dengue. These signs are persistent high fever for more than 2 days, severe pain or abdominal tenderness, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, drowsiness, and hyperactivity, according to WHO guidelines, 2009.

What kind of severity are we talking about?
----
On the scale of 1 to 4 (with 4 being the highest, according to the WHO 1997 classification) used in the study, most cases were classified as 1 and 2, ie, less severe. No deaths were reported during clinical studies related to vaccination and all cases have recovered with routine treatment.

Why can people already vaccinated get dengue?
----
No vaccine provides 100% protection. In the case of the dengue vaccine, it has been shown to provide 66% protection, a reduction of 80% of hospitalizations and protection against severe forms of the disease of 93% after the 3rd dose of the vaccine.

Dengue vaccine: clarifications
---------------------------
The manufacturer of the degnue vaccine, Dengvaxia, the Sanofi-Aventis Laboratory, presented priliminary information, as yet non-conclusive, that some individuals can develop severe forms of the disease [dengue] when the vaccine is given to those who have not had prior contact with the virus [are seronegative prior to vaccination]

The possibility exists in the case of seronegative individuals (those who never came into contact with the dengue virus) are vaccinated and then are later exposed to the dengue virus, ie after the bite of an infected mosquito.

The vaccine itself does not trigger a severe disease or induce the onset of spontaneous disease. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent contact with the dengue virus after vaccination through prevention of mosquito bites.

Initially, the vaccine package insert will be updated as ANVISA evaluates the completed study data to be presented.

Should I take the vaccine or wait?
----
At this time, and until the evaluation is completed, the recommendation is that the vaccine is not be taken by seronegative individuals, ie, people who have never had contact with the dengue virus. We clarify that this risk had not been identified in studies submitted for approval of the vaccine in the population for which the vaccine was approved.

The Dengvaxia was approved in Brazil on [28 Dec 2015]. The vaccine is not offered by the National Immunization Program (NIP).

Prior to registration, the vaccine was studied in more than 40 000 people worldwide. Clinical trials followed the standards set by international guides as "Guidelines for the clinical evaluation of dengue vaccines in endemic areas" of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Currently Sanofi vaccine is the only approved in Brazil. The product is suitable for immunization against four (4) dengue virus subtypes. For people who have had dengue, the benefit of using the vaccine remains favorable.

Preliminary information about changing the vaccine safety profile were presented to Anvisa this week. The Agency has already held a meeting with Sanofi and the vaccine group of the World Health Organization to assess the case.

[Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has spread to most tropical and many subtropical areas. The disease is caused by 4 distinct but closely-related viruses, the dengue virus types 1-4. There are no specific treatments for dengue, and until the Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia® prevention was primarily limited to vector control measures. The vaccine is designed to induce an immune response against each of the 4 dengue viruses, but not to cause disease. The immune response results in antibodies capable of fighting dengue infections (https://www.asianscientist.com/2016/11/features/ng-su-peing-Dengvaxia-sanofi-pasteur-dengue-vaccine/). The Philippines and Brazil are 2 countries that have introduced public vaccination programs in specific areas or populations.

Sanofi has asked health authorities to update information provided to physicians and patients on its dengue vaccine Dengvaxia in countries where it is approved. The request is based on a new analysis of long-term clinical trial data, which found differences in vaccine performance based on prior dengue infection.

Based on up to 6 years of clinical data, the new analysis evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in people who had been infected with dengue prior to vaccination and those who had not. "The analysis confirmed that Dengvaxia provides persistent protective benefit against dengue fever in those who had prior infection. For those not previously infected by dengue virus, however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection."

"These findings highlight the complex nature of dengue infection. We are working with health authorities to ensure that prescribers, vaccinators, and patients are fully informed of the new findings, with the goal of enhancing the impact of Dengvaxia in dengue- endemic countries," said Dr Su-Peing Ng, Global Medical Head, Sanofi Pasteur (http://www.sanofipasteur.com/en/articles/Sanofi_updates_information_on_dengue_vaccine.aspx).

Based on the new analysis, Sanofi will propose that national regulatory agencies update the prescribing information, known as the label in many countries, requesting that healthcare professionals assess the likelihood of prior dengue infection in an individual before vaccinating. Vaccination should only be recommended when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks (in countries with high burden of dengue disease). For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination should not be recommended.

The Sanofi label proposal will be reviewed by national regulatory agencies in each of the countries where the vaccine is registered or under registration. Following their review, each agency might amend the company proposed label.

"Dengvaxia has been evaluated in 2 phase 3 clinical trials (CYD14 trial in 5 countries in Asia and CYD15 trial in 5 countries in Latin America). Together, these trials included over 30 000 participants aged 2 to 16 years. Vaccine efficacy against confirmed dengue pooled across both trials was 59.2 percent in the year following the primary series, and 79.1 percent against severe dengue. Efficacy varied by serotype, by age at vaccination and serostatus at baseline (that is, previous exposure to dengue prior to vaccination)."

"While efficacy was reported against hospitalized and severe dengue in years 1 and 2 post-dose 1, an excess of cases of hospitalized and severe dengue cases in those receiving Dengvaxia was seen in year 3 in some subgroups, although it is based on relatively small numbers of cases. Whether the increased risk was due to age or serostatus at baseline, which is highly correlated with age, could not be fully clarified with the available data at the time. For individuals aged 9 and above, in the 1st 25 months of the phase 3 trials, there was a reduction in severe dengue by 93 percent and a reduction in hospitalizations by 81 percent. Owing to the higher efficacy among participants vaccinated at age 9 years or older, as well as an elevated risk of hospitalized dengue in the 2-5-year age group, licensure was obtained in several countries to date for those aged 9-45 or 9-60 years living in dengue-endemic settings (http://www.who.int/immunization/QA-dengue-vaccine.pdf)

Under the school vaccination program being implemented in Philippines, a total of 491 990 9-year-old students were vaccinated in the 1st phase, under then Health Secretary Janette Garin. Out of that number, 415 681 participated in the 2nd phase (http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/30/17/doh-on-alert-as-sanofi-admits-dengue-vaccine-poses-risks). Data are still being collated to determine how many school children completed the 3rd and final round of vaccinations. None of the children included in the vaccination program were ever tested to determine if they had been previously infected with the dengue virus.

WHO's interim interpretation of data is that:
- the vaccine significantly protects against hospitalized and severe dengue in individuals seropositive for dengue at time of 1st vaccination in all age groups studied;
- the risk of hospitalized and severe dengue is significantly increased among vaccinated individuals who were seronegative for dengue at the time of 1st vaccination in all age groups studied;

WHO will conduct a full review of the data through the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and SAGE, for revised guidance of the use of Dengvaxia. Pending the full review of the data, as a precautionary and interim measure, WHO recommends that Dengvaxia be only administered to individuals that are known to have been infected with dengue prior to vaccination (http://www.who.int/immunization/QA-dengue-vaccine.pdf).

Based on these new data, a more detailed analysis of the data is required to determine what it will mean for other dengue vaccines in clinical development. The 2 candidate vaccines in phase 3 clinical development differ significantly from Dengvaxia, so that no conclusions on the safety and efficacy profile of these candidates should yet be drawn. However, it will be necessary to carefully monitor vaccine performance over time in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. - Mod.UBA

The concern about more severe dengue infections in vaccinated children who experience their first natural infection is due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of that infection. ADE can occur in individuals who have antibodies that are not neutralizing but are able to attach to the virus and bind them to cells that are susceptible to infection, enhancing that infection. Since Dengvaxia vaccinations are not 100 percent effective in preventing dengue virus infection in nature and yet induce antibodies to dengue virus, there may be a small proportion of vaccinated children in whom ADE and more severe natural infections may occur.

The practical challenge in restricting vaccination to children who have already had one or more dengue virus infections is determining who has had those previous infections and who has not. There is no quick, cheap and reliable test available that can be administered in vaccination clinics filled with children awaiting their shots. - Mod.TY]
