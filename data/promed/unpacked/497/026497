A massive effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to fast-track the development of COVID-19 vaccine, treatments, and diagnostics -- and make them available to countries that need them most -- released its production targets today [Fri 26 Jun 2020] and the price tag needed to produce and deliver the items, which totals USD 31.3 billion.

The pandemic total rose to 9 682 414 cases, and 491 113 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard.

The WHO, backed by several world leaders and global health groups, first launched the COVID-19 countermeasure scale-up effort on 24 Apr [2020] in response to a call from G20 leaders in March [2020]. Known as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, the effort was backed by several countries and regional organizations, as well as groups including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. However, several big countries did not participate, including the United States, China, India, and Russia.

An early pledging event hosted by the European Commission in early May [2020] netted nearly USD 8 million, almost reaching its initial target.

At a technical meeting today [Fri 26 Jun 2020], the ACT-Accelerator published its investment case, which is to speed development, equitable allocation, and scaled-up delivery to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of 500 million diagnostic tests by the middle of 2021, 245 million treatment courses by the middle of 2021, and 2 billion vaccine doses -- half to LMICs -- by the end of 2021.

In a statement today [Fri 26 Jun 2020], the WHO said the plans call for USD 31.3 billion in funding, of which USD 3.4 billion has already been pledged. It said USD 27.9 billion is needed, including USD 13.7 billion to cover immediate needs.

"The investment required is significant, but it pales in significance when compared to the cost of COVID-19: the total cost of the ACT-Accelerator's work is less than 1/10 of what the IMF [International Monetary Fund] estimates the global economy is losing every month due to the pandemic," the WHO said, adding that 468 000 people have already died from COVID-19.

ACT-Accelerator activities are led by partner organizations and are grouped under 4 pillars. For example, the diagnostics pillar is led by the Foundation for Innovative and New Diagnostics (FIND) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; the therapy one is led by Unitaid and Wellcome Trust; and the vaccine one by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.

A major pledging event tomorrow [Sat 27 Jun 2020] led by the European Commission and Global Citizen will feature a campaign, concert, and summit at which world leaders, corporations, and philanthropists are expected to announce new pledges.

Ahead of the event, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a statement today [Fri 26 Jun 2020] that it's clear that to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control, the world needs effective diagnostics and drugs in unprecedented quantities and at unprecedented speed. And it's also clear that because all people are at risk, the tools to battle COVID-19 shouldn't be limited to just those who can afford to pay for them.

"The principle of equitable access is a simple thing to say, but a complicated thing to implement; it requires active collaboration between governments, industry, health organizations, civil society organizations, and communities," he said. "Vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics are vital tools, but to be truly effective, they must be administered with another essential ingredient, which is solidarity."

[2] Impact of COVID-19 on multiple organs
Date: Sat 27 Jun 2020

Scientists are only starting to grasp the vast array of health problems caused by the novel coronavirus, some of which may have lingering effects on patients and health systems for years to come, according to doctors and infectious disease experts. Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath, the virus that causes COVID-19 attacks many organ systems, in some cases causing catastrophic damage.

"We thought this was only a respiratory virus. Turns out, it goes after the pancreas. It goes after the heart. It goes after the liver, the brain, the kidney, and other organs. We didn't appreciate that in the beginning," said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.

In addition to respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 can experience blood-clotting disorders that can lead to strokes, and extreme inflammation that attacks multiple organ systems. The virus can also cause neurological complications that range from headache, dizziness, and loss of taste or smell to seizures and confusion. And recovery can be slow, incomplete, and costly, with a huge impact on quality of life.

The broad and diverse manifestations of COVID-19 are somewhat unique, said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. With influenza, people with underlying heart conditions are also at higher risk of complications, Khan said. What is surprising about this virus is the extent of the complications occurring outside the lungs. Khan believes there will be a huge healthcare expenditure and burden for individuals who have survived COVID-19. Patients who were in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks will need to spend extensive time in rehab to regain mobility and strength.

"It can take up to 7 days for every one day that you're hospitalized to recover that type of strength," Khan said. "It's harder the older you are, and you may never get back to the same level of function."

While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization but are still suffering months after first becoming infected.

Studies are just getting underway to understand the long-term effects of infection, Jay Butler, deputy director of infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a telephone briefing on Thursday [25 Jun 2020].

"We hear anecdotal reports of people who have persistent fatigue, shortness of breath," Butler said. "How long that will last is hard to say."

While coronavirus symptoms typically resolve in 2-3 weeks, an estimated 1 in 10 experience prolonged symptoms, Dr. Helen Salisbury of the University of Oxford wrote in the British Medical Journal on Tuesday [23 Jun 2020]. Salisbury said many of her patients have normal chest X-rays and no sign of inflammation, but they are still not back to normal.

"If you previously ran 5 km [3.1 mi] 3 times a week and now feel breathless after a single flight of stairs, or if you cough incessantly and are too exhausted to return to work, then the fear that you may never regain your previous health is very real," she wrote.

Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine, reviewed current scientific literature and found about half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had neurological complications, such as dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness, and muscle pain. Koralnik, whose findings were published in the Annals of Neurology, has started an outpatient clinic for COVID-19 patients to study whether these neurological problems are temporary or permanent.

Khan sees parallels with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Much of the early focus was on deaths. "In recent years, we've been very focused on the cardiovascular complications of HIV survivorship," Khan said.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 27 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is a global initiative between multiple partners to ensure equitable access to life-saving tools for COVID-19. WHO has published the ACT-Accelerator Investment Case, which provides an overview of the ACT-Accelerator, its goals, and the investments that are required to carry out its mission.
- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros emphasized that "vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics are vital tools, but to be truly effective they must be administered with another essential ingredient, which is solidarity."
- WHO has published interim guidance on rapid hospital readiness and an accompanying checklist tool, which can be used to monitor the development of operational-readiness capacity in hospitals and identify gaps that require investment and action. The checklist covers hospital governance, structures, plans, and protocols to rapidly determine the current capacities of hospitals to respond to COVID-19.
- WHO has published interim guidance on biomedical equipment for COVID-19 case management and an accompanying inventory tool, which countries can use to collect in-depth facility inventories of biomedical equipment re-allocation, procurement, and planning for COVID-19 case management. The tool is intended for use from the early stages of an emergency to early recovery.
- In Nigeria, more than 12 000 doctors, pharmacists, medical students and other health workers are offering their expertise and time to curb the spread of COVID-19. A nurse volunteering at a hospital in Abuja has forgone time with family so as not to put her family at risk. She says few are willing to be in the frontlines of the pandemic response, but "if someone must be there, then I should be."

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 59.6% of the global newly reported cases and 74.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. USA reported 37.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 36.9%, Mexico 5.7%, Chile 4.0%, Peru 3.7%, Colombia 3.3%, and Argentina 2.4%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2, although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but Columbia and Argentina are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region.

The European region reported 10.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.0% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 36.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 7.5%, the UK 7.4 %, Sweden 6.7%, France 5.7% , Germany 3.7%, Armenia 3.6%, Kazakhstan 3.0%, Azerbaijan 2.8%, and Portugal 2.4%. Again, the same countries as yesterday (26 Jun 2020), with a minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day, although the proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen. Note the appearance of Armenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Portugal joining Sweden, Ukraine, and Belarus as 7 of the 11 countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.4% of the global newly reported cases and 7.3% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 21.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 16.7%, Iran 14.0%, Iraq 11.0%, Egypt 8.7%, Oman 6.0%, Qatar 5.0%, and Kuwait 4.9%. Multiple countries are very active in the region.

The African region reported 5.2% of the global newly reported cases and 1.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 66.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 7.3%, Cote d'Ivoire 4.3%, Ghana 3.9%, Ethiopia 2.7% Algeria 2.6% and Mauritania 2.3%. Other countries of prior prominence are less than 2%. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.81% of the global newly reported cases and 0.20% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 68.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 15.0%, Japan 6.8 %, South Korea 3.5%, Australia 2.5%, and China 1.6%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South-East Asia region reported 13.5% of the global newly reported cases and 7.1% of global deaths. India reported 76.5% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 15.9%, Indonesia 5.1%, and Nepal 2.4%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South-East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, but basically on parity, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 27 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above test. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 10 011 863, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. As predicted in yesterday's [Fri 26 Jun 2020] post, the global tally crossed the 10 million-case mark. The global case count rose by 1.2% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.58 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.8% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.28 million cases), represents 12.8% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and the UK), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.2%). A global total of 499 173 deaths have been reported, an increase of 2307 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is now number 22, as Colombia surpassed China in the past 24 hours. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Russia, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, a decrease of 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region and an increase of 1 from the South-East Asia region. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.UBA
