Rotavirus outbreak in Chiapas: alert
---------------------------------------------
According to state authorities, the Secretariat of Health in Chiapas
has declared an alert as a result of an outbreak of rotavirus
infection and deployed multidisciplinary teams to the communities
where cases have been confirmed.

The head of Sanitary Jurisdiction VII, Andres Gerardo Espinosa, said
in an interview that the number of cases of acute diarrheal disease
in 2010 had increased by 30 percent compared with the corresponding
period last year [2009]. Cases have been reported in 16
municipalities in the regions of Costa, Sierra, and Frontera Sur,
which comprise that jurisdiction.

"We are facing a rather severe outbreak of acute diarrheal disease
that we believe is the result of a rotavirus infection for which
unfortunately there is no specific treatment," he said and added that
so far the [samples] sent to the laboratories of the National
Institute of Public Health have confirmed 15 cases of rotavirus
infection in the jurisdiction, most of them from the municipalities
of Tapachula and Huixtla, with no deaths reported. "Rotavirus
infection causes severe diarrhea that may lead to dehydration and
even death," Espinosa said.

He reported that the state health sector is were working to implement
a series of strategies to combat the disease. Starting on Mon 8 Feb
2010, sampling of food and water including sewage, drinking, bottled,
and river waters has been initiated to detect rotavirus and bacteria
that may be affecting the inhabitants of the region.

Espinosa explained that currently there is a rotavirus vaccine that
is only administered to children under one year old, but that "the
disease affects the entire population." For this reason he called on
parents to have their newborns vaccinated and urged the rest of the
population to take extreme precautions.

[Rotaviruses are 70 nm icosahedral, non-enveloped, double-stranded
RNA viruses that belong to the family _Reoviridae_. The virus is
characterized by its 3-layer capsid, an outer and an inner capsid and
an internal shell that surrounds the 11-segment double-stranded RNA genome.

Rotavirus is currently by far the most common cause of severe
diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide and of diarrhoeal
deaths in developing countries with a distinct winter seasonality in
temperate climates and year-round exposure in tropical countries.
Virtually all children are infected by the time they reach 2 to 3
years of age. Most symptomatic episodes occur between 3 months and 2
years of age with a peak incidence between 7 and 15 months. Symptoms
include watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and
dehydration. Outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis in day-care
centers and hospitals can spread rapidly among non-immune children,
presumably through person-to-person contact, airborne droplets, or
contact with contaminated toys. Children from low socioeconomic
background and low birth weight infants have an increased risk for
hospitalization.

Rotavirus infection can also occur in adults, especially in
institutionalized or hospitalized elderly patients. Both symptomatic
and asymptomatic patients shed rotavirus in their stools for 7-10
days, but shedding can last for several weeks. The virus is highly
resistant in the environment and can survive for months in stools at
room temperature.

Three oral RV vaccines are currently licensed, a human monovalent
live attenuated rotavirus strain, RotarixTM, a pentavalent live
bovine-human reassortant vaccine, RotaTeqTM, and a lamb-derived
monovalent live attenuated strain, LLR, which is only being used in China.

Concerns remain regarding the potential effectiveness of any oral
live vaccine in view of prevalence of competing intestinal flora in
children, occurrence of mixed infections, high levels of maternally
transmitted antibodies and micronutrient malnutrition. More detailed
information on rotavirus disease and rotavirus vaccines can be found
at the WHO Diarrhea Disease website
(<http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index5.html>).
