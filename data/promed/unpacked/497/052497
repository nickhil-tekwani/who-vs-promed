It is a shame that we are even discussing this theme. But it is good to see
people from both sides of the fence expressing their opinions.
Many times we read articles about the right way to treat a disease in the
developed world, with means we do not have, and the disease is coming from
our coutries to theirs. We have been treating it with our nails and saving
some, and seeing others die for lack of cashflow.
One of the consequences of privatization of everything that makes money in
our world is that there is little interest in producing cheap medication,
like the ones we would be using to avoid our "diseases" spreading to "their
world".
Wake up! It is the same world, and we are the same human beings. Poor
people did not chose to be poor. You people did not choose to live in
England or Finland. The people that live in the "misery belts" around big
cities in the developed world did not chose to live there.
I hope this kind of discussion goes around in many places at a time, and
some kind of pressure develops around good medicine being tied to a lot of
money. We doctors are currently working more for companies that make health
"stuff" than for our patients, like it or not.

It is frightening that terms like 'survival of the fittest' and 'population
control' are being introduced into this topic.
Incidentally, the 6 billionth person was officially 'born' today (12 Oct
1999), according to the United Nations.

It's a little discouraging that most of the respondents missed the point --
and the irony -- of the initial communication.
The author is proposing a thought experiment, not an act of bioterrorism --
and is jogging us all to think globally, or at least a little "outside the
box".
