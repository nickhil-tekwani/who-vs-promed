More than 30 000 cattle have been vaccinated against anthrax in Bikita and Gutu districts in Masvingo Province following the outbreak of the disease recently, an official has said. This comes in the wake of reports that more people continued to be diagnosed with anthrax as the districts have recorded more than 70 patients while 50 cattle have also died as of [Fri 24 Jan 2020].

In an interview, the Department of Veterinary Services provincial officer, Dr. Ernest Dzimwasha, said his office had managed to attend to 2 dip tanks in Bikita and Gutu where officials vaccinated a considerable number of animals. "Following the outbreak of anthrax last week, we launched a massive vaccination exercise. We managed to vaccinate 14 832 cattle in Bikita and another 18 335 in Gutu from 2 dip tanks, as of last [Fri 24 Jan 2020]," he said. He added that the anthrax situation was expected to normalise after the vaccination but indicated that the department always carried routine vaccination programmes. "We hope our vaccination exercise will put a stop to cattle deaths. The department is also carrying out routine vaccination exercises regardless of whether there is an outbreak or not," he said.

However, Bikita District Development Coordinator Mr. Bernard Hadzirambwi said the district was still recording cattle deaths despite the ongoing vaccination exercise. He appealed for more vaccines which would cover more cattle. "As of [Mon 20 Jan 2020], the number of people treated of human anthrax had risen to 72 from 34 last week while cattle deaths increased to 50 from 33 cases. While the vaccination exercise is ongoing in Bikita East, the vaccines are not adequate. We, therefore, appeal to the Government to avail more vaccines that can cover the whole district. We expect at least 14 000 more vaccines, to carter for the remaining areas," he said.

[Dr. Ernest Dzimwasha, provincial officer Department of Veterinary Services, and his people are to be congratulated on their extensive hard working efforts to limit this outbreak in Masvingo. This should limit the impact of any wandering female tabanid flies with contaminated mouthparts looking for another blood meal. Experience is that they can wander some 5 to 15 km (approx. 3 to 9 mi) from the main activity, sometimes even further. This does not happen every day, but it can cause problems when distant animals die; though usually in such circumstances it is just a single cow, which makes sense when you think about probabilities.
