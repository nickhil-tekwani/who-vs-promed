HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME - CANADA: BACKGROUND (02)
*******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Correction: Only 2 Species of Hantavirus Have Been Identified in Canada
---------------------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail post entitled "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome -
Canada: background 20030415.0919" erroneously states that 7 different
hantaviruses have been identified in Canada. Below is part of a
response I sent out in December 2002 [see: Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome - Canada (Alberta) 20030103.0011] to correct some errors in
a previous ProMED-mail post that similarly incorrectly stated that 7
different hantaviruses had been identified in Canada.
"Although it is possible that several species/genotypes of
hantaviruses are present in Canada, only Sin Nombre virus and
Prospect Hill virus have actually been documented by serological and
phylogenetic characterization (Drebot et al., 2000, Can Commun Dis
Rep 26-08, 65-69; Drebot et al., 2001, Virus Research 75:75-86) to be
associated with rodents in this country."
Also the number of cases in Canada is now 45, not 32, as noted in S.
Berger's letter.

[Dr Steven Berger's reasonable response is that GIDEON, like
ProMED-mail, is a mirror site which, among other functions, collects
data from National Health Ministries and peer-review publications.
It is not intended to correct the taxonomic terminology used by these
sources, nor can it predict how many cases of a given disease will
have been reported after a given year. As the note points out, 32
cases had been reported by December 1999, not 45 as noted in Dr.
Drebot's letter. Like ProMED-mail, the GIDEON database is constantly
evolving as new material is published, and these points regarding
viral names will appear in the next addition.
As Moderator I have to apologise for compounding the error. My
comment, appended to Steven Berger's post, was intended merely to
point out that only 5 of the 7 species listed are recognized
currently as discrete species by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses. I failed to recollect that Dr. Drebot had
previously advised ProMED-mail readers that only 2 hantavirus species
have been unequivocally identified in Canada. The figure of 7
hantavirus species in Canada appears to have originated from some
documents and drafts that have not been published (see, e.g., List of
recognized hantaviruses (03) 19961214.2072). ProMED-mail and Gideon
are indebted to Dr. Drebot for pointing out the error. - Mod.CP]
