Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has been diagnosed in four cases of which
two died in a village in the Kohlu area of Baluchistan Province of Pakistan
in February. The four cases belonged to the same family of herders living
in close contact with their sheep. Specimens were collected from the two
surviving patients, from other members of the family who developed fever
without haemorrhagic symptoms and from many of the contacts. Blood
specimens from cases and contacts were shipped to the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Reference and Research on Special Pathogens at the Centre for
Applied Medical Research, Public Health Laboratory Service, Porton Down,
United Kingdom for testing. All had IgG and IgM antibody to Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus indicating recent infection. Other virologic
testing is in progress at Porton Down.
