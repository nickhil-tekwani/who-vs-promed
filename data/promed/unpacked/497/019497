ref: Hodcroft EB, Zuber M, Nadeau S et al. Emergence and spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant through Europe in the summer of 2020. medRxiv 2020.10.25.20219063
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
A variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in early summer 2020, presumably in Spain, and has since spread to multiple European countries. The variant was first observed in Spain in June [2020] and has been at frequencies above 40% since July [2020]. Outside of Spain, the frequency of this variant has increased from very low values prior to [15 Jul 2020] to 40-70% in Switzerland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom in September [2020]. It is also prevalent in Norway, Latvia, the Netherlands, and France. Little can be said about other European countries because few recent sequences are available. Sequences in this cluster (20A.EU1) differ from ancestral sequences at 6 or more positions, including the mutation A222V in the spike protein and A220V in the nucleoprotein. We show that this variant was exported from Spain to other European countries multiple times and that much of the diversity of this cluster in Spain is observed across Europe. It is currently unclear whether this variant is spreading because of a transmission advantage of the virus or whether high incidence in Spain followed by dissemination through tourists is sufficient to explain the rapid rise in multiple countries.

Caveats
-------
- This variant rose in frequency in multiple countries, but we have no direct evidence that it spreads faster. The rise in frequency could also be due to epidemiological factors.
- There are currently no data to evaluate whether this variant affects the severity of the disease.
- While dominant in some countries, 20A.EU1 has not taken over everywhere and diverse variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to circulate across Europe.

Introduction
------------
Following its emergence in Wuhan in late 2019 (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020; Zhu et al, 2020), SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic resulting in unprecedented efforts to reduce transmission and develop therapies and vaccines. The spread of the virus across the world has been tracked with phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences (Worobey et al, 2020; Hadfield et al, 2018; Pybus et al, 2020) which were and still are generated at a rate far greater than for any other pathogen. More than 157 000 full genomes are available in GISAID as of October 2020 (Shu and McCauley, 2017). In addition to tracking the viral spread, these genome sequences have been used to monitor mutations which might change the transmission, pathogenesis, or antigenic properties of the virus. One mutation, in particular, D614G in the spike protein, has received much attention. This variant (Nextstrain clade 20A) seeded large outbreaks in Europe in early 2020 and subsequently dominated the outbreaks in the Americas, thereby largely replacing previously circulating lineages. This rapid rise has led to the suggestion that this variant is more transmissible (Korber et al, 2020; Volz et al, 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders were closed and viral variants circulating were distributed across the world, intercontinental travel remained suppressed through the summer of 2020. The paucity of intercontinental travel allowed continent-specific variants to emerge. Within Europe, however, travel resumed in the summer of 2020. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant 20A.EU1 (S:A222V) that emerged in early summer 2020, presumably in Spain, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe. Over the summer, it rose in frequency in parallel in multiple countries. As we report here, this variant, 20A.EU1, and a 2nd variant 20A.EU2 with mutation S:S477N in the spike protein account for the majority of recent sequences in Europe. It is unclear at present whether the rapid spread of either variant is due to association with particular demographics, properties of the virus, or chance but the dynamics of both should be carefully monitored.

Discussion
----------
In addition to the 20A.EU1 cluster we describe here, an additional variant (20A.EU2) with several amino acid substitutions, including S:S477N and mutations in the nucleocapsid protein, has become common in some European countries (see Fig. 1 and Fig. S3 [at the source URL above]). The S:S477N substitution has arisen multiple times independently, for example in a variant in clade 20B that has dominated the recent outbreak in Oceania. The position 477 is close to the receptor binding site, and deep mutational scanning studies indicate that S:S477N slightly increases the receptor binding domain's affinity for ACE2 (Starr et al, 2020). Thus, the spread of this variant should also be closely monitored. The rapid rise of these variants in Europe highlights the importance of genomic surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. If 20A.EU1 and/or the 20A.EU2 variant do increase the transmissibility of the virus, previously effective infection control measures might no longer be sufficient.

Along similar lines, it is imperative to understand whether novel variants impact the severity of the disease. So far, we have no evidence for any such effect: The low mortality over the summer in Europe was predominantly explained by a marked shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases and this variant was not yet prevalent enough in July and August to have had a big effect. As sequences and clinical outcomes for patients infected with this variant become available, it will be possible to better infer whether this lineage has any impact on disease prognosis.

It is only through multi-country genomic surveillance that it has been possible to detect and track this cluster. However, the absence of consistent and uniform sequencing across Europe has still limited our efforts: we do not know the role this cluster may be playing in many countries' outbreaks because no or very few sequences have been shared. This work underscores the importance of a coordinated and regular sequencing effort, particularly in closely-associated communities like Europe, in order to detect, track, and analyze emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Finally, our analysis highlights that countries should carefully consider their approach to travellers from areas with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence when travel resumes across Europe. Whether the 20A.EU1 cluster identified here has rapidly spread due to a transmission advantage or due to epidemiological factors alone, its observed introduction and rise in prevalence in multiple countries implies that the summer travel guidelines and restrictions were generally not sufficient to prevent onward transmission of introductions. While long-term travel restrictions and border closures are not tenable or desirable, identifying better ways to reduce the risk of introducing variants, and ensuring that those which are introduced do not go on to spread widely, will help countries maintain often hard-won low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

[This paper is recommended reading to see the full text as well as the many informative figures and references. Real-time sequencing has become an invaluable epidemiolocal tool to follow the spread of a pathogen through the mutations that accumulate in the genome. Because RNA viruses mutate readily due to their error-prone polymerase, many mutations are lethal or of little significance, while others are able to increase fitness of the pathogen, giving it a competitive edge, possibly allowing more efficient transmission, or enhanced speed of replication increasing severity of infection, or they facilitate adaptation to a new host or environment. But it is difficult in the expansion stage of an outbreak to distinguish which features are contributing most to the spread of the pathogen, in this case the virus. The authors observed a "consistent and rapid growth of this variant (20A.EU1) in multiple countries and its frequency is above 50% in some localities. In countries where more than one introduction has occurred, it appears that multiple introductions have expanded. Notably, case numbers across Europe started to rise rapidly around the same time the 20A.EU1 variant started to dominate in Spain, Switzerland, and the UK (limited sequence data are available for other countries and we cannot draw clear conclusions), see Fig. S2. However, this acceleration of transmission also coincided with the arrival of fall and seasonal factors are an alternative or compounding explanation." More sequences are needed, especially from the countries where data are limited. But this study demonstrates how informative it is to analyze the molecular epidemiology of an emerging virus. It would be good to conduct studies to evaluate the biological significance of the mutations observed. -Mod.LK]

The Department of Disease Control has begun urgently investigating whether a French woman patient who tested positive for COVID-19 was allowed to pass on the infection to 2 others staying in the same quarantine facility as her. The department on Tuesday [27 Oct 2020] revealed it is testing to see if there is a match between the strains contracted by the 57-year-old French native and those found in an Asian and a European male shortly afterward at the alternative state quarantine facility (ASQ) at Siam Mandarina Hotel in Samut Prakan province.

The French national left the ASQ facility at the [hotel] on [15 Oct 2020] and returned to her home on Koh Samui [island], where she developed a fever on [17 Oct 2020]. Laboratory tests confirmed her infection 3 days later. The 2 infected male patients tested positive on [15 and 19 Oct 2020] respectively. One of them had stayed in the next room to hers.

"Fortunately, all of them are now in the hospital at the same time and that can help us examine the virus genetics. The results will help us come closer to answering how the French lady became infected with the disease. We need a few days to carry out the genetic testing," Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, acting chief of the Department of Disease Control (DDC) told media on Tuesday [27 Oct 2020]. Dr Opas said the fitness room where the strain of novel coronavirus had been detected was not the place of transmission as the French patient had not used it during her stay.

The department announced on Tuesday [27 Oct 2020] that Siam Mandarina Hotel would no longer be used to house returnees, although those currently in quarantine there would complete their 14-day term and then be asked to self-isolate at home for a further 7 days. Dr Tanarak Plipat, the department's deputy chief, said that the case has shown that the hotel could not follow the department's guidelines. "Arrivals from high-risk countries must stay in their room only. They should not have been allowed for outside activity," he said.

[The hotel] has served as a government ASQ since June [2020] with 8 people, including the 2 recent male cases, having tested positive for COVID-19 during the period. Dr Tanarak said all 67 staff at the hotel had tested negative following the case of the French woman.

There have also already been 126 tests carried out on others who may have come into contact with her after her release, and all of those tests had come back negative too, he added.

Two foreigners, in quarantine at a hotel in Samut Prakan province where a 57-year French woman was found to be infected with COVID-19, developed symptoms and tested positive for the disease on [15 Oct 2020], according to Dr Sophon Iamsirithavorn, Director of the General Communicable Diseases Division today [27 Oct 2020]. He admitted, however, that health investigators are still unable to determine whether the 3 cases are linked or how and where they became infected, adding that the hotel, which is used as an alternative state quarantine facility, may not be up to the required standard.

The French woman developed coronavirus-related symptoms when she arrived on Samui Island with her husband and son, after she had completed her quarantine at a hotel in Samut Prakan. The 3 patients have now been admitted to hospitals.

Health officials have disinfected areas at the hotel, including a gym where the COVID-19 virus was found on some of the equipment, while results of DNA tests on the 3 infected patients are still pending. Meanwhile, Dr Opas Karnkavinpong, Director-General of the Disease Control Department, said that he has discussed, with health officials in Samut Prakan province, about suspending the use of the hotel in question as a quarantine facility and the possibility of keeping other people in the same facility from leaving after completion of their 14 days of isolation or requiring them to install a tracing app on their smart phone.

[3] Yemen: excess mortality
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020
Source: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [edited]
https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/satellite-images-suggest-deaths-more-doubled-aden-yemen-during-intense-covid


The true death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Yemen remains unknown but according to new research highlighted in a pre-print study [see reference below], there is a consensus that the pandemic has had a considerable impact on the health system.

The research, which is not yet peer-reviewed, was led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine [LSHTM] in partnership with the technology and innovation company the Satellite Applications Catapult, which has expertise in geospatial analysis. Using very high-resolution satellite imagery the team quantified burial activity across all identifiable cemeteries within Aden governorate, Yemen, to generate estimates on excess deaths in the region.

Between April and September [2020], a period temporally coinciding with COVID-19 transmission in Aden governorate, they estimated about 2100 excess deaths, against an expected baseline of about 1300 deaths. This total is best interpreted as the net sum of deaths due to COVID-19 infection and deaths indirectly attributable to the pandemic (for example because of disruptions to health services) or control measures (for example problems accessing food).

To the researchers' knowledge, this is the 1st instance of satellite imagery being used for population mortality estimation.

Professor Francesco Checchi, principal investigator of the study from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: "Having an accurate picture of the impact of COVID-19 is vital for effective government and humanitarian responses. Unfortunately, in low-income and crisis settings, this can be very challenging as it is often difficult to access ground locations. By estimating excess mortality, we aimed to develop a more accurate estimate of the toll of COVID-19 in Yemen."

The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Yemen was expected to be severe, despite its comparatively young population. The country's 5-year protracted crisis has resulted in disrupted health services, overcrowding due to internal displacement, food insecurity, and shrinking humanitarian aid.

Yemen recorded its 1st laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease on [10 Apr 2020]. The epidemic was expected to peak earliest and more dramatically in Aden governorate due to overcrowding and limited mitigation measures.

In May 2020, videos posted on social media and information from key informants reported high numbers of fresh graves, suggesting a spike in burial activity. The use of mechanical excavators in place of human gravediggers suggested that demand exceeded routine capacity, while, during the same period, Médecins sans Frontières reported a peak in hospital admissions, with a very high case-fatality ratio. Media also reported that a shortage of personal protective equipment forced several hospitals to close or reject patients exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms.

However, as of [25 Oct 2020], Yemen had reported 2064 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections with 600 deaths, but the reliability of these official numbers is undermined by low testing capability.

Emilie Koum Besson, lead author from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: "Given limited testing capacity and locally different approaches to defining and recording direct COVID-19 deaths, excess mortality may be the only measure that allows to draw comparison across different geographical settings. Though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths, estimating excess mortality attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in humanitarian setting captures the whole system impact of the pandemic. It can inform our understanding of how different factors, national strategies, and policies have affected the spread and severity of the pandemic."

For example, study findings indicate that the peak death rate in Aden (about 650% according to Civil Registry data, or about 250% based on satellite imagery compared to baseline) was similar to those recorded in London and New York (respectively 200% and 600% the baseline) despite significantly different containment measures.

Professor Checchi said: "We believe this is the 1st-time satellite imaging has been used to help model the impact of infectious disease outbreaks. This new technique is very exciting for global health. Remote analysis could pave the way for the development of accurate health data in areas where this is currently not possible, providing organisations and policymakers with new evidence to make potentially life-saving decisions."

Andy Norris, co-author from the Satellite Applications Catapult, said: "'The applications of satellite data to provide information on humanitarian crises are vast. Together with LSHTM, for the 1st time, we have combined satellite imagery with cutting-edge modelling techniques to provide information that was simply not otherwise available, and which can inform the response from the international community. It is a piece of transformational work for the satellite industry and the people of Yemen."

The authors acknowledge limitations of their work, including that the temporal association of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and excess mortality is not conclusive evidence that the pandemic caused the observed increase in burials. The analysis would not have been able to capture a family's preference to bury their members in their origin locality (villages) in other governorates and difference in local burial practices such as cremation.

The team are now replicating the study in Mogadishu, Somalia. Both studies are funded by UK aid from the UK Government, however, the findings and views expressed on them, do not necessarily reflect that of official UK Government policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Background
"The burden of COVID-19 in low-income and conflict-affected countries is still unclear, largely reflecting low testing rates. In parts of Yemen, reports indicated a peak in hospital admissions and burials during May-June 2020. To estimate excess mortality during the epidemic period, we quantified activity across all identifiable cemeteries within Aden governorate in Yemen (population approximately one million) by analysing very high-resolution satellite imagery, and compared estimates to Civil Registry office records from the city.

"Methods
"After identifying active cemeteries through remote and ground information, we applied geospatial analysis techniques to manually identify new grave plots and measure changes in burial surface area over a period from July 2016 to September 2020. After imputing missing grave counts using surface area data, we used alternative approaches, including simple interpolation and a generalised additive mixed growth model, to predict both actual and counterfactual (no epidemic) burial rates by cemetery and across the governorate during the most likely period of COVID-19 excess mortality (from 1 Apr 2020), and thereby compute excess burials. We also analysed death notifications to the Civil Registry office during April-July 2020 and in previous years.

"Results
"We collected 78 observations from 11 cemeteries, of which 10 required imputation from burial surface area. Cemeteries ranged in starting size from 0 to 6866 graves. In all but one, a peak in daily burial rates was evident from April to July 2020. Interpolation and mixed model methods estimated approximately 1500 excess burials up to [6 Jul 2020], and 2120 up to [19 Sep 2020], corresponding to a peak weekly increase of 230% from the counterfactual. Satellite imagery estimates were generally lower than Civil Registry data, which indicated a peak of 1823 deaths in May alone. However, both sources suggested the epidemic had waned by September 2020.

"Discussion
"To our knowledge, this is the 1st instance of satellite imagery being used for population mortality estimation. Findings suggest a substantial, under-ascertained impact of COVID-19 in this urban Yemeni governorate, and are broadly in line with previous mathematical modelling predictions, though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths. Satellite imagery burial analysis appears a promising novel approach for monitoring epidemics and other crisis impacts, particularly where ground data are difficult to collect."

Fascinating work. Remembering that in the initial stages of the pandemic in severely impacted countries media reports carried pictures of new cemetery plots -- most notably in Sao Paulo, Brazil (May 2020: https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/americas/gallery/brazil-coronavirus/index.html the 1st and 8th pictures) and Teheran, Iran (May 2020 https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves/). While counts weren't available the focus was on excess mortality both direct and indirect. It's curious that the satellite imaging undercounted deaths during the period when compared with civil records. The authors speculate they may have missed newer cemeteries and burial locations, but suggests that baseline data on mortality rates are available in Aden governorate. Again, a fascinating approach to estimate excess mortality in a resource poor country. But still in relatively early stages of development of the methodology. - Mod.MPP]
