Suspected cutaneous anthrax, Belgium ex Botswana
-----------------------------------------------
A 30-year-old Belgian woman traveled, from 12 Dec 2004 to 22 Jan 2005, to
Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. She visited several game parks with 2
different tourist groups (of 15 and 8 people). On 8 Jan 2005, shortly after
a visit to Chobe National Park in Botswana, she developed a small painless
vesicular lesion on the dorsum of her left 4th finger. There was a rather
fast progression, with the center of the lesion becoming black. There was
no pus. Peripheral swelling and redness followed, with discrete vesicular
lesions at the edge of the central black lesion. Digital pictures were
taken. Massive edema -- that involved the finger, the left hand, and the
left arm -- followed quickly ("arm as thick as her leg"). There was no
fever, no pain in the arm and the general condition was good. She developed
a moderately painful left axillary lymphadenopathy.
She quickly received 2 grams of augmentin [amoxicillin/clavulanate
potassium] and was hospitalized in Johannesburg. A wound culture was
positive for "viridans streptococci," although _Streptococcus viridans_
does not normally cause erysipelas or gangrenous ecthyma [gangrenous
ecthyma is usually associated with septicemia caused by gram negative
organisms and is characterized by lesions that begin as vesicles that
rapidly progress to pustules and gangrenous ulcers - Mod.MPP].
Ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, tetracyclin and cloxacillin, together with
topical mupirocin, were administered. She was discharged after 6 days,
returned home, took one more week of flucloxacillin and came in for
advisement to our policlinic (Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp,
Belgium).
When we saw her at the beginning of February [2005], her general condition
was excellent, but she still had a painless necrotic finger lesion, 1 x 4
cm, with limited peripheral edema. The lesion was clearly healing. There
was limited damage to the extensor tendon of the distal phalanx of her 4th
finger, and there was a 15 cm zone of hypoesthesia on the radial aspect of
her left forearm. No additional antibiotics were prescribed. The
possibility of anthrax was explained to the patient, together the lack of
person-to-person transmission.
Upon questioning, she admitted that some people in her group touched the
carcasses of dead antelopes in Chobe Park, and one member had climbed upon
a dead hippo but subsequently sank into the carcass. Afterwards (before
eating), all the members of the group washed their hands in a small plastic
tub with some water and a bit of Dettol.
The aspect of the black dry skin lesion, the central necrotic character,
the impressive peripheral edema with faint vesicles, the absence of
leukocytosis, the normal ASLO [antistreptolycin O] and ESR [erythrocyte
sedimentation rate], the absence of pain or fever (maximum temperature was
37.8 C at only one time) during all phases of her illness, as well as the
history involved, were all suggestive of cutaneous anthrax.
Our lab was immediately notified. A culture, performed in a BSL3 lab, was
negative. PCR-confirmation for _Bacillus anthracis_ will be sought (on
material prelevated on a Dacron swab as well as on wound crusts). We stored
serum for anthrax serology, but we do not have the facilities to perform
this test ourselves. A skin biopsy of the finger was not taken. The case
was notified as "probably cutaneous anthrax" to the Belgian public health
officials.
As many members of her (international) traveling group as possible were
urgently contacted by email. We obtained indirect information from South
Africa that 6 more people might have developed similar skin lesions
(further data is lacking).
Colleagues active in travel medicine are asked to include a warning against
touching dead animals.

[One could not ask for a better pathognomonic description of cutaneous
anthrax, except that fever can occur: local inflammation with vesicles,
painless sores latterly turning black, edema, enlarged lymph nodes. In that
folk regularly ascribe foolish actions to others when they were themselves
involved, one might presume that she might have been a hippo-climber as
well. In spite of the group hand washing "in a small plastic tub with some
water and a bit of Dettol," one (plus 6 to 8?) persons developed a
cutaneous lesion. And it is always wise not to interfere with the bodies of
dead animals, unless you know what you are doing, and even then, we usually
take automatic precautions. It is a good rule that, if you can get close to
a wild animal, it is probably sick. Therefore, stop and step back. - Mod.MHJ]
