The death of a New Hampshire man said to be infected with a rare mosquito-borne disease called Jamestown Canyon virus has raised questions as to whether he is its 1st recorded fatality.

The widow [of the deceased] says 2 separate tests found evidence of the Jamestown Canyon virus in the 56-year-old. The deceased, of Derry, died [Mon 18 Jun 2018]. His cause of death was determined to be encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can be caused by Jamestown Canyon virus as well as a number of other agents.

The state says it has not confirmed any reports of Jamestown Canyon virus in New Hampshire this year [2018], though the confirmation process can take some time. Jamestown Canyon virus does not usually cause major illness and is not known to be fatal.

Pinpointing the exact cause of the death is difficult, partly because of the effect of years of chemotherapy [the deceased] had undergone, reducing his immune response, and partly because Jamestown Canyon virus is a relatively new medical problem in the country.

"There haven't been a lot of cases yet, so we're still learning a lot about this disease," said Elizabeth Daly, chief of the state's Bureau of Infectious Disease Control. "We don't know a lot about this virus, about how long it has been around."

State health officials will not discuss individual cases due to federal patient privacy laws.

The virus is found throughout the USA but produces few symptoms, or none at all, in most people, according to medical officials. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported nationally, 5 of them in New Hampshire since 2013, including 3 reported last year [2017].

Daly said as of [Thu 28 Jun 2018], no cases of Jamestown Canyon virus had been confirmed in the state. But, she said, "testing is not widely available," and overall numbers "probably under-represent what is actually happening in the community."

There has never been a confirmed fatality from Jamestown Canyon virus. That makes the [Mon 18 Jun 2018] death of the man, a Navy veteran who worked as an engineer, all the more important.

"They told me it's because his immune system was compromised from the chemo," said the wife of the deceased, thinking back on conversations she had with doctors. "I think people should be aware of it."

As she tells it, the deceased's problems date back more than a year, starting with fatigue and phantom pains, progressing through confusion and mood swings into physical decline and eventually dementia that made him hard to control and sometimes forced the family and doctors to restrain him. He died in bed at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, [MA], a shell of his former self.

The deceased, an engineer at Nantero Inc. in Massachusetts, had lymphoma, but with chemotherapy it had been in remission since 2012, and he had seemed healthy until a little over a year ago, his wife said. The 2 had been married 18 years, with grown children from previous marriages and one daughter of their own.

"Last year, in May [2017], we had a campfire with family and friends. That was about the last time he was able to do anything," she said. "We didn't do one thing last summer. We never camped once last year; that's the 1st time ever. We knew something was wrong but didn't know what."

They went to doctors who considered Lyme disease and then fibromyalgia, both of which can show similar chronic symptoms, but no cause was found, she said. As months went on, things got worse.

"In January [2018], he started getting really confused. He called me from work and said, 'I don't know what to do here,'" she recalled.

The confusion got so bad that his company had to keep him from working with chemicals or electrical systems out of fear for his safety, and then told him to stay home.

"In February [2018], he was pulled over by Derry police. They called me and said they thought he was under the influence," she said. "They were awesome when they learned it was a medical condition. They let me call a family member to pick him up."

Soon, he had to be kept at home, and when his oncologist saw his condition at a regular appointment in March [2018], they halted chemotherapy and went into more extensive testing.

"We all thought the cancer was back," [she] said.

At Dana Farber Cancer Institute, doctors did MRIs, a spinal tap, and bloodwork, but "in early April [2018] they said, 'We don't know what's going on.' There's inflammation, cells that aren't supposed to be there, proteins are high, but they didn't know."

Meanwhile, his confusion increased, she said, and by late April [2018] there were times that he couldn't dress himself, times that he couldn't sleep for long, and times that he would become increasingly irrational.

By early May [2018] he was at Brigham and Women's Hospital where they had to restrain him: "He was going in other people's rooms, trying to leave." They eventually put him in a tent bed, an enclosed bed that kept him from walking away but didn't keep him tied down, she said, but he kept getting worse, shedding weight until he was down to 118 pounds [56 kg].

"Day to day, I could see a change in him. They finally told me he had rapidly progressing dementia and had weeks to live," she said.

On [Mon 14 May 2018], she said she got a phone call that blood testing at the University of Southern California [in Los Angeles, CA] had found evidence of Jamestown Canyon virus as part of sweeping tests.

"I had told them, you test him for any kind of bug that's out there because of all the time he spends in the woods," she said. "He's always out there walking, outside."

She said they tried 2 experimental medicines -- "we had to get FDA approval" -- but they didn't work. Medicine was halted [Sun 10 Jun 2018], and he died 8 days later.

Daly said that Jamestown Canyon virus, like other diseases passed on by mosquitoes such as West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis, can lead to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, causing "headaches, seizures, changes in mental status, confusion, symptoms of something neurologic happening."

All diseases passed on by mosquitoes, including Jamestown Canyon virus, must be reported as part of public-health monitoring. Its appearance in the state, while still rare, has led officials to include it in information about arboviral disease -- those transmitted by insects and other bugs -- to health practitioners and the public.

"We've started to include it as part of arboviral disease communication to providers, letting them know it's time to start considering these when they show symptoms," [Daly] said. "Fortunately, the same precautions that we take against West Nile, EEE are also effective against Jamestown Canyon."

They include removing standing water where mosquitoes can breed and taking efforts to avoid being bitten, such as wearing long sleeves and long pants when mosquitoes are out and using proper bug spray.

As for the wife of the deceased, as she puts her family's life back together, she says she tries not to 2nd-guess what happened.

"I have to wonder, if they'd found it a year ago, could they have saved him?" she said. "You never know."

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) cases were diagnosed in New Hampshire in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare and, if laboratory confirmed, the above case will be the 1st documented death due to the virus. It is difficult to assess the contribution of the previous chemotherapy to the progression of the patient's disease and eventual death.

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, CO, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup, Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
