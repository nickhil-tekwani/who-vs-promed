[Zdenci, a town of 1100, is located in Eastern central Croatia, Lat 45.58;
Long 17.58. See
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/HR/17/Zdenci.html>.
Needless to say, the fact that the hosts are migratory swans is a cause for
concern. If both this and the Swedish finding in wild ducks actually turn
out to be the same H5N1, what can be said except this would not be a
particularly good day for the containment of H5N1. - Mod.PC]
