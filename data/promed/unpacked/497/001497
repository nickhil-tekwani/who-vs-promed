At least 1458 people contracted the measles or still have it, reports the RIVM (Instituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu), the National Institute for Public Health and Environment, on Thu 19 Sep 2013.

Since last week, 110 new cases have been reported, more than twice as many as the week before, 9 of whom had to be admitted to the hospital. The real number of cases is probably higher, because most people who contract the measles don't go to their doctor. The measles epidemic has been going on since May this year [2013].

Although the RIVM finds it difficult to predict the course, the institute thinks the peak is yet to come, possibly in autumn [2013]. The majority of people who become infected live in the Bible Belt, the strip from Zeeland to West Overijssel, where many strict Calvinists live, who, for their faith, abandon vaccination.

On Mon 16 Sep 2013, medial staff of the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital of the Astrachan State Medical Academy (ASMA) admitted another 3 students with suspected measles infection, bringing the total number of cases to 29. Previously, 26 students had been admitted with measles virus infection imported by foreign [i.e. non-resident] students from Dagestan.

The number of medical students who have become ill with measles in Astrakhan has grown to 26. According to an official, the academy decided to take immediate action to contain the outbreak and conducted mass vaccination of all students and staff. The necessity for vaccination was based on the presence of several students from Dagestan with suspected measles virus infection. The medical staff decided to extend vaccination to all patients and staff who did not have contraindications for vaccination.

Since many of the academy students had spent time in other health facilities as well as in the hospital, it was decided to extend vaccination to include all departments of the academy in addition to the hospital to avoid contact between patients and potentially infected students.

Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan, has been affected by the current outbreak of measles virus infection, which is affecting the whole of Russia.

Kazan municipal authorities have endorsed a plan to combat the spread of measles. According to figures cited by the city authorities, during the 1st 7 months of 2013, there were 720 cases of measles in 40 regions of the Republic. In Kazan, there have been 26 cases compared with 11 during the same period in 2012. This increase has been attributed to both the increasing incidence of measles in the countries of the European region and an increasing number of imported cases of the infection.

The spread of infection has occurred mainly in the unvaccinated sector of the population. In Tatarstan as a whole, 73.1 percent of people either have not been vaccinated against measles or have received only one vaccination.

At least 40 children were killed in a fresh outbreak of measles across the 23 local government areas in northwest Nigeria's Kaduna State, local media reported on Friday [20 Sep 2013], APA reports, quoting Xinhua.

This year [2013] alone, the Nigerian state recorded at least 1000 cases of the disease resulting in the high number of deaths, the local People's Daily Newspaper said, citing Sufyan Babale, Executive Secretary of the Kaduna Primary Health Care Agency. "I visited the area personally and saw fresh graves of over 30 children that died in Lere local government area alone," Babale told the Abuja-based newspaper. The healthcare official said more cases reported in other local government areas have been put under control by the government.

"There are states that are selected for this year's [2013] campaign on implementation of measles (immunization) in the country, of which Kaduna State is one. So, we are going to do that to educate our people on the disease," he added. The measles immunization program will run between 5-9 Oct 2013 across the northern state.

6 months ago, federal health authorities in Abuja made moves to combat the contagious viral disease that had infected no fewer than 4000 children in the northern part of Nigeria as of March 2013. Children between 9 months and 5 years old are particularly susceptible to the disease.

Queenslanders are being urged to check their measles vaccination records, following the 14th diagnosis of the highly infectious disease in the state this year [2013].

In the past 2 weeks alone, 5 people in Ipswich have been diagnosed with measles. A range of interstate and international visitors have also been diagnosed while visiting the state's southeast in the past 2 months.

Queensland Health communicable diseases unit doctor Stephen Lambert urged those aged 30 to 45 to check their vaccination records, saying the group was more susceptible to the disease than other parts of the population: "This group, now aged about 30 to 45 years, were young children during the years when vaccine was 1st being used in Australia, but uptake was low. Even low vaccine uptake had a quick effect on dampening down measles virus circulation, meaning that this group of children didn't catch measles infection and may not have been immunised. This has left them vulnerable to catching measles when exposed." The health authority said anyone concerned should see their GP immediately to discuss their options.

Measles vaccinations were introduced in 1966, and since then, the number of cases has fallen dramatically. Public health staff around the southeast are working to ascertain the links, if there are any, between the recent cases.

The 1st case in the most recent outbreak of measles was confirmed in Queensland in late July 2013, when a Victorian who had contracted the disease following an outbreak in that state visited Brisbane while unknowingly infectious. A 2nd infected Victorian travelled extensively on the city's public transport network between 9-17 Aug 2013, while an international tourist travelled from Cairns to Brisbane and then on to Sydney between 16-24 Aug 2013. A Caboolture High School student was diagnosed in late August 2013, while the 1st Ipswich case came in early September 2013.

Dr Lambert advised anyone in Brisbane between these dates to be on the lookout for symptoms of the disease. "True measles is a serious viral infection that causes fever, cough, runny nose, then a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later," he said. "Measles occasionally has dangerous complications with up to 1/3rd of young adults with measles ending up being treated in hospital."

He said that anybody who had or knew someone with those symptoms should visit their GP immediately.

Vulnerability to outbreaks of measles virus infection is a consequence of incomplete vaccine coverage and an abundance of non-resident tourists. - Mod.CP
