[A recent Emerging Infectious Diseases article
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/2/317.htm> on EHD in Turkey
summarizes the disease as follows:

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a member of the genus
_Orbivirus_, family _Reoviridae_, and is closely related to
bluetongue virus (BTV). EHD often causes death in white-tailed deer
and, less frequently, a bluetongue-like illness in cattle.

EHDV has been isolated from cattle throughout the world, including
Africa, North America, Australia, Japan, and recently Israel. Recent
outbreaks of EHDV in Israel during 2006 were attributed to EHDV-7;
outbreaks in Morocco and Algeria were similar to EHDV-6/EHDV-318.

For further details, see article referenced below, and the comments
of Mod.AS are particularly useful in providing a full understanding
of the disease in the Mediterranean region. Importantly, EHD was last
year (2008) determined to meet OIE's criteria for an emerging disease
(multiple countries reporting a disease event that had never occurred
before), and full reporting has been required since the semi-annual
report of June 2008.

Of course, this report would be more complete if both strain
information and a description of the epidemiology of the outbreak was
provided instead of the vague reference to an epidemiology similar to
the 2003 outbreak that occurred in Reunion. - Mod.PC]
