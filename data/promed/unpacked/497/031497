In August 2004 there began a series of notifications of an epizootic
(animal deaths) in monkeys in the state of Goias involving the
municipalities of Sao Miguel do Passa Quatro, Goianapolis, Terezopolis de
Goias, Minacu, and Santa Cruz do Goias. Given the geographic proximity to
the location of an outbreak of jungle yellow fever in 1999/2000, the
Secretary of Health of Tocantins adopted measures to increase the
sensitivity of epidemiologic surveillance and improve yellow fever
vaccination coverage.
On 13 Sep [2004] the 1st epizootic [monkey death] was notified in
Tocantins, having occurred approximately 10 days earlier [3 Sept 2004] in
the municipality of Ponte Alta do Tocantins, at the Ema ranch, near to the
border with the municipality Novo Acordo. On [16 Sep 2004] the State
Department of Health/Epidemiologic Surveillance was informed of a new
epizootic occurring also approximately 10 days before, with the death of 2
animals found in the same locale, in the municipality of Parana, located in
San Domingos, on the border with the municipality of Sao Valerio da
Natividade. On 21 Sep [2004], the Secretary of Health Surveillance was
informed of a new epizootic in the state of Tocantins, now in the
municipality of Divinopolis, where a rancher encountered a dead monkey near
the bank of a stream.
Epizootics, especially in monkeys, are sentinel events, possibly due to the
circulation of the yellow fever virus in the jungle. In outbreaks of
jungle yellow fever in the country through 2003, epizootics were frequently
reported before the onset of the outbreaks. With this in mind, the
Ministry of Health in 2002 developed guidelines for detection of and
response to an epizootic. Amongst other measures, actions to be taken
include an investigation of the epizootic, collection of laboratory
specimens from the wild vectors, active surveillance for human cases, and
vaccination of the population, even without the confirmation of circulation
of the yellow fever virus in animals.
In the state of Tocantins, after this epizootic was discovered, meetings
were held with health specialists from the municipalities and the
representatives of environmental organizations, agriculture, tourism, and
farming to establish partnerships and optimize local resources to
facilitate implementation of control measures.
The following steps were taken by the State of Tocantins Department of Health
- dissemination of facts on their internet website
- written information for all municipalities of the state explaining the
epidemiologic information and sending orientation material on yellow fever
- production of an informational videotape on the necessity to report
epizootics, be up-to-date on vaccinations, and of the risk of the
circulation of yellow fever virus, to be aired by local television channels.
- provision of orientation material and help to the municipalities on the
strategies for intensification of vaccination activities [with yellow fever
vaccine]
Where ongoing [epizootic] activity is suggested, work has already begun on
house-to-house vaccination, with the involvement of PACS [?] to search for
non-vaccinated individuals, primarily in the rural zones. It is important
to emphasize that during the outbreak in 1999/2000, vaccination of the
population was intensified, resulting in the current situation: today there
are only 3 municipalities with vaccination coverage under 100 percent. The
Ministry of Health is helping, through sending technical advisors to the
Secretary of Health Surveillance of the Evandro Chagas Institute, to
collect the jungle vectors in order to verify the circulation of [yellow
fever] virus. This will begin on 1 Oct 2004 in the municipality of
Divinopolis in Tocantins.
The recognition of an epizootic has led to a state of maximal alert in
order to take measures for the prevention and control of yellow fever,
principally for intensifying vaccination activities in the states of Goias
and Tocantins. Additionally, there should be strengthened surveillance for
deaths in monkeys and for suspected human cases, with wide dissemination of
the definition of a suspected case of yellow fever to all health services
in the affected regions. The alert should also be given to the following
regions: the west of Bahia, southwest of Piaui, southwest of Maranhao,
south of Para and northeast of Mato Grosso.
Currently there is the important variable of the municipal elections, when
there is a large population movement toward the interior of the states,
increasing the risk of non-vaccinated persons contracting the infection. It
is therefore recommended that there be dissemination and utilization of
epizootic information forms in order to report information collected in the
field. This form was made available for the participants of a national
meeting on this disease held in Brasilia in 2003.
In the state of Tocantins, the notification of epizootics or of suspected
human cases should be made via telephoning (63) 218-1762, and the
orientation material on the vaccine can be obtained by telephoning 0800
631002 or (63) 218-1783. Within the Ministry of Health/Secretary of Health
Surveillance, reporting of epizootics can be made by telephoning (61)
226-9075 or (61) 314-6332, or through email to <covev@funasa.gov.br>.
The analysis of vaccine coverage in Brazil is provided to underline the
necessity for further refinement of vaccination strategies, to facilitate
the identification of the population to be vaccinated (groups that are
resistant to vaccination, travelers, those interested in radical sports,
ecotourism, etc.). The situation demands a greater degree of effort to
offer vaccine, especially to groups of travellers, and to take best
advantage of opportunities for vaccination. In this sense, the following
designations apply to all the federal units (States), according the
situation of yellow fever risk:
Endemic Area, Transitional Area and Potential Risk Area:
Offer yellow fever vaccination in all municipalities and vaccination posts,
daily during their entire periods of attendance and in extramural
strategies. DO NOT MAKE APPOINTMENTS.
Area not at risk:
Considering the intensive flow of travellers going to endemic areas,
transitional areas and potential risk areas, we should orient the state
Capitals to offer yellow fever vaccine in all vaccination posts, daily,
during their entire period of attendance. The municipalities of the
interior of the state should offer yellow fever vaccine in at least one
vaccination post daily during its entire period of attendance.
