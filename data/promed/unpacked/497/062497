Yucatan registers 55 positive cases of influenza, as confirmed by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sinave).

Based on weekly reports, during the seasonal season of this disease, 12 more cases of this illness were registered in one week in the state. Also, only one death has been reported so far.

In general, cases of this disease had a notorious increase last week [week of 12 Dec 2022], as confirmed by federal authorities themselves, reaching 5554 counted at the national level, as well as 81 deaths due to this cause so far.

Nuevo Leon tops the list of cases with 921, followed by Queretaro with 782, Mexico City with 573, and Aguas Calientes with 540.

The incidence of influenza in Russia has increased several times compared to last year's [2021] indicators: 143.6 cases per 10 000 inhabitants, the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza reported.

Among these strains, the [influenza A/H1N1] dominates. As RIA Novosti writes, it originates from the well-known Spanish flu, which, according to some estimates, killed a hundred million people in 1918-1920. This flu has returned several times. The epidemic of 2009 was particularly severe. At that time, according to the World Health Organization data, 18 449 people died.

But there are also ordinary seasonal flu -- the H3N2 -- and some other respiratory viral infections. They are back after a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19.

However, the coronavirus is not gone, although it has weakened greatly. It still poses a threat, along with some other infections.

Children under the age of 5 are at the greatest risk for the flu. Teenagers are also at risk. There have already been several fatal cases. A 17-year-old cadet of the Moscow University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation died in Stavropol, a 15-year-old girl died in Yaroslavl region, and a 10-year-old schoolboy died in Chelyabinsk region.

Educational and medical institutions have been quarantined in a number of Russian regions. Moreover, according to the head of the Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing), Anna Popova, no restrictions are envisioned at the federal level.

However, according to experts, in reality, nothing unusual is happening yet.

Mass vaccination against flu is over in Russia, and 52.2 percent of the country's population -- or 74 million people -- were vaccinated. This is significantly less than last year [2021]: 85.9 million, according to Rospotrebnadzor.

As per experts, the epidemic will end when collective immunity is achieved; that is, when more than 70 percent of the population acquires it.

The increase in the incidence of influenza this year [2022] was predicted for an earlier period, which is now being confirmed, Natalya Shmeleva, head of the laboratory of influenza and influenza-like diseases of the Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, told reporters.

Traditionally, an increase in the incidence of influenza in Belarus and in many countries is observed in January-February, but this year, as in the past, influenza viruses appeared a little earlier, Natalya Shmeleva noted. This situation is related to the coronavirus pandemic. "The emergence of the SARS-COV-2 virus and the development of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the fact that other respiratory viruses were forced out of the usual seasonal circulation. And in the 2020-2021 season, we practically did not register influenza viruses on a global scale, there were only sporadic cases ", said the head of the laboratory.

Later, the influenza virus returned to seasonal circulation and a 2-wave rise in the incidence was observed in the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. In the future, due to the spread of the omicron variant coronavirus, the epidemic rise in the incidence was short-lived and quickly subsided. "This year, we also predicted an earlier start of the epidemic rise in the incidence, which we are currently observing."

European countries have already entered the influenza epidemic since the 45th calendar week [week of 7 Nov 2022], in many countries the epidemic thresholds have long been exceeded both in terms of incidence and in the frequency of detection of influenza viruses," Natalya Shmeleva noted. According to her, influenza A (H3N2) viruses dominate globally, but in some countries, including Russia, and Belarus, A (H1N1) viruses predominate among detected influenza viruses. As the head of the laboratory explained, the different etiology of epidemic rises in the incidence in different countries is due to several reasons.

"First, we have been traveling less recently to the countries of North America and Europe, so the influenza virus that circulates there is less likely to enter our country. Second, in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere in the summer, when there was an epidemic rise in the incidence, influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses circulating. This applies to a number of Asian countries.

The virus had the opportunity to get both to Russia and to Belarus. And now the H1N1 virus is predominantly spreading in our country. Cases of influenza B virus are also recorded, she said. Other respiratory viruses also contribute to the development of the epidemic situation. SARS-COV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza are still relevant. That is, known viruses continue to circulate but only in certain periods of time the dominating place is occupied by different pathogens.

Three cases of swine flu have been established in Bulgaria. For the time being, the health authorities assure that there is no room for concern and emphasize that the most important thing is to limit infection among the population.

This was stated by the director of the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases Prof Iva Hristova in the program "Before Everyone" on Bulgarian National Radio.

"Anti-epidemic measures are helping, and now there is also an increase in viruses causing acute respiratory diseases, not only [influenza A/H1N1]. This is normal for the season, but this time it started earlier and with more sick people," explained Prof Hristova.

She emphasized that the respiratory syncytial virus, which is dangerous for newborns and for many of the elderly, takes the leading place with more frequent infections among people.

This is because in these target groups the disease is longer and more severe, and it is possible to develop bronchiolitis, to affect the respiratory function more seriously, and lead to hospitalization of the youngest children, up to 4 years.

"They have suffered because they do not have developed immunity, they are often in groups in kindergartens. This virus is also leading in the world. The measures are for parents to separate children from large groups of people, these are my recommendations. Also, we should not wait for the virus to develop and keep them from kindergarten, we should stop the child from contact with other children at the 1st symptoms. We have 2 antiviral preparations for this virus, but the flu vaccines do not protect us from it," explained Prof Hristova.

In 2nd place is the rhinovirus, again in children. Currently, there are also adenoviruses, parvoviruses, and others.

The director of the National Institute of Health and Welfare assured that it is not too late for those wishing to get the flu vaccine, as the peak of the season is expected in February and March.

"Negotiations are underway to purchase more flu vaccines; they are in demand worldwide at the moment. It is true that every year there are not enough, especially the free ones at the general practitioners' for the elderly," added Prof Iva Hristova for BNR.

Overall the reports above indicate increased influenza activity, with an early surge reported from many countries.

The report from Syria ([3] above) may potentially indicate other respiratory pathogens in addition to influenza, including bacterial causes. However, limited diagnostic capacity for diagnosis of non-influenza viruses and bacteria may lead to misdiagnosis and/or delay in treatment. - Mod.UBA]
