One of the nation's largest dog food producers has recalled some of
its products in 22 states after receiving reports that they caused
death and illness, a company executive said Thursday.
In a letter to thousands of its suppliers, Diamond Pet Food announced
it found aflatoxin in products made at its Gaston, South Carolina,
plant, said Chief Operating Officer Mark Brinkmann.
Products made at the Gaston facility are shipped to Alabama,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee, West Virginia, Vermont and Virginia. 5 cat food products
and 14 dog food products were recalled.
Aflatoxin is a poisonous substance produced by fungi that grow on
grains, including corn.
Brinkmann said he wasn't sure how many animals fell ill from the
toxin, but the 22 states' veterinarian's offices reported a total of
17 deaths and 24 illnesses believed linked to the tainted pet food.
Investigators were at the South Carolina plant Thursday trying to
determine when the contamination began, state Agriculture
Commissioner Hugh Weathers said. "We were pulling samples yesterday
and this morning," he said.
In its recall announcement, Diamond states that its in-house analysis
has determined that "shipments were definitively clear of aflatoxin
after 1 Dec 2005."
Clinical signs that an animal may have ingested aflatoxin include
yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums, bloody vomiting or
stools, lethargy, loss of appetite and increased water consumption.
Since other illnesses can cause the same symptoms, it is important
for a veterinarian to check any suspected cases, experts said.
Brinkmann said the company was alerted to the problem last Friday by
a veterinarian in New York State who said he had seen 3 dogs that
were exhibiting symptoms associated with liver disease.
"They were all 3 on one of our foods," Brinkmann said.
The company issued the recall Wednesday for foods containing corn
produced at the South Carolina plant between 1 Sep and 10 Dec 2005.
The suspect items are marked with "best by" date codes of between 1
Mar and 10 Jun 2007. They contain an 11th or 12th digit, "G,"
signifying the Gaston facility.
The plant routinely takes samples of each half hour of production and
is sending those samples to laboratories as part of an investigation
into how the contamination occurred, Brinkmann said.
He urged consumers to check any product they may have before feeding
it to their pets.
Diamond Pet Food, a family-owned company, is based in Meta, Missouri,
outside Jefferson City.

Perhaps the reason for this public notice it not for the protection
of dogs but of humans. It is common knowledge that people will eat
canned dog food since it is cheaper than other protein sources and
yet it is prepared under similar FDA regulations as for human foods.
