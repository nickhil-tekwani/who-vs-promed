[re: ProMED-mail: Canine parvovirus - USA: (CA)]
------------------------------------------------
The old practice I worked at did not report [parvovirus] cases and we saw them all the time. We do tend to see more of these cases when the winds blow strongly. CPV [canine parvovirus] is not an airborne virus, but attached to dust particles may allow it to be spread (speculation). It's a tough virus and can last 2 years in the environment under the right conditions. A vaccine research scientist in a lecture 10 years ago, said they had to fumigate the buildings where the control dogs were with formaldehyde gas, or they would break before challenge. None of the liquid disinfectant products would work.

Then a couple of weeks ago I attended some CE [continuing education] where Dr Stanley Marks from UC Davis said: (from his notes) "Caution should be heeded in ruling out CPV in fully vaccinated dogs that are 6 months old or older, including those lacking neutropenia on CBC, because "atypical" CPV, associated with CPV-2C has been well documented in these animals. A negative fecal ELISA test should never be used to rule out CPV." [Reference for statement by Dr Marks: Decaro N, Buonavoglia C. Canine parvovirus -- a review of epidemiological and diagnostic aspects, with emphasis on type 2c. Vet Microbiol. 2012 Feb 24; 155(1): 1-12. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.09.007. Epub 2011 Sep 12; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21962408.]

Discussions on Veterinary Info (http://www.vin.com) have indicated that some dogs may need vaccination out to 5 months of age because maternal neutralizing antibodies may interfere with CPV vaccination beyond 16 weeks of age. The current vaccines will work for CPV-2C. But there may be a genetic immune problem with some dogs being unable to respond to CPV infection. It has been suggested that the high rate of death in Doberman and Rottweiler puppies was an immune problem, but these susceptible individuals may have been removed from the population as we no longer see this. Some of this could be related to breeders who were giving puppies vaccines every day or two because of the CPV problem and actually may have shut off the immune response to the virus, much like desensitizing an allergy patient.

Canine parvo is a continuous problem and one must try to calm the fears of an epidemic by statistics. The mother and puppies were from a rescue in Tehachapi and were brought to us in Palmdale for treatment; one puppy died, the rest survived [see ProMED-mail posting 20140517.2478614.] The report we made to the County did include the Tehachapi source.

[The triggering report for this thread was a public service announcement by the County of Los Angeles Department of Animal Care & Control on 6 May 2014 (http://1.usa.gov/1jph3q1), which was used essentially word for word in the Dog Channel report [see ProMED-mail post 20140516.2477464]. A more complete set of data has been requested from the LA animal care and control people but has yet to arrive.

From Dr Cyrog's informed remarks this moderator is of the opinion that LA County is possibly seeing the synergistic results of uneven reporting by the veterinary clinics, along with the impact of a seasonal whelping pattern dumping a surge of young puppies into the local canine population and the opportunity for increased cases not abnormal for this time of the year.

Following up on a lead from Richard Brown, a fellow Cantab veterinarian presently in Hong Kong, I checked out Parvo Watch and came upon a report of a parvovirus outbreak presently affecting the animal shelters in El Paso, Texas: http://www.elpasotimes.com/latestnews/ci_25676525/el-paso-animal-shelters-hit-by-parvo-outbreak. For those interested there is a nice Parvo Watch map of cases in the UK at https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zMCcrk13bCFY.keHmMJsxnmiI.

Unless there is evidence of a serious and unusual problem in Los Angeles, this thread is cut. With thanks to Peter and Richard for their contributions. - Mod.MHJ
