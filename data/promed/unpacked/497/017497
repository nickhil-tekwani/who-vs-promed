More than 500 people in the United Kingdom have been affected by a _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to pork scratching products. There were 534 sick people as of late October 2021 with the majority falling ill since June 2021.

The 1st patient was in September 2020, and the peak was 80 cases reported in one week. Slightly more than half are male with an age range of 0 to 92 years old and a median of 54. A dozen were admitted to hospital, but this information is available for only 35 people. The majority of those sick are in England, but some patients live in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Whole genome sequencing identified the genetically similar _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis cases. It is thought to be the largest outbreak of this _Salmonella_ type ever reported in Europe.

In late August 2021, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland advised consumers not to eat several pork scratching products purchased since February 2021, which were linked to _Salmonella_ infections. At that time, the agencies reported 179 people were sick.

Tayto Group's recall included some Mr. Porky, Jay's and The Real Pork Crackling Company products. Production was halted at the implicated factory once a possible link was identified. Cases have reduced but continue to be reported despite the product recall. Items have best-before dates up to and including 19 Feb 2022. Microbiological investigations identified isolates matching the outbreak strain at the production site and in an unopened product from the day of inspection.

Tayto Group, who also distributes to the EU and other countries, voluntarily suspended production and withdrew and recalled products as well as doing enhanced cleaning and microbiological testing. The original cause of contamination has not been determined with FSA traceback work including looking at pork rind supplied from 3 countries.

[Readers who are "muggles" to different snacks made from the skin of pigs may need to be educated about the differences in pork snacks.

"In simple terms, the difference between pork scratchings, crackling, and rinds typically comes from the way they are cooked:

- Pork scratchings are cooked once and are the hardest of these 3.
- Pork crackling is cooked twice. The 2nd cook lightens the edge of the pork, which puffs it a little, resulting in more flavour with less tooth-shattering crunch.
- Pork rind is also cooked twice but at a higher temperature, resulting in a lighter, fluffier snack that's full of flavour. Pork crunch is a British term for the same snack"
(https://www.snafflingpig.co.uk/blogs/pig-blogs/whats-the-difference-between-pork-scratchings-pork-crackling-and-pork-crunch-pork-rind).

Given that these products are cooked, the contamination with _Salmonella_ likely occurred after the cooking process. - Mod.LL
