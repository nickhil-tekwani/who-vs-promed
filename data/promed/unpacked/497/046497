The February 19, 1998 edition of Eurosurveillance Weekly contains a report
of a suspected case of Crimean/Congo haemorrhagic fever in British
traveller returning from Zimbabwe. A 78 year old woman with fever of
unknown origin was admitted to hospital in Poole, Dorset, on the south
coast of England, on 20 December 1997. The initial working diagnoses were
malaria and typhoid. Her condition deteriorated on 25 December, when she
developed thrombocytopenia, melaena, and a haemorrhagic rash. She underwent
several procedures, including computed tomography, lumbar puncture, and
plasmapheresis, but died on 28 December. Serum taken on 27 December was
examined at the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR).
Strongly positive specific IgG and weakly positive specific IgM titres
indicated a strong probability of Crimean/Congo haemorrhagic fever. Viral
cultures were negative.
The patient had visited Zimbabwe between 18 November and 14 December 1997,
where she stayed at her brother's tobacco farm near Harare. Rodent
droppings were seen in the cottage where she stayed, and she often walked
barefoot between the cottage and the farmhouse, which were adjacent to an
ostrich farm. Ostriches carry many ticks, and outbreaks of Crimean/Congo
haemorrhagic fever have been reported in recent years among workers who
rear ostriches and handle their meat in neighbouring South Africa, although
not from Zimbabwe. The endemic area for Crimean/Congo haemorrhagic fever
extends to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia. The virus is
transmitted through bites from adult ticks of _Hyalomma_ species, which are
widely distributed through the endemic area.
Secondary spread of Crimean/Congo haemorrhagic fever to health care workers
has been documented. Sixty-four health care worker contacts in Poole were
identified, including members of the resuscitation team. No secondary cases
occurred, but this case highlights the need for vigilance and swift
commissioning of expert diagnostic help when patients returning from the
tropics present with fever and haemorrhage. Severe haemorrhage is typical
of established viral haemorrhagic fevers, and represents a hazard to health
care contacts. Early treatment with intravenous ribavirin can shorten and
ameliorate the illness, so suspicion of the diagnosis can benefit both
patient and carers.

[As pointed out, earlier recognition of this infection might have allowed
treatment of this patient with ribavirin. This case emphasizes the need
for complete epidemiologic inquiries of travelers returning home ill and
the need for availability of knowledgeable infectious disease specialists
with experience in exotic diseases. - Mod.CHC
