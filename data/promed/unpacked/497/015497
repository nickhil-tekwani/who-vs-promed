Introduction and outbreak description
-------------------------------------
Tularaemia is a cosmopolitan bacterial zoonosis caused by
_Francisella tularensis_. This gram-negative bacterium contains
several highly pathogenic subspecies, whose distribution is ubiquitous
in the northern hemisphere. Because of its pathogenic potential,
tularaemia is a notifiable bacterial zoonosis in France, and is listed
as potential bioterrorist weapon. The bacterium has very complex
epidemiological cycles, including many wild species, whose
epidemiological role is sometimes unclear. Namely, _F. tularensis_ has
been isolated from more than 250 species, including 190 mammals, 88
invertebrates, 23 birds, 3 amphibians, as well as several species of
reptiles and fishes, and 2 disease cycles, terrestrial and aquatic
have been described. The interaction between these 2 cycles remains
not well known. In general, the disease cycle involves only few key
species in a given region. In the terrestrial cycle in France, the
European brown hare plays an important role in the ecology of
tularaemia as amplifying host, and it may serve as a significant
source of human infection. Hare tularaemia has been reported in most
of the departments in France, but endemic areas have been described in
the northern part of France. A recent increase in cases in hares has
been observed in 2007 and 2008. At the same time, during the winter,
an excess of human cases has been reported (144 sporadic cases from 1
Jan 2007 to 31 Dec 2008, including 48 cases in 2007 and 96 in 2008,
against a mean of 23 cases per year for the period 2003 to 2006), but
the factors responsible for this increase have not been identified.

Although tularaemia is often fatal to hares, hare tularaemia in
France is usually sporadic and does not significantly affect hare
populations. We report here an outbreak of tularaemia in brown hares
in France, which occurred in Pas-de-Calais from January to March 2011
and was characterised by a high mortality rate in the local hare
population. The epizootic form of the outbreak reported here raised
many epidemiological questions and led us to reconsider the potential
associated risks for hare populations and public health.

Conclusions
-----------
The outbreak ended in late March 2011 and the epidemiological field
investigations, performed in the middle of March have been unable to
identify a source of infection, although they were conducted at a time
when hare mortality was still observed. Molecular typing of the
isolates recovered from collected hare carcasses and ticks will
hopefully help us understand the origin of this outbreak by
determining whether it was related to the focus (one case) reported at
a distance of 10 km [6.2 mi] in 2007. Indeed, it is highly important
to determine whether the epizootic form of this outbreak was due (i)
to the emergence of a novel _F. tularensis_ strain, (ii) to the fact
that the hare population was unusually abundant, in which case the
outbreak may have been a density-dependent phenomenon, or (iii) to
particular ecologic circumstances favouring hare-to-hare transmission,
since the outbreak occurred during periods of frost (which may have
led the hares to take refuge in the woods) and coincided with the
mating season (when hares are immunosuppressed and in close contact
with each other). Further studies are planned, including histology and
surveillance of ticks and rodents, to gain knowledge on the
transmission route and on the maintenance of a disease in the area.

The epizootic focus will be carefully surveyed this year [2011] and
hunters, people walking in the forest, and physicians will be warned
that a potential risk of disease transmission exists in the area,
respectively by the departmental federation of hunters involved in the
SAGIR [surveillance of wildlife diseases] network, local authorities,
and the regional agency of health. We wish to warn wildlife managers
that aggregated cases of hare mortality may be due to _F. tularensis_
and that systematic precautions should be taken to make sure that
humans do not contract the disease. Human tularaemia is usually
sporadic in France even if aggregate cases have been described.
Infected ticks like those found alive on dead hares may become a
reservoir in the area, thus the potential for human infection is now
higher than it was. As the wood is highly frequented, tularaemia
should be considered in the area as a diagnosis, particularly in
people with contact with hares or ticks.

Tularemia, an OIE notifiable disease, is a zoonosis caused by
_Francisella tularensis_. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits
and hares) and rodents, especially microtine rodents such as voles,
vole rats, and muskrats, as well as in beavers. In addition, a wide
variety of other mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates have
been reported to be infected.

Tularemia occurs endemically in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease
can occur as epizootic outbreaks in many countries in North America
and Europe, while it occurs only as sporadic cases in some other
countries in Europe and Asia. It is rarely reported from the tropics
or the Southern Hemisphere. Several epizootic outbreaks have been
reported as a result of importation of subclinically infected
lagomorphs.

The clinically most relevant 2 types of _F. tularensis_ are
recognised on the basis of culture characteristics, epidemiology, and
virulence. _Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is
mainly associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is primarily
transmitted by ticks or biting flies, or by direct contact with
infected lagomorphs. It is highly virulent for humans and domestic
rabbits and most isolates ferment glycerol. _F. tularensis_ subsp.
_palaearctica_ (type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers,
muskrats) and voles in northern North America, and in lagomorphs
(hares) and rodents in Eurasia. It is primarily transmitted by direct
contact or by mosquitoes, but may be transmitted through inhalation or
through infected water or food. It is less virulent for humans and
domestic rabbits and does not ferment glycerol. The information above
is primarily based upon chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual
from which additional information, particularly addressing diagnostic
techniques, is accessible at
