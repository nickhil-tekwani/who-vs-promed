We confirm our previous information concerning the outbreak of shigellosis
in the Ouham province of Central African Republic. We have obtained 6
additional stool samples. _Shigella dysenteriae_ serotype 1 was isolated
from 4 (_Schistosoma mansoni_ was found in only 2 of the 6 samples). The 9
isolates of _S. dysenteriae_ are identical in terms of antibiotic
susceptibility.
Unfortunately, for security reasons, the team from Medecin sans
Frontieres-Spain was obliged to shorten their mission and can no longer
provide medical care to the population.
