A Bulgarian woman 69 or 70 [the 2 accounts differ] years old has died
of anthrax after contact with an infected sheep but there is no
danger of a wider outbreak among people, a state health official said
on Thursday. The woman was first hospitalised because of heart attack
symptoms. After she ran temperature, the doctors realized it was an
infection.
The diagnosis of anthrax has been confirmed by microbiologists from
Sofia. Experts say there is no risk of a wider outbreak of the
disease.
The woman from the village of Kamen in northeast Bulgaria contracted
the disease after processing meat from a sheep her family later
cooked and ate, said Angel Kunchev, head of the health ministry's
epidemics control unit. She died on 31 Aug 2007.

[Anthrax is sporadic in Bulgaria and each year will see a few human
cases, latterly in the ones & twos. The fact that the woman's doctors
took a while to diagnose this disease would suggest it was the
gastroenteric form, not the cutaneous which is pathognomonic. This is
the first ProMED report on anthrax in Bulgaria. - Mod.MHJ]
