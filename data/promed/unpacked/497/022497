Cherry growers in Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh are being forced to cut down their trees to prevent the spread of cherry X disease by leafhoppers. The disease is spreading fast between orchards. Early in 2021, growers noticed that the trees were drying up quickly. Scientists from Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar University visited the affected region later in 2021 and found the presence of the X disease phytoplasma.

Growers say that the situation is alarming. They have asked the local government to assist them to eradicate the leafhoppers and provide an integrated spray schedule. About 10 000 small-scale producers grow cherries on 550 hectares in the area. It is estimated that the disease, if not controlled, could destroy the cherry-growing area in around 5 years.

The government, together with farmers, is trying to find a long-term solution to eradicate the disease. It is planned to map and zone the infected and vulnerable cherry-growing regions of the state before the next flowering season in March-April.

[Phytoplasmas of the 16SrIII taxonomic group (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma pruni) cause X diseases (such as Western-X, Canada-X) of stone fruit (_Prunus_ spp). Symptoms and host specificity differ for members of the group. X-disease symptoms in cherry (also called cherry buckskin) vary with the cultivar and rootstock combinations but are often similar to viral little cherry disease.

Phytoplasmas can be spread by sap-sucking insects (mostly leafhoppers), by grafting, with contaminated tools (such as during pruning of trees), and with tissue cultures. They survive in asymptomatic crop hosts or non-crop reservoir species. Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum, as well as the use of certified clean planting and propagating material. Such measures require reliable molecular diagnostic methods and coordinated efforts on a regional scale, especially when dealing with long-lived tree crops.

Other members of 16SrIII have been shown to be associated with frog skin disease of cassava (for example see ProMED post 20071130.3864) and sugar beet yellow wilt in South America.
