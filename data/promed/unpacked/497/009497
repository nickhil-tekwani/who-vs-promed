State officials said Wednesday [11 Sep 2019] that Eastern equine encephalitis had been detected in a deer in Richmond, the 2nd such case in Rhode Island during the current outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus. The state Department of Environmental Management (DEM) reported the 1st deer infection a day earlier [10 Sep 2019] in Coventry.

With deer season opening [15 Sep 2019], DEM said it was emailing about 1200 hunters who have recently purchased 2019 deer licenses to offer personal precautionary information when field dressing animals. EEE is not considered to be a threat to the state's deer populations. Deer, like horses, cannot transmit EEE to humans, but the transmission of EEE to deer reinforces that 2019 is a higher-than-average risk year for mosquito-borne disease, DEM spokesman Michael J. Healey said.

DEM and the state Department of Health also provided more details of the aerial mosquito spraying conducted Tuesday night [10 Sep 2019] over parts of Westerly, Charlestown, and Hopkinton. Overall, the state treated parts of 21 communities over 3 nights with a pesticide formulated to kill adult mosquitoes. The flight crew used the pesticide, called Anvil 10+10, at a low concentration, dispersing a total of 556 gallons [2105 L] across 115 179 total acres [46 611 ha], meaning that 6/10 of an ounce [17 g], aerosolized, was used to treat an acre [0.4 ha]. That's the equivalent of slightly less than 4 teaspoons [20 g] per acre [0.4 ha]. [Anvil pesticide (Sumithrin or d-phenothrin) is a commonly used insecticide that belongs to the pyrethroid family of chemicals. - Mod.TY]

EEE is a rare but serious illness that spreads when people are bitten by infected mosquitoes. The health department announced [9 Sep 2019] that the individual who had contracted the state's 1st human case of EEE this year [2019] had died the day before. It was Rhode Island's 1st fatal human EEE case since 2007.

[One usually thinks of EEE virus causing human or equine fatalities. In Rhode Island, there are now 2 deer fatalities. When hunters take to the forests in 2 days (15 Sep 2019) it will be interesting to see if they discover additional dead deer that have been hidden in the vegetation, as is often the case when there are epizootics of epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer. It will also be interesting to learn if more dead deer are discovered in those states where EEE virus has been circulating this summer. The risk of EEE virus infection for humans, horses and deer will continue in Rhode Island and the other affected states until the 1st killing frosts occur, likely in October (2019). - Mod.TY
