Kenya Under Fresh Threat From Rift Valley Fever
-----------------------------------------------
When it struck barely a year ago, the dreaded Rift Valley fever [RVF]
left a 2 billion Shilling [3 224 8220 USD] void in the country's
livestock industry. And now experts are warning that the disease may
hit Kenya again and other neighbouring countries.

The new warning by the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
follows an acute outbreak of the viral disease on the Island of
Madagascar, off the coastline of East Africa.

The latest outbreak of RVF in Madagascar was 1st reported by
Agriculture Ministry on 9 Apr 2008, [following positive results of]
tests on 2 of 9 animals that were taken ill with symptoms associated
with the disease around Avaradrano, Antananarivo, 2 months earlier.

"The situation of RVF in Madagascar is very serious because the
2-month delay in disease reporting may have facilitated the spread of
the disease and the consequent confirmation of several human cases
and deaths. This could indicate that the infection is well
established in animals in this new epidemic," the experts warned in
the latest issue of the emergency prevention system (EMPRES) report
by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) [see further in the
commentary.- Mod.AS].

Analysts said the alarm by NASA and OIE would come handy for Kenya;
[from Dec 2006 to May 2007] the country [was] hit hard by an outbreak
of the disease that left more than 155 people killed and more than
700 infected. North Eastern province bore the brunt of the attack
with 333 cases of infections reported, closely followed by Rift
Valley province with 141 cases while Coast and Central provinces
recorded 14 and 13 incidents respectively.

Huge damage was also afflicted on the livestock industry where about
4000 animals were lost prompting the State to slap a ban on livestock
movements. Most consumers stopped eating livestock products, pushing
thousands of dealers and suppliers out of business.

According to EMPRES, the Health Ministry in Madagascar had already
reported 17 human deaths and 418 suspected infections as at mid April
[2008] in areas around Alaotra, Mangoro, Analamanga, Itasy,
Vakinakaratra and Anosy. The WHO has so far confirmed 59 cases of RVF
[in humans] through laboratory tests.

Experts are now warning that the situation in Madagascar poses a
direct threat to neighbouring nations such as Kenya, especially
because surrounding regions in Central Africa are anticipated to
witness an increase in precipitation above normal rains in the next
few months -- a condition that suits the spread of the disease.

"Considering that RVF outbreaks were reported in Kenya, Tanzania and
Sudan in 2007, and South Africa is currently experiencing an outbreak
of RVF, disease surveillance should be heightened and preparedness
plans put in place throughout the Eastern part of the African
continent. RVF surveillance efforts should be pursued in non-affected
areas since the disease can still spread," the report said.

A veterinary expert, Joseph Musaa, said unpredictable weather
patterns in the country offered a room for the re-emergence of the
disease and urged surveillance in main risk areas. "It is not that we
were only hit the other day so we are safe, the dangers of another
attack are alive because the effects of climate change are alive and
playing out," he told Business Daily.

Analysts said RVF is an arthropod-borne viral disease of ruminants,
camels and humans and may present itself [in humans] in an
uncomplicated influenza-like illness to a hemorrhagic disease
attacking the liver and showing in ocular or neurological lesions. In
animals, the disease may be unclear in non-pregnant adults, but
outbreaks are characterised by a large number of abortions and high
neonatal mortality.

Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly the Aedes mosquito whose infected eggs can
survive through desiccation for months or years and restart
transmission after flooding.

Recommended preventive measures include, awareness campaigns,
increased disease surveillance and controlled animal movement to
prevent spread. Animal vaccination is also another strategy besides
use of mosquito
repellents and mosquito nets.
