A severe outbreak of Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection has been
identified in the South-Eastern region of Bangladesh. Infected animals
(goats) showed the typical 3Ds (discharge, diarrhea and death) signs of
PPR. The presence of PPR virus antigen in the nasal discharge and fecal
samples was identified using PPR specific monoclonal antibody-based Slide
ELISA. PPR virus specific antibody was identified in sera of recovered
animals using monoclonal-based C-ELISA.
To date more than 40 000 animals were infected and 5000 animals were either
died or were terminated or sold, hence the disease is still spreading to
the adjacent areas. However, massive movement animals from the outbreak
area during EID [The end of Ramadan festival may affect the other region
of the country.

[PPR is an acute or subacute viral disease of goats and sheep characterized
by fever, necrotic stomatitis, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. IT is also
known as pseudorinderpest of small ruminants, pest of small ruminants, goat
plague, pest of sheep and goats, and a number of other names.
The causal virus, a Morbillivirus of the family _Paramyxoviridae_, has a
particular affinity for lymphoid tissues and epithelial tissue of the GI
and upper respiratory tracts, in which it produces lesions.
PPR is prevalent in West and Central Africa and in the Middle East. - Mod.TG
