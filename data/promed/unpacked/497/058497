A deadly flesh-eating disease has spread among possums, with the
RSPCA getting an average of 2 infected animals brought in every week.

RSPCA wildlife expert Janet Gamble said the disease was found in
about one quarter of all possums brought into the refuge. "It's
pretty ugly. Their faces get eaten away, and they often go blind. We
then have to euthanize them," she said. "It's some sort of
flesh-eating bacteria, and it affects mostly brushtails and some
ringtails, although we haven't seen it in gliders." Ms Gamble said
the disease seemed to spread within the possum community much as
chlamydia did with koalas.

Initial thoughts were that the disease might have something to do
with the density of possums, especially in built-up areas. "They are
territorial, but if they keep running into each other, it adds to
stress and might effect their immunosuppression abilities," she said.
"It might even be something to do with climate."

Ms Gamble said the disease had been recorded from Sydney to
Townsville. People could be inadvertently helping to move the disease
about by trapping possums around their homes and then relocating them.

Ms Gamble said the disease was 1st noticed in 2003. "It seems like
some sort of dermatitis, and maybe they become infected when
scratched from fighting or being trapped," she said. "We're getting
over 100 a year brought in, and it's usually fatal. We've been
treating them with antibiotics, but many are too far gone and have to
be put down."

[For a photograph of a bush possum, please see:

The brushtailed possum is a distant relative of the opossum in North America.

The photograph on the reporting site made me wonder whether they have
tried treating these animals for necrotizing fasciitis. Although that
mixture of bacteria is often more a deep tissue infection, it
nevertheless seems like something that cannot be ruled out at the moment.

These are fascinating creatures, and we hope the veterinarians and
researchers will find a way treat and cure these animals. - Mod.TG]
