Several haggis products have been recalled by Macsween of Edinburgh due to "inadequate" procedures which could lead to food poisoning. The company confirmed the recall after it was discovered potential problems with practices to control _Clostridium botulinum_.

Food Standards Scotland said there was no suggestion food products may be contaminated. The watchdog described the step as "precautionary". A Food Standards Scotland spokeswoman said: "Our advice to consumers is to not eat the product and return it to the store where it was bought for a full refund."

Macsween of Edinburgh products on the list include haggis batches which have use-by dates up to and including [18 Aug 2017]. They include the traditional, gluten free and vegetarian haggis varieties. Marks & Spencer products including haggis, black pudding and white pudding have also been affected. Donald and Sons haggis and black pudding, which are stocked by Lidl, have been recalled, while all Warren and Sons haggis products are also on the list.

[Haggis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis) is a savoury pudding containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach though now often in an artificial casing instead. According to the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique: "Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour". It is believed that food similar to haggis (though not so named), perishable offal quickly cooked inside an animal's stomach, all conveniently available after a hunt, was eaten from ancient times. Although the name "hagws" or "hagese" was first used in England c. 1430, the dish came to be considered traditionally Scottish, even the national dish, as a result of Scots poet Robert Burns' poem Address to a Haggis of 1787. Haggis is traditionally served with "neeps and tatties", boiled and mashed separately, and a dram (a glass of Scotch whisky), especially as the main course of a Burns supper.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
