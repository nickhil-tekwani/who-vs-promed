Third Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Reported from Minas Gerais
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MINAS GERAIS: The Regional Directorate of Health (DRS) of Passos, in Minas
[Gerais], is investigating another case of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome]
in Sao Joao Batista do Gloria. A 40-year-old man was admitted on Thu 11 Jul
2002 to the Dona Chiquita Municipal Hospital with symptoms of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome and on the same day was transferred to Santa Casa de
Passos. The DRS collected serology specimens for sending to the Adolfo Lutz
Institute in Sao Paolo.
According to the Secretary of Health of Sao Joao Batista do Gloria,
Sebastiao da Silva Reis, the clinical condition of the patient is stable.
He is doing well, but is hospitalized under observation.
On Sat 13 Jul 2002, an administrator of a farm died after being
hospitalized with symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. This case has
not yet been confirmed.
The DRS has confirmed 2 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome already this
year. In May, a rural worker also died as a result of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. A third case, non-fatal, was confirmed in the city [of Passos?].

[Hantaviruses are transmitted through the urine and feces of wild rodents
and the principal symptoms are fever, severe headache, muscle pains and
respiratory and renal problems. Each species of hantavirus has a
distinctive rodent host. At least 3 different hantaviruses, _Juquitiba
virus_, _Ararquara virus_, and _Castelos dos Sonhos virus_, have been
associated with cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Brazil (see:
Johnson, A.l., et al., Journal of Medical Virology 59, 527-535, 1999).
Information on the identity of the viruses, and their specific rodent
hosts, responsible for these recent cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
in Minas Gerais would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
