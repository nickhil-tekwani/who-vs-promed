Since the demarcated infection zone falls under Phuentshogling City area, pig rearing is strictly prohibited; therefore, there are no pig farms around the area. All the sighted pigs are stray scavenging. Under the directives of the Department of Livestock, Rapid response teams have been activated and implementing necessary prevention and control measures in the zones (infection and protection) demarcated based on epidemiological assessments.
