[Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell):
As of today, 201 people in North Kivu & Ituri have survived #Ebola infections. We should all be grateful to the health workers, epidemiologists, safe burial teams, logisticians & all the other people working to stop this outbreak. I know I am.]

[I think it is important to express as Helen Branswell did in her tweet and the Minister of Health did in his latest report, that we are all incredibly grateful and in awe of the dedication of the Ebola fighters, an appropriate name for all the people sacrificing their own personal safety and giving of their time to stop Ebola virus before it spreads further as it keeps threatening to do. - Mod.LK]

[2] Response
- Mon 24 Dec 2018. WFP's Response to the Ebola Outbreak in DRC
[Relief Web, World Food Programme report, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/wfp-s-response-ebola-outbreak-drc-24-december-2018

Complex operating environment
-----------------------------
The context of this particular Ebola outbreak is exceptional: Beni territory in North Kivu, the epicentre of the crisis, is an active conflict zone.

At least 200 people who could be carrying the virus have not been traced by medical response teams.

What is the role of WFP?
------------------------

- WFP [World Food Programme] supports the medical response to Ebola, led by the Ministry of Health and WHO.

- Its role is twofold: 1st, to provide operational support to medical response teams through a range of logistical services; 2nd, to help contain the spread of the virus by providing food and nutrition assistance to people affected by the disease.

- Food parcels from WFP on a weekly basis ensure that those suspected of carrying Ebola, and their families, don't need to leave their homes to buy food while under medical observation.

The more suspected cases stay in one place, the less likely it is the virus will spread.

Scaling up WFP food and nutrition assistance
--------------------------------------------
As of 12 Dec 2018, WFP has reached over 86 000 people with food since August. They include "contacts" of Ebola patients, discharged patients, health-care staff, frontline personnel and those who have recovered from the virus. People who have been in contact with Ebola carriers, and who may therefore be carrying the virus, constitute 90% of the caseload. They receive maize flour, beans, vegetable oil, salt, fortified flour and special nutritional paste on a weekly basis. New lists of potential virus carriers are shared every 48 hours by the Ministry of Health.

WFP responds within 48 hours, in cooperation with distributing partner CARITAS. This helps contain the spread of the virus. At the end of November 2018, WFP, in partnership with a group of Ebola survivors, began food distribution to about 100 other Ebola survivors.

Distributions will continue each month, for a year

A total of 30 WFP national and international staff are working directly on the Ebola response and additional distribution teams are being formed and deployed to step up distributions and support WHO in Butembo town and southern Ituri province, where new cases have been reported.

WFP logistical support
----------------------
WFP expanded its warehouse capacity in Beni with the erection of 2 Mobile Storage Units (one for food and one for WHO supplies). Due to the high number of cases reported south of Beni, logistics staffs were deployed there to help WHO build a new Ebola Treatment Centre.

A new community football pitch laid out by WFP in Beni was opened on 4 Dec 2018, replacing a nearby pitch used to build an extension to an Ebola Treatment Centre.

Around 90 metric tons of various commodities are delivered per week to WFP's cooperating partner, CARITAS, using WFP trucks.

Additionally, some 140 cubic meters of cargo are dispatched weekly to WHO partners, warehouses and health centres.

Preparedness
------------
WFP is preparing to react promptly to new outbreaks in other parts of DRC, especially in urban areas.
The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, (ECHO) is funding WFP's Ebola response.

Funding
-------
The Ebola response remains underfunded and WFP is currently reviewing its requirements for the months to come. Additional funding will be required to sustain WFP's support to the Ebola response in the continued fight against the virus.

["Assisting 91.4 million people in around 83 countries each year, the World Food Programme (WFP) is the leading humanitarian organization saving lives and changing lives, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience. WFP helps the most vulnerable people strengthen their capacities to absorb, adapt, and transform in the face of shocks and long-term stressors." See http://www1.wfp.org/

This organization plays a critically important role in helping communities experiencing stress survive hard times. Funding is needed to accomplish this work, and one hopes that will come through for them. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 26 Dec 2018. DRC polls: CENI says no election in Beni, Butembo, Yumbi until March 2019
[Africa news, abridged, edited]
http://www.africanews.com/2018/12/26/drc-polls-ceni-says-no-election-in-beni-butembo-and-yumbi-cities-until-march/

Congo's electoral commission said on [Wed 26 Dec 2018] that it was delaying [Sun 30 Dec 2018] presidential and legislative elections in 3 cities until next March [2019], meaning that their votes would not be taken into account in the presidential contest.

The cities concerned are Beni and Butembo in the east, which have been dealing with an Ebola outbreak since August [2018], and Yumbi in the west, where more than 100 people were killed in ethnic violence last week.

The elections will go ahead elsewhere in the vast central African nation on [Sun 30 Dec 2018] as planned, the commission said in its statement. Final results for the presidential election will be announced on [15 Jan 2019] and the new president sworn in on [18 Jan 2019].

Explaining the delay, the CENI cited "the persistence of the Ebola epidemic that continues to dangerously strike the electoral districts of Beni, the city of Beni and the city of Butembo...as well as the terrorist threat that lingers in the region."

The CENI pushed the election date back by 7 more days last week due to delays deploying voting materials.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[This is yet another delay in the election but this time, only for 3 select cities ostensibly because of the threat of Ebola and violence. It is not clear how their votes will count if the results will be announced on 15 Jan 2019 and the new president sworn in 18 Jan 2019. While Ebola has been given as the cause for the delay, one cannot help but be suspicious because campaigning has been taking place in these cities; and Beni and Butembo, furthermore, are "known as bastions of opposition to outgoing President Joseph Kabila, who is supporting his former interior minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in the race." Therefore, the opposition districts will be excluded from participation in the election. One has to be concerned that the election will lead to instability and further unrest which may subsequently lead to movement of people and increased transmission of virus.
