Preliminary tests have cleared 6 Indonesians from North Sumatra province of
suspected bird flu, the health minister said on Thursday [3 Aug 2006].
"Investigations by the Ministry of Health lab and NAMRU-2, [released] on 2
and 3 Aug 2006 [established that] all specimens collected from the
suspected cases in Kabanjahe district came up negative," health minister
Siti Fadilah Supari told a news conference, referring to the United States
Naval Medical Research Unit based in Jakarta [NAMRU-2]. She said the
investigation showed the patients to be suffering from common [seasonal]
flu that normally affects humans.
The suspected bird flu cases were in a village about 5 km (3 miles) from
one where as many as 7 members of an extended family died from bird flu in
May 2006, triggering fears the H5N1 bird flu virus had mutated into a form
that could spread easily between people. The minister said the government
was still investigating and would carry out further tests, with final
results expected within 5-7 days. She did not mention a 7th possible case
some officials had referred to previously.
The National Commission on Avian Flu Control and Preparedness has also set
up a post in Kabanjahe district to provide services for the community
there, including compensating farmers whose poultry were culled, the
minister said. For future diagnosis of bird flu, Supari said Indonesia
would not send human samples to the World Health Organisation-authorised
laboratory in Hong Kong for confirmation, but would still send samples to
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. "WHO requires
human samples to be sent to one of WHO's 6 collaborative centres. So, we
only need to send them to CDC Atlanta as it has worked with the US NAMRU-2
lab here," she said. Indonesia currently sends samples to WHO authorised
labs both in Hong Kong and CDC Atlanta for confirmation as local tests are
not considered definitive. "We have 3 independent labs here which are
capable of detecting bird flu virus in humans," she said, referring to the
Eijkman Biomolecular Institute, the Health Ministry's National Institute of
Health Research and Development Laboratory (Badan Litbangkes) and the US
NAMRU-2. All are based in Jakarta.

A 35 year old man from Viet Nam's southern Kien Giang province has been
hospitalized after eating meat from a duck that died and then exhibiting
bird flu symptoms, local media reported on Thursday [3 Aug 2006]. The man
from Giong Rieng district was admitted to the Kien Giang General Hospital
on 30 Jul 2006 after having high temperature and respiratory failure, and
the doctors said his lung has been severely damaged, according to Youth
newspaper.
The patient's relatives said he slaughtered [butchered?] and ate a dead
duck offered by a neighbor one week before hospitalization. Three days
after eating the meat, he had high fever and took medicine at home.
Specimens from the patient are being tested for [H5N1 avian influenza virus].
To prevent bird flu infections among people, Viet Nam's National Institute
of Hygiene and Epidemiology has asked for permission from the country's
Health Ministry to test bird flu vaccines it made from monkeys' kidneys on
volunteers in late 2006, the newspaper said.
To prevent potential outbreaks of the disease among fowls and humans, Viet
Nam is intensifying surveillance, management over transport, trade and
import of poultry and related products at border gates, preparation for
sufficient supply of relevant medicines and equipment, border quarantine
activities, and enhancement of public awareness about the potential
[resurgence] of bird flu.
Viet Nam has detected 93 bird flu patients since the disease hit the
country in December 2003, the country's Health Ministry said on 1 Aug 2006,
noting that [there have been] no new human cases of infection since
mid-November 2005.

China's latest bird flu patient was discharged from hospital on Wed [2 Aug
2006] in Guangdong Province, local health authorities said. After being
treated in the Donghu Hospital for 50 days, the patient, 31, a truck driver
from Shenzhen, had recovered sufficiently to leave, the Shenzhen municipal
health department said.
On 15 Jun 2006, the Ministry of Health confirmed that the patient had
contracted the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, bringing China's total human
infections to 19. The truck driver had been to a local market where live
poultry was sold several times before developing symptoms of fever and
pneumonia on 3 Jun 2006.
He was critically ill when he got to hospital, according to Zhou Boping,
head of the hospital. Many internal organs showed signs of failure and his
lungs were severely infected by different kinds of anti-drug virus
[anti-viral drugs? drug-resistant virus?], according to Zhou. Several
treatment methods were used, including some "innovative technology", said a
source with the department.
The truck driver's condition was the most serious of all the bird-flu
patients who have recovered in China, according to the department. He has
been doing well since late June. Examinations showed the avian influenza
virus was no longer in his system by 22 Jun 2006, and by 5 Jul he was able
to breathe without the use of a respirator. Health workers will monitor his
physical condition after he leaves hospital, the department said.

[These reports describe: (1) a new suspected human case of avian influenza
virus infection in Viet Nam, which -- if confirmed by an external
WHO-designated laboratory -- will be the 1st confirmed human case in the
country since late 2005; (2) 6 patients in the North Sumatran province of
Indonesia placed under observation on account of their proximity to the
cluster of cases thought to involve transmission of infection within a
single extended family are no longer under suspicion; and finally (3) the
most recent case of avian influenza virus infection in China has been
released from habitual care after a prolonged illness of 50 days.
So far there has been no confirmation of H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection among the 144 patents still under observation in Thailand. - Mod.CP]
