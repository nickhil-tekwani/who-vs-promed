Dieback killing mango trees
---------------------------
A fungal dieback has killed off an alarming number of mango trees in the Kimberley town of Derby, Western Australia. Residents have lost trees in backyards and one commercial mango grower says nearly half of his plantation has now fallen victim.

The mango farmer said he first noticed dieback in 2005 on just 4 or 5 trees, and had it diagnosed as _Botryosphaeria_ dieback. It had since spread and this year [2016] had been horrific, with nearly 200 of his mango trees now dead. He said he had followed advice from the department of agriculture, "but all to no avail. I just can't afford it anymore, so I'm letting them die. I'd think in another 3 or 4 years they'll all be gone."

Peter Johnson, WA Department of Agriculture and Food, said it was a widespread pathogen not normally responsible for killing healthy trees. "They're very much opportunistic. If the trees become weak through stress or some other method, they start causing decline. Then it becomes a snowball effect." Making sure trees were getting enough water and nutrition was key.

[The farmer] said the unanswered question was why the trees were succumbing to dieback now, and not previous years when trees were "stressed". [It's a] mystery why Derby has suffered from dieback so severely.

[Fungal species in the family Botryosphaeriaceae and currently or previously classified as members of genus _Botryosphaeria_ are known to affect a wide variety of several hundred hosts. In woody species, they can cause fruit rots and leaf spots (such as in black rot of apple), as well as branch and stem cankers which lead to dieback and may kill the host by weakening it or even girdling the trunk.

Spores of the pathogens can be spread, for example, by plant material, contaminated orchard equipment, rain and insect activity. Infection occurs through natural openings and wounds, but usually remains latent until hosts are stressed. Disease management for woody crop species may include application of fungicides, pruning of infected limbs and orchard sanitation. However, it has been reported that control of _Botryosphaeria_ dieback is often not very effective, especially in mango.

In the report above, the possibility of emergence of new fungal strains with fungicide resistances and/or increased virulence on mango cannot be excluded. Since it is being reported that stress factors increasing tree susceptibility do not seem to have changed significantly over the years, presence of a new pathogen strain would explain the current increase of the problem in the region.
