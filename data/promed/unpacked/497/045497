Early testing suggests possible H5 avian influenza outbreak on B.C. farm
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says it is investigating
the possibility of an H5 avian influenza outbreak on a turkey farm in
British Columbia's (B.C.) Fraser Valley.

Agency spokesperson Monika Mazur says testing done at the B.C.
provincial laboratory suggests the presence of an H5 virus but more
tests are being done for confirmation at CFIA's national laboratory
in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Mazur says it's not yet known if the virus is
of a high or low pathogenic strain and further testing must be done
to determine what the virus's N or neuraminidase type is.

Mazur says the initial testing was done after turkeys on a 50 000
bird farm showed signs of respiratory distress. Several farms within
a 3-kilometre [1.8-mile] radius of the turkey producer in Abbotsford,
B.C., have been placed under the quarantine. Mazur says the CFIA is
informing the World Organization for Animal Health. Any outbreak of
avian influenza involving H5 or H7 strains must be reported to the
Paris-based organization.

The presence of H5 virus, if it is confirmed, does not mean there is
an outbreak with the H5N1 virus that has killed nearly 250 people in
parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. There are multiple subtypes of H5
avian flu. In fact, the Fraser Valley experienced an H5N2 outbreak in
November 2005.

B.C. Poultry Association spokesman Calvin Bruekelman says blood
samples from the birds at E and H Farms tested positive for avian flu
antibodies. "That doesn't necessarily mean they're diseased with it,"
Bruekelman says. "It could be that they just have antibodies in the blood."

"There's nothing to be concerned about at this point," Bruekelman
added, pointing out tests were expected back as soon as Friday [23
Jan 2009]. "Then we'll know for sure. If we need to act on it then we
we'll have to depopulate the flock." He said the quarantine was in
place simply as a precaution.

Seventeen million birds were slaughtered in the Fraser Valley in
February 2004 following an outbreak of H7N3, a different avian
influenza subtype.

[Historically, the highly pathogenic viral strains we now know as
avian influenza was once known as fowl plague. This virus infects
domestic poultry and wild birds. Avian influenza (AI) is often of low
pathogenicity when it infects domestic poultry. A Low pathogenic
avian influenza can still produce subclinical infections, respiratory
disease, or drops in egg production. Some AI viruses cause severe
systemic infections and frequently this is coupled with high
mortality. In most wild birds, AI viral infections are subclinical.

Avian influenza viruses are type A orthomyxoviruses characterized by
antigenically homologous nucleoprotein and matrix internal proteins,
which are identified by serology in agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID)
tests. AI viruses are further divided into 15 hemagglutinin (H1-15)
and 9 neuraminidase (N1-9) subtypes based on hemagglutinin inhibition
and neuraminidase inhibition tests, respectively. Most AI viruses
(H1-15 subtypes) are of LP, but some of the H5 and H7 AI viruses are
HP for chickens, turkeys, and related gallinaceous domestic poultry.
