[The VOV reporter interviewed Viet Nam's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Cao Duc Phat, on the issue of Viet Nam's preparedness for possible introduction of A/H7N9 from China. The last question addressed H5N1].

Q: Apart from the risk of A/H7N9 flu, the Central and Central Highland provinces of our country currently have an A/H5N1 influenza outbreak. What can the minister recommend to the people in this respect?

Minister Cao Duc Phat: During this time, the influenza A/H5N1 is on the drive [upswing]. The prevention of this virus has been ascribed to the local authorities who are directed to coordinate the implementation of the relevant regulations. Special attention should be paid to the organization of surveillance activities to detect outbreaks promptly and to handle them thoroughly. In particular, we conduct vaccination in accordance with the provisions of the veterinary authority. Regarding the ongoing outbreak, we suggest that farmers comply with recommendations of the veterinary surgeons concerning disinfection measures to prevent the spread of the virus to poultry. In particular, be wary of the virus capacity to infect humans.

[Viet Nam has submitted its follow-up report no 4 on the recent epizootic on Thu 13 Feb 2014. The current epizootic reportedly started in October 2013 and has caused, so far, 11 outbreaks, including the 6 new outbreaks covered in the current report, which are located in 6 separate provinces distributed throughout the country, from north to south (Nam Dinh, Khanh Hoa, Tay Ninh, Quang Ngai, Ca Mau, and Kon Tum).

The report does not specify the species affected (that is, chickens, ducks, geese, etc.).

According to the report above, Viet Nam's applied control measures are: stamping out, movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).

Viet Nam is known to be infected by HPAI H5N1 since 2003. Its last major epizootic reportedly started in December 2006, with 360 outbreaks reported to the OIE throughout the years 2007-2012. Several outbreaks have been reported since. In September 2012, the Vietnamese noted the spread in the north of a new, extremely pathogenic strain of the H5N1 virus, suspected to have originated in China (see ProMED-mail posts 20120908.1286497, 20120910.1288966, and 20120920.1300398).

Since 2003, Viet Nam has reported 126 human cases of avian influenza H5N1, of which 63 died. Of the 126, a total of 112 were recorded in the year 2003. Since that time, there have only been sporadic human cases of H5N1 virus infection in Viet Nam. As noted by Mod.CP (in ProMED-mail post 20140201.2248635) "...therefore, it is too early to conclude that the human case in 2014 is the harbinger of a new outbreak."
