Researchers are intensifying efforts to stop a fungus from consuming
over 80 percent of the global wheat produce in the face of biting
shortages and soaring prices in the international market. Under the
Global Rust Initiative (GRI) scientists are seeking new ways to
eradicate the new wheat stem rust strain Ug99, so called because it
was discovered in neighbouring Uganda in 1999. The fungal disease
also threatens barley and has crossed the Red Sea towards Yemen. If
not checked, it will be soon afflicting wheat fields in Egypt, the
Middle East, and Asia.

[US Department of Agriculture] Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
plant pathologist Yue Jin confirmed that a new variant of Ug99 that
has been found in Kenya has shown more virulence towards existing
genetic resistance traits, putting more wheat fields in danger. "It
could broaden the disease's reach to beyond the 80 percent of the
world's wheat that is at risk," said lead researcher Rick Ward of the
International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre (CIMMYT).

Previous field studies in Kenya and Ethiopia showed that Ug99 has
overcome most of the known stem rust resistance genes deployed in
wheat cultivars over the years.

Stem rust is the worst of 3 fungal rust diseases that infect wheat.
It infests straws so that nutrients cannot reach the grains. Powdery,
reddish-orange spores form on infected plants.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. It occurs worldwide throughout wheat producing areas.
Symptoms are dark orange pustules on the stems and also on the
leaves. Stems can be completely girdled by the pustules damaging the
conducting tissue and preventing grain fill. Yield losses of up to 70
percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. If stem
rust arrives early in the growing cycle, losses are higher. The
fungus is spread by wind and with infected straw.

New pathogen races are emerging with increased virulence against
genes previously used for resistance breeding. Considered most
dangerous at present is strain Ug99, which was 1st reported in Uganda
in 1999. Recurring epidemics in Kenya and then Ethiopia followed and
it has recently spread to Yemen. It may also be present in Pakistan,
Sudan, and Tanzania and appears to be moving on prevailing winds.

Ug99 can infect and cause disease in many commonly grown stem rust
"resistant" wheat lines. In much of the world, resistance to stem
rust in wheat is based at least in part on the gene Sr31. High levels
of stem rust infection were observed in Uganda on wheat lines
containing the Sr31, Lr26, and Yr9 genes for rust resistance, and
Ug99 was identified as a new strain with virulence to Sr31.

From the report above it appears that an even more virulent variant
of Ug99 able to overcome additional resistance genes has emerged in
Kenya. This increases the threat posed by Ug99 to global wheat
production further. International screening programmes for germplasm
with resistance to the new strains are being set up under the GRI.

The other 2 rust diseases of wheat mentioned above are leaf rust
caused by _Puccinia triticina_, and stripe rust caused by _P.
striiformis_.
