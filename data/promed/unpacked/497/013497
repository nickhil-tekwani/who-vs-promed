Introduction. Gonorrhoea is the 2nd most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI), after chlamydia. Untreated gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women and epididymitis and orchitis in men. In the European Union/European Economic Area countries, a total of 89 239 confirmed cases of gonorrhoea were reported in 2017 with an overall rate of 22.2 cases per 100 000 population [1]. This represented a 17% increase over the previous year [2016], which was particularly striking in certain groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), who represented almost half of the cases in 2017, and the 25-34-year-old population [1].

In Spain, 8722 cases of gonococcal infection were reported in 2017 (rate: 18.74 per 100 000 inhabitants), with a very wide range of infection incidence among the different regions of the country, from 2.44 and 48.50 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. The highest rates were registered in Catalonia (48.50), Balearic Islands (41.79) and Madrid (28.48) [2]. Of the 3622 cases reported in Catalonia in 2017, men accounted for 82% of the diagnoses. Data from 1136 patients (31%) could be collected: 44% were MSM followed by heterosexual men (22%) and women (20%) [3].

_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the bacterial species responsible for gonorrhoea, has developed resistance to the different families of antibiotics used in the past, challenging future treatment. Currently, extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) are the last-line treatment option for _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection. Unfortunately, strains showing resistance to ESC have been reported worldwide [4-6]. In 2017, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reported a resistance rate to cefixime of 1.9% within the European Union/European Economic Area countries and no isolates showing resistance to ceftriaxone [7]. The resistance rate to azithromycin was 7.5%; and high-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than or equal to 256 mg/L) was detected in 7 isolates [7].

This pathogen has moreover been able to acquire or develop nearly all known mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance: target modification, inactivation of the antimicrobial by enzymatic means, decreased influx of antimicrobials, and increased efflux of antimicrobials [8]. This situation highlights the importance of carrying out resistance monitoring programmes, in order to update therapeutic guidelines and to timely detect the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains.

Nowadays, most of the treatment guidelines recommend dual antimicrobial therapy (500 mg intramuscular ceftriaxone + 1 g or 2 g oral azithromycin) [9-12]. The rationale for gonococcal combination therapy using different antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action is to potentially mitigate the spread of antimicrobial resistance [13]. Combination therapy has been reported as possibly related to the decline in prevalence of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (DSC), defined as a MIC greater than 0.032 mg/L [14,15].

The aim of this study is to describe antimicrobial susceptibility of _N. gonorrhoeae_ in isolates collected between 2013 and 2017 in Barcelona, Spain.

Results. Between 2013 and 2017, 2054 strains were isolated from 1979 patients. Eighteen strains were excluded because, in 16 patients, _N. gonorrhoeae_ was recovered from 2 different body sites, and in one patient, gonococcus was recovered from 3 different sites. In the end, susceptibility testing was performed on 2036 _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains isolated from 1979 patients, because 47 patients presented 2 different episodes and 5 patients presented 3 episodes during the study period.

Of the 1979 patients included, 1888 (95.4%) were from men. 1292 (65.3%) were tended in the Drassanes-Vall d'Hebron Sexually Transmitted Infections Unit. Furthermore, 573 patients (29.0%) presented in primary healthcare units and 114 (5.8%) in other medical departments of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital. For 1555 patients with data on age available, the median age was 32 years, and 1173 (75.4%) were between 20 and 40 years old. A total of 1598 (78.5%) of the 2036 isolates studied were from urethral samples, and 1888 (95.4%) patients were men (Table 1).

Most of the isolates (69.6%; 1380/1982) showed a ceftriaxone MIC less than or equal to 0.016 mg/L. The percentage of ceftriaxone resistant isolates (defined as MIC greater than 0.125 mg/L) appeared to decrease from 0.6% (2/324) in 2013 and 2014 to 0.2% (1/408) in 2016 (p = 0.4637). No isolates resistant to ceftriaxone were found either in 2015 or 2017. The average prevalence of decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (DSC [decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone]; 0.032 - 0.125 mg/L) throughout the study period was 15.8% (314/1982), seemingly declining from 2013 to 2015 (from 24.1% (78/324) to 7.4% (25/339)) but in 2016 and 2017 the proportions of isolates with DSC returned to higher levels, 19.1% (78/408) and 14.3% (82/572), respectively.

The average percentage of isolates with cefixime resistance (MIC greater than 0.125 mg/L) at 4.9% was higher than the average percentage with ceftriaxone resistance at 0.3% (Table 2). Despite this, cefixime resistance rate decreased from 8.3% (27/327) in 2013 to 4.4% (25/572) in 2017 (p = 0.0073). For both ESC [extended-spectrum cephalosporins], the proportion of isolates with MIC less than or equal to 0.016 mg/L appeared to increase from 2013 to 2015, from 35.2% (115/327) to 78.5% (266/339) for cefixime and from 61.1% (198/324) to 82.3% (279/339) for ceftriaxone (Figure).

For azithromycin, most of isolates (54.6%; 1082/1981) showed MIC between 0.094 and 0.19 mg/L. Annual MIC50 and MIC90 values remain the same during the study period, 0.125 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Nevertheless, the proportion of resistant isolates, according to the EUCAST breakpoint (ECOFF greater than 1mg/L) seemed to increase slightly from 1.5% (5/340) in 2014 to 3.0% (17/572) in 2017 (p = 0.5295). A total of 16 strains showed high-level azithromycin-resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 256mg/L): 7 in 2016 and 9 in 2017. These 16 strains accounted for almost 1/3 (16/52) of all azithromycin-resistant strains. No high-level azithromycin-resistant gonococcal isolates were found from 2013 to 2015.

However, the proportion of isolates showing both DSC and azithromycin resistance appeared to decrease from 1.5% (5/329) in 2013 to 0.3% (2/581) in 2017.

The prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin was 51.3% and 20.1%, respectively (Table 2). For penicillin, the resistance rate presented a statistically significant decline over the study years (p = 0.0000), from 28.1% (92/327) in 2013 to 12.2% (70/572) in 2017. In addition, 14.7% (300/2036) of isolates were penicillase-producing _N. gonorrhoeae_ (PPNG). For ciprofloxacin, the resistance rate fluctuated between 48.8 and 56.8% during the study period, with no clear trend. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin (Table 2). The MIC50 and MIC90 values for gentamicin were 4 and 6 mg/L, while for fosfomycin these were 12 and 24 mg/L, respectively (Table 2).

In conclusion, we analysed the susceptibility of 2036 isolates in Barcelona from 2013 to 2017. We were able to observe that susceptibility to ceftriaxone remains high, and resistance has decreased since dual therapy was implemented in 2012. However, azithromycin resistance increased during the study period, and high-level azithromycin-resistant strains were isolated for the 1st time in 2016.

Our study highlights the need to monitor antibiotic susceptibility and to perform molecular typing studies at a national level, which would allow identifying temporal and geographical changes, to detect the emergence and dissemination of new strains, and to maintain therapeutic guidelines updated.

[The above journal article reports the antibiotic susceptibility of 2036 isolates of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the cause of gonorrhea, in Barcelona, Spain, from 2013 to 2017. The susceptibility to ceftriaxone remained high and resistance decreased since ceftriaxone/azithromycin combination therapy was started in 2012. However, azithromycin resistance increased during the study period, and high-level azithromycin-resistant strains were isolated for the 1st time in 2016.

Barcelona, with a population of 5.6 million people, of whom about 30% (1.6 million) live in the city of Barcelona, is a province in the center of the autonomous community of Catalonia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Barcelona).

The journal article above reports that the highest rates in Spain for gonorrhea in 2017 were in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands in 2017. ProMED-mail posted in 2019 a report of 2 cases of gonococcal infection in heterosexual UK females due to ceftriaxone-resistant isolates (MIC 1.0 mg/L) that were intermediately susceptibility to azithromycin (MIC 0.5 mg/L) thought to have been acquired from men who had been in the Balearic Islands (Ibiza) in 2018 (Gonococcal disease - UK: antibiotic resistance, ceftriaxone/azithromycin 20190109.6250560 and Gonococcal disease - UK (02): MDR, ceftriaxone/azithro, ex Spain susp, WHO, 2018 20190206.6299471). Both isolates were also resistant to cefixime, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline, but susceptible to spectinomycin. That report said no _N. gonorrhoeae_ strain had been isolated in Ibiza with the same resistance pattern as these 2 UK isolates.

Ibiza is the 3rd largest of the Balearic Islands, 185 km [115 mi] from Spain's Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza). The autonomous community of Valencia is on the southern border of Catalonia.
