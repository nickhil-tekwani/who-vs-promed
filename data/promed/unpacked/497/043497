[Though this official report to OIE claims that their previous outbreak was
in 1995, there has been a regular recurrence since 2005; previous years
were erratically reported.

Currently, they are usually sporadic multi-species outbreaks involving
cattle, sheep and goats, horses, even pigs. In 2002, there were 5 human
cases, 2003 (2), 2004 (no record), 2005 (5 and one death), 2006 (0), 2007
(disease present, number of outbreaks not recorded), 2008 (29 and 3
deaths), and in 2009 (disease present, number of outbreaks not recorded).
What they mean by "sub-clinical" infection is difficult to interpret, but
it looks rather like newly introduced unvaccinated sheep coming down. - Mod.MHJ
