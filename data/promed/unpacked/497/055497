[Dr. Gregor Caspari has sent the following response to Joyce Oliver's
request for information posted as: Hepatitis B virus, blood transfusion,
2000 - Japan: RFI 20030823.2131]
There is no specific reason why a donor who has a virus load so low it
slipped through the nucleic acid amplification tests is a priori more
likely to be a chronically infected individual rather than someone in the
window period of infection. Just after the infectious event, the virus
load is zero. It will then increase passing a range of concentrations below
the detection limit of the NAT. The time during which virus is present in
the blood or plasma but is not detectable with NAT early during infection
depends upon the kinetics of the virus multiplication and the detection
limit of the NAT and is extremely difficult to determine. The attainable
detection limit of NAT in blood transfusion services is limited by the fact
that blood transfusion services tend to perform (and regulatory authorities
up to now only require) NAT of pooled samples in order to make NAT testing
affordable.
To my knowledge, anti-HBc testing is obligatory for every single blood
donation in Japan and several other countries. First introduced to
recognize individuals at elevated risk for HIV in the mid-1980s, this test
soon became a surrogate marker for hepatitis C virus infection as well. As
sensitive and specific tests have been introduced into the blood
transfusion system for both viruses, continued routine use of anti-HBc
testing is now being justified for its possible effect on prevention of a
few hepatitis B virus infections.
Germany has not introduced anti-HBc testing as yet, mainly because early
studies demonstrated the variability of results obtained with different
test kits for the same donor (1, 2). The low specificity of the test is
confirmed by the fact that in states where all donors with specific
anti-HBc (i.e., former hepatitis B virus infection) have been screened out
years ago, the positivity rate for anti-HBc remains in the range of one
percent. This is either a high rate of non-specificity or an unfavorable
donor epidemiology. Quality and comparability of tests may have improved
since the original studies were performed, but I am not aware of medium- or
large-scale studies to answer this question.
According to US estimates, 50 000 donations and possible long-term donors
have to be sacrificed in order to detect one anti-HBc-positive donation
with a low level of hepatitis B virus DNA. The authors of that study
carefully avoided any possible link to infectiousness of the blood.
Therefore the net benefit of anti-HBc testing with respect to prevention of
infection and disease in the recipient is almost completely unknown if both
hepatitis B virus NAT and anti-HBc testing are performed. The net effect
may depend upon background prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection, which
is higher in countries with high background prevalence and very low in
countries with a very low background incidence of hepatitis B virus infection.
