Technical Note: Treatment of cases of human rabies in Floresta Pernambuco
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 14 Oct 2008, the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance (DES),
Department of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health (MOH), through
the state Department of Health of Pernambuco, was notified of a
suspected case of human rabies from the municipality of Floresta. The
epidemiological investigation was initiated by Epidemiological
Surveillance of the city, together with the Pernambuco Department of Health.

This [case] is a boy of 15 years, with report of aggressive attack by
a hematophagous bat and the initiation of symptoms on 6 Oct 2008, who
was then transferred to the University Hospital Osvaldo Cruz of the
University of Pernambucoon 10 Oct 2008. The patient received 4 doses
of vaccine against rabies before the start of symptoms [the USA CDC
ecommends 5 doses of vaccine post-exposure. - Mod.TY]. The incubation
period was approximately 29 days.

A hair follicle biopsy of the region of the nape of the neck was
submitted for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), nested PCR and genetic sequencing, carried out by the
Pasteur Institute-SP Laboratory. On 22 Oct 2008, the tests were
positive for rabies [virus], which was identified as a variant
compatible with [rabies virus] isolates from _Desmodus rotundus_
[vampire] bats.

The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on 11 Oct
[2008], and on 13 Oct [2008] was intubated and the Milwaukee
treatment protocol was initiated, which was used in a patient with
rabies in 2004 in the United States. On 30 Oct [2008], he was brought
out of the induced coma and today [11 Nov 2008] the patient is
unsedated and is clinically stable.

Specific tests for titration of enzymes, which will be processed in
the United States, will be provided to the DES/MOH and medicines not
available in Brazil will be imported.

The successful outcome of this patient, as well as the cure observed
in the patient in the United States, opens rather promising prospects
[for treatment of] this disease, which so far is considered to have a
case fatality rate of 100 percent. In facing this possibility, the
DES / MOH will prepare a treatment protocol to be used in other cases
of human rabies in Brazil.

[Survival in children who received treatment with [rabies-immune]
serum or immunoglobulin before the onset of symptoms is well
recognized. There are several (not many) cases reported in the literature.

The factors that lead to survival are not well known, however,
passive and active immunization, above a certain age seem to be
important determinants.

As far as I know, this is the 1st documented case [of rabies
survival] in Brazil. Rabies should still be considered a uniformly
fatal disease, and a few cases in among thousands [of fatalities]
does not mean that the disease can be cured. - Mod.LJS]

[The physicians who implemented the Milwaukee rabies treatment
protocol that was successful in the case of the 15-year-old girl
indicated that induction of coma and control of cerebral edema and
generalized cerebral artery spasm were critical elements in the
patient's survival. Survival was prolonged enough for the patient to
develop high-titered antirabies antibody in both blood and CSF (see
ProMED archives listed below). The above report does not provide
enough details about the treatment to know how closely the Milwaukee
protocol was followed.
