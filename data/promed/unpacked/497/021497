Highly pathogenic avian influenza suspected in Belgium ruled out
----------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 18 March 2003 from Dr Luc Lengel√©, chief veterinary
officer, Animal Health and Animal Products Department, Federal State
Service for Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, Brussels:
To date the laboratory tests have not succeeded in demonstrating the
involvement of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus in the
clinical problems in the broilers. Furthermore, taking into account the
favorable evolution of the clinical signs, which is not consistent with
avian influenza, it is already possible to rule out with high certainty an
outbreak of HPAI.
According to OIE and European Union standards, however, the result of the
passage onto a new series of embryonated eggs has to be awaited to
officially catalogue the result of the virus isolation as negative. The
measures provided for in the European Commission Decision 2003/173/EC will
be withdrawn from 19 March at 00:01 hour. This means that the nationwide
transport ban for live poultry and hatching eggs can be lifted.
Further details will be published in the next issue of Weekly Disease
Information, available on line as from Friday 21 March 2003 afternoon (GMT).

[It appears as if recent caution about assuming avian influenza was the
cause of the epidemic now seems to be warranted (reference below). It is
important to remember when disease control officials are looking for a
disease with heightened awareness, many candidates will appear and they
must all be investigated. Sometimes such a candidate situation will turn
out to be spread of the disease and sometimes it won't. This time it
didn't. However, any assumptions of what may happen in the future as
regards cross border spread of the disease should also be approached
cautiously. In an epidemic with a high potential for spread, no one can
predict the future. The best policy is good surveillance and using only
good information for the basis for disease control. The Belgian authorities
are to be congratulated for timely and transparent disease reporting. - Mod.PC]
