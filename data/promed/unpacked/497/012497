The Florida Veterinary Medical Association (FVMA) has sent an alert about a canine influenza outbreak in Palm Beach. The initial number exceeds 60 reported from a shelter, and other pets are being diagnosed. This news is a concern for Central Florida because canine influenza (CI), or dog flu, is a highly contagious viral infection affecting dogs and also cats. There are 2 strains of canine influenza virus: H3N8 and H3N2. This outbreak is caused by H3N2, the same strain that attacked Central Florida in 2017-2018.

Influenza viruses are dangerous because they can morph and evolve to infect different species. H3N2 is known to infect cats and ferrets, but thankfully not humans.

Canine influenza is transmitted through droplets or particles aerosolized from coughing, barking, and sneezing. Dogs in kennels, at groomers or daycare facilities, or rescued from shelters are at increased risk. Canine influenza can also be spread indirectly through contact with virus particles left on objects in kennels, food and water bowls, collars, and leashes. People who have been in contact with infected dogs can also pass it to healthy ones. Therefore, disinfection and limited contact are paramount to contain this outbreak. Just as with the COVID-19 pandemic, [practicing] basic hygiene, limiting contact, and seeking veterinary vaccines to prevent the disease is the best plan of attack.

The virus can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 48 hours, on clothing for 24 hours, and on hands for 12 hours. It is important to implement washing of hands, changing clothes, and disinfecting shoes after being in contact with an infected dog.

The incubation period for H3N2 is quick! Dogs may start showing respiratory signs between 2 and 8 days after infection. Dogs are most contagious during the incubation period and shed the virus even though they are not showing clinical signs of illness.

All dogs exposed to canine influenza virus will become infected, with approximately 80% developing clinical signs of disease and 20% being asymptomatic. Of those showing signs, 80-90% will recover within 2 weeks with antibiotics and supportive care, but approximately 15-20% might become severely ill and develop fatal pneumonia.

Signs include a soft, moist cough, nasal and/or ocular discharge, sneezing, lethargy, and anorexia. Many dogs develop a purulent nasal discharge and fever (104-105 deg F [40-40.6 deg C]). The nasal discharge is usually caused by secondary bacterial infections.

Tests are available to diagnose and identify strains of the canine influenza virus. We send PCR tests for the diagnosis of canine influenza and recommend treating at home with antibiotics, immune system boosters, and food therapy. If your pet develops pneumonia, then hospitalization at a 24-hour facility is indicated.

This is a preventable disease; there is a vaccine available against both strains of this highly contagious virus. Stay away from crowded places where multiple dogs gather like daycare facilities, dog parks, and dog-friendly events. Do not let your dog drink from common dog water bowls. Please contact your veterinarian and protect your pets against the dog flu.

["The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been recognized in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, the H3N8 influenza virus or 'flu' appears to have 'jumped' from horses to dogs. The virus had mutated into a form known as canine influenza virus (CIV) that is highly infective for dogs. At 1st, veterinarians thought the H3N8 canine flu would be quite lethal. Fortunately, like the human flu virus, it kills very few healthy individuals. Since its detection in 2004, H3N8 canine influenza has been detected in most states. The disease was discovered by Dr. Cynda Crawford from the University of Florida, and she estimated that the H3N8 strain kills between 1% and 5% of dogs that contract it, with most of the deaths being in dogs that have serious concurrent illnesses. That's nothing to sneeze at. The 1918 Spanish flu had a mortality rate of only 2%.

"In March of 2015, a new strain of influenza in the United States was identified (H3N2) in Chicago during an outbreak of respiratory illness. Prior to this, the H3N2 strain of canine influenza had only been identified in Asia after jumping from birds to dogs. After its initial detection, cases of H3N2 influenza were reported in many states and a few provinces in Canada. The strain was even detected in a group of shelter cats that were exposed to infected dogs. A more recent outbreak was reported by the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in May 2017. By mid-June [2017], H3N2 infections had been reported in many other states, including the Carolinas, Texas, and Illinois. The severity of H3N2 may be greater than other respiratory infections, especially in those dogs with higher risk of infection. Similar to H3N8 infection, the risk of mortality with H3N2 infection is low.

"Currently, there are approved CIV vaccines in the United States and Canada. Vaccination against canine flu should be considered for any at-risk breed, dogs with heart or respiratory conditions, dogs that travel or show, and those that have extensive contact with other dogs (e.g., those that are boarded).

"The symptoms of canine influenza are similar to the human flu: cough, runny nose, and fever. The most common clinical sign associated with canine influenza is a cough that does not respond to antibiotic or cough suppressant therapy and lasts 10-21 days. This cough may be productive ('moist') or non-productive ('dry'), and it may be associated with reduced appetite and lethargy. The majority of dogs infected with canine influenza will display mild clinical signs. Dogs infected with the H3N2 strain of canine influenza appear to be at greater risk of developing more severe clinical signs.

"The CI virus is virtually identical to other respiratory infections such as kennel cough. In fact, many cases of CIV may be mistaken as kennel cough or other infections in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex because of these similarities. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing canine influenza from CIRD, any dog with these clinical signs should be seen by a veterinarian.

"Older dogs and dogs with heart and respiratory conditions are at particular risk for CIV. Dogs with short, flat faces (brachycephalic breeds), such as Boston terriers, boxers, pekingese, pugs, and shih tzus, are also at higher risk."

"Due to its similarities to other respiratory infections, canine influenza cannot be diagnosed on clinical signs alone. If a veterinarian sees a dog within the 1st few days of the onset of clinical signs, a nasal swab for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic lab. If the PCR test is positive, the dog most likely has CIV. After 4 days of illness, PCR results are less likely to be accurate (there may be false-negative results). At this stage, blood testing for CIV antibodies should be performed. This type of testing, called serology, involves comparing antibody levels 2-3 weeks apart. If antibody levels rise significantly over this period, it indicates active CIV infection. Your veterinarian may also wish to run other diagnostics such as blood work and radiographs to assess the severity of infection.

"Any dog suspected of having the CIV should be tested to determine if the disease is spreading in your area. If there are confirmed canine influenza virus cases in your area, consult with your veterinarian and consider vaccinating your dog."

"It is important to note that the CIV vaccine cannot completely prevent the disease. It may, however, reduce the severity and duration of clinical signs associated with infection. This is especially important in at-risk dogs and to help reduce the spread of outbreaks.

"Talk to your veterinarian to determine if vaccinating against canine influenza is right for your dog.

"As with nearly all viral infections, treatment is largely supportive. It is important that your pet be kept in a warm, dry area away from other dogs, fed a high-quality diet, and kept well hydrated during illness. Good nutrition and husbandry are crucial in ensuring that dogs mount an adequate immune response and can help promote faster recovery. Dogs affected with a mild form of canine influenza will often develop a secondary bacterial upper respiratory infection. These dogs typically have a thick green mucous discharge from their nose and benefit from broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Dogs that develop pneumonia may require hospitalization, intravenous fluids and medications, and potent broad-spectrum antibiotics. Most dogs fully recover from canine influenza within 2-3 weeks. It is important to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment. Dogs exposed to the virus should be isolated for 4 weeks to prevent further spread.

"Virtually 100% of dogs exposed to CIV will become infected. For this reason, it is important that owners of dogs diagnosed with the virus keep them away from other dogs. This includes trips to the groomer or dog parks and contact with other dogs during walks and in kennels. Clothing, equipment, floors, and hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and water after contact with any dog with signs of respiratory illness."

This is Florida's 2nd outbreak in about 6 weeks. Owners should heed the warning and get their pets vaccinated. Activities such as play dates, groomers, dog parks, and vacations with other dogs around make it critical for the owner to get their dog vaccinated. Prevention is much easier on the pet, the pet parent, and the finances of the pet parent. - Mod.TG
