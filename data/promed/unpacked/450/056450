A patient with a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was
sent by health officials to the Luis Chicho Fabrega regional hospital
in Veraguas [province]. The patient is a resident of the Bahia Honda
community [in Los Santos province] on the south coast district of
Sona.

Humberto Torres, regional director of the Ministry of Health (MINSA)
in Veraguas, explained that the patient was transferred so far away
from that sector due to the similarity of symptoms with [a]
hantavirus [infection] and for the protection of the patient, who
must receive special treatment in order to prevent complications.

Torres went on to inform that while the patient is not currently
hospitalized, he is undergoing treatment and samples were taken and
sent to the Gorgas Memorial Institute so that the competent health
authorities can confirm or rule out [a] hantavirus [infection].

Although not stated in this report, in Panama, the hantavirus most
likely to be the etiological agent in this case is Choclo virus. As
mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses
(and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo
(_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens
(costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda
(cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human
pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
