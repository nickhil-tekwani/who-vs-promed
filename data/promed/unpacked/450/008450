In the wake of an especially prevalent and deadly year for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus, National Institutes of Health officials say the mosquito-borne illness poses an "emergent threat" and are calling for a national strategy to address it and other emerging arboviruses [arthropod-borne viruses].

As of [3 Dec 2019], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 37 confirmed human cases of EEE this year in 9 US states, resulting in 15 deaths. Of these cases, 4 were in Connecticut, 3 of which were fatal.

The unusual outbreak in Connecticut prompted statewide calls in the early fall to take precautions and curb evening activities, with several municipalities canceling or rescheduling outdoor activities, as well as conducting extra mosquito spraying.

One infected mosquito was discovered in South Windsor.

According to the NIH, the virus is transmitted primarily between the _Culiseta melanura_ mosquito and birds in freshwater swamps. Occasionally, the mosquito transmits the virus to people and other mammals, such as horses. [Other mosquito species serve as bridge vectors as well, feeding on infected birds and then carrying the virus to areas outside swamps where they feed on horses and humans. - Mod.TY]

In people, the virus takes between 3 and 10 days to cause symptoms, which include fever, malaise, intense headache, muscle aches, nausea, and vomiting.

According to the NIH, 96 percent of infected people don't develop symptoms. Of those who do develop symptoms, however, 1/3 or more die and those who survive frequently suffer permanent and severe neurologic damage.

Though outbreaks of the virus have previously been "infrequent and focal," NIH officials wrote in a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine that the spike of cases in 2019 and the "looming presence" of other "potentially deadly" arboviruses -- a virus transmitted to a human by a mosquito, tick, or other arthropod -- call for a "national defense strategy."

Officials say that although the best way to address these viruses isn't entirely clear, they say that to "ignore them completely and do nothing would be irresponsible."

According to the CDC, there is no approved human vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for EEE. NIH officials say that many compounds are being assessed in the effort to find a safe and effective antiviral drug for EEE, adding that "monoclonal antibodies" have been found effective in an "experimental animal model," but only when given prior to infection.

The officials say that several vaccine candidates are in development but caution they may have trouble reaching advanced development and approval, owing to the "rare, brief, and focal" nature of EEE outbreaks, which make it difficult to identify an appropriate target population for vaccination.

Currently, the officials note, EEE patients are treated with supportive care, usually consisting of intensive care in a hospital and ventilator assistance. They add that social support for patients and their families is "vitally important given the seriousness of the disease."

Absent effective vaccines and treatments, officials say that state and local agencies play a critical role in providing an early warning system by surveilling horses, birds, and mosquitoes, but adding that such efforts are "threatened by insufficient funding."

Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Director Theodore Andreadis and a colleague authored an article in 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine about the threat posed by EEE.

Andreadis said there's no way to prevent the virus from occurring in Connecticut, but said his office is taking measures to prepare for next year [2020].

He said the station would continue to conduct its "very comprehensive" mosquito trapping and testing program, which he said is the state's "best line of defense" against EEE at this point.

"We have a good program," he said. "We have one of the finest programs in the Northeast, if not the whole country."

The program, which captures between 200 000 and 300 000 mosquitoes at 92 sites around the state each year, runs from the beginning of June through the end of October, and screens for 7 viruses, including EEE and West Nile virus.

Seeking to add 15 new trapping sites in parts of southeastern Connecticut where EEE was newly detected in 2019, Andreadis said his office has asked Gov. Ned Lamont for USD 150 000 to supplement the USD 500 000 his office currently receives to run the program. If the funding is provided, Andreadis said he thinks his office will be able to detect the virus early enough.

Andreadis said his office would be studying the virus over the winter, conducting genetic sequencing to see if the virus present in the state is a single strain or multiple strains. That will help Andreadis and his colleagues tell if the virus has been "overwintering" here, or if it was newly introduced this year [2019].

Andreadis said his office plans to collaborate with neighboring states on their research, including Massachusetts, which had 12 people infected with the virus in 2019.

Though he said it's hard to predict what will happen next year [2020], Andreadis hypothesizes that there won't be as much EEE activity. He suggested that's because there were high numbers of birds exposed to the virus and, rather than dying from EEE, birds develop immunity to it. "If the bird population is immune, it will dampen the transmission cycle," he said.

Other emerging arboviruses Andreadis and his colleagues are keeping a close watch on in Connecticut include t2wo mosquito-borne viruses, the La Crosse and Jamestown Canyon viruses, and a tick-borne virus, the Powassan virus.

According to the state Department of Public Health, 5 residents were infected with Powassan in 2019, one of whom died. [Powassan is a tick-transmitted flavivirus that is unrelated to EEE virus. - Mod.TY]

[EEE virus transmission has ended for the season in those states that have had killing frosts that bring mosquito activity to a halt. It is unlikely that additional human or equine EEE cases will occur in 2019, with the possible exception of Florida. As mentioned above, in a series of ProMED-mail posts and by the CDC, 2019 has indeed been an active year for EEEV transmission with cases in humans and in horses. The CDC EEE web page (https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/index.html) states, "As of 19 Nov 2019, CDC has received reports of 36 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis virus disease for this year [2019], including 14 deaths. Cases have been reported from the following 8 states: Connecticut (4), Indiana (1), Massachusetts (12), Michigan (10), North Carolina (1), New Jersey (4), Rhode Island (3), and Tennessee (1)."

The report above does not mention cases of EEE in horses. There have been triple the number of horse cases over human cases this year (2019). Horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern states should vaccinate their animals. As the authors above state, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. The sporadic nature of the relatively few human cases that occur annually and the extremely high cost of developing a vaccine for people and the difficulty in identifying a target population to vaccinate, as the authors mention, are currently insurmountable barriers to EEEV vaccine development. - Mod.TY
