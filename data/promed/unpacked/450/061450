This is regarding the posting of 9 Jun 2014: Japanese encephalitis & other - India (02): (BR), archive number 20140609.2527999.

The Muzaffarpur [district, Bihar state] outbreaks, annually recurrent, are quite different from many other outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in various parts of India, including some parts of Bihar [state].

(1). The season: JE has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes -- Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains the outbreak stops.

(2). The clinical illness: The clinical and laboratory parameters are not like encephalitis (ICD 10 A 86), but typical of encephalopathy. Onset is sudden, without any prodromal phase, typically in the early morning hours. Till previous evening the child [has been] well. Cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] is clear with no increase in cell count. Low CSF sugar and low blood sugar are documented in some 40 per cent of children. Thus, the diagnosis is acute encephalopathy (ICD 10 G 92 and 93). The cause is non-infectious.

The reason, I believe, why earlier investigators (and there were several teams of experts, including from CDC, who had investigated this problem over a few or even many years) missed this clear distinction was that Japanese encephalitis occurs typically in recurrent seasonal outbreaks, and any acute brain disease occurring in annual seasonal outbreaks are taken for granted as some encephalitis. Once you diagnose encephalitis, the direction of investigation is to take clinical samples and look for viruses.

Those who have not kept up with the literature over the decades may not be aware of the many reports of outbreaks of acute encephalopathy in India (Jamshedpur fever; Nagpur encephalopathy; Reye syndrome outbreak, hepatomyoencephalopathy) and in Thailand (Udorn encephalopathy). So, acute encephalopathy can occur in outbreaks; when outbreaks occur in annual seasonal recurrent fashion, there has to be some factor(s) with repetitive behavior, triggering or actually causing the disease in clusters. Epidemiological puritans can argue if non-infectious encephalopathy outbreaks are truly outbreaks or merely clusters.

(3). Muzaffarpur is famous for lychee [litchi] orchards. May and June are lychee harvest season. The strong spatial and temporal association of the outbreaks with lychee harvesting have been noticed by all previous investigators, but they did not pursue the association in depth. Similar lychee-harvest-associated acute encephalopathy outbreaks have been recently reported in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. In Bangladesh the diagnosis was encephalopathy -- hence pesticides were considered the noxious agent. In Viet Nam, lychee-associated viruses were explored. Even in Muzaffarpur, fruit-eating bats have been noted, and some investigators proposed some bat viruses.

Malda in West Bengal is another lychee cultivating region in India, and this year [2014], a similar outbreak has been reported in the media (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Litchi-virus-kills-8-kids-in-Malda/articleshow/36225598.cms).

(4). The Jamaican vomiting disease (acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy) is triggered by eating unripe ackee fruit [_Blighia sapida_], which contains a toxin called hypoglycin A (Methylenecyclopropylalanine, MCPA). Ackee and lychee belong to one family, namely soapberry (_Sapindaceae_). Lychee seeds have been shown to have a lower analogue of MCPA, namely methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG). In animal experiments, both MCPA and MCPG interfere with fatty acid oxidation, in mitochondria, thus causing acute encephalopathy like in Jamaican vomiting disease.

We all know lychee is a safe and enjoyably edible fruit, very popular. Eating lychee cannot simply be blamed for the Muzaffarpur (or the Bangladesh and Viet Nam) outbreaks. Yet, the presence of MCPG in lychee seeds must be pursued -- my investigation this year [2014] was aimed at investigating cases for "metabolic fatty acid derangement" and lychee seeds and fruits for MCPG or associated substances. Unfortunately, I was given some colleagues who interfered with funding for the studies, and thus I lost the opportunity to complete the investigations this season. Just 4 days ago, I received word that funding may be back on track, but that is too late for this year.

The pathogenesis appears to be blocked gluconeogenesis -- why children go into gluconeogenesis has to be investigated -- most victims are undernourished, and probably liver glycogen-depleted. So perhaps their glycogenolysis is inadequate to supply brain cells with energy source, namely glucose. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is necessary, but some toxin blocks the pathway -- like in any fatty acid metabolic derangement syndrome (usually of genetic origin). These are all hypothetical, to explain what we have observed. Organic acidemia and aciduria would have confirmed the diagnosis, but this year I did not have funds to pursue this.

In summary, the Muzaffarpur (and Malda in India, Bangladesh and Viet Nam) seasonal brain disease outbreaks in children are a peculiar acute encephalopathy, non-infectious in origin, probably predisposed by undernutrition and somehow associated with either lychee seed swallowing, or some such unknown link, to be investigated next year. Please be sure I am not giving lychee a bad name; please eat lychee to your hearts' content, for lychee is a great and safe fruit.

I am attaching a recent hypothesis note published in: John TJ, Das M. Acute encephalitis syndrome in children in Muzaffarpur: hypothesis of toxic origin. Current Science, 2014; 106: 1184-1185 (10 May 2014).

[2] Litchi fruit NOT
Date: Thu 12 Jun 2014

Experts looking into the annual outbreak of a disease in parts of Gorakhpur [district] in Uttar Pradesh [state] and Muzaffarpur [district] in Bihar [state], which has claimed the lives of many children, have told The Indian Express that it has nothing to do with the cultivation of litchi [lychee]. The disease, for the 1st time, has also led to the deaths of children in Malda district of West Bengal [state] this year [2014].

In the absence of any known pathogen or infectious agent, the symptoms are described as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Since those affected reside close to litchi plantations, it has been loosely described as "litchi syndrome" as well. Some experts feel that the children are affected by colouring agents and insecticides used on the fruit crop. However, no connection has been established.

Meanwhile, West Bengal's minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, said on Wednesday that children should not eat green litchi. "It contains toxins, which reduces the blood sugar level as well as glucose in the body, leading to the infection, particularly in children," she was quoted as saying in the Assembly.

Dr Vishal Nath, the director of Muzaffarpur-based National Centre for Litchi under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), said, "We have been working on investigating a correlation between litchi and the AES cases for years, and have performed hundreds of toxicology studies. Last year [2013], we had a team of experts from the Centre for Disease Control in the US, and the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi. Even this year [2014] we have doctors from the field conducting tests everyday...we have established zero association between the 2. It is ridiculous to still call the disease a litchi syndrome or associate it with the fruit in any way."

Nath pointed out that while the crop begins to bear fruit in the 1st week of May, the AES cases start surfacing a month later in June, when 90 per cent of the crop has been "picked, sold and disposed of."

"Our research teams have also busted the theory that children who contract the disease may have eaten the fruit [that had] fallen from trees, which may have been touched by rats or bats. Zoologists and toxicologists from multiple agencies have conducted tests and found no toxins in the bodies of diagnosed children or on fruit samples," Nath explained.

Experts say a history of a similar AES outbreak in Siliguri [West Bengal state] in 1996, which was traced to imported raspberry, might be behind this litchi theory.

Experts at the ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), Patna, who have been trying to identify a cause for the outbreaks in Muzaffarpur, said no known cause of the disease was identified yet. "We do not know if there is a pathogen or any environmental factors or infectious agents behind the disease. AES is a term for a broad spectrum of diseases which have encephalitis-like syndrome, including fever convulsions and high mortality, but we do not know what the disease is exactly," Dr Pradip Das, director of RMRI, said.

In-charge of National Centre for Disease Control, Patna, Dr Ram Singh, said tests performed by their scientists and CDC in the US last year [2013] had "shown no association with litchi, or helped us identify any cause of the disease."

Gorakhpur witnesses JE [Japanese encephalitis virus infections] and AES cases associated with water-borne factors every year. Due to similarities in symptoms, children in Muzaffarpur were 1st tested for JE. Dr G K Thakur, medical superintendent of the Sri Krishna Medical College in Muzaffarpur, one of the 2 hospitals where children are treated, said all diagnosed cases have tested negative for JE. "If you take the history of the patients, not all have eaten the fruit. Children less than a year old cannot walk around and eat fruits lying around trees. We treat children with anti-convulsant and fever-controlling drugs," Thakur said.

Doctors of SKMC [Sri Krishna Medical College] published an article in July [2013] in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Public Health saying that high temperatures and humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which may be contributing to the AES-like symptoms.

The experts' views came a day after Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called an emergency meeting Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] on AES. The ministry announced a JE immunisation campaign on 22-23 Jun [2014] in UP [Uttar Pradesh] and Bihar [states] as a precautionary measure. Harsh Vardhan said there was a need to conduct more research on the still unexplained nature of the disease and set up a National Virology Centre in Muzaffarpur.

[Litchi has been associated with cases of AES for several years. The above 2 reports lay this hypothesis to rest. Similarly, these cases of encephalopathy apparently have nothing to do with JE virus infection, which, although occurring in the same localities, has a different seasonal pattern. Dr John is thanked for his evaluation of the situation presented above, and one hopes that he is able to complete his studies to determine the physiopathological characteristics of the disease and determine the causal factors.
