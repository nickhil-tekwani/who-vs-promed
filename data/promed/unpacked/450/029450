Foot and mouth disease (FMD) was suspected on 25 Feb 1999 in the province of
Oujda, 5 days after being notified in Algeria. The responsible virus was
isolated by the National Laboratory of Biological Production (Biopharma)
from epithelial lesions of suspected animals. The isolation was obtained on
cell cultures and a typical cytopathic effect of FMD virus demonstrated.
Serotyping was carried out using the serum neutralization technique. A virus
of serotype O (similar) to the one isolated in Algeria was identified. The
confirmation was made by the World Reference Laboratory in Pirbright [UK.
At the present time, only cattle are affected, the other susceptible species
did not show the characteristic clinical signs of the disease.
Spatial and temporal evolution
------------------------------------------
The first cases were reported on 25 Feb 1999 at Oujda Province, precisely in
the center of the city, about one kilometer away from the municipal
slaughterhouse, on animals belonging to a wholesale butcher known for
speculation and active in the feedlot trade. Two days later (27 Feb 1999),
two new foci were reported in cowsheds belonging to wholesale butchers also
located in Oujda city . The disease is still confined to Oujda where 5 other
foci were reported. The last focus was reported on 11 Mar 1999. At the
present time, the situation is well under control.
Number of cases and foci
-----------------------------------
Since the appearance of FMD and up to 15 Mar 1999, eight foci were reported
at 8 cowsheds totaling 113 cattle, 14 of which showed clinical signs of FMD.
All affected animals were males aged 12 to 24 months except for a Friesian
cow and a Friesian heifer, both in good condition.
Summary of reported foci animals in foci:
---------------------------------------------------------
Oujda (8 times)
Origin of the infection:
-----------------------------
The situation of FMD in Algeria, the geographic location of the foci
detected in Morocco, the nature of affected animals and the chronology of
the appearance of suspected cases are all factors indicating the
introduction of FMD virus from Algerian territory, most probably through
feedlot cattle smuggling.
Measures undertaken:
------------------------------
Before the epizooticÂ´s spread in Algeria, measures laid down in a
pre-established contingency plan against FMD were set up, and are still
being implemented. These include destruction of affected animals, slaughter
of contact animals, control of animal movement along the Morocco-Algerian
border and vaccination of cattle in at risk zones and subsequently in the
whole national territory.
A national FMD committee as well as provincial committees were constituted
to closely monitor the sanitary situation and to implement appropriate
control measures.
a) In terms of sanitary control with closing of livestock markets since 1
Mar 1999
-- contacts with disinfection and incineration of manure in infected
livestock units.
To date, slaughtered: 113 cattle (14 of which were destroyed)
-- susceptible animals intercepted at the borders which may have been
introduced illegally through the borders.
Since the appearance of the outbreak (25 Feb 1999), the number of animals
intercepted and destroyed is 20 cattle and 110 sheep.
b) In terms of medical control:
Given the fact that the cattle were subject to annual vaccination against
FMD type O from 1992 until December 1997 and have a satisfactory level of
immunity, and that the Directorate responsible for livestock production has
a standby stock (vaccine of serotype O Manisa), a vaccination campaign was
immediately launched in the provinces bordering Algeria (Oujda, Berkane,
Figuig, Jerrada, Er Rachidia and Ouarzazate). This vaccination programme was
also extended to the buffer zone
consisting of the provinces adjoining those mentioned above (Taza, Taounate,
Fes, Al Hoceima, Boulemane and Nador).
To date, around 70 000 cattle have been vaccinated. Extension of the
vaccination programme to the entire cattle population is currently being
planned.
c) In terms of epidemiological surveillance:
A serological survey was conducted on a representative sample of the cattle
population after the appearance of the first foci and revealed, using the
serum neutralization technique on cell culture, that an average of 60% of
cattle still had a protective antibody level against FMD (titres greater
than 1.9 log DN50).
Based on these results, vaccination against FMD was launched in areas where
low titres of protective antibodies were observed. This will chiefly concern
young stock which was not previously vaccinated.
Extending vaccination to the whole national cattle population is being
envisaged.
Prospective and sanitary surveillance of susceptible species, national
territory.
-- the Kingdom's wilayas and provinces.
To date, the animal population being checked represents about 25% of the
national stock receptive to FMD.
-- Public information and sensitization of the public at large on the
outbreak and its evolution and economic impact: campaign under way.
