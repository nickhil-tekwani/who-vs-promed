A case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] has been reported in Grand County [Utah], and while instances of HPS are rare, local health department officials are reminding area residents to take precautions to help reduce the risk of contracting the disease, which is only transmitted to humans through contact with hantavirus-infected rodents or their urine, saliva and droppings.

"We had a confirmed case in Spanish Valley," Orion Rogers, environmental health scientist for the Southeastern Utah District Health Department said on 22 Apr [2015]. "A man had come into contact with deer mice."

The man was treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado, and survived, Rogers said. "It's been years since we've seen a case in our region," Rogers said. "It's a very uncommon disease."

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus is not contagious and cannot be transmitted from one person to another, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). People most often become infected with [a] hantavirus when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, such as in areas like storage sheds and root cellars, where rodents and rodent droppings and urine might be found.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has a fatality rate of 38 per cent, according to the CDC, and symptoms may develop within 1-5 weeks after a person is exposed to the virus. Early symptoms of the disease can include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the thighs, hips, back and sometimes shoulders. Individuals may also experience headaches, dizziness, chills, and nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. An individual may begin to experience coughing and shortness of breath caused by the lungs filling with fluid 4-10 days after the initial symptoms appear, the CDC website states.

According to a news release from the Southeastern Utah District Health Department, several simple precautions should be taken to help prevent the possibility of contracting the virus:

- When entering an outdoor shed or other area that has been closed up for a few months, be sure to open the doors and windows to allow sunlight and fresh air into the area for at least 30 minutes before entering. This will help inactivate the virus. "The [ultraviolet light] from the sun kills the virus, so we're more worried about darker, danker areas," Rogers said.

- Remove trash and debris [that might harbor deer mice] from around the home, and move wood piles at least 100-feet from the home's living area.

- Seal any cracks or openings that lead into the home, and make sure doors and screens are in good condition [to prevent mice from entering].

- Store food off the floor, and clean up food spills quickly [to avoid attracting mice]. Campers should store food safely and keep it away from rodent harborages.

"If you notice areas that have mouse droppings, do not vacuum them," the news release states. "Put on rubber or latex gloves, and spray the area with a mixture of 4 tablespoons [60 ml] of bleach to one gallon [3.8 l] of water. Then use a paper towel to gently sweep up the mess, double bag it and throw it away."

Health officials also noted that just because a person sees a mouse does not mean they are or will be infected with the virus. "It requires exposure to something that is already contaminated," officials said. "If we take reasonable precautions, we can go about our lives worry free."

[This area is geographically close to and ecologically similar to the 4 Corners area (where the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona adjoin), where the 1st recognized cases of HPS occurred and Sin Nombre virus was initially detected. Although not stated in the report above, the specific hantavirus involved in this case probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Utah. The nature of the patient's contact with the deer mice is not specified, but would be of interest.

An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at the URL above and at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
