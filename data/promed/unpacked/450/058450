Sadly it seems the Press enjoy tormenting pet owners hoping to avoid
quarantine simply to fill up space. Animal Health Import Division, who will
be responsible for implementing the Scheme, advise us that the criteria for
the Pilot Scheme (announced on 26th March 1999 as being put into place
anytime up to the end of March 2000) is not yet available and we do not yet
know what countries will be included and who will be eligible. Currently
lists of those who will be approved to carry out blood tests, health
certification vaccination are being formulated and a decision as to which
type of micro-chip will be accepted is being made. Those are the current
facts. We can only urge you to wait for the formal Press Release from MAFF,
which will definitely accompany any announcement launching the Pilot Scheme.
