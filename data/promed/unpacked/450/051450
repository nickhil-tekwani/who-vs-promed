Pig disease outbreak in Ukraine a major warning sign
-----------------------------------------------------
Following the 1st-ever detection of African swine fever [ASF] in Ukraine, FAO is warning that while control measures appear to have temporarily halted the disease's spread, it has established a firm foothold in the Caucasus and poses an ongoing risk to neighbouring areas.

In addition to some other parts of Ukraine, nearby countries like Moldova, Kazakhstan and Latvia -- which have large pig populations raised on household or family farms, and oftentimes weak biosecurity protocols -- are also now at high risk of disease introduction.

"National and local authorities in the entire region should scale up their prevention measures and be ready to respond in case of further outbreaks," said Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer. "This could be the 1st of more outbreaks to come, according to our disease analyses."

ASF doesn't affect humans, but mortalities in domestic pigs can be extremely high.

In 2011, up to 300 000 pigs died or were culled as a result of ASF outbreaks in the Russian Federation, incurring an estimated USD 240 million in economic losses.

Ukraine has responded quickly, implementing sanitary measures, destroying affected pigs and imposing a quarantine zone around the village where the outbreaks occurred, according to Lubroth.

Most importantly, Ukraine has paid farmers compensation for pigs that were slaughtered and properly disposed of, so that poor families that depend on pig raising for food and income aren't left ruined by the loss of their pigs, he said.

All countries at risk should stand ready to detect any ASF outbreaks as soon as they occur and respond in a similarly proactive fashion, according to FAO.

ASF is caused by a highly infectious virus that affects domestic pigs and wild pig species.

Humans often contribute to its spread, even via what would seem a harmless discarded sandwich. Foodstuffs that contain ASF-contaminated pork or pork products, such as cured meats, can be consumed by scavenging free-ranging pigs, kept by many vulnerable families in the region for income and their own household food needs. These pigs can be exposed by feeding on contaminated food among refuse, by consuming improperly disposed pig carcasses and pork parts that are infected or if they eat a discarded ham sandwich that contains the virus.

As a result, ASF can spread by leaps and bounds when it is introduced to new areas.

Prior to being introduced to the Caucasus in 2007, it had been confined for several decades to the African continent and the Italian island of Sardinia. Today, however, it is considered endemic in parts of the Russian Federation and some countries in the Caucasus region, including Georgia and Armenia. It was eradicated from the Iberian Peninsula in the mid 1990's after decades-long work between the veterinary services and swine producers.

FAO has continuously recommended a strict ban on "swill feeding," in which various food scraps and leftovers are fed as a mix of liquid and solid food to domestic pigs.

FAO studies on ASF in the Russian Federation indicate that swill feeding is responsible for 97 percent of all new infections in domestic pigs. The backyard sector, which accounts for 34 percent of the entire domestic pig population, is typically infected 1st before subsequently passing the virus on to small commercial farms and eventually industrial farms.

Bans on swill feeding can be challenging to enforce in resource-poor settings, where swill feeding is a low-cost option for feeding pigs.

European wild boar are also susceptible to African swine fever, making them a vector for transmission as they wander freely across national boundaries.

According to FAO's mapping of wild boar populations in Europe, there is cause for concern: moving westward from the Caucasus region, wild boar populations steadily increase and become particularly dense in countries such as France, Italy and Spain. The number of domestic pigs likewise increases significantly moving westward from the Russian Federation, with Poland, Hungary and Germany marking the outer limits of large-scale commercial farming that exists throughout Western Europe.

ASF will be that much more difficult to combat as it finds a convenient host in dense populations of susceptible species, both farmed and wild pigs.

[2] Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor response

Regarding the threat of African swine fever in the territory of the European Union
-----------------------------------------------------
Rosselkhoznadzor considers it necessary to give some explanation in response to yesterday's statement by FAO on the risk of further spread of African swine fever (ASF) in the territory, including some EU countries.

Threat of the spread of ASF, which has existed since the economic development of Africa by Europeans, has intensified with the globalization of trade. No large-scale accidental outbreak that swept in the 2nd half of the 20th century in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands were connected with the postwar heyday of international trade. Suppressing the epizootics required enormous cost and enormous effort. In connection with this, the concerns of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) that "ASF outbreak in Europe could have serious implications for food security," are understandable.

The threat of new entry of ASF into the EU has risen sharply in 2007 when the outbreak in Georgia started. Bernard Vallat, Director General of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), who had visited the country shortly before the outbreak, warned the Georgian leadership on the inadmissibility of the reform of the National Veterinary Service of Georgia to the actual abolition of veterinary checks at the border. From Georgia, ASF infiltrated Armenia and Azerbaijan, covering the entire Transcaucasus region, and then with wild boars the pathogen was brought to Russia.

Following the recent ASF outbreak in Ukraine, the Ministry of Agriculture of Germany expressed very serious concern about the risk of the disease agent penetrating the territory of the European Union. According to the German Association of Pig Producers, the disease -- if introduced -- may affect 31 000 pig farms in Germany, losses amounting to billions of euros.

Taking into account the administrative and functional division of the Veterinary Service of Germany at the federal and regional levels, which severely limit its ability to act, and objectively assessing the existing threats and risks, Rosselkhoznadzor is sympathetic to the concerns of the German business community.

Rosselkhoznadzor is extremely serious about the fight against the spread of the ASF epizootic, fully sharing the view of FAO that "African swine fever is fast becoming a global problem."

In the analysis of the possible spread of ASF within the territory of the European Union, Rosselkhoznadzor experts, taking into account the fact that currently 2 endemic areas are present in Russia. The causative agent may enter the territory of the EU in 2 routes: the northern route, through Belarus, the Baltic States, Poland and Germany, and the southern route, through Ukraine, Romania and Austria, which has now started to be realized by the introduction of ASF into Ukraine.
