The death of a person in central North Dakota is being attributed to hantavirus [pulmonary] disease. The state Health Department did not identify the adult victim or say where the person lived.

It is the 1st case of the disease spread by infected mice since 2009. Only 12 cases have been reported to the state Health Department since 1993, when the virus was first recognized in the US. There have been 7 deaths in North Dakota including the most recent one.

Epidemiologist Michelle Feist says people should take precautions if they are cleaning in areas where signs of rodents are present.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_). In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.

An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
