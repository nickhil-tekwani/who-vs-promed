In the past week, nearly 20 reports of chikungunya cases were
registered at the PHC [primary health care] at Nidagundi town of
Basavana Bagewadi taluk. [A taluk is an administrative subdivision of
a district. - Mod.TY] Confirmation of blood tests of all the patients
for malaria is awaited.

According to the district nodal officer, S L Lakkannavar, only one
death due to chikungunya has been registered in the district till the
1st week of October [2009].

Doctors asked the villagers to take necessary actions to curb the
disease, by keeping their houses and surrounding areas clean. All the
areas in Nidagundi town were fogged, after the PHC doctors who visited
the areas found them unhygienic.

The doctors also advised the people to immediately take blood tests at
the district hospital, if they had any symptoms of chikungunya [virus
infection].

[Since chikungunya virus infections are very rarely fatal, the one
fatality reported here is unusual. It would be of interest to know if
the person who died had other underlying medical problems. The most
recent report of chikungunya virus transmission in Karnataka state was
on 27 Jun 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090629.2351).
