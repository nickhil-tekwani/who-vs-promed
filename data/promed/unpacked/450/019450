Update on incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in New South
Wales, Australia
Further to my previous reports of 1 and 9 December, I wish to advise that a
further infected farm has been detected within the declared infected zone
(Australian terminology refers to restricted area). This third farm was
within 1 kilometre of the first infected farm and is well within the 3 km
surveillance zone. Rigorous surveillance has shown no evidence of any other
infection in farms within the restricted area or the 10 km radius control
area (equivalent to OIE surveillance zone), surrounding the initial
infected farm. All birds on the farm have already been destroyed and
disinfection has commenced.
The third farm was a commercial broiler farm which also raised emu chicks.
These emu chicks were sampled as part of the surveillance program in the
restricted area. Subsequently, the emu chicks were destroyed to enable
commercial day old chicken to be introduced for broiler production.
Sampling of the emus resulted in the isolation of the H7 virus. There was
no evidence of clinical disease in the emus. As a result of the detection
of H7 virus from the destroyed emus, the three day old chickens were
destroyed as a precaution.
An update of relevant details is presented at Attachment 1.

Attachment 1:

Country/Location: Australia, Tamworth in the state of New South Wales.
Name and Position of Sender: Dr. Gardner Murray, Australian Chief
Veterinary Officer
Facsimile Contact: (61.2) 6272 5697
Date of Notification: 1 December 1997, Updated 9 December 1997, Updated 16
December 1997
Name of Disease: Highly pathogenic Avian Influenza
Nature of Diagnosis: Fluorescent antibody testing of impression smears of
pancreas and
isolation of an influenza virus in inoculated embryonated eggs. The virus
has been typed as H7N4.
Date of initial detection: 25 November 1997
Estimated Date of first infection: Unknown
Number of separate outbreaks: One outbreak involving three infected farms
within 3km restricted area.
Geographical identification: 31° 1' south, 150° 50' east, near Tamworth,
NSW about 400 km north of Sydney.

Details concerning the outbreak:
Species No. of animals
Farm 1 avian 128,000
Farm 2 avian 30,000
Farm 3 avian/rattites 261 emu chicks/33,000 avians

Comments concerning affected population:
The third affected property is a broiler farm which also had 261 emu
chicks, raised in outdoor pens within several hundred metres of the broiler
sheds on the farm. These emus were clinically healthy, but were destroyed
to enable the introduction of 33,000 day old chickens for broiler
production. Surveillance sampling of the emus prior to slaughter detected
the presence of H7 virus. There were no poultry on the farm at the time
the emus were destroyed. The 33,000 three day old chickens introduced
after removal of the emus, were therefore destroyed as a precaution.

Comments on the epidemiology:
The third farm is located within 1km from the first infected property. The
source of infection in the emus has not been confirmed.
Because of the proximity of the emu pens to the commercial broiler sheds,
the broiler chickens were destroyed as a precaution.

Control measures taken to date:
· The third infected farm was placed in quarantine on 12 December 1997

· The existing restricted zone includes 3km around the third case.

· The surveillance zone has been extended slightly to include 10km around
the third case.

· All birds have been destroyed on the three infected farms.

· Disinfection is nearly complete on the first property, well underway on
the second property and has commenced on the third property.

· A high level of surveillance is being maintained on all poultry
enterprises within the restricted and surveillance zones.
