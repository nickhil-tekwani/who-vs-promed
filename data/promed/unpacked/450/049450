More than 480 cases of chikungunya [virus infections] have been
reported over the past several days in the southern districts of
Brazzaville, the Congo [Brazzaville] Director General of Health,
Professor Alexis Elira Dokekias, said Saturday [11 Jun 2011] on
Radio-Congo.

"Of the more than 480 cases we identified, there have not been any
deaths; there are patients who have major, intermediate symptoms,"
said Professor Dokekias, calling on the population to remain calm and
not to yield to panic, because a "mechanism has been developed so that
people can easily access treatment."

Patients are presenting with skin lesions and complain of headaches,
muscle aches or joint pain and show a general fatigue," said Professor
Dokekias, stating that it is a question not of a "robust malaria," as
was the rumor spread in the city, but rather "a viral infection with
the chikungunya virus, a microbe from a variety of mosquito that
thrives in an environment where there is stagnant water" [This is not
malaria. The regional laboratory was able to identify chikungunya
virus in specimens that were taken as part of the investigation of the
increase in cases. - Mod.TY].

"We are facing an epidemic. Treatment is based primarily on the use
of paracetamol, the hydration of patients, and above all, we recommend
NOT to use certain medicines such as aspirin and anti-inflammatories,
which may facilitate a hemorrhagic form of the disease," he said,
announcing an upcoming campaign for "mosquito reduction" in the city,
using a substance not harmful to human beings.

Mosquito reduction and sanitation of the environment are the
preventive measures recommended by Professor Dokekias to counter the
epidemic of chikungunya that has already affected "several African
countries, including Mali, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Cape Verde and,
very close to us, Gabon."

[This is the 1st report of a chikungunya [CHIK] outbreak in the
Republic of the Congo posted by ProMED-mail. There was a report of
CHIK virus outbreaks in Senegal in 1966, 1977, 1975, 1983, 1988,
1990,1992, 1996 and 1997 in many areas including the Dakar area.
Outbreaks were reported in neighboring Gabon in 2007, 2008 and 2010,
so an outbreak in the Republic of Congo is not surprising. ProMED
would be interested in receiving reports of CHIK virus infections in
Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and Cape Verde, as ProMED-mail has never received
information from these countries, although they are mentioned in the
above report.
