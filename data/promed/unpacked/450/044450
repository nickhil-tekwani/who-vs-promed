Results of scientific tests have confirmed that the devastating tropical
race 4 strain of the Panama disease fungus is present on a banana farm
outside Darwin.
The soil borne disease, which slashes production, has been detected in the
Territory twice before with infected plants eradicated and the area of soil
fenced off.
Director of Resource Protection with the Department of Primary Industries
and Fisheries, Ian Kilduff, says strict quarantine procedures have been put
in place to ensure the disease doesn't spread on this occasion. He says the
farm of between 15 and 20 hectares will have to be destroyed.
Ian Kilduff: So we'll take out the worst affected areas and then continually
survey in 3 to 4 week intervals, and take out further infection. And at this
stage the plantation has a limited life and we propose to kill the rest of
the plantation around about the end of November [1999].

[Field screening of parents and clones of banana will likely continue to be
the main means of detecting resistant selections. Unfortunately, expertise
and infrastructure are limited in the key areas where Foc 4 is found - Mod.
