Animal MRSA infections found in Canada Signs of novel strain found
increasingly often in humans, but questions remain over public health
importance
--------------------------
A strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
primarily associated with pigs has been found to be infecting humans
in Canada, say researchers this week [week of 8-12 Mar 2010] in
Emerging Infectious Diseases(1). They are the 1st cases of infection
with the bug to be reported in North America, the authors say,
although the strain was known to be colonising livestock and farmers
in both the USA and Canada.

"Recent emergence of infections resulting from this strain is of
public health concern," write the researchers, led by George Golding
at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada.
"Additional surveillance efforts are required to monitor the
emergence and clinical relevance of this MRSA strain in Canada."

The strain called livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA), also referred
to as MRSA clonal complex (CC) 398, was 1st identified colonising pig
farmers in the Netherlands in 2005, and has since been found
colonising and infecting farmers and livestock across the globe. In
the Netherlands, where there is a high density of pig farming,
LA-MRSA now accounts for an increasingly high percentage of all newly
detected MRSA strains in people -- 42 percent of them at the end of
2008.

LA-MRSA is capable of causing disease in humans, from mild skin
infections, wound infections and abscesses to severe invasive
infections leading to organ failure. The strain can also spread
between people, as shown by reports of health care workers carrying
LA-MRSA after contact with infected patients. But how easily this can
occur is unclear, as there are relatively few reports and no
epidemiological studies of LA-MRSA in people who have not had direct
contact with livestock.

To determine the prevalence of LA-MRSA in the general population in
Canada, Golding and colleagues analysed 3687 MRSA isolates collected
in Saskatchewan and Manitoba between 2007 and 2008. The sample
represented about 66 percent of all MRSA samples collected in
Saskatchewan and 17 percent of those collected in Manitoba during
this period, both provinces with a low density of pig farming. The
researchers found 5 isolates with genes characteristic of LA-MRSA, 4
of which were associated with cases of skin and soft-tissue
infection. One of the isolates came from a post-operative infection
in a patient who was unlikely to have had any contact with livestock,
according to the authors.

Although the number of reports of LA-MRSA is increasing worldwide, it
is difficult to say whether this represents genuine emergence or just
increased surveillance for the strain, says Wannes Vanderhaegen, of
the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre in Uccle, Belgium.
"It's a very recent problem," he points out. "There's not enough
evidence yet."

The public health implications of the finding are also unclear,
Vanderhaeghen says. Most of the LA-MRSA strains that have been found,
including the isolates reported in the Canadian study, have lacked
virulence factors such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a
cytotoxin thought to play a role in some severe infections. Some
research suggests that strains without these virulence factors may be
less infectious, Vanderhaeghen says. But some LA-MRSA isolates with
PVL have been identified in China, he points out, raising the
possibility that more infectious clones of LA-MRSA could emerge in
the future.

Furthermore, the prevalence of LA-MRSA in the general population in
Canada appears to be low. In the Golding et al. study, the animal
strain accounted for only 0.14 percent of the MRSA isolates. Even in
the Netherlands, where the strain accounts for a high proportion of
all isolates of MRSA in people, a study published last month in PLoS
ONE2 found that out of a representative sample of 534 people who had
had no contact with livestock, only one harboured LA-MRSA. This
figure is in line with the low overall MRSA rates reported in the
Netherlands, and comparable to a 2009 study of 422 schoolchildren in
Germany, where no LA-MRSA was detected, say the authors, led by
Brigitte van Cleef at the National Institute for Public Health and
the Environment in Bilthoven.

But the prevalence of LA-MRSA in farmers and veterinarians is very
high, despite the relatively small number of infections detected so
far. Studies in pig farmers have shown colonisation rates of up to 25
percent in Canada and 45 percent in the USA, Golding et al. report.
In the Netherlands, Van Cleef and colleagues found the bug in 26
percent of people who had had contact with livestock -- and other
European studies have shown rates as high as 45 percent in pig
farmers, they say. For this reason, hospitals in the Netherlands
screen people in regular contact with pigs or veal calves for MRSA on
admission.

The wide range of animal hosts for the strain, and what appears to be
a high rate of transfer to humans based on the high rates of
colonisation in livestock workers, means the strain should be watched
closely, Vanderhaeghen says. "Staphylococcus is usually quite
host-specific," he points out. "It's very strange that you find the
same strain in pigs, veal calves, dairy cows, dogs, chickens, rats
and goats."

[ProMED has reported on several occasions on this strain of MRSA in the past:

A report of MRSA transmission in the USA between humans and pigs
found that the MRSA isolates were not typeable by PFGE using Sma-1,
but multilocus sequence typing (MLST) documented that the isolates
were ST398 (see ProMED-mail post Staph. aureus (MRSA), human, swine -
USA: (IA, IL) 20090126.0348). Colonization with non-typeable MRSA
ST398 has also been reported in pigs and pig farmers in Ontario,
Canada (see ProMED-mail post 20071109.3640).

Non-typeable MRSA ST 398 was also detected in the Netherlands in pigs
and pig farmers in 2003 (see ProMED-mail post archive number
20080605.1799). This strain of presumably animal origin (nearly 40
percent of pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be colonized by
this strain) is reported to be responsible for more than 20 percent
of all human MRSA infections in the Netherlands
(<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512> -- subscription
required), and has been found in community-associated human
infections in several European countries (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/5/pdfs/EID_Vol15No5.pdf>), North
America, and Asia.

Nosocomial transmission of this strain has also been reported
recently among patients and health care workers in the Netherlands
(<http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352>).
This outbreak makes clear that transmission on a larger scale can
occur with non-typeable MRSA ST 398. - Mod.ML]
