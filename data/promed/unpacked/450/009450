We have strong evidence for the 1st human case of West Nile fever acquired in Germany -- a male veterinarian from Bavaria (Germany) has been diagnosed after contact with a West Nile virus (WNV)-infected bird.

The 31-year-old veterinarian, who works at a birds' clinic, had performed necropsy of a just-deceased owl (great grey owl, _Strix nebulosa_) found in a wildlife park near Poing, Ebersberg, Bavaria. WNV was detected by PCR in tissue samples recovered during the necropsy. The owl case was posted on 14 Sep 2018 on ProMED-mail [West Nile virus (35): Europe (Germany, Croatia) wild bird, OIE 20180914.6029586]. Then 3 days after the necropsy, the veterinarian developed flu-like symptoms persisting for 4 to 5 days and a maculopapular skin rash, followed by a 2nd episode of fever one week later. Serological examination of a serum sample collected one month after the necropsy revealed the presence of specific IgM antibodies against WNV with a titre of 1:80 by immunofluorescence assay. No IgM antibodies against dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, yellow fever virus and Japanese encephalitis virus were present. IgG antibodies against WNV and the other flaviviruses tested were positive with titres of 1:640 each. The patient had a history of past vaccinations against TBE (during childhood) and yellow fever virus (in 2012). The diagnostic tests were performed at the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology (Federal Armed Forces).

A monospecific IgM response against WNV and a cross-reactive IgG response against WNV, as well as a broad spectrum of other flaviviruses after a history of flavivirus vaccinations in the past, is the expected antibody profile during a fresh or recent WNV infection and provides strong evidence for the diagnosis. Further tests of follow-up samples from the patient to confirm the diagnosis are pending.

Contact of the conjunctiva with contaminated body secretions of infected birds and occupational accidents involving injury with sharps have been described as potential transmission routes of WNV and may also have been the route of infection in the present case, although the patient was not aware of any such event.

Between 28 Sep and 4 Oct 2018, EU Member States reported 50 human West Nile virus infections in Greece (22), Romania (19), Hungary (7), Bulgaria (1) and the Czech Republic (1). EU-neighbouring countries reported 30 cases, all in Serbia.

In 3 areas, human cases were reported for the 1st time: Bulgaria (1), the Czech Republic (1) and Serbia (1). All other human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

This week [28 Sep to 4 Oct 2018], 18 deaths were reported by Greece (8), Romania (6), Serbia (3) and the Czech Republic (1). In the same week, 21 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (13), Greece (3), France (3), Hungary (1) and Slovenia (1).

In 2018, as of 4 Oct 2018, EU Member States have reported 1317 human cases in Italy (495), Greece (283), Romania (256), Hungary (197), Croatia (45), France (16), Austria (15), Bulgaria (6), Slovenia (3) and the Czech Republic (1). EU-neighbouring countries reported 434 human cases in Serbia (350), Israel (81) and Kosovo* (3). To date, 142 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (36), Romania (36), Greece (34), Serbia (32), Bulgaria (1), the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (1) and Kosovo* (1).

During the current transmission season, 222 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (120), Hungary (79), Greece (13), France (5), Romania (2), Austria (1), Germany (1) and Slovenia (1).

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should defer for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of West Nile virus circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sabine Zange and her colleagues for the report on the suspected 1st autochthonous West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Germany.

WNV is endemic in Africa, southern Asia, and northern Australia, and only sporadic cases or small epidemics were seen in Europe previously. However, the incidence of human cases has increased recently with higher activity reported during 2018 from many European countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) publishes a weekly WNV activity report (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc). - Mod.UBA
