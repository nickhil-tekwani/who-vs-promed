A donkey residing in Palm Beach County, Florida, is recovering after contracting West Nile virus (WNV), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [25 Oct 2016]. "The donkey had no vaccine history and was imported from a Louisiana auction into Florida on 16 Oct [2016] with no clinical signs," the EDCC said. "Clinical signs began on 18 Oct [2016] and currently the donkey is recovering... Given the travel history and incubation period for WNV, the donkey most likely did not acquire WNV in Palm Beach County."

This is Palm Beach County's 1st confirmed WNV case and Florida's second for 2016.

West Nile is transmitted to horses and other equids via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[In spite of the absence of Floridian WNV reports in ProMED, the virus is in circulation in the state. See Florida Health http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2016/week42arbovirusreport-10-22-16.pdf.

"Arbovirus surveillance in Florida includes endemic mosquito borne viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV),and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), as well as exotic viruses such as dengue virus (DENV) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and California encephalitis group viruses (CEV). Malaria, a parasitic mosquito-borne disease is also included. During the period of 16 to 22 Oct 2016, the following arboviral activity was recorded in Florida: WNV activity: No human cases of WNV infection were reported this week No horses with WNV infection were reported this week. A total of 8 sentinel chickens tested positive for antibodies to WNV this week in Citrus, Lee, Leon, Manatee, Sarasota, and Walton Counties. In 2016, positive samples from 169 sentinel chickens, 6 humans, 1 horse, and 5 mosquito pools have been received from 22 counties."

But this does not list West Palm Beach. As this unvaccinated donkey first showed signs 2 days after arriving in the state from an auction in Louisiana it is not improbable that it brought the infection with it and the stress of travel contributed to the disease appearance. West Nile is unevenly reported in Louisiana whether in humans or equids. - Mod.MHJ
