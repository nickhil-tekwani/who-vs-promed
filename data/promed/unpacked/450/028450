The total number of polio cases in the country has touched 77 after an infant was tested positive in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The child had received [zero doses of] essential immunisation, [and he did not] receive any inactivated polio vaccine.

In a press statement issued Saturday [26 Oct 2019], KP EOC Coordinator Abdul Basit said that the virus was spreading rapidly in southern districts of the province, especially in Bannu, which has recorded 32 cases. He said that the only viable solution to the problem is to vaccinate the child in every campaign, as only repeated doses can protect the child from permanent disability and stop the virus circulation. Abdul Basit appealed to the parents not to pay attention to anti-vaccination propaganda. The EOC report cited "refusals by parents" as the top reason for the scale of the virus' resurgence witnessed this year [2019].

KP leads the number of polio cases with 57. Sindh followed with 8 cases, while the number of cases in Balochistan was 7 this year [2019]. Only 5 cases surfaced in Punjab, mostly in its capital Lahore.

One of the reasons is the increased resistance towards vaccination drives and violence against polio workers in the province as compared with the rest of the country.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, last month [September 2019], had expressed serious concern over the recent spike in polio cases in the country and directed federal and provincial government officials to undertake effective awareness and immunisation campaigns to eliminate the disease.

Another polio case [has] surfaced in Sarae Norang area of district Lakki Marwat said Coordinator Abdul Basit on Saturday [26 Oct 2019]. He said that polio was detected in a 9-month-old baby and the NIH Islamabad confirmed the baby with polio positive.

He said that polio vaccines are a must for children, but unfortunately the parents of the baby did not administer polio vaccines to their child. He said that it is the need of the hour that polio vaccines must be administered to every child to eliminate polio from the area and save their lives. He urged the parents, Ulema-e-Karam and civil society members to play a role in creating awareness among people to administer polio vaccines to their children.

[With the addition of this newly confirmed case, the total number of cases reported by Pakistan with dates of onset since 1 Jan 2019 is now 77, and the total number of cases of WPV1 reported globally is now 95. Of note is that 57 of the 77 cases (71.4%) reported by Pakistan this year (2019) were from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

It's a repetitive story of unvaccinated children.
