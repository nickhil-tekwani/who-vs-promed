[This report officially confirms the information published in ProMED-mail post no 20150727.3538703; see comments in the indicated post.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtype, based on 2 surface proteins: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains [Note: in 2014 and 2015, LPAI H7N7 was identified in Germany, the Netherlands, and UK where HPAI H7N7 strains were also detected. - Mod.CRD]. The H5 and H7 subtypes have been known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in domestic poultry.

Although not all avian influenzas can be transmitted to humans, transmission of some of the H5 and H7 strains, particularly those of Asian origin, has occurred when people have had close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments. Due to the potential for human infection, it is recommended that people working with poultry suspected of being infected with avian influenza, take proper precautions and wear protective clothing, including face masks, goggles and gloves (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453). - Mod.CRD
