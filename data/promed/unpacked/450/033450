Seven people have developed anthrax in the village of Zholdama of the
Kustanai region, Kazakhstan. Sixty people associated with these cases are
being watched for symptoms.
Deputy head of the Kazakhstan Sanitary Surveillance Department Faisulla
Bismildin said that the epidemic was caused by a family from the Zoldama
village who ate contaminated meat of their sick cow. However, Bismildin
blamed the local veterinary service as well. Several horses had died of
anthrax several days before the human cases occurred in the village.
Apparently the local veterinarians had neither vaccinated the cattle nor
carried out necessary checks [presumably of the dead cow and horses.
There were 78 incidents of anthrax in Kazakhstan over the past 1.5 years.
In most cases the disease was caused by the local population who evaded
vaccinating cattle on private and state farms.

[It was unclear from this report as to who or what were affected in the
past 18 months. When we were in Almaty last Autumn, there had been 70
reported human cases in the first nine months of 1997. Livestock anthrax is
usually only reported if there are human cases. Previous reports have
blamed faulty vaccination procedures on private farms only. The extension
of blame to state farms is note worthy. - Mod.MHJ
