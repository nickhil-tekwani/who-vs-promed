An outbreak of measles has killed 60 children aged between 6 months
and 12 years in Nigeria's northern state of Borno, the local media
reported on Tue 19 Jun 2007.
The epidemic, which broke out in the state capital, Maiduguri, and
its environs a few days ago, has so far affected some 400 children,
the report quoted officials of the affected areas as saying. The
worst-affected areas include the Maiduguri council, where 125
children have been treated for measles, an acute and highly
contagious viral disease marked by distinct red spots followed by a
rash, which occurs primarily in children. Other badly hit councils
are Borno, Konduga (25 deaths each), as well as Jere and Bama (20
deaths each).
Konduga council secretary, Kaka Ali Yale, was quoted as saying
communities without access to health centers have been supplied with
drugs and drips for the treatment of the disease.

[Borno (formerly Bornu) is the most internally located province of

It is likely that this outbreak is a reflection of inadequate vaccine
coverage, a situation not uncommon even in well-organized societies
in the interior of Africa. The death toll is distressingly high.
Greater effort and better organization will be required to control
further outbreaks of this highly contagious disease. - Mod.CP]
