On the night of 26 Dec 2019, the Gansu Province Health Commission posted news on its official website that the positive brucellosis antibody event at the Lanzhou Veterinary Institute was caused by exhaust gas from the nearby China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant. As of 25 Dec [2019] at 4 p.m., the number of people testing positive for brucellosis had reached 181. Aside from one person with clinical symptoms, all the others did not have clinical symptoms and were not ill.

The official website stated that this event happened from 24 Jul-20 Aug 2019. China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant produces brucellosis vaccine for animal use. Because disinfectant [used in the fermenter] had expired, exhaust gas containing vaccine strain was insufficiently sterilized. As the Lanzhou Veterinary Institute is downwind from the biopharmaceutical plant, [the exhaust gas] was inhaled or made contact with mucous membranes causing the positive brucellosis antibodies event.

Investigation found that from July to August 2019, winds in Lanzhou are mainly southeastern at windspeed level 2 to 3. Waste gases containing pathogen released by the biopharmaceutical plant were aerosolized and carried by the wind to a limited distance. Exposure levels were very low. So there would not be large numbers of people with positive antibodies. Thorough investigations led to the official conclusion that this was an accidental event.

China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant's brucellosis vaccine production plant stopped production on 7 Dec 2019.
