Over the past 6 weeks [late October to early December 2014], the Traverse City [Michigan] area has become an unnerving, real-life example of the consequences of undervaccination. Cases of whooping cough and measles have impacted hundreds of families, overwhelmed local doctors and public health officials, and put parents who don't vaccinate their children on the defensive.

"Nobody likes to be the person who says, 'I told you so,'" but what's unfolding now is exactly the scenario feared by those worried about the region's low immunization numbers, said Dr. Bradley Goodwin, a Traverse City family physician who is president of the Grand Traverse County Medical Society. Grand Traverse County has one of Michigan's highest rates of schoolchildren opting out of vaccines -- twice the state average and 6 times the national rate for kindergartners in 2013-14. In some schools, the rate is even higher. That includes Grand Traverse Academy, the 1200-student charter school associated with the initial outbreak of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, an illness nicknamed "the 100-day cough."

A teacher at Grand Traverse Academy was diagnosed with whooping cough on 16 Oct 2014. Once introduced into the school community, the disease took off. To date, a total of 151 confirmed and probable cases of whooping cough have been linked to the school. One reason the illness swept through the academy: A significant number of its students are unvaccinated. In 2013-14, 17 percent of Grand Traverse Academy kindergartners had parents who signed a waiver exempting their children from the required childhood immunizations. "When you have (pertussis) spread so fast through a school community with high waiver rates, that's not coincidental," Goodwin said.

Also fueling the outbreak: When the teacher was 1st diagnosed, students classified as "close contacts" were told to take antimicrobials as a preventive measure, but not all followed the directive, said Wendy Trute, health director for the Grand Traverse County Health Department. Some parents didn't want to give antibiotics to children who don't seem sick. But whooping cough is contagious before symptoms appear. "2 families didn't get or take antimicrobials, and they account for 8 or 9 of the confirmed cases," Trute said. "People not following through (with medical directives) is one of the issues."

The school had so many cases of whooping cough that school officials canceled the elementary fall carnival as well as 4 days of classes. While the school was shuttered, the 1200 students were told to stay at home in quarantine to prevent spreading the disease further.

That was the 2nd week of November 2014. Since then, whooping cough cases have been reported at 14 other school buildings across the region and new cases are still coming in, Trute said.

Trute said about 1/3rd of the pertussis cases in the Traverse City area involve people who are vaccinated. Particularly vulnerable have been children around age 10 or 11, because the immunizations they received in infancy are wearing off and they haven't yet had a booster shot. It didn't help that the outbreak at Grand Traverse Academy started in the upper elementary grades, Trute said. Still, it's clear that unvaccinated children were those most at risk. A state epidemiologist ran the numbers for the Traverse City pertussis outbreak and calculated that children who aren't vaccinated have been 5 times more likely to come down with pertussis than those who have been immunized, Trute said.

The pertussis outbreak has become a hot-button issue in Traverse City, pitting parents who vaccinate their children against those who don't, said Beth Milligan, a reporter for The Ticker, a Traverse City news website. "People on the pro-vaccination side are very angry at the anti-vaxers for exposing their children to disease," Milligan said. Meanwhile, "the anti-vaxers are latching onto the fact" that some fully vaccinated people are getting whooping cough, which they say proves their point that vaccinations are ineffective, Milligan added.

"A lot of people who don't vaccinate don't see the need," said Milligan, who wrote an in-depth story in September 2014 about the county's low vaccination rate. "Many are families who are into holistic medicine," and feel there are better ways to build the immune system and ward off disease.

The problem with that thinking, Goodwin said, is that unvaccinated people are much more likely to spread disease compared to those who are immunized, even if the unvaccinated people don't appear sick. "I'm a big believer in better living through better living," Goodwin said. "But while your immune system is fighting off an illness, you can still be contagious and infect others, and those others may not be as healthy as you."

If anything, Trute said, the fact the pertussis vaccine is not 100 percent effective is all the more reason to maintain high immunization rates, to prevent the disease from getting a foothold in the community. Her fear, she said, is that what's happening in 2014 will become a semi-regular event in Grand Traverse County.

"It's also helping people to reconsider and re-evaluate their stance against vaccines," Goodwin added. "Most people are seeing now that there is a value to getting vaccines, and realizing their previous premise about going without being vaccinated was overzealous."

Trute agreed there has been a "fair amount of conversation" in recent weeks about trying to reduce the number of schoolchildren with vaccination waivers. "A lot of people are becoming vocal now because it's affecting them," she said. "I do think it's possible that once we get through this craziness, there will be a call to positive action."

Some educators are thinking the same way. Susan Wagner-Dameron, director of Grand Traverse Academy, said it is important to remain respectful of parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. But she is also thinking of hosting an immunization clinic at the school next year.

Meanwhile, The Children's House, a Montessori school in Traverse City, which also had a student with whooping cough, has been educating parents on the value of vaccinations.

"I don't think you're ever going to change the minds of some people," Trute said. "We're trying to affect people on the fence." Milligan agreed that some opposed to vaccinations are "digging in their heels," but recent events are changing attitudes on vaccinations.

"When you're faced with a highly contagious outbreak, it creates a lot of fear and that fear can be a useful catalyst," Milligan said. "Sometimes you need something scary to happen to realize the consequences of not vaccinating."

[In a previous posting on the outbreak of pertussis in Grand Traverse County, Michigan, particularly at the Grand Traverse Academy (Pertussis - USA (23), archive no. 20141116.2947034), I wrote, "With a large jump in probable cases in a number that could represent more than 10 per cent or more of the students, it would be important to know the vaccination status of the school's students."

It is now clear that undervaccination at the school (estimated at 17 percent) has played a large role in this outbreak of _Bordetella pertussis_ infection. The truths and untruths surrounding the anti-vaccine movement are complex and multifactorial. What is clear is that today's parents do not appreciate what these vaccine-preventable diseases have produced in their heydays, including pertussis's severe morbidity and mortality in infants less than 3 months of age, the deaths from encephalitis and pneumonia from measles and paralytic disease putting children in Drinker respirators (the "iron lung") with poliomyelitis.

But the times and the distrusting mindset of parents are clearly different than in 1955. In the well-publicized Cutter incident in April 1955, more than 200 000 children in 5 Western and Midwestern USA states received a polio vaccine in which the process of inactivating the live virus proved to be defective (1). Within days there were reports of paralysis, and within a month the 1st mass vaccination program against polio had to be abandoned. Subsequent investigations revealed that the vaccine, manufactured by the California-based family firm of Cutter Laboratories, had caused 40 000 cases of polio, leaving 200 children with varying degrees of paralysis and killing 10. Although the vaccination against poliomyelitis took a hit, it was nothing compared to what would have happened to vaccine acceptance if it were to happen today.
