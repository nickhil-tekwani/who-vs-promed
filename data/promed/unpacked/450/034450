The Pentagon on [Thu 4 Jun 2015] asked microbiologists for help in tracking samples of anthrax that the army shipped to at least 51 labs in different states, including Ohio, and 3 foreign countries, according to an announcement shared with Reuters. The request indicates that the Pentagon does not know where the anthrax wound up. [This] suggests there has been some sideways movement of the samples that the Army has no record of.

Researchers who had worked with it at the Dugway Proving Ground biological lab in Utah thought the anthrax samples that they shipped had been killed, but at least one of the labs that received it said it in fact contained live spores.

On [Wed 3 Jun 2015], the Pentagon said the number of labs known to have received live samples of anthrax could rise as its investigation continues.

The Defense Department's request to the American Society for Microbiology [ASM], which the group emailed to its members, indicates how far from complete that investigation might be. But it asked the association to notify its members that the Pentagon is recalling the anthrax samples. The association includes microbiologists who work in academia, commercial labs, government facilities, and elsewhere.

The Pentagon said its goal is to reach scientists "who may have received samples of inactivated _Bacillus anthracis_ supplied by DoD [Department of Defense] from others within their institutions or 3rd parties."

"This was supposed to be dead material," said microbiologist Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and the founding editor of the ASM's journal mBio. "If it was completely inactive you would think that a record of chain of custody would not be required in the same form as if they were dealing with live spores." Most labs keep some sort of notebook or diary of how they handle samples, however. "I suspect this will not be so hard to figure out since labs know who they sent samples to," Casadevall said. "With all the publicity, anyone who got spores from anyone would probably be concerned."

Over the last few weeks, it was revealed, anthrax was sent to 52 laboratories in 18 states plus South Korea, Canada, and Australia. 31 people received treatment for possible exposure. In 2014, a similar incident saw 75 people possibly exposed to the pathogen. Samples of the pathogen that were supposed to be inactivated were sent to laboratories by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2014 and the Department of Defense most recently.

The origin point of this year's [2015] accident was Dugway proving ground in Utah, a military facility which produces anthrax in industrial quantities for the purpose of military research -- detection, mainly, and as a countermeasure.

The post-9/11 era saw a huge expansion in the security state. The bioweapon industry was no different. After the 2001 anthrax attacks -- known to some as "Amerithrax" -- there was a 20- to 40-fold increase in the number of institutions and individuals working with biological weapon agents like anthrax, according to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biosecurity expert at Rutgers university.

In response to questions from the Guardian, a spokesperson for CDC said there were 181 "organizations or entities" such as Dugway registered as working with live anthrax, and 321 in total working with live pathogens. Within those 321 entities, according to the Government Accountability Office, there are some 1495 laboratories accredited under the Federal Select Agent Program to work with live pathogens such as anthrax, and a much larger number working with inert versions of the same pathogens.

There is no official government body to oversee production and research of bioweapons that does not -- as CDC does -- engage in its own active pathogen research, and no apparent fixed official guidelines regarding their handling.

After CDC's own accident with anthrax in 2014, it said it would hold an official investigation and issue a set of binding guidelines. No such comprehensive set of guidelines appears to have been issued and it is unclear exactly under what authority CDC could bind, for example, the Department of Defense. A spokesperson for CDC told the Guardian that it "and [the US Department of Agriculture] work jointly on regulating and overseeing the work done on select agents."

However, a 2013 Government Accountability Office report found "a continued lack of national standards for the design, construction, commissioning, and operation of high-containment laboratories" and said "no single federal agency was responsible for assessing overall laboratory needs." According to Ebright, basic rules, such as having at least 2 people in a lab at any one time, or even that accredited laboratories should have CCTV cameras, do not exist in many such facilities.

Information regarding the latest breach is relatively scarce. Army chief of staff Raymond Odierno told reporters "the best I can tell there was not human error. The fact that this has been obviously happening for some time and perhaps at several different places hints at a systemic issue," said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

Stephen Morse, who also worked at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) between 1995 and 2000 on biodefense, speculated that the process by which machines irradiate the live pathogens, inactivating them, might be "poorly calibrated." "Luckily for us, human beings are relatively resistant to anthrax compared to smallpox," said Morse. "But that's not something we should rely on."

Indeed, according to Ebright, military contracted laboratories across the US routinely work with other, more dangerous pathogens than anthrax -- including several virulent strains of avian flu. A mistake with one of those, instead of anthrax, could have devastating results, including "a global pandemic". Nominally all such labs are working on defenses against these pathogens. But it has become, Ebright said, "all pork-barrel," with at least one lab in every single state. "[It's] spending that can't possibly be defended on any rational basis," he said.

"With each of the incidents in the past there has been a notable absence of responsibility. They know if you mess up, nothing happens; the programs aren't reduced, the personnel suffer no consequences. So it's all about the worst you could possibly have: no one watching, no rules, and no accountability."

But according to Ebright, the real issue isn't a question of danger to the public from the accidental sending itself. It's the chance that the pathogen -- which was the same strain used in the 2001 attack -- could fall into the wrong hands. "Even one spore is a sufficient seed stock from which an amount could grow to mount a biological weapons attack," Ebright said. "The sad circumstance is that this massive effort since 2001 has dramatically increased the chances of a biological weapon attack on the US, precisely by distributing a highly lethal strain of the agent with no structure and no ability to record where they have gone."

Nor is this the only slip-up that has been made at Dugway. In 2011 the base was placed on lockdown for several hours after a vial containing a deadly "nerve agent" went missing, the BBC reported at the time. "The major concern is the security breach, that the material will be transferred to domestic terror and international terror and be used as the seed source for a bomb or weapon," said Ebright. "It would be disappointing if the Department of Defense becomes the supplier for al-Qaida that enables a bioweapon attack."

[According to CBS News (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthrax-investigation-broadens/), the investigation now involves up to 66 laboratories in 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia -- Pennsylvania has been added to the list.

Two facets to keep in mind. If your inactivation technique is 99.999 per cent effective and you have 1x10**9 spores/ml in a vial, some 10 000 spores (that is, 1x10**4) will survive inactivation. Search and you will find. As general Odierno said it was not a matter of human error or accident. It seems that there was a perception that the receiving laboratories would presume that their samples were "dead." Secondly, the strain used was AG-1, which it turns out was the same strain that was recovered from the Amerithrax letters. Oh boy! If they needed a live strain for checking their diagnostic test kits and the competence of the test-kit holders, why did they not use a safe live vaccine, such as Sterne which only kills mice and has but one plasmid, pX01, or the Italian vaccine "CarboSap" which has both plasmids and has been withdrawn by the Italian government because of its poor performance as a vaccine? Sterne is widely available from veterinary clinics worldwide and over the counter from most US livestock feed stores. - Mod.MHJ]
