As many as 18 samples of people from among 20 samples from Pali villagers of Sattari taluka [sub-district] sent for testing have tested positive for Kyasanur forest disease [KFD] which has so far claimed 4 lives ever since the 1st death was reported on 4 Mar [2015].

State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar informed The Navhind Times that the health officials sprung into action to find the cause of death after the 1st case of a woman was reported due to diarrhoea. He said that various teams visited the village on various occasions but failed to find the exact cause of death.

He further said that it was only when the 4th death was reported that the report of samples that were sent to Manipal Centre for Viral Research [MCVR] revealed that the people were afflicted by KFD. He said that the samples of serum sent included that of the 4th person who died of KFD.

The health official said that since the disease was not identified the health officials from Valpoi and the headquarters checked the people with symptoms of the disease for chikungunya, dengue, hepatitis A and E, typhoid, malaria, H1N1, etc., but all the tests proved negative for the diseases, prompting the health officials to send the samples for further testing to Manipal-based institute.

He also said that water sampling was done by the health officials to find presence of any bacteria but nothing could be found. He said that health officials also took stool samples and did stool culture to find whether there was any bacteria growth, which also proved to be negative.

The health department also sought help of Goa Medical College [GMC] in finding the cause of disease but the reason behind the disease could not be ascertained. He also said that since four patients did not respond to medication at community health centre in Valpoi they were referred to the GMC well in advance where their condition deteriorated and they succumbed.

Dr Betodkar further said that after it was found that there was prevalence of KFD in the area, the health department officials together with others swung into action and urged the people to take action to prevent hard tick bites, from which the disease [virus] was passed. He said that people have been advised to avoid bushes where hard ticks could be present.

The state epidemiologist also informed that as soon as the first samples sent to MCVR revealed presence of KFD, the head of the department of the institute came down personally with a team of expert to make further studies of the surrounding areas in Pali and collected took samples of 4 persons with symptoms of disease, which turned out to be positive.

Dr Betodkar also said that a team of National Centre for Disease Control, which had been informed of mysterious disease, was presently in Goa to study epidemiological features of disease and advise the state health authorities on prevention of spread of disease and measure to control. An expert from Bangalore is expected to join the team on [Fri 17 Apr 2015], he added.

Meanwhile, taking cognisance of the Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), state health authorities, the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services and the forest department have conducted an awareness programme in the Pali village, which has been affected by the disease. Villagers have been informed about the need to take appropriate measures to control the spread of the disease. The programme was organised by the Community Health Centre at Valpoi. Dr Kartavi Mashelkar from the directorate of health services made the villagers aware about the disease. In her lecture, she stressed upon the need to stay away from the ticks and informed the villagers of the steps to be taken before going to forest areas and on returning from there.

Meanwhile, Dr Mashelkar said that the state health authorities lack the vaccine for this particular disease and that they are in talks with other states to provide the same. She assured that the vaccine will be available soon in the state. Range Forest Officer of Mhadei wildlife sanctuary Paresh Parob and Valpoi veterinary official Dr Betkikar also spoke on how to control the tick-borne disease.

Medical officer Dr Shyam Kankonkar, Dr Vaibhav Gadgil, medical councillor Aqueeb Shaikh, MPHW [Multi Purpose Health Worker] Vishnu Gaonkar, BJP [Indian People's Party] leader Vishwajit Rane were also present for the programme.

[This is a follow up report of KFD in Goa to the ProMED-mail posting of 15 Apr 2015. The 18 positive samples (serological or virological by isolation or PCR?) of the 20 samples tested is new information, as are the details of the public education efforts in the affected village. As noted in the previous post, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case-fatality rate is from 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family.

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
