Few, very mild cases of a febrile disease in dairy cows suspected to be epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) or bluetongue, accompanied by a drop in milk production, have been reported by the practitioners of 3 dairy farms in the Jordan Valley (2 of them adjacent to the northern part of the Dead Sea, one south of the Sea of Galilee). PCR for EHD have been reported to be positive. Alertness requested.

[Outbreaks of epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) have been previously diagnosed in Israel in the fall of 2006, serotyped as EHDV-7. Later, EHD has been added to OIE's list of reportable diseases.

EHD, caused by an orbivirus, is clinically undistinguishable from bluetongue. It is a vector-borne infectious noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer (in North America) and cattle. Sheep and goats might also be susceptible, but usually do not develop overt disease. The disease has been diagnosed recently in Tunisia (serotyping pending).

Subscribers are referred to OIE's Terrestrial Manual of Animal Diseases, chapter 2.1.4B, version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04b_EHD.pdf.

EHD is not zoonotic.

Confirmation of the suspected cases or otherwise, and -- in case confirmed -- serotyping, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
