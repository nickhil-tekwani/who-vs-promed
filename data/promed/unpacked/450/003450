----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bananas are one of the most important fruit crops and a staple food in many developing tropical and subtropical regions. In southern Africa, banana production is threatened by viral diseases including _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV), cause of the most devastating virus disease of banana.

A survey for BBTV in South Africa in 1996 confirmed the absence of BBTV in Mpumalanga Province. No other surveys were conducted since then in South Africa. In June 2015, 5 [cultivar] 'Williams' plants, showing symptoms resembling BBTV, including streaks on the pseudostem and upright bunchy appearance, were submitted to Agricultural Research Council-Plant Protection Research (ARC-PPR). The plants originated from the KwaZulu Natal region.

BBTV-specific PCR was done, amplifying a fragment of the putative replicase gene. The 5 plants tested positive for BBTV and the PCR products of 2 were sequenced. A non infected banana plant was included as a control. Phylogenetic analyses grouped them with the South Pacific group that included accessions from India, Pakistan and other regions in Africa, with a sequence identity of 99 per cent. The 5 plants tested positive for BBTV in ELISA, confirming the previous positive results.

44 additional samples were collected randomly from 14 blocks on the same farm and included symptomatic and non symptomatic plants. BBTV was detected with ELISA in 34 of these plants; 10 tested negative. In one block, all the sampled plants (4) tested negative. In 3 other blocks, positive and negative plants were recorded. In the remaining 10 blocks, all collected plants tested positive. Intense management strategies, including removal of infected plants and spraying for aphids, were implemented on the farm to prohibit the spread of the virus.

This is the 1st report of BBTV on _Musa_ spp. from South Africa. Strict phytosanitary measures will be necessary to prevent the spread of this virus to other regions in the country. The need to do extensive surveys for the presence of BBTV in other banana production regions in South Africa is highlighted by this finding.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the type member of the genus _Babuvirus_ (family Nanoviridae) and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands.

BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools). Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting or natural cluster of plants is considered impossible, and the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates from different regions: the South Pacific group (including Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga, Western Samoa) and the Asian group (Philippines, Taiwan, Viet Nam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 per cent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.

'Williams' is one of the main commercial cultivars and belongs to the Giant Cavendish group (AAA; see links below).
