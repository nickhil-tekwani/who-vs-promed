Alzheimer's could have bacteria as source, research shows
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Research into the cause of Alzheimer's disease has for the first time
identified a possible link with bacterial infection, health experts said
Tuesday. The bacteria _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, a known cause of common
respiratory ailments such as sinusitis and bronchitis, was found in the
brains of 17 out of 19 Alzheimer victims examined by a team of university
biologists in Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore. The same organism showed
up in the brain of only one of 19 patients who had died of other diseases.
Chlamydial infection was most pronounced in regions of the brain that had
sustained damage typical of Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia that
strikes one in 10 elderly people and leads to forgetfulness, disorientation
and confusion. There is no known cure.*
Up to now, suspected causes of Alzheimer's disease have ranged from
environmental toxins and genetic predisposition to abnormal protein levels
in the brain. British researchers caused a stir early in 1997 when they
presented evidence of a link between the disorder and the virus which
causes cold sores. "People have been looking at viruses. They haven't been
looking at bacteria," said Zaven Khachaturian, director of the Alzheimer
Association's Ronald and Nancy Reagan Institute. "This study needs to be
looked at with great care, and replicated." The three-year study by
researchers from Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Wayne State
University and Johns Hopkins University could shed light on the cause of
inflammation which has been found in the brains of victims of Alzheimer's.
"What we have here is an organism that can get inside (brain) cells and can
potentially trigger them to cause inflammation," said Brian Balin, an
Allegheny University neurobiologist who helped lead the research.
Describing the _Chlamydia_ bacteria as a possible new risk factor for
Alzheimer's, researchers said they hoped their efforts would lead to new
treatments for victims. The study's results appeared in this month's issue
of the journal, Medical Microbiology and Immunology...
