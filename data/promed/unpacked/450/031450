Health officials in Syracuse are investigating whether 3 women with a rare
bacterial infection ate recalled food. The Syracuse area residents have
been diagnosed with listeriosis, which is a potentially fatal bacterial
disease caused by eating contaminated food. Onondaga County health
officials say the 3 women, ages 48, 70, and 77, were hospitalized.
The USA Food and Drug Administration announced on 28 Jun 2005 a recall of
Golden Taste Tuna Deluxe, Scallion Tuna Deluxe, and White Fish Salad
because they may contain an organism that can cause listeriosis.

[This FDA recall is one of many for _Listeria_ contamination. ProMED does
not post them unless they are linked to human cases, are related to an
unusual situation, or involve botulism. It is yet to be determined if this
one is the root cause. - Mod.LL]
