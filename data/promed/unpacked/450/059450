From 1 to 31 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health has reported 53 suspected
cases of meningococcal disease including 6 deaths (case-fatality rate, 11.3
percent) in Adi health zone, Province Orientale, in the northeastern part
of the country, bordering Uganda.
Two cerebrospinal fluid specimens have tested positive for _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup A by latex test.
A vaccination campaign targeting 99 400 people is being prepared and will
be synchronized with Uganda, which is currently experiencing an outbreak of
meningococcal disease in the neighboring area. The International
Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis
Control has agreed to provide 115 830 doses of bivalent meningococcal
vaccine (A/C) along with injection materials and oily chloramphenicol.
WHO and Medecins sans Frontieres, Switzerland are working with the Ministry
of Health to contain the outbreak. Case management, community education and
strengthened surveillance are continuing.

From 1 to 28 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health of the Government of
Southern Sudan has reported 666 suspected cases of meningococcal disease
including 70 deaths (case-fatality rate: 10.5 percent) from 7 out of 10
states in Southern Sudan. Some of these cases were also reported as early
as October 2006.
The population in the affected states includes returnees as well as
displaced people living in areas of difficult access and disperse
population settlements. A number of cerebrospinal fluid specimens have
tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A by culture as well
as by latex test.
Several field investigations have been conducted through mobilization of
rapid response teams, case management has been standardized in all the
affected states, community mobilization and health education are ongoing
and surveillance has been strengthened to ensure early case detection and
monitoring of the epidemic. A mass vaccination campaign targeting the
high-risk population in Warrab state, one of the most affected states
during this outbreak, has already started targeting over 45 000 people. The
WHO Country Office has provided the government with injection materials,
oily chloramphenicol, transport media and rapid test kits to control this
outbreak.

[3] Uganda (West Nile)

Meningitis is spreading fast in West Nile, leading to the postponement of
the beginning of the school term in the region. A total of 520 cases have
been reported, up from 342 cases announced last week in the districts of
Arua, Koboko and Yumbe, with 15 deaths registered.
As a result, the regional meningitis task force has directed that opening
of schools in Arua and Maracha-Terego districts be postponed by 2 weeks, to
allow mass vaccination. Schools countrywide were to open on Mon, 5 Feb 2007
for the new academic year.
In a circular copied to district leaders, Arua vice-chairman Kamilo Sabo,
said the postponement affected all government and private schools. The task
force, in collaboration with the WHO and Doctors without Borders, starts
mass vaccination on 2 Feb 2007 in Koboko, Omugo and Ayivu sub-counties,
which have the highest number of cases.
It will then roll to all affected sub-counties in Arua. The next 10 days
will cover Maracha/Terego, Koboko and Yumbe districts, medical sources
revealed.

In several recent meningococcal updates on ProMED, serogroup X was
discussed. The following is the abstract from Boisier P, Nicolas P, Djibo
S, et al: Meningococcal Meningitis: Unprecedented Incidence of Serogroup X
Related Cases in 2006 in Niger. Clin Infect Dis 2007;44: 657-63:
In Niger, epidemic meningococcal meningitis is primarily caused by
_Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) serogroup A. However, since 2002, Nm
serogroup W135 has been considered to be a major threat that has not yet
been realized, and an unprecedented incidence of Nm serogroup X (NmX)
meningitis was observed in 2006.
Methods. Meningitis surveillance in Niger is performed on the basis of
reporting of clinically suspected cases. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens are
sent to the reference laboratory in Niamey, Niger. Culture, latex
agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction are used whenever appropriate.
Since 2004, after the addition of a polymerase chain reaction-based
nonculture assay that was developed to genogroup isolates of NmX,
polymerase chain reaction testing allows for the identification of Nm
serogroup A, Nm serogroup B, Nm serogroup C, NmX, Nm serogroup Y, and Nm
serogroup W135.
Results. From Jan to Jun 2006, a total of 4185 cases of meningitis were
reported, and 2905 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were laboratory tested.
NmX meningitis represented 51 percent of 1139 confirmed cases of
meningococcal meningitis, but in southwestern Niger, it represented 90
percent. In the agglomeration of Niamey, the reported cumulative incidence
of meningitis was 73 cases per 100 000 population and the cumulative
incidence of confirmed NmX meningitis was 27.5 cases per 100 000 population
(74.6 cases per 100 000 population in children aged 59 years). NmX isolates
had the same phenotype (X : NT : P1.5), and all belonged to the same
sequence type (ST-181) as the NmX isolates that were circulating in Niamey
in the 1990s. Nm serogroup W135 represented only 2.1 percent of identified
meningococci.
Conclusions. This is, to our knowledge, the 1st report of such a high
incidence of NmX meningitis, although an unusually high incidence of NmX
meningitis was also observed in the 1990s in Niamey. The increasing
incidence of NmX meningitis is worrisome, because no vaccine has been
developed against this serogroup. Countries in the African meningitis belt
must prepare to face this potential new challenge.
