People are being reminded to take care when cooking raw breaded chicken products such as goujons and nuggets after 2 ongoing outbreaks of salmonellosis. Products are being recalled by Iceland [Foods Ltd.], Aldi, and Lidl.

2 particular strains of salmonellosis are being investigated as they are linked to frozen, raw, breaded food products. Aside from raw, breaded uncooked chicken products, _Salmonella_ can be found in raw meat (processed and unprocessed), undercooked poultry, and unpasteurised milk. Inadequate cooking and cross-contamination during food preparation can lead to salmonellosis.

The reminder comes from The Food Standards Agency (FSA) along with Food Standards Scotland (FSS) and Public Health England (PHE), Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Wales. Colin Sullivan, chief operating officer of the FSA, said: "Our advice is to always take care when storing, handling, and cooking these types of frozen breaded chicken products to help reduce the risk of food poisoning to you and your family. You should always check the cooking instructions on food packaging, as different brands of the same product might have different instructions. Cooking food at the right temperature and for the correct length of time will ensure that any harmful bacteria are killed."
