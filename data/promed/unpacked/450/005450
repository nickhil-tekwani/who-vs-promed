Nipah virus is back. Last week, after a 23 year old man tested positive in Kerala, 318 people (including everyone in contact the patient) have been kept under observation, and 52 of them have been added to the high-risk category. Several states like Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and districts such as Kanyakumari, Coimbatore, Mysuru, Udupi sharing the border with Kerala are on high alert.

According to the World Health Organization, fruit bats are the carriers of the deadly virus. The rare brain-damaging infection transmits through the partially-eaten fruits by infected bats.

Last year in May [actually 2018. - Mod.SH], the virus claimed 17 lives in Kerala. The fear crept in internationally as well when the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment issued a ban on imports of fruits and vegetables from Kerala.

While summer fruits are delicious and irresistible, you might want to exercise caution before indulging in them. Here are certain steps you must follow before eating mangoes, lychees, and dates:
- prefer fresh, ripe and non-withered fruits;
- avoid over-ripe and wet fruits, especially their colour appears different;
- look for visible defects like cuts, dirt, or deformities before eating them;
- ensure the fruits don't have a strange smell;
- if you are buying fruits from the supermarket, don't opt for box that has damaged produce;
- wash fruits and vegetables properly before eating;
- it would be wiser to peel fruits before consuming them.

You might want to go easy on guavas this summer. While there is no confirmation yet, a young Kerala student recently claimed to have contracted the virus after eating guavas. A team of medical professionals from Thiruvananthapuram are investigating the matter.

Drinking date palm sap, palm toddy, or juice can also [result in] infection. For a non-vegetarian, partially-cooked meat of an infected animal can lead to the spread of the virus.

Steps to ensure you are consuming the right thing:
- avoid fruit juices unless you know the source;
- avoid consuming unpasteurised fruit juices;
- boil freshly collected date palm juice before consuming.

The Nipah virus symptoms are flu-like, ranging from fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, to severe signs like seizures and neurological indications (indicating acute encephalitis).

Other preventive measures:
- avoid close (unprotected) physical contact with infected people;
- wear NH95-grade and higher masks that protect the wearer from breathing in small particles in the air;
- wash hands regularly with soap;
- avoid being around animal pens;
- maintain your and children's personal hygiene.

[Nipah virus (NIV) infections occurred in Kerala in 2018. Now there is a new case, apparently associated with consumption of Nipah virus in guavas that had been contaminated by flying fox fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_), the reservoir hosts of the virus.

As of 17 Jul 2018, a total of 19 NiV cases, including 17 deaths, were reported from Kerala state: 18 of the cases were laboratory confirmed, and the deceased index case was suspected to have NVI but could not be tested. The 2018 outbreak was localized to 2 districts in Kerala state: Kozhikode and Malappuram. At that time, 12 of 36 fruit bats tested at the National Institute of Virology were positive for (NIV).

It is possible that NIV is now established in Kerala in these bats. People in Kerala would be wise to follow the recommendations given in the report above. - Mod.TY
