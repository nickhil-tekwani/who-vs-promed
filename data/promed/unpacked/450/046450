JOHNES DISEASE, SHEEP - AUSTRALIA (NEW SOUTH WALES)

At least 320,000 sheep in 183 New South Wales flocks will be slaughtered as
part of a campaign to eradicate Ovine Johnes Disease . The total NSW flock
numbers about 43 million sheep and lambs. Ovine Johnes Disease is an
intestinal bacterial wasting disorder similar to tuberculosis and leprosy
in humans. It is ingested from infected pasture and spread via manure. With
a pasture life of at least two years, infected land is generally switched
from sheep to cattle or cropping.
Besides the 183 flocks already identified, a further 120,000 sheep in 71
commercial flocks in NSW have been classed as "suspect" because of contact
with infected flocks. A spokesman for the Minister for Agriculture, Mr
Amery, has
foreshadowed a $5 million State Government compensation payout to the
farmers affected.
