American scientists have devised a new technique to detect West Nile virus
which killed seven people in an unusual outbreak in New York last year. The
technique uses a sample of fluid taken through a spinal tap (lumbar
puncture) to detect the [viral RNA]. "We have established a sensitive and
specific real-time PCR method for detection of West Nile virus," Ian
Lipkin, of the University of California, Irvine, said in a letter to The
Lancet.
PCR, polymerase chain reaction, is a technique used to amplify a fragment
of [RNA] to detect the viral sequence. "Analysis of specimens obtained
during the 1999 New York outbreak indicated the presence of viral sequences
in cerebrospinal fluid of all of four individuals with fatal outcomes, and
in only one of four who survived," Irvine and his colleagues added.
West Nile virus, which struck more than 60 people in New York, is usually
found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The New York outbreak was the
first in the Americas. The virus is spread from [mosquitoes to] birds to
mosquitoes to humans. Government officials in the United States said last
month that the virus will probably not be eliminated in the Western
Hemisphere but added that it can be contained by controlling the mosquitoes
that spread it. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

[Ian Lipkin, who directs a top notch group of researchers, was the bloke
who was first to recognize that the virus infecting New Yorkers (humans and
birds) last summer was not St. Louis encephalitis virus. He erred in
calling the virus Kunjin-West Nile-like but he certainly did not call it a
St. Louis encephalitis-like virus or St. Louis encephalitis virus. Now he
has developed a real-time PCR, which should be extremely helpful to
laboratory diagnosticians in the coming months, particularly given the
difficulties states are having in establishing adequate diagnostics. Now,
if the USDA will only loosen its regulations a bit to allow appropriate
reagents to get into the hands of those who need them, we might be in an
improved position. - Mod. CHC]
