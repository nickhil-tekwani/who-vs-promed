LIONS, FATAL ILLNESS --EAST AFRICA (2)
================================
The problem has been isolated by pathologists from the veterinary school
at Tennessee. It turns out to be primarily canine distemper.
There is now work going on on the transmission cycle ... it appears to
involve both feral and native dogs. Massive vaccination programs are underway.

The Nature paper describes the identification of a morbillivirus, closely
related to an endemic canine distemper virus, that emerged, subsequent to 1991,
and killed a high percentage of the Serengeti lions in 1994.
