[On Tue 12 Nov 2013, ProMED-mail posted a press report which was given the title: "Hepatitis C - USA (05): New York City, increasing incidence (archive number) 20131113.2053830." Katherine Bornschlegel of the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has indicated that this heading is incorrect and that it should be amended for the following reasons. - Mod.CP]:

"In NYC, there is in fact no evidence that the incidence of new hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection is increasing. However, because so many people have been living with chronic infection for over 20 to 30 years, the number of HCV-related deaths is increasing nationally (ref. Ly et al, Ann Intern Med 2012; 156:271-278) and in NYC (unpublished data). The incidence of HCV infection is challenging to estimate, because most new infections are asymptomatic, and there is no lab test to differentiate new infection from long-standing (chronic) infection."
