A raft of recent cases of tuberculosis among captive Asian elephants has
sparked concern among vets who treat large animals. The infection is
believed to have been passed to the pachyderms by contact with human
handlers. Of the 18 elephants in zoos and circuses diagnosed since 1996, 6
of the animals have died, although what role TB played in the deaths
remains unclear.
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ is a major killer of people worldwide, and
drug-resistant strains of the microbe are a growing threat in the United
States, health experts say. Because the bacterium doesn't seem to affect
elephants in their native habitat, researchers believe infections have
occurred through contact with infected handlers, either in Asia, where the
animals were captured, or in North America.
However, elephant experts stress that they don't know much about the way
the disease moves among the animals. It's not known, for example, whether
infected elephants can transmit it to other elephants, or whether contact
with a person afflicted with the disease is necessary. So how does TB show
up in elephants? Much the same as it does in people, says Dr. Richard
Montali, a veterinarian and head of pathology at the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.
"Usually there's very little to go by" at first, says Montali, co-author of
a paper describing elephant TB in a recent issue of Zoo Biology. "It's an
insidious, smoldering disease." Over time, however, affected animals can
develop respiratory symptoms, like coughing, and they can lose weight and
grow listless, just like people with the bacterial disease.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over zoo
animals, issued guidelines in 1997 that called for TB screening of all
elephants in captivity. "Trunk wash" cultures turned up the bacterium in 18
of 539 animals, or 3.3 percent. Agriculture officials recommend treating
infected elephants with the same drugs used on people. But a year-long
course of antibiotics, given orally or rectally, for an 8000-pound adult
Asian elephant can quickly run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Asian
elephants, smaller than their African counterparts, also are far less
common, with only about 35 000 remaining, conservationists say.

[There were many documented cases of humans transmitting _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ to dairy cows before the United States tuberculosis control
campaign made significant gains in the first half of last century (ah, I
never tire of the new decade, century, millennium novelty). So it may not
surprise anyone if an analogous phenomenon occurs in captive elephants,
particularly if they have close contact with their keepers. It would be
interesting to know if the type of housing or environment was a risk factor
for transmission. - Mod.PC
