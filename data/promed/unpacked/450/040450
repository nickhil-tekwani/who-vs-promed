An unvaccinated horse in Winthrop, Minnesota has tested positive for West Nile Virus and is severely ill. The 1.5-year-old Friesian stallion has been unable to stand for a week and is receiving supportive care. This is the 1st confirmed case of 2016 affecting a Minnesota horse.

West Nile Virus is regularly found in the United States, and birds serve as the primary host of the disease. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus from birds and then carry it to horses or people. The virus can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Infected horses may or may not show neurological symptoms and many recover completely, especially with annual vaccinations.

Vaccines for horses are widely available and have been proven to be effective in preventing infection. Steps can also be taken to reduce disease risk by reducing mosquitoes.
- Change water in drinking troughs every week.
- Mow long grass.
- Drain stagnant water puddles.
- Remove items mosquitoes use for breeding grounds, like old tires and tin cans.
- Place and maintain screens over windows and stable doors.
- Horses and people can also be protected from mosquitoes by using repellents.

Positive test results for West Nile Virus must be reported to the Board of Animal Health. See annual maps of positive cases in horses on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service website.

This is a high risk time of the year for West Nile Virus transmission. People are at risk too, and the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises wearing repellent, especially if you're outside at dawn or dusk. Learn more about the virus on the MDH website.

A horse in Mille Lacs County has the 2nd confirmed case of West Nile Virus so far this summer. Dr. Paul Anderson is from the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. He says the horse was diagnosed yesterday [Tue 4 Aug 2016]. "The horse is also clinically ill. It is able to get up with some assistance, and it is eating and drinking, so we'll see how things go. But, the prognosis might not be too bad. But, the horse is definitely showing signs of neurological disease."

The 1st case was in a horse near Winthrop in Sibley County.

West Nile virus is regularly found in the U.S. Birds serve as the primary host of the disease. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus from birds and then carry it to horses and humans. The virus can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Many infected horses recover completely, especially with annual vaccinations.

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture has received a report of a horse in the Panhandle that has contracted West Nile Virus (WNV). Horses can become infected with WNV after being bitten by an infected mosquito; however, they cannot transmit WNV to other horses or people after they contract the disease. While many horses can be exposed to the disease and not show symptoms, about 35 percent will become ill and will have to be potentially euthanized.

There are 4 WNV vaccines that are licensed through the United States Department of Agriculture to use on horses. If you have not vaccinated your horse or are unsure if your horse has been vaccinated, please contact your local veterinarian. Vaccines have been shown to be the best strategy to help prevent WNV infection in horses.

[If West Nile is being diagnosed in horses it means that it is circulating in those areas and humans are at risk.

There are effective equine vaccines for West Nile.
