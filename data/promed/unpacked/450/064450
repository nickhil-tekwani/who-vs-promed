[1] Belgium: SBV identified in culicoides
Date: Sat 10 Mar 2012
From: Thierry van den Berg [edited]


Belgium: Pools of Culicoides spp. found positive for Schmallenberg virus by RT-qPCR
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since it was first identified in Germany in Nov 2011, Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been confirmed in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, and Italy. Knowing that related viruses belonging to the same Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses are generally spread by midges and mosquitoes, it was assumed that these vectors could also spread SBV.

In Belgium, _Culicoides spp._ have been monitored since 2007 through a surveillance program financed by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FAVV-AFSCA).

In order to examine the potential role of midges in the spread of SBV, pools of midges were analyzed at CODA-CERVA by RT-qPCR. Midges had been captured outdoors in September and October 2011 with an UV light trap at Betekom (Province of Vlaams Brabant, Belgium) by scientists of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM, Antwerp). The pools consisted of 10 heads of culicoides each identified morphologically at species level. Although only 23 pools have been examined so far, SBV has been detected in 2 of them (by RT-qPCRs detecting S and L segments of SBV according to protocols provided by FLI, Germany). One pool consisted of _C. obsoletus s.s._ caught on 7 Sep 2011 (Ct=34.9 and 37.0 for S and L segment resp.) and another pool consisted of _C. Dewulfi_ caught on 4 Oct 2011 (Ct=38.1 for S and negative and L segments). These results strongly confirm the role of biting midges in the transmission and spread of SBV. This indication is strengthened by the fact that the examined pools consisted exclusively of heads, suggesting that midges act as real amplification vectors and were not simply SBV positive after a blood meal on viraemic animals.

More pools collected by the monitoring project will be tested to identify other possible SBV vectors among _Culicoides_ species and to shed light on the time of introduction of SBV in this and other regions. Pools of mosquitoes will also be tested to assess their potential role in the spread of SBV.

[The above information is a welcome additional contribution of the scientific community to the study of the emerging SBV. Scientific fraternity and exemplary transparency have, fortunately, characterised the course of the SBV epizootic since its early stages (as demonstrated also in item 2).

The fact that a pool of midges caught on 7 Sep 2011 in Belgium was found SBV-infected is in line with estimates that the virus was already circulating in Aug 2011 (see commentary and reference in posting 20120211.1038921). Further studies will, hopefully, unravel its earlier history and geographical distribution; most important, its route and mode of introduction.

The latter issue is important also in regard to the control measures to be decided upon, including vaccination. Contrary to countries traditionally known to suffer from periodic outbreaks of AH (arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly) caused in susceptible ruminants by the orthobunyavirus Akabane virus (for example, Japan, Australia, Israel), the north western European countries affected by SBV are -- most probably -- not situated on the verge of endemically infected territories, where the virus circulates regularly without clinical expression. The virus "jumped" into north Europe, not gradually, stepwise as would have been expected if climatic changes were at the background, but literally "out of the blue"; similar to the BTV-8 event which started in the same area in 2006. It is assumed that the newly introduced virus(es) encountered a local, receptive, and efficient vector, most probably culicoides population(s), resulting in their extensive and rapid spread. This hypothesis calls for further profound study.

[2] Germany: SBV electron microscopy

First visualization of Schmallenberg virus
------------------------------------------
Scientists of FLI on the Isle of Riems have 1st succeeded in visualizing the so-called "Schmallenberg virus" [SBV].

The work group for electron microscopy led by Dr Harald Granzow of the Institute of Infectology of the FLI on the Isle of Riems has visualized the pathogen by high-resolution electron microscopic analyses of infected cells. The shape of the virus is similar to that of other bunyaviruses; the virus is visible as a membrane-enveloped particle with a diameter of about 100 nanometers (1nm = 1 millionth of a millimeter). The membrane envelops the 3 segments of the genetic information. "This is another important step forward in the understanding of SBV", explains the president of the FLI, Prof Dr Dr h c Thomas C Mettenleiter.

Schmallenberg virus was described for the first time worldwide in November by a group of scientists of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology of the FLI, led by Dr Martin Beer. It is transmitted by insects and is responsible for malformations in newborn lambs and calves.
