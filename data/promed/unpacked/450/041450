The Ukraine Ministry of Health reported 88 outbreaks of botulism in 2021, as a result of which 98 people became ill, including 3 children. A total of 10 cases were fatal and 79 patients were given anti-botulinum serum. This compares with 2020, when Ukraine reported 65 cases and 4 deaths. In 2021, cases of botulism were registered in all regions of Ukraine, except Zakarpattia, Luhansk and Mykolaiv regions. The highest number of cases was registered in Volyn oblast - 9, 8 cases were recorded in Zhytomyr, Lviv and Chernihiv oblasts and 7 cases were reported in Cherkasy oblast.

The main causes of botulism food poisoning were the consumption of dried/salted/dried freshwater fish of home cooking or of unknown origin, which was purchased on the natural markets (30 cases - 30.6%) and canned home-cooked meat (30 cases - 30.6%).

Foodborne botulism occurs when the spores of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ germinate after improper food preparation and the bacteria produce toxin in food that is later eaten. Botulinum toxin is one of the most potent neurotoxins known.

Typically, in a few hours to several days after ingestion of the contaminated food the person starts to show the classic symptoms; blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty in swallowing. Gastrointestinal symptoms may or may not occur. If untreated, the paralysis always descends through the body starting at the shoulders and working its way down. The most serious complication of botulism is respiratory failure where it is fatal in up to 10% of people. It may take months before recovery is complete.

If the disease is caught early enough it can be treated with antitoxin. If paralysis and respiratory failure happen, the person may be on a ventilator for several weeks.

[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users.

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the most common. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E, which is usually associated with fish and marine life-associated cases, is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). A recent review regarding botulism in Ukraine (2) reported that from 1955 to 2018, 8614 cases of botulism were recorded in Ukraine, causing 659 deaths. The distribution of types of botulism toxins was represented by type A (7.97%), B (59.64%), suspected as C (0.56%), E (25.47%), others (5.33%), and unidentified (1.04%).
