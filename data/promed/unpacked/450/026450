An outbreak of hepatitis at Kalma camp for internally displaced people [IDP] in South Darfur state [Sudan] has led to the death of 150 people and infected 500 others. Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, is commonly caused by viral infection. According to WHO, hepatitis E is included among the most concerning iterations of the disease (types A, B, C, D and E) because of its epidemic potential.

The humanitarian affairs officer for the IDP, Essa Salih, told Sudan Tribune on Wednesday [3 Sep 2014] that 150 people, mostly children, pregnant women and elderly, [have] died, while 500 others have been infected with hepatitis due to rapid spread of the disease in the past 2 months [Jul-Sep 2014]. He added that the proliferation of the disease was caused by malnutrition and lack of adequate health services inside the camp, pointing out that most of the infected people died at Nyala Teaching Hospital.

Saleh noted the disease became the biggest threat to IDP in South Darfur state following expulsion of foreign aid groups in 2009. Immediately after the 1st arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Sudan's president Omer Hassan al-Bashir in March 2009, Sudan expelled 13 aid groups from Darfur, accusing it of collaborating with the war crime courts. Saleh called for the urgent intervention of the health ministry and aid groups to contain the disease in Kalma camp, warning against its spread to other IDP camps. He also pointed to the growing malnutrition diseases among children and elderly in the camps.

The health minister in South Darfur state, Omer Suleiman, for his part confirmed existence of hepatitis E cases, saying he hasn't yet received precise numbers, stressing ongoing efforts to remedy the situation.

Nyala Teaching Hospital suffers from a severe shortage of doctors, particularly specialists, following resignations of significant numbers of them due to government's failure to pay their salary arrears for years.

Hepatitis E has been a significant issue in Darfur. The following is from WHO regarding the disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/):

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus.

Transmission
------------
The hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include:

- foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals;
- transfusion of infected blood products;
- vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus.

Although humans are considered the natural host for the hepatitis E virus, antibodies to the hepatitis E virus or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species.

Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. The ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has also been identified as the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas.

The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of the hepatitis E virus in feces. - Mod.LL
