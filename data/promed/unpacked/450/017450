Eleven children from Beit She'an were treated for rabies last week,
after a rabid dog they'd been in contact with bit 2 other people in
the town. The small, long-haired dog, whose owner neglected to
vaccinate, lived near the school; children used to pet and play with
her. When the dog was diagnosed with rabies, the Health Ministry
asked anyone who may have touched her to report to the nearest health
clinic. This is the 11th rabies case -- 7 involving pet dogs, 4 in
[other] animals -- diagnosed in the Galilee and Golan since the
beginning of the year [2010, see comment]. Last year, 58 cases of
rabies were recorded, mostly in the north, compared to 9-12 annually
before that.

[A 12th case of rabies has been lab-confirmed in the meantime; it
involved a jackal in the vicinity of Beit-Shean, where the 11th (dog)
case was observed.

A more exhaustive version of the above article is available in the
Hebrew edition of Haaretz at
<http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1154601.html>. It underlines
the obstacles, recently exercised by the environmental protection
minister, Gilad Erdan, in authorizing the culling of stray dogs (see

The Veterinary Authorities in Israel are alarmed about the sharp rise
in the number of rabies cases among animals, 58 cases in 2009, and
already 4 have been confirmed in January 2010 [this figure has become
11 as of 7 Mar 2010. - Mod.AS]. 74 percent of these [2009] cases were
recorded in dogs (n=36) and jackals (n=10), whereas the rest were
diagnosed in 9 ruminants, 3 foxes, one donkey, one stone marten and
one cat. This compares with only 12 cases during 2008, 15 cases in
2007, and 9 cases in 2006. Between 1979 and 2000, foxes constituted
the main reservoir of rabies in Israel, but the implementation of the
fox-targeted oral vaccination programme, initiated on a limited scale
in 1998 and then more comprehensively through 2003, led to a dramatic
decrease in the number of confirmed rabies cases. The disease
practically disappeared from almost all of Israel.

However, a new outbreak started in the northeast region of Israel in
2005, with a few cases sporadically appearing along the Syrian
border. During 2005-2009, stray dogs emerged as the main animal
reservoir in northern Israel, while lower numbers of rabies cases
were confirmed in other animals. Biological and molecular
characterization of rabies isolates from infected foxes and dogs
showed that they differed, suggesting 2 distinct and separate
lineages. The analysis of the G-L intergenic region sequences of
Turkish, Jordanian, southern Lebanese and northeastern Israeli rabies
virus isolates indicated that dog-mediated rabies showed a close
relationship to Turkish dog rabies. It, therefore, appears that the
canine rabies outbreaks in Israel resulted from north to south
movement of infected animals in the eastern Mediterranean area.

From 1995 to 2002, 14 human rabies cases were reported in Lebanon,
and a dog bite was identified as the source of exposure in the
majority of cases. 24 fatal human cases of rabies occurred in Syria
between 1997 and 2002. The last 3 human cases in Israel were
confirmed in 1996-1997 [A single case was also reported in 2002. - Mod.AS].

The transition from fox-mediated rabies to dog-mediated rabies in the
northern Israel area is of great concern to public health officials
because of the close contact between dogs and humans. Measures
undertaken by the Israeli Veterinary Authorities include
intensification of supervision of compulsory pet dog vaccination,
increased frequency and density of oral vaccine bait distribution in
affected areas and initiation of cooperation with Jordan in a joint
wildlife oral rabies vaccination project in the Jordan Valley. A new
public awareness campaign has also emphasized the importance of
annual dog vaccination and reporting to the proper medical
authorities of any close physical contact with suspect animals,
particularly wildlife.

Online information on rabies incidence in Israel can be found at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2010.html>; a paper
entitled "Emergence of dog rabies in the northern region of Israel"
was published by David et al. in Epidemiol. Infect. (2009) Vol. 137, p544-548.

[As of 4 Mar 2010, 12 rabies cases in animals have been lab-confirmed
in Israel (all in the northeastern zone): 7 dogs, 3 jackals, one
grazing-beef-cow and one sheep. During the parallel periods of
previous years, the all-national numbers were: 2005 - 3; 2006 - 1;
2007 - 0; 2008 - 0; and 2009 - 6.

The following information, kindly obtained from the Epidemiology
department in the Ministry of Health, provides the annual numbers of
humans who had to undergo post-exposure rabies vaccination by the
Ministry's 3 sub-district offices covering northeastern Israel:

Sub-district: Zefat / Kinneret / Affula
2005: 332 / 93 / 309
2006: 106 / 110 / 291
2007: 161 / 103 / 393
2008: 235 / 145 / 402
2009: 700 / 192 / 618

The significant increase in the number of exposed/treated humans is
related to the increased number of rabid canids within the affected
zone. These people had, predominantly, contacts with infected or
suspected dogs, both owned and strays. As explained in the above
review (item 2), the spread of the dog-mediated virus is attributed
to stray dogs and jackals.

In the absence of regionally-internationally coordinated control
activities in stray dogs, and in view of the apparent inadequacy of
the distributed fox-oral-vaccine baits in immunising dogs (against
this particular virus clade?), continuous measures to decrease the
stray dog population within the affected area and to maintain its
decreased density are inevitable if containing the further virus
spread is to be attempted. Refraining from doing so is a cause for
grave concern to the public health authorities. - Mod.AS]
