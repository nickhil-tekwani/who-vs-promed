[The previous Chinese news (Xinhua News Agency) report [11 Jan 2017 Anthrax - Zambia (02): (WE) 20170111.4757580] had 17 human cases and some 40 or so affected cattle. This report lacks any human cases and mentions only 27 affected cattle. This may reflect more rigorous reporting based on laboratory confirmed cases. - Mod.MHJ
