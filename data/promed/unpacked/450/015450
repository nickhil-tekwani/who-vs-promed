[Perhaps the most striking feature of these sets of data is the
discordance between the geographical location of West Nile virus by
Dead Bird Surveillance and the distribution of probable or confirmed
human cases of West Nile virus infection. The numbers of human cases
peaked in the prairie provinces, where the virus had been absent
previously, whereas dead birds were recorded across the breadth of
Canada. In general the Health Canada survey concluded that most
people infected with West Nile virus had mild symptoms or no symptoms
at all. - Mod.CP]
