[Given the widespread occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the area [see ProMED-mail archive list below], it should not be surprising that HPAI has now been reported in Ghana.

There is a high probability that the current subtype reported by Ghana will be the same as that recently reported in Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria, namely H5N1.

"In April 2015, the FAO assessed the situation in Nigeria and concluded that the border countries of Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Cote d'Ivoire and Sudan, because of the level of trade and transhumance between all of these countries, constituted high risk of spread (FAO, 2015). Mali and Ghana should also now be concerned," https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427773/poa-h5n2-update-150513.pdf.
