Ebola patient's family ordered to stay inside after trying to leave
-------------------------------------------------------------
The family of the Texas Ebola patient D. have been ordered to stay in their home after violating official's initial request not to leave. "There were violations of the request to not leave their premises," Dallas judge Clay Jenkins said of the breach that prompted the Texas Department of State Health Services to order the quarantine. D. was staying with family members in Dallas when he became ill and was confined to an isolation unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. His family members, including 5 school age children, were told to remain at home. The entire apartment complex is being power washed today [2 Oct 2014].

The order came as authorities track all the people who D. is believed to have come in contact with since his arrival. The circle of people who have come into contact with him has grown rapidly from 18 Wednesday night [1 Oct 2014] to 100, according to Texas health officials. "Out of an abundance of caution, we're starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home," Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Carrie Wilson said in a statement. "The number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection."

A team of 10 experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have arrived in Dallas and will be helping the local health officials "find, assess, and assist everyone who came into contact" with D., according to a CDC news release.

[Correction: 2 Oct 2014: An earlier version of [a New York Times] article, using information from federal and Texas health officials, misstated the day that the Ebola patient, D., 1st visited the hospital. It was Thursday [25 Sep 2014], not Friday.

When did his symptoms begin? Was he symptomatic and therefore infectious to contacts all day Thursday and even earlier? He arrived in the USA without symptoms on 20 Sep 2014. - Mod.JW]

[2] Prevention & false alarms


Liberia to prosecute man who brought Ebola to USA
-------------------------------------------------
2 Oct 2014 (ABC News): Liberia plans to prosecute the airline passenger who brought Ebola into the U.S., alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person, authorities said Thursday. D. filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas. On a 19 Sep 2014 form obtained by The Associated Press, he answered "no" to all of them. Among other questions, the form asked whether D. had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. "We expect people to do the honorable thing," said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the board of directors of the Liberia Airport Authority in Monrovia. The agency took the case to the Ministry of Justice, which will formally prosecute it.
