Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) have made an alarming resurgence across the United States, where 2016 saw a record 2 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, including 628 cases of congenital syphilis. But California, the most populous US state, stands out for its willingness to tackle the crisis head-on, with cases of the 3 ailments up 45 per cent in 2017 from 5 years ago.

30 babies were stillborn amid 300 reported cases of congenital syphilis, more than in any other US state last year [2017]. "These are incredibly alarming numbers," said Heidi Bauer, chief of the STD control branch of the California Department of Public Health. She said it amounts to an epidemic.

Congenital syphilis had been essentially eliminated from the United States, as it had in developing countries such as Cuba, Thailand, and Moldova in the former Soviet Union, said Jeffrey Klausner of the UCLA school of medicine. "But you know the fact that congenital syphilis is roaring back in the states and in California is a shameful reminder of our inadequate public health programs," he said. The cases of the stillborn babies are 100 per cent preventable and this is "a slap in the face", he added.

Herein the problem seems to lie: the US health system is more reactive than preventive. And there is a lack of prevention and public awareness campaigns in a society in which people do not like to talk about sex. Striking billboards in Los Angeles are sponsored by an NGO called the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which aims to prevent or diagnose HIV and provide medical care for those who have it or other sexually transmitted diseases in free clinics. Another sign about syphilis shows a torso ravaged by open wounds. The foundation's president, Michael Weinstein, said the NGO's campaign has boosted visits to its clinics by 50 per cent in Los Angeles.

By comparison, in south Florida, where cities such as Miami Beach or Fort Lauderdale as considered hotbeds of STDs, such campaigns are barred because they are deemed to be bad for tourism. "You educate, you prevent, you test. You treat. You contact partners," said Weinstein. "We're not doing any of those things adequately." The discouraging figures will keep rising and "the government is not helping", he warns.

The financial crisis of 2008 -- at the time STDs were not of particular concern -- led to deep cuts in healthcare spending, so many clinics shut down. Add to this an increase in poverty, homelessness, drug use, and pregnancies undertaken without proper healthcare -- all considered risk factors for congenital syphilis.

California has the world's 5th largest economy but the budget for fighting STDs is a paltry USD 20 million, which includes money that comes from the federal government.

[Congenital syphilis occurs when a fetus is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40 per cent of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

During 2013-2016, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis increased both among men and women. During 2015-2016, the rate increased 14.7 per cent among men and 35.7 per cent among women. These increases among women are of particular concern because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rates of primary and secondary syphilis among women increase (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/figures/44.htm).

After decreasing to 8.4 cases of reported congenital syphilis per 100 000 live births in 2012, the rate increased nationally each year to 12.3 in 2015, with 492 cases of congenital syphilis, and to 15.7 in 2016, with 628 cases of congenital syphilis, including 41 syphilitic stillbirths (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/tables/1.htm#modalIdString_CDCTable_0). Rates of congenial syphilis this high hadn't been seen since 1998. National data for 2017 are not yet available.

During 2012-2016, the increase in reported congenital syphilis cases in the US was primarily attributable to an increase in the western region (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming); during this period, the congenital syphilis rate increased 365.5 per cent in the West, 100 per cent in the Northeast, 29.9 per cent in the South, and 23.5 per cent in the Midwest (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/Syphilis.htm). In California, 2017 was the 5th consecutive year for increases in the number of infants born with congenital syphilis (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/CA-STD-2017-Provisional-Data-Tables.pdf). In 2015, California reported 148 cases of congenital syphilis, with a rate of 30.1 cases per 100 000 live births; in 2016, 214 cases, with a rate of 43.8; and in 2017, 278 cases, including 30 stillbirths, with a rate of 57.2. 28 of 58 California counties had 1 or more congenital syphilis cases in 2017 compared with only 14 counties in 2012 (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Syphilis-Women-Babies-2017Snapshot.pdf).

In 2016, California had more cases of congenital syphilis than any other US state, although it ranked 2nd in rate per 100 000 live births, with 41.0, to Louisiana, with 74.4 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/tables/40.htm#modalIdString_CDCTable_0); and according to the news report above again has more cases than any other state in 2017. - Mod.ML
