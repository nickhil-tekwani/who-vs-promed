The federal government says there are now as many as 40 cases of _E. coli_ infections linked to contaminated romaine lettuce -- and one of them has been fatal. A total of 16 people, ranging in age from 4 to 85, had to be hospitalized. The Public Health Agency of Canada announced last week [week of 11 Dec 2017] that an outbreak of infections had caused people to be sick or even hospitalized.

Since then, 10 new cases have been reported. The affected provinces are:
Quebec (13 cases)
Newfoundland and Labrador (13 cases)
Ontario (8 cases)
New Brunswick (5 cases)
Nova Scotia (1 case)

Health officials at the agency are warning people in those provinces to "consider consuming other types of lettuce, instead of romaine lettuce, until more is known about the outbreak and the cause of contamination," according to a statement issued late [Thu 21 Dec 2017]. That includes not ordering romaine lettuce in fast food chains or restaurants as well.

The following food safety tips for lettuce will help you reduce your risk of getting an _E. coli_ infection:
- wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, before and after handling lettuce;
- discard outer leaves of fresh lettuce;
- wash your unpackaged lettuce under fresh, cool running water. There is no need to use anything other than water to wash lettuce. Washing it gently with water is as effective as using produce cleansers;
- keep rinsing your lettuce until all of the dirt has been washed away.
- don't soak lettuce in a sink full of water. It can become contaminated by bacteria in the sink;
- ready-to-eat lettuce products sold in sealed packages and labelled as washed, pre-washed, or triple washed do not need to be washed again;
- use warm water and soap to thoroughly wash all utensils, countertops, and cutting boards before and after handling lettuce to avoid cross-contamination;
- store lettuce in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. Discard when leaves become wilted or brown;
- bagged, ready-to-eat, pre-washed lettuce products should also be refrigerated and used before the expiration date.

[Most serotypes of _E. coli_, when confined to their usual habitat in the gastrointestinal tract, are harmless and indeed have beneficial properties to their human "host" including detoxifying substances and preventing the overgrowth of more harmful bacteria. Some strains, however, "enteropaths", have evolved to produce toxins and can cause diarrheal illnesses including travelers' diarrhea. One of these groupings is the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) also called Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ (STEC). It is this group with the prototypic serotype O157:H7 discussed in this post. Most of the time, however, when water boiling notices are posted because of high levels of _E. coli_ in a water supply, it is not EHEC per se being testing for but rather the _E. coli_, sometimes referred to as "coliforms" that are used to test for sewage contamination of water.

The classical vehicle for EHEC is undercooked ground beef but salad ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, bean sprouts, and spinach can serve as a transmitter from contamination of the produce at any point from while growing in the field to harvesting to the restaurant or home kitchen. These organisms are found in a variety of animals, primarily cattle. While the advice in the posting is important, several enteric pathogens including EHEC can actually internalize into the produce and replicate there so washing will not always be successful in removing the contamination. The following publication is a recent one investigating this phenomenon:

Wright KM, Crozier L, Marshall J, et al. Differences in internalization and growth of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 within the apoplast of edible plants, spinach and lettuce, compared with the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Microb Biotechnol. 2017; 10: 555-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404196/

Abstract
--------
Internalization of food-borne bacteria into edible parts of fresh produce plants represents a serious health risk. Therefore, internalization of verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolate Sakai was assessed in 2 species associated with outbreaks, spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) and compared to the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Internalization occurred in the leaves and roots of spinach and lettuce throughout a 10 day time-course. The plant species, tissue type and inoculum dose all impacted the outcome. A combination of low inoculum dose (about 100 CFU [colony-forming unit]) together with light microscopy imaging highlighted marked differences in the fate of endophytic _E. coli_ O157:H7 Sakai. In the fresh produce species, bacterial growth was restricted but viable cells persisted over 20 days, whereas there was more than 400-fold (about 2.5 Log10 ) increase in growth in _N. benthamiana_. Colony formation occurred adjacent to epidermal cells and mesophyll cells or close to vascular bundles of _N. benthamiana_ and contained components of a biofilm matrix, including curli expression and elicitation, extracellular DNA, and a limited presence of cellulose. Together the data show that internalization is a relevant issue in crop production and that crop species and tissue need to be considered as food safety risk parameters.
