Ten imported cases of dengue fever treated in Beijing this year
---------------------------------------------------------------
A male patient who recently returned from Laos was confirmed yesterday as
[dengue virus positive by the Tropical Disease Research Centre of the
Friendship Hospital, Beijing. He is the first dengue patient in Beijing
[since the recent spread of Thailand's dengue epidemic to other South East
Asian countries. The patient worked in Laos this year. Due to the proximity
of Laos and Thailand, the dengue epidemic has spread to Laos. After coming
home to Beijing, the patient had fever and rashes and was misdiagnosed by 2
other hospitals in Beijing [before being transferred to the Friendship
Hospital, where the diagnosis was confirmed by serological testing.
The patient's condition is not serious. Apart from a low blood count and
slight functional damage to the liver and kidney, his condition is
generally stable now. With appropriate medical treatment, the patient
should be able to be discharged next week.
Dengue fever is a tropical disease that is carried by _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes. These types of mosquitoes are unable to
survive in Beijing [due to the severe winters, thus Beijing is not at risk
of a dengue epidemic. In the past year, the Tropical Disease Research
Centre of the Friendship Hospital in Beijing treated more than 10 dengue
cases. All the patients had worked in a tropical region for some time
recently. All fully recovered after about 2 weeks of treatment in the hospital.

[While imported dengue will not spread in the Beijing area, this report is
relevant for 3 reasons. Firstly, since doctors in Beijing are not familiar
with dengue fever, the cases referred to the Tropical Disease Research
Centre are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg; secondly, if cases are
being imported into the Beijing area in North China, they must also be
arriving in South China; and, thirdly, South China does have the climate
and the vector mosquitoes capable of supporting an epidemic. - Mod.JW
