The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) and the Minnesota
Department of Health (MDH) are investigating illnesses in at least 6
people in Minnesota that are connected with a recall of organic shell
eggs due to contamination with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis. The contaminated eggs were traced back by the MDA to
Larry Schultz Organic Farm of Owatonna, where environmental testing
confirmed the presence of _S._ Enteritidis. Larry Schultz Organic Farm
is cooperating with the MDA investigation and has issued a voluntary
recall of the products.

Routine reportable disease monitoring by state health officials
identified 6 cases of _S._ Enteritidis infection with the same DNA
fingerprint. The individuals became ill between 12 Aug 2011 and 24 Sep
2011. The illnesses occurred in both children and adults, and all are
residents of the 7-county metropolitan area. 3 of the cases were
hospitalized but have since recovered. 5 of the 6 cases have reported
eating eggs from the Larry Schultz Organic Farm purchased at grocery
stores or co-ops.

Eggs affected by this recall were distributed to restaurants, grocery
stores, food wholesalers, and foodservice companies in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan.

Eggs from Larry Schultz Organic Farm are packaged under the following
brand names: Lunds & Byerly's Organic, Kowalski's Organic, and Larry
Schultz Organic Farm. Eggs are packed in bulk and varying sizes of
cartons (6-egg cartons, 12-egg cartons, 18-egg cartons). Full product
descriptions and a list of grocery stores where these products were
sold can be found at http://www.mda.state.mn.us. Cartons bearing
Plant Number 0630 or a "Sell by" date are not included in this
recall.

_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis has the unique ability to
contaminate eggs without causing discernible illness in the birds
infected. The infection route to humans involves colonization,
survival, and multiplication of the pathogen in the hen house
environment, the bird and, finally, the egg. The review cited below
highlights the stages of transmission and discusses evidence that
altered bacterial growth patterns and specific cell surface
characteristics contribute to the adaptation of _S._ enteritidis to
these diverse environments.
