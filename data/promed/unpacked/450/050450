Granollers Hospital [Granollers is a city near Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain] has recorded 14 cases of _Legionella_ pneumonia during August 2013, and this has been confirmed in a report issued by the Catalonia Public Health Agency, where they mention they are investigating the origin of this occurrence.

The agency reported that all 14 cases are doing well and that now only 3 persons are still hospitalized. There are 11 men: one man is 37 years old; another, 51; and the 9 remaining are above 64 years of age. The 3 women are above 64 years old. All affected patients live in the Eastern Valles region.

The 1st case was learned of last 5 Aug 2013, and the last one was detected last 27 Aug 2013, Until the results of tests performed to learn the origin of this outbreak are available, intensive cleaning and disinfection procedures of suspicious facilities are being performed.

Meanwhile, public health technical personnel are investigating, together with Granollers municipality, the possible sources of this infection, and samples from different facilities and equipment in the inspected areas have been taken.

_Legionella_ is transmitted by inhalation of water spray or aerosolized particles, but it is not transmitted from person-to-person. Public Health officers pointed out that persons may drink tap water, both from their homes as well as from public sources, since it does not represent any risk.

[This outbreak of legionnaires' disease, the more serious, pneumonic form of legionellosis, is presumably community-acquired rather than nosocomial. The news report above does not say how the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was made or what species of _Legionella_ was implicated in the 14 cases.

Legionnaires' disease is caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species; more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

_L. longbeachae_ is found in soil and potting mix (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387), and legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil. Unlike _L. longbeachae_, _L. pneumophila_ is found in water sources, such as natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters.

Although healthy individuals can contract this disease, legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons.

A diagnosis of even a single case of legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Granollers is an inland, mainly an industrial city, with a population of 60 658 in 2009, about 36 km (about 22 miles) northeast of the center of Barcelona and 18 km (about 11 miles) west of the Mediterranean coast, in Catalonia, Spain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granollers). Granollers is the capital of the county of Eastern Valles. - Mod.ML
