Aiken County had its 1st confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) when one of 4 horses tested positive for the vector-borne disease between 26-30 Aug 2013.

The other confirmed positives were in Bamberg County, Berkeley County, and Darlington County. The 4 cases bring the total number of horses to test positive for the virus in the state this year [2013] to 39.

However, eastern equine encephalitis isn't the only vector-borne disease with which horse owners and locals should be concerned. One horse has tested positive for West Nile virus as well. Vaccinations and booster shots are critical to maintaining the best protection for horses.

The incubation period for the disease is from 4 to 10 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention. Mosquito prevention plays a critical role in preventing the disease. An infected mosquito can transmit the virus by biting a horse or human. Horses and humans are at risk in areas where the virus is currently circulating.

If horse owners suspect their horses may be infected with eastern equine encephalitis, they should contact their veterinarians and make an appointment for evaluation and treatment.

There are a number of clinical signs which horse owners should be aware of if they suspect their horse might be infected with the virus. Signs can include a change in the way a horse presents itself, loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, severe fever, acting out of the ordinary, incoordination, inability to swallow, and drooling.

People can take measures to protect themselves from being bitten by an infected mosquito. The use of insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, eliminating and mitigating mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water, and having secure screens on windows and doors can help prevent infection.

[The eastern seaboard of the US has been having a tremendous number of cases of EEE and more WNV cases this year (2013).

This high number of cases is made ever so much sadder because they are preventable. These were needless deaths! There is a vaccine that combines WNV and EEE, and it is a very effective vaccine. However, one must vaccinate the horses in order to protect them. Also, immunity to EEE wanes more quickly than to WNV, and it is advisable to revaccinate every 4-6 months.
