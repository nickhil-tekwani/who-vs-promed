Dr Moses Dbordsi, Upper East regional director of veterinary services, on Friday [19 Jul 2013] confirmed an outbreak of anthrax in the Builsa North District in the Upper East Region. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Dr Dbordsi said some people were affected by the disease that attacked animals, but the regional veterinary services office was keeping surveillance to put the situation under control.

He said the office was educating the public on the disease, and a ban had been placed on the movement of animals in the Builsa North District.

Dr Steven Degbor, district director of food and agriculture for Builsa North, in a report to the assembly said 39 sheep died [up from around 30] in Wiaga, which led to an emergency census on animals in the district as well as laboratory investigations to confirm the situation.

He indicated that carcasses collected from a household had been buried, and vaccinations had started since 11 Jul 2013 on sheep, cattle, goats, pigs and donkeys within an 8-km radius from the area where the sheep died. He said a total of 207 cattle, 821 sheep, 394 goats, 70 pigs and 57 donkeys had been vaccinated so far.

Veterinary officers in the Builsa North district in the Upper East region have placed a ban on the slaughtering of animals in the area following the latest outbreak of anthrax.

Some residents are reported to have contracted the disease, which attacks animals. Public campaigns are, however, under way to sensitize residents in order to ensure the disease does not spread any further.

Regional director of veterinary services, Dr Moses Dbordsi, tells Joy News a ban on the movement of animals and other measures are being enforced to fight the disease.

He said 69 animals [up from 39] which contracted the disease have died so far, but they are yet to record any deaths after the other animals were vaccinated. He said his outfit will also ensure that no infected animal is consumed by humans.

Dr Moses Dbordsi said their work is, however, hampered by lack of funds.

Officials of the veterinary services have vaccinated livestock in Wiagah, a community near Sandema in the Upper East Region, to control a possible outbreak of anthrax. The action follows the deaths of about 69 sheep from anthrax infection on Mon 22 Jul 2013 [sic: The last death was on 11 Jul 2013. - Mod.MHJ]. The animals have since been buried.

Director of veterinary services in the region, Dr Moses Dbordsi, said although the infection is not widespread, they have ensured that no one consumed meat from the infected animals.

In April this year [2013], there was a similar outbreak of the disease in the Bawku West District of the region. Although it was contained, there were reports of the sale of anthrax infected animals to people outside the district [See 20130416.1650374 and 20130409.1633741, with no reports at that time of infected meat sales or human cases outside Bawku. - Mod.MHJ].
