South Australia has recorded its 1st case of canine ehrlichiosis -- a disease caused by a tick-borne bacteria, which can be fatal to dogs if left untreated.

The disease was detected in a dog living in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, in the far north of the state.

South Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Mary Carr said the confirmation of the 1st case came as more ticks carrying ehrlichiosis were found in the APY Lands.

She urged dog owners to ensure their dogs were on an appropriate tick repellent program.

"As expected, these discoveries indicate the disease is now established in South Australia," Dr Carr said. "The ticks and the dog with the disease were found in APY Lands communities and surrounding areas, so dogs living and travelling in the far northern areas where tick numbers are higher remain at the highest risk."

Ehrlichiosis was believed not to exist in Australia until it was confirmed in Western Australia's Kimberley region in May last year [2020] and in the Northern Territory in June [2020].

In December last year [2020], it was estimated nearly 1000 dogs had died from the disease in the Northern Territory as it rapidly spread through remote Indigenous communities.

Dr Carr said the best way to protect dogs from the disease was by preventing tick bites. "You should also check your dogs every day for ticks, and avoid areas likely to be tick-infested," she said.

"If your dog gets sick, tell your vet, including where and when you've travelled."

Dog owners in the affected communities have been asked not to move their dogs around unless they are healthy and free of ticks.

"Dog owners in remote communities can reach out to local services like Nganampa Health Council which may provide advice and support for animal health."

Dogs with ehrlichiosis can show signs of fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, abnormal bleeding (such as nose bleeds), pain, and weight loss.

If not treated properly it can result in death.

The Department of Primary Industries and Regions said it was currently unlikely dogs in the southern parts of South Australia would become infected unless they had recently travelled to areas where infected ticks had been detected.

Infected dogs cannot transmit the disease to people. However, in rare cases, ticks may infect people.

Key points:
- The potentially deadly disease has been detected in the APY Lands
- Ehrlichiosis is caused by a tick-borne bacteria
- Dog owners are being urged to ensure their dogs are on a tick repellent program

[This article seems to skip over the fact there is adequate treatment to prevent ticks from infesting your dog. Please see your veterinarian for appropriate and effective tick prevention. Checking your pet daily is important, but some ticks can be tiny, smaller than the head of a pin, and can be missed in an ear crease or between the pads of the foot. However, tick prevention medication is extremely effective.

I don't understand why adequate tick and flea prevention is not advocated. Why is it not being shipped (via truck, or plane, or other mechanisms) to get these areas tick prevention and get the word out of how very serious this disease is to your pet?

Ticks can harbor and transmit more diseases than ehrlichiosis. Promotion of prevention of ticks should be in every vet's office, every feed store, on the televisions, radios, and internet sites of every community.

More information regarding the disease follows (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/ehrlichiosis-canine):

"Canine ehrlichiosis is a worldwide tick-borne disease caused by _Ehrlichia_ species, which are rickettsial organisms infecting mononuclear, granulocytic, or thrombocytic cells. The most common causative agent is _Ehrlichia canis_, but other _Ehrlichia_ species can also produce the disease. Clinical and subclinical infections are common in dogs.

"The typical presentation is characterized by depression, lethargy, mild weight loss, and anorexia, with or without hemorrhagic tendencies. If present, bleeding usually is manifested by dermal petechiae, ecchymoses, or both. Hemorrhagic diathesis, such as epistaxis, may occur. Other signs may include lymphadenomegaly, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and, less frequently, anterior or posterior uveitis, polymyositis, polyarthritis, and central nervous system (CNS) signs (such as seizures, ataxia, vestibular deficits, or cerebellar dysfunction).

"Differentials include Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and other causes of thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, immune-mediated disorders, and cutaneous drug reactions.

"Diagnosis
---------
- Hemogram: normochromic, normocytic nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, or of serum anti-_Ehrlichia_ antibodies. If initial test results are negative, one should consider repeating the assay 2 to 3 weeks later because false-negative results can occur in acutely ill dogs. Likewise, false-positive results (indicating exposure rather than infection) may occur, especially in healthy dogs in endemic areas.
- PCR technique (blood, bone marrow aspirate, splenic aspirate): detection of _Ehrlichia_ leukopenia is common.
- Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: detection antigen.

"Treatment and prognosis
-----------------------
- Supportive care (such as fluids, blood transfusions) should be provided if needed.
- The treatment of choice is doxycycline 10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 28 days.
- Alternative treatments include the following:
-- Tetracycline 22 mg/kg PO q 8 hours for 14 to 21 days
-- Chloramphenicol (that is for puppies under 6 months old) 15-25 mg/kg PO, SC, or IV q 8 hours for 14 to 21 days
-- Midocarb dipropionate 5 mg/kg IM twice, 2 to 3 weeks apart
- Clinical improvement should be seen 24 to 48 hours after treatment is initiated. Platelet counts should also begin to increase during this time, usually returning to normal within 14 days.
- A strict tick control program should be instituted for dogs and premises.
- In endemic areas, long-term doxycycline 3 mg/kg PO every 24 hours has been used prophylactically to prevent reinfection.
- The prognosis is good if treatment is initiated early in the course of the disease. The prognosis is poor for dogs with chronic or severe disease. Infected dogs are not directly contagious to humans or to other dogs (except via blood transfusions), but their infection can be indirectly transmitted via tick vectors."

We extend our sympathies to the owners of the animals and to the veterinary staff and caregivers. In an epidemic situation, this is very difficult. - Mod.TG
