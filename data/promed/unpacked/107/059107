[The above figures differ in some cases from figures from other official
sources. For example, Switzerland's official, detailed website mentions, in
its update of 21 Apr 2006, 32 "avian influenza positive" wild birds. The 23
which are not included in the ADNS table have been identified as H5; their
N type has not been analyzed/determined.
Though the table includes a separate column for LPAI in wild birds, not a
single positive case is to be found in this column. On the other hand,
there were 3 LPAI detections in domestic fowl: all 3 reported from the UK,
with the last date of confirmation being 5 May 2006.
ADNS covers EU member states and other countries connected to the application.
The reviewed ADNS table includes, in addition to the above 16 countries,
also 16 countries which have not reported, during 2006, any positive HPAI
case in domestic or wild birds: Andorra, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Spain,
Finland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal.
It would be helpful if ADNS, or another EU institution/agency, could obtain
and publish figures and species of the wild birds tested by all
participating countries, infected and not-infected, within their respective
surveillance projects, and specify the species of the positive wild birds.

the Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at

The presented data in the table are an example of numerator bias. Many of
these "positive" birds were collected for diagnostic purposes in a
non-standardized fashion primarily to determine whether H5N1 virus was
present, yes or no. There are no standards for the denominators.
Those comparing 40+ve birds in one country of whatever species are hard to
correlate with 5+ve birds in another. Plus, as we know, the harder one
looks, the more one finds. In some respects, if one presumes on a minimal
standard for sick bird surveillance, the absent reports may have more
interpretive weight than the positive reports.
Clearly, we still have a way to go in sorting out what is happening, likely
to happen, and what the true risks are. - Mod.MHJ]

[2] Romania (Brasov), commercial poultry farms

Veterinary authorities' heads to roll after spread of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Minister of agriculture Gheorghe Flutur on Tuesday [16 May 2006] said the
national and the Brasov county level management of Romania's veterinary
authority, or ANSVSA, will be sacked, after the outbreak of bird flu in
chicken farms was discovered over the weekend. He added that 14 localities
in Brasov county had suspected cases of bird flu.
Romania discovered on Friday [13 May 2006] that the bird flu virus was
active in 3 chicken plants in Brasov County, central Romania, and
quarantined the town of Fagaras and other 8 villages as a result. [Map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=45.8433&lon=24.9779&scale=4000000&icon=x>].
These were the 1st cases of birdflu outbreaks in [commercial] chicken farms
in Romania. The 53 outbreaks identified since October 2005 occurred on
family farms only. The last such outbreak was officially closed in late
April 2006.
The 3 plants where the bird flu virus originated are Dracom Silva, Pati
Prod, and Avi Prod, all located in Codlea town, Brasov County.
The bird flu virus was identified only when one individual bought 500
chickens from Dracom Silva and resold them to other farmers. The chicken
plants did not inform authorities of the unusual death rate of the poultry,
Flutur said on Monday [15 May 2006].
The farms sold live chickens to farmers in 5 counties, while hundreds of
tons of processed meat made it to stores in 20 Romanian cities.
Authorities said the meat poses no threat to health if cooked for a long
time, but 220 tons of meat were taken out of store shelves and destroyed.
Farmers will get compensation for their culled birds, but processing plants
will receive them only if they complied with sanitary laws, the Ministry of
Agriculture said. It also announced the people responsible for spreading
the virus through the selling of live virus-tainted chicken will be
prosecuted by law.
Authorities prevented from leaving the farms some one dozen people working
there; they will be hospitalized, as none of them used safety gear.
However, the farms also illegally employed people who will be difficult to
track down, as they were not on the company's records.
All 104 000 birds in the Dracom Silva plant will be culled, and sanitary
authorities around the country, as well as store managers, are bound to
search and destroy any chicken products originating in the Brasov County.
The transportation, buying and selling of live birds was banned on all of
Romania's territory for 2 weeks, starting Saturday [13 May 2006].
Hunting of birds is banned till 1 Aug 2006, as usual, but authorities
enforced a ban on hunting mammals too in all areas where bird flu outbreaks
were confirmed.

UN expert praises Egypt's bird flu response
-------------------------------------------
Egypt's quick response to bird flu shows that even less developed countries
can cope with limited outbreaks if they follow guidelines, the United
Nations' chief bird flu expert says. Although health experts had worried
that Egypt could be hit hard by avian influenza because of its backyard
flocks and widespread poverty, the North African country coped well with
its outbreak, Dr David Nabarro said. "They have been an example of good
practice in the way they moved to introduce active surveillance. They got
the human case mortality very low," Nabarro told Reuters in a telephone
interview.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread to more than 40 countries. It
mainly infects birds but has sickened 208 people and killed 115 of them.
Egypt has had 13 cases, and 5 of those people have died.
On Monday [15 May 2006], Egyptian Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said the
epidemic in birds was nearly controlled. "The situation as of this morning
is that the disease has been wiped out to a level of 96 to 97 per cent,"
Gabali told parliament, without elaborating.
Nabarro said Egypt followed World Health Organization guidelines that call
for countries to address bird flu at the highest political level, to begin
intense surveillance to catch as many cases as possible, to cull flocks as
soon as outbreaks are reported, to compensate farmers who lose birds this
way and to quickly treat human victims.
"Countries around the world -- not just Egypt but Viet Nam, Thailand,
Ukraine and others -- they are all making very sincere efforts to follow
the strategies that were recommended (by the World Health Organization),"
Nabarro said. "They have good political leadership and good surveillance
schemes, and they are paying attention to the livelihoods of people that
lose their birds."
A senior foreign expert, speaking about 2 weeks after the disease reached
Egypt in February 2006, said it would be extremely difficult to eradicate,
because up to half of all households keep poultry and because chicken farms
are often close together.
Nabarro said Egypt's case was good news for efforts elsewhere to cope with
H5N1, which the WHO predicts will eventually spread globally. "But, like
many other governments, (Egypt's government) has found it hard to cull, and
to compensate owners for the loss of backyard birds, especially in cities."
He said it has coped well in other areas. "They introduced active
surveillance all across the country. They've been very transparent. They
haven't hidden anything from anybody," Nabarro said.

Bird flu found in fowl in Indonesia's Papua - official
------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia has found the avian flu virus in chickens in Papua province, the
1st bird flu case in the archipelago's easternmost province, a senior
government official said on Tuesday [16 May 2006].
A number of fighting cocks in Manokwari regency of western Papua tested
positive for the H5N1 virus in late April 2006, prompting authorities to
cull about 200 chickens, Syamsul Bahri, animal health director at the
agriculture ministry, told Reuters.
"The fighting cocks might have been brought to Papua from neighboring
Sulawesi island," Bahri said. "It was the 1st case we had in Papua. We
culled around 200 chickens, mostly from backyard farms around the
neighborhood where the virus was found to prevent it from spreading," he
said. Bird flu has been found in poultry in about 2/3rds of the country's
33 provinces. [Map at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Indonesia_provinces_english.png>].
The latest case in poultry in Papua highlights international concern over
Indonesia's ability to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed 25
people in the country and at least 115 worldwide since 2003.
Although the human death toll has climbed, the government has resisted mass
culling of birds, citing the expense and impracticality in a country where
keeping a few chickens or ducks in backyards is common. Culling at
selective farms and their immediate surroundings has been the preferred method.
Millions of chickens and other fowl have died from the disease in Indonesia
or been killed to prevent its spread since it 1st surfaced in the sprawling
archipelago in late 2003.
Bahri said the government was considering intensifying culling, but faced
opposition from the public over compensation. "The government can only
offer 10 000 rupiah (USD 1.07) for each fowl culled. But people want higher
compensation," he said.
Shigeru Omi, the World Health Organization's director for the Western
Pacific, told Reuters earlier in Jakarta that Indonesia -- the nation with
the most human deaths from bird flu this year (2006) -- had the will to
combat the disease but far-flung provinces had fallen short at putting
plans into action.
In the latest case, Indonesia is investigating an outbreak of bird flu in
up to 8 members of a North Sumatran family, of whom 6 have died.
