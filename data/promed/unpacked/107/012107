As of 23 Sep 2014, a total of 344 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella enterica_ serotypes Infantis, Newport, or Hadar have been reported associated with exposure to live poultry from 42 states and Puerto Rico. Since the last update on 8 Aug 2014, a total of 44 new ill persons have been reported from Alabama (1), Arizona (1), Connecticut (1), Georgia (1), Illinois (1), Iowa (2), Kansas (1), Kentucky (3), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Nebraska (2), New Jersey (1), New York (4), North Carolina (4), Ohio (6), Pennsylvania (4), South Carolina (3), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (2), Texas (1), Utah (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (1).

Among persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 3 Feb 2014 and 23 Aug 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than 1 year to 95 years, and the median age is 32 years. 33 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 54 percent of ill persons are female. Among 224 ill persons with available information, 71 (32 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 24 Aug 2014 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked this outbreak of human _Salmonella_ infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry from Mt. Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio.

78 percent of ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began. Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live baby poultry from homes of ill persons have identified Mt. Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio as the source of chicks and ducklings. This is the same mail-order hatchery that has been associated with multiple outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to live poultry in past years, including in 2012 and 2013.

[As in the continuing outbreak of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg linked to chicken and chicken parts for sale (Salmonellosis, st Heidelberg - USA (06): chicken, continuing alert 20140627.2566071), no concrete action has been taken to minimize the risk of salmonellosis from contact with live poultry. There is no doubt it may be quite difficult to produce _Salmonella_- or _Campylobacter_-free birds, so better education may be the answer, as recalling or banning the selling of small fowl are not likely, as was done with small turtles. Caveat emptor: let the buyer beware. - Mod.LL
