Michigan: outbreak of suspected viral disease at nursing home in Troy
------------------------------------------------
Seniors at a Troy nursing home have fallen ill because of a mysterious
outbreak. One person has died at the facility, and several others have been
hospitalized because of the illness.
The facility, Alterra, is comprised of 2 buildings: the assisted living
building, and the Alzheimer's unit. The outbreak occurred in the
Alzheimer's [disease] unit, which has been quarantined. There are 39 people
who live there, and 16 have fallen ill with the same flu-like symptoms.
Paramedics were on the scene, suited up in biohazard uniforms. Sick
patients have been evacuated from the building to 3 area hospitals.
The outbreak started on the night of Wed 8 Dec 2004. 4 people became ill
with flu-like symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. All of these
people were taken to the hospital, where one man went into cardiac arrest
and died. Officials are not certain that the man who went into cardiac
arrest was also suffering from the flu-like symptoms.
The family members of the residents in the Alzheimer's unit have been
notified of the outbreak, and have been given a number to call for
information. Family members are asked to not come to Alterra. Officials say
that this situation is being treated as a viral outbreak.
Dr William Anderson, the director of emergency medicine at Beaumont
Hospital in Troy, spoke with Action News. He explained that the problem
with treating elderly patients is that they often have other physical
ailments, such as diabetes and dementia. The elderly are also as risk for
dehydration, and all the patients are being closely monitored. Dr Anderson
also explained that they are treating the outbreak as a virus, and he is
not surprised that it was able to spread so quickly. "Oh it's very
contagious. In fact, nursing homes and assisted living facilities are
really areas where outbreaks like these are occurring not uncommonly. Just
because you have a lot of patients living in close proximity, there are
hygiene issues, and it's not surprising that there's an outbreak of this
nature."
Action News has been told that all the victims have been stabilized. The
Oakland Co. Health Department and the Department of Community Health are
investigating this outbreak, in order to identify the illness.

[The term "flu-like symptoms" is applied to the early stages of almost
every virus-associated illness. The contagious nature of the illness and
the setting suggest perhaps either an outbreak of norovirus infection or
even influenza itself. A precise description of the illness and a statement
of the diagnostic tests carried out would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
