[2] USA: New York state, public health travel ban, New Jersey

Officials in New York have consulted with federal authorities to help prevent 2 people exposed to measles from traveling by air in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease amid the largest outbreak of the virus in 2 decades, officials confirmed [on Sun 26 May 2019]. The unidentified people are among 8 throughout the country who have voluntarily canceled travel plans in lieu of being placed on a rarely used federal list maintained by CDC that would bar them from boarding flights, according to a report in the Washington Post.

The current outbreak of the virus has its roots in air travel. Several travelers came to the United States legally from Israel, where there are outbreaks of the virus, and visited ultra-Orthodox communities where there is an aversion to vaccinations. "That's how we started here," said Ed Day, the Rockland county executive. "They came in legitimately through the front door."

Outbreak spreads across the county
----------------------------------
Health officials in 5 states, including New York, have contacted CDC about travelers who have been exposed to measles for their potential inclusion on the list, according to the Washington Post.

A total of 880 cases of measles in 24 states [see above -- the most current CDC case count is 940 cases in 26 states] have been reported this year [2019], which is a 25-year high, CDC recently reported. That's the highest annual total since more than 950 cases were reported in 1994. A representative from the CDC did not immediately respond to requests for comment on [Sun 26 May 2019].

The outbreak in Rockland county began when 7 travelers from Israel visited last October [2018]. Since then, the county Health Department, Refuah Health Center, and private pediatricians and family doctors have administered more than 21 000 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine since the outbreak started.

Of the people infected in Rockland, 85% have been under 18 years old, Day said. Before the outbreak, there was only a 70% immunization rate in Rockland. "Those numbers are beginning to shift because we've given out so many MMRs," he said. The county typically gives 1000 doses of the MMR vaccine, which is regarded as the best way to stop the spread of the virus, each year.

The 2 people from New York, who were dissuaded from traveling, were identified during routine investigations regarding exposures and infections, Day said. People who are exposed to the virus are warned not to travel, but the 2 people told health investigators that they planned to travel regardless. That's why officials escalated the matter to federal authorities, he said. Day has taken an aggressive stance in attempting to halt the spread of the disease. He has issued 2 orders, one of which was struck down in court, seeking to prevent people infected with measles from attending school and from gathering in public.

Fewer cases so far in New Jersey
--------------------------------
There have been far fewer cases in New Jersey. Only 14 people have been infected: 11 in Lakewood township in Ocean county and 3 people in one Passaic household. However, several exposure warnings have been issued by New Jersey health officials since the outbreak began late last year [2018].

The Do Not Board list was first implemented in 2007 in response to a case of a man traveling to Europe who had been infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis, according to the Washington Post.

Measles exposure warnings in New Jersey are infrequent and limited compared with Rockland county, which last week [week of 20 May 2019] issued a list of a dozen locations, including 2 taxis, used by potentially infected people.

The county executive also wrote to the Trump administration asking for an order to prevent people without immunity to measles from entering the country. Day said he has since been in communication with officials from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, but he declined to talk about the specifics of those conversations.

CDC's Do Not Board list would not prevent people infected with measles from entering the county. Yellow fever is the only disease for which proof of immunization is required and changing that would require a lot of international cooperation, according to the Washington Post.

A 6th case of the measles now has people in Auburn [Washington] on high alert. We learned [Fri 16 May 2019] a woman in her 40s may have exposed people in several public locations.

Health officials believe everyone who has gotten sick with the measles so far may have been in contact with one individual who was at SeaTac Airport on 25 Apr 2019, likely in the morning. The WA State Department of Health first called this latest round of measles a new "outbreak" on [Wed 14 May 2019].

New Mexico has dodged the widespread measles outbreaks that have hit some states, but the confirmation of the state's 1st measles case in nearly 4 years could spark new scrutiny of the state's immunization laws.

A Democratic state lawmaker said this week [week of 20 May 2019] that she's considering revisiting legislation that would tighten the state's current allowable immunization exemptions -- as the number of New Mexicans opting not to vaccinate their children has steadily increased in recent years.

As of 2018, there were 4441 school-age children with immunization exemptions on file with the state Department of Health. That's up more than 30% from the 3322 children with exemptions in 2014.

Rep Deborah Armstrong, D-Albuquerque, said she plans to meet with health secretary Kathy Kunkel to discuss immunization-related matters in light of the measles concerns and suggested that New Mexico's immunization exemption laws should be examined, along with other issues. "I think that ought to be on the table," Armstrong told the Albuquerque Journal. Under New Mexico law, there are 3 types of allowable immunization exemptions: a medical exemption that requires a physician's certification, a religious exemption that requires a written affirmation from a religious leader and a religious exemption that parents or legal guardians can submit.

The largest increase in New Mexico immunization exemptions in recent years is attributable to forms submitted by parents, said state epidemiologist Dr Michael Landen with the Department of Health. A 2015 bill proposed by Armstrong would have eliminated that category of exemption, but the legislation generated opposition and failed to advance out of its 1st assigned committee. Armstrong acknowledged that such an effort is a "tricky balance" and said there may have to be a different approach to the issue.

Currently, there are 3 states -- California, Mississippi, and West Virginia -- that do not allow religious or personal belief exemptions for immunizations, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. There are also 16 states that allow personal belief -- or nonreligious -- exemptions to required vaccinations and attempts in states including Washington to remove such exemptions have been met with fierce resistance.

Rep Gregg Schmedes, R-Tijeras, a medical doctor who previously participated in a vaccination program in Africa through the World Health Organization, said he supports educational efforts to increase vaccination awareness. But he said he would oppose efforts to reduce parents' ability to decide whether their children get vaccines. "I would not support a government-mandated vaccine," Schmedes said. "When the government is telling you what you must put in your body, that gets a little sci-fi scary."

The New Mexico measles case confirmed last week [week of 13 May 2019] by the state Health Department is in a 1 year old in Sierra county. It is the state's 1st confirmed measles case since December 2014. State health officials have been tight-lipped about the case's details, and Landen said it's unclear how the child contracted the measles virus.

Overall, although the total number of New Mexico children with immunization exemptions filed with the Health Department is less than 1% of the total number of school-age children statewide. Landen said some schools appear to have vaccination rates of less than 95% -- either because of allowable exemptions among students or because the schools' records aren't kept up to date.

He also said that percentage-wise, the largest pockets of nonvaccinated children in New Mexico are in Santa Fe, Taos, and Los Alamos counties.

Health officials confirmed on [Sat 25 May 2019] that a case of measles was diagnosed in a child in Massachusetts. This is the 2nd confirmed case of measles in the state this year [2019]. The infected child, who was diagnosed on [Fri 24 May 2019], was in several locations in Weymouth and Quincy and could have exposed other people to measles. [See source URL for locations of potential exposure.]

"Lack of vaccination, combined with domestic and international travel, has resulted in the spread of measles nationally and internationally," said public health commissioner Monica Bharel, MD, MPH. "Getting vaccinated is the best way for people to protect themselves from this disease."

Chief medical officer of health, Dr Jennifer Russell, says public health officials in New Brunswick are setting up a special immunization clinic aimed at those in the school population who haven't yet received a dose of vaccine within the last 28 days. Health officials in New Brunswick say there are 2 new cases of measles in the province, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 5.

All of the cases are in the Saint John area and the latest 2, confirmed late [Sat 25 May 2019], are linked to a previous confirmed case at Kennebecasis Valley High School. The latest cases followed news on [Fri 24 May 2019] of another confirmed case, the province's 3rd, which was also linked to the school.

In a news release, Dr Jennifer Russell says public health officials are setting up a special immunization clinic aimed at those in the school population who haven't yet received a dose of vaccine within the last 28 days. A previous immunization clinic was held at the school on [Fri 24 May 2019], and Dr Russell says the new clinic will be offered for added protection as an outbreak control measure because of recent exposures.

On [Fri 24 May 2019], public health officials issued a directive advising staff and students at Kennebecasis Valley High School that they must receive a measles booster shot if they want to continue going to school.

The 1st confirmed case in the Saint John area involved a person who visited the Halifax Infirmary emergency room last month [April 2019] and later went to the ER and X-ray room at Saint John Regional Hospital. Officials later confirmed the 1st infected patient recently travelled internationally. The 2nd case was confirmed at Kennebecasis Valley High School.

UN health officials say Nigeria has been experiencing a large outbreak of measles since the beginning of the year [2019], affecting all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). With nearly 29 000 measles cases, including 89 fatalities reported nationally, more than half the outbreak cases are in Borno state (15 237).

The massive outbreak prompted the World Health Organization (WHO), State Ministry of Health, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), UNICEF, and Gavi -- the Vaccine Alliance to organize a reactive vaccination campaign to provide life-saving vaccines against measles in 2 phases. As a whole, WHO and its partners successfully vaccinated 1 227 038 eligible children across 32 wards in 13 LGAs [local government areas] upon completion of the reactive vaccination campaign on 19 May 2019.

"Immunization is the best and safest way to protect our children against this serious but preventable disease. Borno state has mobilized, trained, and engaged enough health workers, recorders, religious, and traditional leaders to ensure that all eligible children in the target 13 LGAs are vaccinated against measles," said Alhaji Babagana Abiso, director for disease control, Borno State Primary Health Care Development Agency. "The state authorities welcome this immunization campaign. We are grateful to WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi for making the exercise possible and supporting us in controlling the ongoing outbreak," he added.

[11] Madagascar: cases decreasing
Date: Sat 25 May 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/madagascar-measles-continue-decreasing-trend-20522/


WHO reports that the measles epidemic in Madagascar continues to show a decreasing trend since February [2019], when supplementary immunization activities (SIA) were performed. In the 8 month period of September 2018 to May 2019, 145 136 cases have been registered. Children under 14 years were the most affected. Of this total, more than 19 000 cases had complications and 909 people died.

The last and 3rd phase of the measles vaccination campaign took place in early April [2019] when an additional nearly 4 million children aged 6 months to less than 10 years in 67 districts were targeted. This last phase follows the 2 campaigns carried out in January and February 2019, which made it possible to target 3.2 million children aged 6 months -- 9 years in 47 health districts in the country.

The WHO representative in Madagascar, Dr Charlotte Ndiaye, said: "The effective protection of the population against measles cannot be maintained without the revitalization of routine immunization. It is important to draw the attention of the population to the need to vaccinate their children, but efforts must be strengthened to ensure that all parents of 9-11 month olds continue to vaccinate their children outside the countryside."

WHO UNICEF Philippines: measles outbreak situation report 11, 27 May 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
Current measles outbreak started late 2017 in Mindanao. In 2018, 20 827 cases were reported with 199 deaths. Outbreak and supplementary immunization activities in 2018 were ineffective in addressing the outbreak as the immunization activity was met with increased vaccine hesitancy due to the dengue vaccine controversy. Weak routine immunization leading to a decrease in overall immunization coverage in recent years resulted in large immunity gaps among younger children against vaccine preventable diseases including measles.

The Philippines Department of Health (DoH) declared measles outbreaks in 5 regions (region NCR [National Capital Region], III, IVA, VI, VII) on 7 Feb 2019, whereas cases were reported from all 17 regions. DoH issued guidelines for nation-wide measles vaccination accompanied by oral polio vaccine (OPV) and vitamin A distribution until end March 2019, prioritizing unvaccinated children between 6 and 59 months; schoolchildren from kindergarten to grade 6; and adults who voluntarily wish to be vaccinated against measles.

Current situation
-----------------
Between 1 Jan and 11 May 2019, 34 950 measles cases including 477 deaths were officially reported through the routine surveillance system from the DoH, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.37% (see table 1 --available at the source URL above).

The number of newly reported cases in epidemiological week 19 (5 to 11 May 2019) was 0.5% lower than in the same time period in 2018.

With a median age of 3 years old, 52% of measles cases are under 5 years of age. 53% of measles cases are male.

With a median age of 1 year old, 83% of all deaths are children under the age of 5: 58% of measles deaths are male. Most deaths are reported from Region III, IV-A, VIII and NCR.

About 80 people who attended a party in Lower Hutt [Wellington] on [Sat 18 May 2019] are at risk of contracting measles. Nurses from Regional Public Health are contacting partygoers after a man was subsequently found to have the infectious disease. He did not know he had measles, and most likely caught it in Australia. The man also visited Lower Hutt businesses [see source URL for locations].

Medical officer of health Dr Annette Nesdale said anyone who was at the party or those businesses could be at risk if they are not immune.

This is Wellington's 4th case of measles this year [2019].

A sales assistant in Hong Kong who works at a shop next to the Gucci outlet hit earlier by a measles outbreak has emerged as the latest victim of the disease. The latest case pushed the total number of measles cases in the city to 75 so far this year [2019], up from 15 last year [2018] and 4 in 2017, according to the Centre for Health Protection.

The 32 year old man works at the Bulgari store in Harbour City shopping centre in the tourist district of Tsim Sha Tsui. 6 staff members at the Gucci shop next door contracted the disease earlier this month [May 2019]. A centre spokesman said on [Tue 28 May 2019]: "It is premature to speculate if the disease had spread from [Gucci]. The man told us that he believed he had not contacted any measles patients."

Despite being of previous good health and said to have received two doses of measles vaccination, the sales assistant developed a fever and runny nose last [Thu 21 May 2019], before a rash emerged 2 days later. He went to see a private doctor on [Sun 26 May 2019] and was referred to the Princess Margaret Hospital, where he was admitted that day. A laboratory test of his respiratory specimen proved positive for the measles virus. The centre said he was in a stable condition.

There are more than 30 people working at the luxury goods store. The patient lives with his mother and his girlfriend, neither of whom had any symptoms but have been put under medical surveillance. The man had no relevant travel history, according to the centre.

In a statement released on [Tue 28 May 2019], the centre said: "Upon notification of the case, the [centre] immediately commenced epidemiological investigations and conducted relevant contact tracing. Investigations are ongoing." A spokesman for the Bulgari outlet in Harbour City could not be reached for comment at press time on [Tue 28 May 2019]. Following the outbreak at the Gucci store, the management company of Harbour City deployed a team of cleaners for disinfection.

A spokesman for Harbour City confirmed it was told on Monday evening [27 May 2019] of the measles case at Bulgari. "Harbour City will continue to take on extra cleaning at the common area in the mall," the spokesman said.

While global measles deaths have decreased by 84% worldwide in recent years -- from 550 100 deaths in 2000 to 89 780 in 2016 -- it is still common in many developing countries, especially in parts of Africa and Asia.

In Hong Kong, health authorities were put on high alert after a cluster of 29 measles cases at the city's international airport were reported since [22 Mar 2019]. In an emergency operation, the centre vaccinated more than 8500 of those working at the airport. On [17 May 2019], the centre announced that the outbreak of measles infection at the Hong Kong airport had concluded.

["Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus, which usually results in a high fever and rash, and can lead to blindness, encephalitis, or death. By the end of 2017, 85% of children had received one dose of measles vaccine by their 2nd birthday and 167 countries had included a 2nd dose as part of routine immunization and 67% of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine according to national immunization schedules."

"In 2017, an estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with routine immunization services such as 3 doses of DTP (diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis) vaccine. Around 60% of these children live in 10 countries: Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa.

"Monitoring data at subnational levels is critical to helping countries prioritize and tailor vaccination strategies and operational plans to address immunization gaps and reach every person with lifesaving vaccines." (https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage)

International travel and trade is undoubtedly sustaining international spread of infectious diseases and since mid-June 2007, when they came
into force, the International Health Regulations adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2005 (IHR 2005) were implemented in all WHO member states.

"IHR implementation is a long-term process that calls for countries to:
- develop and strengthen specific national public health capacities;
- identify priority areas for action;
- develop national IHR implementation plans;
- maintain these capacities and continue to build and strengthen as needed over time."

[16] Vaccination

Before a vaccine became widely available in the 1960s, measles was an inevitable childhood disease. The highly contagious virus came round like clockwork. Infection conferred lifelong immunity -- but at the cost, each year, of about 500 deaths and 50 000 hospitalisations in America alone. In the decades that followed, routine childhood vaccination in Western countries made measles increasingly rare. In recent years, however, outbreaks have become more frequent, with no signs of abating.

The resurgence has been blamed on parents refusing to vaccinate their children or delaying jabs. But what has also become clear is that vaccinating only children is no longer sufficient. In 2013-17 between 33% and 63% of the annual measles cases in Europe were among people older than 14 years. In 2017 the median age for measles cases in Italy, which has frequent outbreaks, was 27 years.
