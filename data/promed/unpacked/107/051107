Huagong Road, on the southeastern reaches of Beijing, is a dusty
stretch of ramshackle auto repair shops, family-run restaurants and,
unfortunately for one young man, the occasional stray dog.
Early this month [July 2007], he became the latest victim of a rabies
epidemic that has astonished national and international health officials.
According to official health figures, rabies is now the deadliest
infectious disease in China. Rarely fatal in the West [because of
little exposure to rabid animals, and effective post-exposure
treatment - Mod.TY], rabies is killing more than 200 people here per
month, outpacing tuberculosis deaths in 13 of the last 14 months.
In 1996, figures show only 163 Chinese died from rabies. Last year
[2006], the disease killed 3215.
"The World Health Organization is extremely concerned about the
number of cases in China," says Dr. Nima Asgari, the WHO's
communicable disease specialist in Beijing. "The reason for the rise
is currently under investigation."
Chinese media have also reported, in what may be an isolated case,
that officials are investigating bogus human rabies vaccines still in
circulation after having been removed from shelves 2 years ago.
Last year [2006], desperate to stem the epidemic, public health
officials touched off an international storm of criticism by ordering
a mass extermination of dogs in some areas.
In the province of Yunnan, officials clubbed, hanged or electrocuted
more than 50 000 dogs in a single week. In the county of Mouding,
Chinese media reported roving squads seizing dogs from their owners,
killing the pets on the spot.
Another worker was bitten by the same dog that late May 2007
afternoon, but the other worker got rabies shots after the incident
and is fine.
With the 2008 Olympics only a year away now, Beijing wants to make
sure nothing goes wrong, especially on the health front.
As recently as 2000, not a single person died in Beijing due to
rabies. But last year [2007] there were a dozen. Local officials want
that number lowered and eliminated, if possible.
Police have gotten tough enforcing a 2003 "one-family, one-dog"
policy in 8 city districts and have rounded up unregistered dogs.
Under the rule of Mao Zedong, pet ownership was frowned upon as
bourgeois and decadent. But today, with China's rising middle-class,
pet ownership has become popular.
The city is home to 550 000 registered canines. But there is believed
to be an equal number still unregistered. With such a large dog
population, unfriendly interactions are bound to occur, and they do.
More than 140 000 people turned up at city hospitals last year [2006]
to be treated for dog bites, all the more reason for the government
to insist on dog vaccinations.
Dog registration costs the equivalent of USD 140 the 1st year for
owners in central Beijing, about USD 70 annually thereafter. That's
real money in a city where the average per capita annual income is
about USD 6000.
But out in the countryside and especially in the south is where the
real problem lies, says Dr. Luo Tingrong, a professor of veterinary
medicine at Guangxi University. Five key provinces -- including
Guangxi -- account for more than 70 percent of the problem.
The reasons for the outbreak are 3-fold, he says: rising incomes have
meant a rapid increase in the number of dogs; far too many remain
unvaccinated; and people in the countryside, in particular, remain
unaware of the seriousness of the problem. People from the provinces,
"don't know how to deal with a bite ... and they don't seek proper
treatment," he said.

[It is tragic that so many fatalities are resulting from a disease
that is preventable. A massive canine vaccination campaign coupled
with a vigorous public education effort to get pets vaccinated and to
seek post-exposure treatment when bitten, alerting health care
providers to administer proper post-exposure treatment, and
elimination of stray (un-owned) dogs could sharply reduce human
rabies cases. - Mod.TY]
