West Nile Virus-Infected Dead Crow Found in Bronx and mosquitoes in Staten
Island and Manhattan
-------------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., also announced that
a dead crow found in the East Tremont section of the Bronx has tested
positive for West Nile virus. This represents the first indication of viral
activity in the Bronx and, as such, weather permitting on Tuesday evening,
15 Aug, the City will conduct ground-based spraying around the two-mile
area where the bird was found.
Dr. Cohen also announced that evidence of WNV was confirmed late yesterday
by the New York State Department of Health in 14 additional pools of
mosquitoes trapped recently in New York City: 13 pools were in Staten
Island; 1 was in Manhattan. Each of the mosquito traps was collected prior
to the most recent adult mosquito spraying efforts in their area. The
mosquitoes were collected from 25-28 Jul from a total of 13 traps
distributed over 9 sites on Staten Island including La Tourette Park,
Tottenville, Rossville, Saw Mill Marsh, Fresh Kills, Blue Heron Park,
Rossville, Westerleigh and Great Kills Park; and from Central Park in
Manhattan on July 28. Since the mosquitoes were collected in Central Park
prior to the City's 4 Aug pesticide application, there is no spraying in
Central Park scheduled at this time.
In addition to the _Culex pipiens_ that were found to be positive for the
virus, another _Culex_ species, _Culex salinarius_ was also found to be
carrying the virus. This mosquito also bites from dusk until dawn and the
precautions recommended - such as eliminating breeding sites and taking
personal protection measures against mosquitoes from dusk until dawn -
remain the same.

Sentinel chickens: First report of seroconversion
-------------------------------------------------
The first sentinel chicken seroconversion has occurred in Westchester
County. The chicken was in Somers and had been infected prior to ground
spraying operations conducted in that area. The Westchester County
Department of Health stated that Somers and communities within a two-mile
radius would not need to be re-sprayed at this time.
[Westchester County has had 12 positive birds since Feb 2000 & 6 positive
mosquito pools. - Mod.JW

[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta this week said
that 188 infected birds have been found this year, including 128 in New
York, 54 in New Jersey, four in Massachusetts and two in Connecticut. More
than half of the infected birds have been found since 1 Aug 2000. The
discovery of infected birds in upstate New York and Massachusetts indicated
the risk of human infection exists in a larger geographical area than in
1999. - Mod.CP.
