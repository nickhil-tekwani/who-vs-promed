[Surprise, surprise. Considering the normal, non-fastidious feeding habits
of British seagulls, which can spend the winter sometimes far inland, I am
surprised that only 3% of the 700 droppings sampled contained O157. But
isn't this an expected prevalence of this bacteria in (healthy) cattle
faeces? One more reason to be careful where you are while eating sandwiches
on a British beach. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-Ahead moderator
