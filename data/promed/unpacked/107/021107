Pepper vines turn brown in Napoklu
----------------------------------
Though the market rate of pepper has soared, the crop loss due to disease has worried farmers. In Napoklu [Kodagu district, Karnataka state], the ready-for-harvest pepper vines have turned brown, resulting in crop loss. The leaves and pepper grains wither from the vines. In spite of providing manure and using insecticides, the crops have been affected badly, the farmers say.

The pepper produce in Karnataka is 13 000 tonne and an average of 5500 tonnes of the crop is produced in Kodagu itself. The farmers anticipate a huge fall in pepper production in the state this time.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is known to be affected by several fungal, nematode, phytoplasma and viral pathogens. A number of diseases causing wilting of leaves and fruit, as described above, have been reported from India, including quick wilt (also called foot rot; caused by _Phytophthora capsici_), slow wilt (also called slow decline or yellows; caused by nematodes) and root rots (caused by _Fusarium_ species).

Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed for successful management of the problem.
