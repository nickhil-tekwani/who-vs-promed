Fresh foot-and-mouth [FMD] outbreak hits central Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------------------
The central province's agriculture department said on Tuesday [8 Sep
2009] that authorities in Truong Xuan Commune [Quang Ninh district,
Quang Binh province] and related agencies have taken measures to
prevent the spread of the highly infectious viral disease, including a
ban on transporting meat out of the neighborhood.

Quang Binh's 1st FMD outbreak last month [August 2009] infected over
100 cows and buffalos. The 2nd outbreak in Quang Binh has affected
nearly 40 cows and buffalos.

Since last month [August 2009], the disease, which hit Viet Nam hard
in 2006 with tens of thousands of cattle being sickened, has recurred
in central and northern provinces like Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, and
Tuyen Quang.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur George Robertson

[According to Viet Nam's OIE annual report for 2008, a total of 24
outbreaks of FMD serotype O were recorded in the provinces of Cao
Bang, Ha Tinh, and Nghe An. This serotype is regarded endemic in Viet
Nam. In July 2007, an outbreak of FMDV serotype Asia 1 was reported
and later (February 2008) declared resolved, becoming endemic as well.
No mortality was reported.

No official information from Viet Nam to confirm the introduction and
spread of a new serotype (FMDV-A?) is as yet available on the OIE
website. The initial (unofficial) information on the identification of
serotype A is included in ProMED-mail posting 20090122.0273.

From previous media reports on the current epizootic, it may be
assumed that the newly introduces virus, allegedly of serotype A, is
highly pathogenic. However this serotyping is in need of official
confirmation. According to the Viet Nam page on the website of the
World reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD-Pirbright), the serotypes
known to have been identified in Viet Nam, and the years during which
they were recorded, are
FMDV-O: 1956, 1967, 1969, 1997, 1999-2009
FMDV-A: 2004-2006
FMDV-Asia 1: 1992, 2005-2009

For further details and genotyping results, see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm>.
The newswire above mentions 2006 as the previous epizootic; may this
be indicative of suspected FMDV-A? It would be interesting to note if
samples from the current outbreaks have been submitted to the WRLFMD.

A response to ProMED-mail's previous RFIs to confirm (or otherwise)
the information on FMDV serotype A allegedly recorded in several
provinces of Viet Nam from north to south since December 2008, will be
appreciated. Preferably, to include morbidity and mortality data, the
strain's genotyping, and the availability of vaccines. - Mod.AS]
