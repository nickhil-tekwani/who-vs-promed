Having the longest land border, the Russian Federation is under constant threat of importation of pathogens of transboundary animal diseases. Thus, the causative agents of the African swine fever [ASF] and infectious nodular dermatitis [LSD] were introduced into the territory of the Russian Federation through the countries of Transcaucasia.

Earlier this year [2018], in the Trans-Baikal Territory, foci of foot and mouth disease [FMD] were registered, caused by a drift, from the territory of contiguous countries, of FMD virus, belonging to type O.

This is not the 1st time, because almost every year the Russian veterinary service has to address foci of this dangerous disease in the settlements located in the immediate vicinity of the Russian-Chinese state border running along the river Argun [see comment]. However, this time the situation is more similar to 2011, when due to cattle grazing in the same field with Mongolian gazelle (_Procapra gutturosa_, 'Saigaks'), domestic animals from the village of Ust-Imalka of Onossky district were infected with the FMDV serotype O. Scientists have repeatedly noted that the migration of these wild animals inhabiting the territory of Russia, Mongolia and China is one of the main factors of the spread of the disease in the region.

A key role in preventing the introduction and spread of this dangerous disease is played by epizootic monitoring, which makes it possible to establish or exclude the fact that the pathogen circulates in a population of wild susceptible animals. Unfortunately, it is this tool that does not work in practicevon the territory of the Specially Protected Natural Territories of the Russian Federation. Due to the lack of effective measures to prevent the introduction and control the spread of infectious animal diseases, such territories are transformed into natural reservoirs of infections, and, thus, into a time bomb. The financial losses the country suffers are attributed, in addition to the direct animal disease and the destruction of products, also to bans of exporting livestock products for an indefinite period.

[The above Russian expert's observation addresses the FMD event covered in 20180213.5624383; please see Mod.CRD's comments, there.

Russia's OIE notification of [Mon 12 Feb 2018] presented 4 outbreaks; the current item (at the source url) includes a map (in Russian), on which 6 outbreaks are presented; the disease seems to spread.

An event of FMDV-O was reported from the same Zabaykal region (Russia/Mongolia/China junction) in Nov-Dec 2016. (https://tinyurl.com/ybeh9pbw)

The Argun or Ergune is a 1621 km (1007 mi) river that forms part of the eastern China-Russia border, together with the Amur River. It marks for centuries the border between Russia and China for about 944 kilometres (587 mi), until it meets the Amur River.

The Mongolian gazelle (_Procapra gutturosa_; in Russian, Dzeren) is a medium-sized antelope native to the semiarid Central Asian steppes of Mongolia, as well as some parts of Siberia and China; see http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Procapra_gutturosa/.
