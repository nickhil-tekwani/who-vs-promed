Poliomyelitis in Kenya - 19 October 2006
---------------------
One case of wild poliovirus type-1, due to an importation of virus from
neighbouring Somalia, has been reported from a Somali refugee camp in
northeastern Kenya. The 3-year old girl (who was born in Kenya and had not
traveled to Somalia) had onset of paralysis on 17 Sep 2006. The case is in
the district of Garissa in North Eastern Province bordering Somalia, where
an outbreak of poliomyelitis has resulted in 216 cases to date since July
2005. Genetic sequencing indicates a virus of Nigerian origin, imported
from Kismayo, Somalia; however, it is not possible to determine how long
the virus has been circulating in Kenya. A joint national/international
rapid response team is conducting a detailed clinical and epidemiological
investigation.
Emergency, sub-national mop-up vaccinations with monovalent type-1 oral
poliovirus vaccine (mOPV1) are scheduled for northeastern Kenya for 3 Nov
[2006], covering 250 000 children in Kenya and coordinated with Somalia and
Ethiopia. The next round in December [2006] may be expanded to include
Nairobi and other high-risk areas.

Kenya - 18 Oct [2006]
-------------------
A case of wild poliovirus type-1 [WPV1], due to an importation of virus
from neighboring Somalia, has been reported from a refugee camp in North
Eastern Province of Kenya. The 3-year old girl, who has not traveled to
Somalia, was born and lives in the refugee camp in the District of Garissa
bordering Somalia, where an outbreak has led to 216 cases to date since
July 2005. She was paralyzed by polio on 17 Sep 2006.
Genetic sequencing indicates a virus of Nigerian origin, imported from
Kismayo, Somalia; it is not possible to determine how long the virus has
been circulating in Kenya. A joint national/international rapid response
team is conducting a detailed clinical and epidemiological investigation.
Emergency, sub-national mop-up rounds with monovalent type-1 oral
poliovirus vaccine (mOPV1) are scheduled for northeastern Kenya for 3
November, covering 250 000 children in Kenya and coordinated with Somalia
and Ethiopia. The next round in December [2006] may be expanded to include
Nairobi and other high-risk areas.
Because of the polio outbreak in neighboring Somalia, 4 rounds of
sub-national immunization days were already conducted in Kenya between
April and September 2006, in an effort to limit the consequences of any
importations. Each of these sub-national immunization campaigns included
the North Eastern Province of Kenya (target population of 250 000 children
aged less than 5 years). Although high coverage (100 percent) was reported,
accurate estimations are very difficult to make: the area's sparse
population moves frequently within the area and across the borders of
Somalia and Ethiopia. Moreover, monitoring of the campaigns and
retrospective reviews suggest children may have been missed in some areas.
Routine immunization coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine
(OPV3) is reported to be between 50 and 60 percent in the northern
districts of the Northeastern Province, but above 80 percent in the
southern districts, of which Garissa is one. However, in the North Eastern
Province in 2006, 50 percent of children with acute flaccid paralysis [AFP]
(a symptom of polio) had 3 or fewer doses of OPV.
Note
Surveillance indicators in North Eastern Province of Kenya: Non-polio acute
flaccid paralysis [AFP] rate of 1-1.9 , below the recommended rate for
areas contiguous to polio-affected countries. Adequacy of stool collection
is below 50 percent.

[In the above reports, the additional information that was not in the
preceding post on this (see Poliomyelitis- Worldwide (14): Kenya ex Somalia
20061016.2980) was the itinerary the WPV responsible for this case followed
-- Nigeria to Kismayo, Somalia to North Eastern Province of
Kenya. Investigations are underway to determine the level of possible
circulation of this WPV in the North Eastern Province of Kenya. In
addition, there is mention of the planned additional immunization efforts
for November and December 2006. The surveillance indicators for the region
in Kenya where the case was identified suggest there are surveillance
weaknesses both in terms of AFP identification as well laboratory
evaluations for AFP cases. Hence, it would not be surprising if additional
cases may be found now that surveillance efforts are being augmented as
part of the case investigation. - Mod.MPP]
