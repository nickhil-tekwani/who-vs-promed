Dusty the dog has been put down after the family received results of
more testing that confirmed he could infect others with the
potentially fatal Hendra virus.

The 2-year-old kelpie became the 1st dog outside controlled laboratory
experiments known to have contracted the bat-borne virus when he
tested positive to Hendra antibodies last week.

Although appearing healthy, testing indicated the dog had contracted
the virus at some stage but overcame it.

The case drew community outcry when it was revealed Dusty would have
to be put down under strict national guidelines for dealing with
Hendra cases, sparking social media campaigns to save him.

But the Mount Alford family said they had decided to put down the
family pet on Sunday afternoon [31 Jul 2011], rather that wait for
Biosecurity Queensland to order them to do so. "Our beloved dog Dusty
was humanely euthanised by our family vet after results of his most
recent blood tests confirmed that he carried Hendra virus antibodies,
which meant he was able to shed the virus to other animals," the
owners said in a statement. "... We are devastated by the loss of our
4th family animal to the Hendra virus (3 horses were also victims of
Hendra on their property, southwest of Brisbane) and are particularly
saddened to witness the effect the loss of our young dog has had on
our children," the statement said. "We remain in awe of the support
our family has been offered by friends and strangers nationwide. The
campaigns and messages of support continue to comfort all of us."

Meanwhile, from now on pets may face mandatory testing on properties
where Hendra virus has infected horses.

Premier Anna Bligh said the tests had been voluntary but Dusty's case
had changed scientists' thinking. "I understand that Biosecurity
Queensland is looking at making (testing) a standard protocol on every
property where there is an infected horse," she told reporters on
Sunday [31 Jul 2011]. "... Given that we've now seen it crossing into
another species, I understand they will be seeking to test other
domestic animals."

Ms Bligh said Biosecurity Queensland was also looking at checking
previously untested pets on properties where horses had been infected
in previous weeks.

A total of 15 horses infected with Hendra have died or been put down
since 20 Jun 2011 -- 10 in Queensland and 5 in NSW -- and more than 60
people [exposed to them] are being tested.

There is no doubt that the dog in question had been infected by Hendra
virus. This was established through CSIRO's [Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organisation] Australian Animal Health
Laboratory, based on serology on repeat samples (both VNT (virus
neutralization test) and ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay).
This laboratory is the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
Reference Laboratory for Hendra and Nipah virus diseases.

It was on this basis that Australia notified the finding to OIE on 27
Jul 2011 and your readers can refer to this link for details:
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10833

Australia's State, Territory, and Commonwealth chief veterinary
officers agreed with this finding.

Although it is very unfortunate that a family pet had to be
euthanised, it has been national policy for some years that all
terrestrial animals that have evidence of infection with Hendra virus
(such as through antibodies) are destroyed. Australia's State,
Territory, and Commonwealth chief veterinary officers were consulted
and confirmed that this policy should apply to this dog.

This policy is necessary at this time because there is clear evidence
from Hendra virus, and the related Nipah virus, that animals and
people that survive infection can go on to develop disease weeks or
months later and potentially pose a risk to people at that time. As
rightly pointed out by Dr David Thompson in a recent ProMED-mail
posting, if this dog were to have been kept alive it would have had to
be confined under extremely strict, long-term biosecurity conditions.
This would not be desirable for the dog's welfare.

In 2008, AAHL [Australian Animal Health Laboratory] scientists
euthanised and conducted a detailed post mortem examination on a horse
that had recovered from infection with Hendra virus, providing
invaluable scientific data. It was hoped that similar investigations
with this dog would add to our scientific knowledge. In this case the
owners of the dog did not give permission for a necropsy.

Australian scientists are continuing their investigations into the
possible drivers for the unprecedented number of outbreaks of Hendra
virus in horses in Queensland and north east New South Wales in 2011.
Australian governments have recently announced AUD 12 million [approx
USD 13 million] of new funding to undertake research into Hendra virus
and further minimise the risk this virus poses to animals and people.

[While there is much misunderstanding about Hendra virus, there is
even more that is misunderstood about Dusty, the dog that tested
positive for Hendra virus antibody.

Australia's one biosecurity containment lab did work with dogs in 1994
and found that dogs do not shed the virus in saliva. However, in 1994,
a human who seroconverted, relapsed 13 months later with a clinical
event leading to death.

Fear is still very much prevalent, but, on the basis of the
seroconverted human who died, it was agreed that seropositive animals
should be euthanized.

Last year [2010], a horse did the same seroconversion and relapsing
and was put down; although no virus was isolated, viral genome was
isolated from a range of tissues.

Therefore, it is likely the dog fell into this same category. The
animal had both ELISA fixing antibodies (on 2 different assays) and
neutralizing antibodies.

Biosecurity Queensland believes they have tested sufficient animals,
including dogs over a number of years to be relatively certain of the
results. Biosecurity Queensland has tested cats and dogs, both on the
premises where this animal resided and elsewhere, both during the
current outbreak and outbreaks in previous years, which have all been
negative until Dusty was encountered.

While there may be limited evidence but adequate policy and safety
concerns to support the actions taken, there do not appear to be any
studies directly dealing with seroconverted dogs. So it seems that
there was a prime study candidate that should have been examined in a
secure facility. However, human considerations are appropriate and
perhaps this canine fellow would not have done well in such an
atmosphere.

According to Biosecurity Queensland there was a risk posed by this dog
and that risk, with this virus, was not worth the deadly consequence
for humans. It is reasonable to assume that the virus may have
replicated in the dog, but whether it was there will now never be
known. It is such a difficult balancing act between science and a
family pet. There are strong emotions on both sides of this
situation.

While there is clearly some research involving dogs, there needs to be
more.

I would like to express my appreciation to Dr Shipp for having taken
the time to write and express the regulatory point of views. Openness
of information and explanation of actions to the public are critical
in emotionally charged situations and emerging situations such as
this. - Mod.TG]
