Four more cases have been reported in Guinea's Ebola outbreak, raising the total to 23, the WHO African regional office said today [6 Apr 2021] on Twitter.

On [1 Apr 2021], the country confirmed a new case after not reporting any new infections in the outbreak since [4 Mar 2021]. Media reports said last week's case was found amid a cluster of suspicious deaths in the area and reports that some sick people had fled the area.

Today's WHO update also reflects 3 more deaths, raising the fatality count to 12.

In another Ebola development, Bavarian Nordic announced today [6 Apr 2021] that it has received a new supply order from Janssen worth USD 28 million to make and deliver bulk MVA-BN Filo, the prime-boost vaccine Ebola vaccine licensed to Janssen.

The vaccine was developed during West Africa's massive outbreak and has been tested in Europe and Africa. The European Commission approved the vaccine in 2020, and the WHO is assessing the vaccine for prequalification, which would allow broader rollout in at-risk African countries.

Bulk production will begin in May [2021], with delivery expected in the 2nd half of 2021.

[This is good as it will supplement the Ervebo (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine which has been in short supply in Guinea. But delivery in the 2nd half of 2021 is likely (one hopes) too late for this current outbreak.

- 6 Apr 2021. Zabdeno/Mvabea Ebola vaccine
[Precision Vaccinations, abridged, edited]
https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/zabdeno-mvabea-ebola-vaccine

Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) Ebola vaccine description

The recent Ebola prevention vaccine therapy consists of 2 components, Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo). Zabdeno is given first, and Mvabea is administered approximately 8-weeks later as a booster. The prime-boost vaccination method is an established approach for preventing infectious diseases.

Developed by Johnson and Johnson's Janssen division, Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) is a monovalent vaccine designed to provide active specific, acquired immunity to the Ebola virus. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the Ebola virus Mayinga variant's glycoprotein. Janssen has rapidly advanced the vaccine's development with multiple clinical Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials ongoing in parallel in healthy adults, children, elderly and immunocompromised populations across Europe, the USA, and Africa intending to register the vaccine ultimately.

Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) is a multivalent vaccine preparation designed to provide active acquired immunity to the Sudan virus, the Ebola virus, the Marburg virus, and the Tai Forest virus (formerly known as Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus).

As protection against Ebola virus disease (EVD) is considered to be of major public health interest, Zabdeno and Mvabea were evaluated under European Medicines Agency (EMA) accelerated assessment mechanism, a tool which aims to speed up patients' access to new medicines if there is an unmet medical need.

As a precautionary measure, a Zabdeno booster vaccination should be considered for individuals at imminent risk of exposure to the Ebola virus, for example, healthcare professionals and those living in or visiting areas with an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak, who completed the Zabdeno, Mvabea 2-dose primary vaccination regimen.

Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) Ebola Vaccine History
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On [29 May 2020], the European Medicines Agency (EMA) human medicines committee recommended granting Zabdeno and Mvabea a positive opinion for marketing authorizations under exceptional circumstances because the applicant was able to demonstrate that it is not possible to conduct a randomized controlled study that might generate comprehensive clinical data on the efficacy of the latest Ebola vaccine even after authorization.

This was considered acceptable in light of the ongoing Ebola outbreak and its high mortality rates.

The initial development of the Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) vaccine was sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health and is now managed by Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company that licensed MVA-BN Filo for use from Bavarian Nordic in a prime-boost vaccine regimen together with their adenovirus-based vaccine candidate, Ad26.ZEBOV.

These vaccines both use a viral vector approach, where a virus is genetically modified not to replicate but is used to express the target virus's essential proteins safely; in this case, the Ebola virus.

Global partners on the vaccine program also include the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the National Institutes of Health.

As a result of these collaborations, more than 6500 individuals have now participated in clinical studies for the Ebola vaccine across the US, Europe, and Africa. So far, the data from these studies suggest that the vaccine stimulates a robust immune response and has a favorable safety profile.

On [17 Nov 2020], The Lancet published a study -- Safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose heterologous Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen in adults in Europe (EBOVAC2): a randomized, observer-blind, participant-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [see reference below]. This study concluded the "2-dose heterologous regimen with Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo were safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic, with humoral and cellular immune responses persisting for 1 year after vaccination. Taken together, these data support the intended prophylactic indication for the vaccine regimen."
