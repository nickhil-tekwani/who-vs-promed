PORTO ALEGRE, BRAZIL: On Tuesday, Brazilian health authorities
confirmed the discovery of a new source of foot and mouth disease
(FMD) in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where 13 million
animals were vaccinated and another 1118 were killed after an earlier
outbreak last May [2001].
The appearance of the new outbreak coincided with a visit from a team
of scientists from the European Union sent to the region to ensure the
disease had been eradicated in order to resume beef imports from
southern Brazil.
The new outbreak, initially affecting 15 animals, surfaced on a ranch
located in the town of Rio Grande, some 300 kilometers (185 miles)
from Porto Alegre, near the border with Uruguay.
Until May 2001, Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Argentina and
Uruguay, was one of the 2 Brazilian states with international certificates
declaring the area free of FMD without having had to resort to
vaccination.
The region, which contains 8 percent of Brazil's cattle, was forced to
halt its beef exports in early May [2001] due to an outbreak of FMD,
and it has been attempting to resume beef sales by implementing the
vaccination program and the eradication of infected cattle.
