A small outbreak of a deadly equine virus near the metro area has prompted a call to quarantine all horses for a few weeks, even if they aren't displaying any signs of an infection. According to Christie Ward, an equine internal medicine specialist at the University of Minnesota, 7 horses have displayed signs of neurological defects, and 4 of those tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1, or EHV-1; 3 horses have been euthanized, one is recovering. Test results on the others are pending, Ward said.

The 1st reported case was 7 Mar 2104 at a farm north of Stillwater by the Stillwater Equine Veterinary Clinic, according to Dr Terry Arnesen of the clinic [see ProMED archive (03) listed below.]. The outbreak so far has remained in a region surrounding the Twin Cities, including Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, and Winona counties and western Wisconsin. The virus can spread from horse-to-horse contact or on fluids on humans and equipment, Ward said.

It seems that barrel racing [see comment below] is the common thread among the 7 cases. "The majority of the horses we've diagnosed have been barrel-racing horses or housed alongside barrel horses," Ward said. "Our best guess is that exposure likely happened at a barrel-racing event." Barrel racing is a rodeo event in which horses are ridden in a cloverleaf pattern around 3 large barrels [see image links in comment].

Ward and other veterinarians are urging horse owners to keep their animals quarantined and to avoid any travel, even if they have no signs and don't barrel race. The virus is highly contagious and can have debilitating and deadly effects on horses, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. Symptoms include fever, weakness, lack of coordination, and incontinence. Early detection and treatment are crucial, Ward said. She recommends quarantine for 28 to 30 days. "For the most part, the equine community is embracing this with enthusiasm and with a great sense of responsibility," Ward said. "Most people are very willing to take these recommendations. Many events have been canceled, but not all of them."

Ward said she has reached out to veterinarians across the state and hasn't heard of any additional cases.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise in temperature, which may signal the first of the disease. If there is a rise in a resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much) then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.
