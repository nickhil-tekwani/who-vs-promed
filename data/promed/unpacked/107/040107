A soil-borne pathogen found in wheat and oilseed rape crops can cut rapeseed yields by up to 50%. The pathogenic fungus _Rhizoctonia solani_ results in pre- and post-germination damping off, causing seed decay and seedling death.

Rumina Ray, University of Nottingham, explains that the pathogen has been underestimated and is now a clear problem for UK oilseed rape growers. "[It] is an overlooked soil-borne disease and its effect on oilseed rape has been ignored. Crop losses attributed to establishment failure due to pests or other soil-borne pathogens could, in fact, be the effects of rhizoctonia. Oilseed rape has one main taproot, meaning infection by the disease will significantly reduce crop growth."

The pathogen containing the AG 2-1 isolates that infect rapeseed crops is commonly found in soils across England. "Dry, healthy soils with good porosity are most at risk of infection, as the pathogen spreads faster under these conditions," she adds.

With limited cultural control and no registered seed treatments currently available, a strategy based on integrated control methods will be most effective at controlling the disease. Although there are no oilseed rape varieties that carry resistance to the pathogen, selecting varieties with high seed viability and vigour will reduce the risk of the disease.

[_Rhizoctonia solani_ (Rs; synonym _Thanatephorus cucumeris_) is a ubiquitous soil borne fungus associated with damping-off, root rot, basal stem rot (foot rot), and fruit rot in a large number of crops. A number of fungal anastomosis groups (AG) have been identified, according to hyphal incompatibility. They vary in host specificity and different AGs affect dicotyledons (including brassicas) and monocotyledons (such as cereals). Hosts are generally most susceptible in the seedling stage. On oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), Rs can cause death of young seedlings leading to patchy emergence or complete failure to establish a crop. Symptoms may also include rotting of roots and crown and delayed or patchy flowering. Other soilborne pathogens can cause similar symptoms which can make diagnosis difficult.

The pathogen survives in the upper soil, compost, and infected plant debris, inoculum levels increase on the roots of host plants. High levels of inoculum in the soil increase the risk of crop damage. Since the fungus has a wide host range, it is difficult to control by crop rotation. Disease management may include seed treatments, cultural practices and use of resistant crop varieties.

In the UK, Rs has also been reported to pose a similar problem for wheat cultivation (see link below). Thus, both dicot and monocot affecting AGs of the fungus are impacting crops in the country.
