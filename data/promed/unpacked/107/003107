Undiagnosed deaths, swine, chicken - Indonesia
--------------------------------------------------
Regarding the comment: "Hundreds of pigs aged 3 to 4 years have died.
Almost every day we hear of pigs dying. If this continues we must
bury them," said Maria. [A puzzling statement. Why burying only if
death continues?! -Mod.AS]"
I think they must be eating them. If they keep dying at this rate,
she is saying, the number of dead pigs available will exceed the
villagers' capacity to eat or preserve the meat before it goes off,
so they will have to start burying them. A villager would see that as
the worst outcome -- pigs dying so fast that they have to be wasted.
This of course could worsen the potential human exposure to whatever
is killing the pigs.
