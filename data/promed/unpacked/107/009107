In Puno to date, 3 yellow fever fatalities have been registered, stated the Puno Regional Health Director, Jose Irigoyen.

"With respect to yellow fever, we now have it controlled; since 20 Jan [2012] to date, we have had the same cases as before. There has not been an increase -- 3 deaths and 6 suspected cases," said the Director.

[This is an update of the ProMED-mail report posted on 11 Feb 2012 (see archive no 20120211.1039339). Fortunately, the prompt response seems to have halted the number of cases. The cases were most likely due to the sylvan (jungle) cycle. Halting the number of cases before an urban cycle can be initiated is good news.
