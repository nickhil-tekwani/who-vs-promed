First Report of Groundnut bud necrosis virus in Iran.
-------------------------------------------------------------
A. R. Golnaraghi, R. Pourrahim, N. Shahraeen, and Sh. Farzadfar, Plant
Virology Department, Plant Pests and Diseases Research Institute, P. O. Box
19395-1454, Tehran, Iran. Plant Dis. 86:561, 2002; published on-line as
D-2002-0319-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 10 February 2002.

During the summer of 2001, mosaic, mottle, ring mosaic, stunting, and bud
necrosis were observed in peanut fields (_Arachis hypogaea_ cv. Gilan) in
the Golestan Province of Iran. Mechanical inoculation of these samples
caused necrotic local lesions on _Vigna unguiculata_ cv. Mashad, necrosis
on _Nicotiana benthamiana_ and _N. rustica_, and mosaic followed by bud
necrosis on _Arachis hypogaea_ cv. NC2.

Using ... TAS-ELISA and polyclonal (As) combined with ... MAbs produced by
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), the samples were tested for presence of
tospoviruses [Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) (As-0115, MAb-0117-
5E4), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (As-0105, MAb-0116-2B6,
MAb-0106-4F2), and Groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV) (As-0118,
MAb-0226-1B4)].

The samples also were checked by TSWV polyclonal antibody (As-0526,
As-0580, DSMZ). ... [Extracts of] leaf samples and inoculated indicator
plants reacted positively to GBNV antibodies. ... A weak reaction was
observed with TSWV-polyclonal antibody ... but no reaction was detected
using the INSV and TSWV-MAbs. GBNV is a member of the Tospovirus genus and
[is serologically related to] TSWV (1).


To our knowledge, this is the first report of GBNV ... in Iran.

[GBNV is a member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Tospovirus. In addition
to GNV, there are 7 other species (Groundnut ringspot, Groundnut yellow
spot, Impatiens necrotic spot, Tomato chlorotic spot, tomato spotted wilt,
Watermelon silver mottle and Zucchini lethal chlorosis) as well 5 tentative
species (Chrysanthemum stem necrosis, Iris yellow spot, Groundnut chlorotic
fan-spot, Physalis severe mottle and Watermelon bud necrosis). Tospoviruses
are transmitted by several specIes of thrips. These viruses have wide host
ranges and can cause severe crop losses. Unfortunately, the level of virus
infection in the surveyed crops was not reported.

According to the International Center for Research in the Semi-Arid Tropics
(ICRISAT), groundnut (a.k.a. peanut) originated in the region of southern
Bolivia/north west Argentina in south America and is presently cultivated
in 108 countries of the world. Major producers are Asia (72 percent of
world groundnut production) followed by Africa (31 percent) and
North-Central America (7.5 percent) production. Important groundnut
producing countries are China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and
Vietnam in Asia; Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Zaire, Chad, Uganda, Cote
d'Ivory, Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mozambique, and Cameroon in Africa;
Argentina and Brazil in South America and USA and Mexico in North America.
