[The Arab village Muqeible is situated in the Northern ("Hazafon") district of Israel, essentially on the demarcation line between the territories of Israel and the West Bank (Palestinian authority, PA); map at http://tinyurl.com/jl7fl3y. It may be suspected that the virus is circulating in the adjacent Palestinian flocks. That said, it deserves to be stated that sheep pox is endemic in both territories.

In Israel and the PA, only sheep are known to be affected by the locally circulating virus strain and, consequently, only sheep are vaccinated. According to obtained official information, this flock, consisting of Assaf breed sheep, was last vaccinated in 2013 and thus may be regarded as susceptible.

Israel's sheep-pox vaccination policy has been exhaustively discussed in posting Sheep pox & goat pox - Israel (02): ovine, vaccination 20161128.4658095. The following vaccination data is derived from OIE's page "Israel, vaccination".

Year/No vaccinated sheep
2007/ 641 752
2008/ 604 392
2009/ 515 789
2010/ 524 032
2011/ 584 721
2012/ 651 087
2013/ 612
2014/ 0
2015/ 0

It remains to be seen what impact will the apparent discontinuation of vaccinations will have upon the epidemiology of the disease (confirmation of the discontinuation was requested in 20161128.4658095).

Until 2013, accurate vaccination statistics could be obtained from the annual reports issued (in Hebrew) by the Israeli Veterinary Services and Animal Health. The last such published report covered 2013. - Mod.AS
