Livestock keepers appeal for help to fight disease
--------------------------------------------------
Livestock keepers in Monduli District have appealed to the Government
to investigate a mysterious cattle disease which has killed more than
3000 cows. Talking to reporters who visited the area recently, the
pastoralists said the disease, whose symptoms resemble Rift Valley
fever, has erupted after the onset of rains. Areas affected by the
disease include Makuyuni, Mti Mmoja, Kanjiro and Mto wa Mbu.

This reporter witnessed hundreds of carcases scattered over large
areas in the affected villages. A famous animal keeper in Monduli
District, Mr Laibon Meshuku Mapii, said he has lost about 700 head of
cattle while hundreds others in his flock are sick. As we come out of
prolonged drought, grass have started to grow after rains began
falling in the villages, but when the cows eat the grass their
bellies swell and they eventually die, he said.

The chairman of CCM parents wing in Monduli, Mr Abdulahi Walsama, who
also owns livestock, said his family has lost more than 50 cattle
since the onset of rains. The pastoralists blame their Kenyan
counterparts as the ones who had come with the disease when they
crossed the border with their animals in search of pastures.

"We ask the Government to bring experts here to establish what is
this disease which kills our cattle," he said noting that if the
disease was not controlled immediately, pastoralists would be
affected economically and socially.

Chairman child, Mr Isupati Mebukoli, said he does not believe that
drought was the cause of the massive cattle deaths of their animals
as grass has a started to sprout after the rains.

Another pastoralist, Mr Yusuph Abdi Omar, who has lost about 140 head
of cattle, said the mysterious disease, and not lack of pastures, is
to blame for the calamity.

The Monduli district commissioner, Mr Jowika Kasunga, was not
available to comment on what the government was doing to assist
pastoralists in distress.

[Since no disease signs nor postmortem changes are included, this
apparently serious outbreak remains undiagnosed. A diagnosis is
urgently required, not only for animal-health sake but also to
exclude threats to public health (e.g., Rift valley fever, anthrax,
poisoning). Any additional information, particularly results of
veterinary investigations, is requested.
