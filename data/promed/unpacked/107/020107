Can anyone refer me to the source of the guidelines for removal of
accumulations of pigeon feces which I saw years ago (about 1993)? I had a
copy of the guidelines which were from an authoritative source which I
unfortunately do not remember. They essentially called for a moon-suit and
various other precautions. I now regret that I did not keep a copy, and I
am seeing this question arise with increasing frequency. Thanks to the
community for any assistance available!

Please advise if there is any documented risk of cryptococcosis in persons
who do not husband pigeons but who reside adjacent to (e.g. neighbors), or
traffic through (i.e. pedestrians) the harborage/dropping area?
In Public Health, we receive numerous complaints from interested parties
about (perceived) health risks in the above circumstances.

[I believe there would be significant risk only for immunocompromised
persons, especially HIV-positive individuals, who engage in cleaning of
pigeon roost areas. Living in the general area or passing through should
not present special risk. See basic information on the US CDC website

As I recollect from my medical mycology course given by Dr. Marguerita
Silva-Hutner, the droppings serve as an excellent medium for the culture of
_Cryptococcus neoformans_. The fungus is actually not an inhabitant of the
birds, per se. The growth of the fungus in pigeon feces has been associated
with the tops of air conditioners, good roosting perches for resting birds.
In the past, human pulmonary infections with this pathogen have been traced
back to this single point source. I believe that is why anti-pigeon devices
are now standard equipment on the tops of window-installed air conditioning
units around most cities with large pigeon populations.
