China has provided Viet Nam with non-refundable aid worth 1.5 million Yuan
(USD 185 650) to combat bird flu, which had spread to 21 cities and provinces
by Friday. It also subsidized the cost of transporting vaccines ordered by
Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City.
The Vietnamese Animal Health Department said Friday that 21 out of the total
64 localities across Viet Nam have confirmed the outbreak of avian influenza.
Meanwhile, in Viet Nam the latest fowl deaths were reported Thursday from Nghe
An province in the center and Quang Ninh province in the north.
Southern metro HCMC has strengthened control at checkpoints and outlying
districts as the city closed its gates to fowls from other provinces.
Since Thursday, 150 military personnel have been deployed to help mobile
patrol and market monitor teams.
In the last few days, local authorities have seized more than 8000 ducks and
chickens and 280 000 eggs at the gates and destroyed them.
There are still around 1462 pigeons, 1544 ornamental birds, and 70 ostriches
in the city. Officials have told the people to move them out of the city.
However, it has been confirmed there are no chickens around the city after the
Prime Minister issued a ban on poultry trading, breeding, and transport in
urban areas from early November.

Viet Nam's commercial hub Ho Chi Minh City has begun poisoning pigeons and
other wild birds as it moves to prevent avian flu from spreading into the
crowded city, an official said on Friday [25 Nov 2005].
The virus has this week also surfaced in the south where Ho Chi Minh City, a
centre of 10 million people, is located.
"We will make sure that no birds are left in the city to minimize the risk of
bird flu," Huynh Huu Loi, Director of Ho Chi Minh City's Animal Health
Department, told Reuters. Loi said beside the poisoning campaign, city
authorities would also move pet birds outside the city until Vietnam is free
of bird flu.
The southern city, the country's largest, has banned poultry farming even
though it has had no human cases since December 2004. Most of the outbreaks in
recent weeks have been in the cooler north. But the virus has spread to the
south with the province of Long An reporting its first flu outbreak in poultry
this week.

[A "stamping out" policy might, at times, become a controversial issue,
especially when protected species or rare animal breeds may be affected. FAO
advised earlier against the destruction of wild birds and their habitats (see
20050226.0607). - Mod.AS]

China's Ministry of Agriculture confirmed a bird flu outbreak in Zalantun city
in northern China's Inner Mongolia, the official Xinhua news agency said on
Friday [25 Nov 2005], bringing to 23 the number of outbreaks of the disease.
A state avian flu lab confirmed that 246 fowl which died last Sunday in
Zalantun had the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic bird flu, Xinhua said.
Local veterinary departments have culled 16 567 poultry within 3 km (2 miles)
of the affected area, it said. China has already culled more than 20 million
birds this year to contain the spread of avian influenza.
