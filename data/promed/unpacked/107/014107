About 70 cattle died and dozens others fell ill due to an unknown
disease in various VDCs* of Dailekh district within the past 3 weeks.

[* VDC (Village Development Committee) in Nepal is the lower
administrative part of its Local Development Ministry. Each district
has several VDCs, similar to municipalities but with greater
public-government interaction and administration. There are 3913
Village Development Committees in Nepal. A VDC is further divided
into wards. See
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Development_Committee_(Nepal)>. - Mod.AS]

Kiran Chaulagain, a local veterinarian, said 3 dozens goats, a dozen
cows, and 11 buffalos died of the unknown disease at Layanti and
Bindrasaini VDCs [Lyati Bindraseni VDC]. The cattle start drooling
and their bodies tremble once they catch the disease, he said.

Meanwhile, about a dozen cattle also died of an unknown disease at
Katti and Pagnath in eastern Dailekh.

Locals said the District Veterinary Office has not taken up the
problem seriously, though they had informed repeatedly.

The veterinary office said that a medical team will be dispatched to
the areas, where the unidentified disease has spread.
