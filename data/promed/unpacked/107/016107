Two more horse deaths attributed to EEE
---------------------------------------
According to the county health department, 2 more horses have died in
Carteret County [North Carolina, USA] due to eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE) [virus] infection. The county has now seen 3 equine deaths from EEE
since October [2009]. All 3 animals were located in the Newport area. With
the reports, health officials are reminding area residents to take
precautions to protect themselves and their horses against the rare disease.

The viral illness, transmitted by some species of mosquitoes, attacks the
central nervous system, causes inflammation of the brain, and can be fatal
to animals and humans. Wild birds serve as reservoirs for the virus.
Mosquitoes bite the birds and then can transmit the virus to humans and
animals, the health department said via a news release.

North Carolina averages about 1 human case of EEE and about 10 equine cases
each year. It is commoner in the eastern part of the state than elsewhere
in North Carolina, the health department said. About 50 per cent of human
EEE cases are fatal, with young children and the elderly most at risk.

Symptoms [in human beings] can develop from a few days to 2 weeks after a
bite by an infected mosquito. They include rapid onset of fever and
headache and can resemble a case of the flu. Survivors of EEE infections
may suffer from long-term effects to the nervous system. Therapy is limited
to treating the symptoms of the disease, but there is no specific cure.
There is a vaccine for horses but not for humans.

For people, the best defense against EEE infection is to avoid mosquito
bites. Reduce time spent outdoors, particularly in early morning and early
evening hours when mosquitoes are most active. Wear light-colored long
pants and long-sleeved shirts and apply mosquito repellent to exposed skin.

The best defense for horses is to vaccinate them against EEE. The American
Academy of Equine Practitioners now recommends that EEE vaccine be given to
all horses as part of a core vaccination program.

Reduce mosquito-breeding areas by removing any containers that can hold
water; keep gutters clean; repair leaky outdoor faucets and change the
water in bird baths and pet bowls at least twice a week; use screened
windows and doors and make sure screens fit tightly and are not torn; keep
tight-fitting screens or lids on rain barrels.

[By mid-December in North America we are thinking of colder weather. Where
there has been a frost/freeze it would have killed the mosquitoes that are
capable of carrying and transmitting EEE. While it is possible that
mosquitoes survive in basements and in some areas, possibly barns, this
many animals affected this late in the year is a little odd. However, the
article does state that it is since October, not necessarily implying that
any of these animals were infected in December.
