For decades researchers have known that a bacterial disease in elk, bison and cattle in the Greater Yellowstone (GY) Ecosystem causes periodic abortions in these animals and chronic illness in humans drinking infected cow's milk. The disease, called brucellosis, poses a financial concern for dairy producers and cattle ranchers, but its effects on the wild elk population have generally been considered minor.

In recent years, however, elk pregnancy rates have become the subject of controversy. Various researchers claim that stress caused by fear of wolves and nutritional deficiencies caused by drought can explain low pregnancy rates in specific elk herds, but until now the effects of brucellosis on elk pregnancy have not been scrutinized.

Utah State University researchers Gavin Cotterill and Johan du Toit report by mid-winter, elk testing positive for brucellosis are less likely to be pregnant than healthy elk, independent from the abortions caused by the disease later in the year. Cotterill and du Toit, along with colleagues from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, US Geological Survey Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, and University of California Berkeley, discuss their findings in Ecology and Evolution published on [28 Oct 2018] (DOI 10.1002/ece3.4521).

"Mid-winter elk pregnancy rates are often seen as an indicator of an elk herd's health and viability," says Cotterill, a PhD candidate at USU and lead author of the paper. "If we're interested in figuring out the effect that predators or climate are having on elk we need to also account for disease."

The researchers analyzed pregnancy and disease data collected over the last 20 years at Wyoming's supplemental winter feed-grounds for elk and ran additional pregnancy tests on stored blood samples.

"We found the disease causes a substantial decline in the probability of pregnancy among young adult elk and the effect is weaker in older animals, but it's still unclear what the mechanism is that's causing this to happen," said du Toit.

The results are not a cause for alarm but are a signal this disease, which came to the area in infected cattle, has previously hidden consequences for the wild elk population. Quantifying this effect is important, particularly as brucellosis is spreading through the elk population, so that the effects of other factors influencing elk reproduction may be estimated more accurately.

"Elk numbers in most of the region are high, and we don't expect changes because of brucellosis," said Cotterill. "It's one more factor researchers and managers need to keep in mind moving forward."

[The Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA), or Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) encompasses several state areas [Wyoming, Montana, Idaho].

Ranchers have complained for years of brucellosis spilling over from elk to cattle. However, this article is from the proverbial other side of the fence. It is examining the effects of brucellosis on the wildlife herd, especially the elk.

In all probability, in some era past, the cattle likely transmitted the disease to the elk that have harbored a low level in some groups, thus transmitting it back into the cattle herds occasionally, after ranchers worked to clean the disease from their cattle.

This article is especially interesting because it details the effects on the wildlife. Wildlife are a natural resource and it is nice to know the numbers are still high. Nevertheless, in a perfect world, treatment for both wildlife and domestic animals would be considered quite the advancement over test and slaughter.

Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.

Although the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2% in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area. Hunters and game processors should take precautions (gloves and good hygiene) when handling reproductive and/or fetal material from hunter-harvested elk and bison.
