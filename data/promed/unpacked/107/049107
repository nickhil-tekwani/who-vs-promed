Russia: an outbreak of viral meningitis in Ekaterinburg
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of serous [now termed aseptic or viral] meningitis has
occurred in a school in Ekaterinburg. According to the sanitary
epidemiological surveillance center, there were 14 cases of serous
meningitis among schoolchildren attending school N 142, which is
located in the village of Gorniy Chit near the city of Ekaterinburg.
According to local physicians, the outbreak was suspected to be a
consequence of contamination of the [drinking] water supply, and this
has been confirmed now by laboratory testing of samples from the
water supply system. Sewage contamination of the water supply could
have exposed children to enteric virus infection. Those responsible
for maintenance of the water supply to the village of Gorniy Chit
have been dismissed, and the water system is now under the control of
the central authority. School N 142 is temporarily closed, and the
inhabitants of the village have been asked not to drink tap water
from the tap and to use bottled water instead.

[This report was received from Vadim Melnik, a ProMED-mail
correspondent in Russia. Ekaterinburg (formerly known as Sverdlovsk)
is located on the Asian side of the Ural Mountain range on the river
Iset. It is a major manufacturing center, and, with a population of
1.3 million (2002), is Russia's 5th largest city. - Mod.NR]
[Serous meningitis (otherwise known as aseptic, lymphocytic, or viral
meningitis) can be caused by many different enteric viruses, mumps
virus, herpes simplex virus (in adults), and, occasionally,
adenovirus. In the majority of cases, especially where infection is
water-borne and associated with fecal contamination, viral meningitis
is a consequence of infection by an enterovirus (usually one of the
many human echoviruses, human coxsackieviruses, or even poliovirus).
Infection contracted in childhood usually resolves quickly with no
sequelae. - Mod.CP]
