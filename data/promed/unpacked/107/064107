_Naegleria fowleri_, often dubbed as the brain-eating bug, has claimed its 1st life in 2019 in Karachi, as officials confirmed on Sat 20 Apr 2019 that a 21-year-old student from Orangi Town area of the city died on Fri 19 Apr 2019 of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), the devastating brain infection caused by the germ, at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).

"A 21-year-old student from Orangi Town, [AA], was brought to JPMC with high-grade fever and other complaints. Doctors suspected meningitis, and the patient was shifted to ICU on deterioration in his health. He died yesterday [Fri 19 Apr 2019] due to complications of the disease," JPMC Executive Director Dr Seemin Jamali told The News on Sat 20 Apr 2019.

Dr Jamali said they had sent the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, and the laboratory report confirmed that the young patient was infected with the lethal _Naegleria fowleri_.

_Naegleria_ is a kind of amoeba that is a single-celled living organism commonly found in soil and warm freshwater bodies, including lakes, rivers, and hot springs. Experts say only one species (type) of _Naegleria_ infects people.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically occurs when people go to swimming or diving in warm freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up from the nose to the brain where it starts destroying brain tissues, say experts.

According to experts of infectious diseases, one cannot be infected with _Naegleria fowleri_ by drinking contaminated water. They add that _Naegleria_ infections occur when contaminated water from sources such as inadequately chlorinated water of swimming pools or contaminated tap water enters the nose when people submerge their heads in water, cleanse their noses during religious practices, or irrigate their sinuses.

A recent study conducted by experts in Karachi and Saudi Arabia revealed that _Naegleria fowleri_ colonies were present in the mud accumulated in the overhead and underground tanks of water in Karachi, and as soon as weather conditions became favourable, they started growing and multiplying in huge numbers.

Confirming the 1st death in 2019 due to _Naegleria fowleri_ in Karachi, the Sindh health department's focal person for _Naegleria fowleri_, Dr Zafar Mehdi, said 7 persons had lost their lives due to the infection in the city in 2018, as the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board was providing non-chlorinated water to the citizens for last several years.

"Chlorination of water kills all the microorganisms, but unfortunately, our water utility is not adding chlorine to the water," Dr Mehdi said.

[The fatality rate of _Naegleria fowleri_ is over 97 percent. Although most cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by _Naegleria fowleri_ infection in the United States have been fatal (139/143 in the U.S.), there have been 5 well-documented survivors in North America: one in the U.S. in 1978, one in Mexico in 2003, 2 additional survivors from the U.S. in 2013, and one from the U.S. in 2016.

_Naegleria fowleri_ has not been shown to spread via water vapor or aerosol droplets (such as shower mist or vapor from a humidifier); https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html.

Recently, an investigational breast cancer and anti-leishmania drug, Miltefosine, has shown some promise in combination with other drugs. Miltefosine has shown ameba-killing activity against free-living amebae, including _Naegleria fowleri_, in the laboratory; https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/health_professionals.html. - Mod.UBA
