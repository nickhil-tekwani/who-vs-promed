On [Sun 12 Jun 2016], 3 elephants, including a calf, died at Asurkhol in Prabhasuni reserve forest in Deogarh [Debagarh] district [Odisha state], due to suspected anthrax infection. 7 elephants have died of different causes in the past one week.

The locals discovered the carcasses of the pachyderms inside the reserve forest and informed the forest personnel. "There are strong reasons to believe that the animals died of anthrax. There was nasal and anal bleeding indicating anthrax infection. There were no other external injuries such as wound or gunshots," principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Siddhant Das told TOI.

The viscera of the dead animals will be sent to Orissa University of Agriculture Technology (OUAT) to find out the exact cause of death, he added. "Besides anthrax, we are also suspecting poisoning," the top wildlife officer said.

According to official sources, the 3 elephants belonged to a herd of around 60 elephants. They roam in the adjoining forests in Deogarh, Angul, and Sambalpur districts [Odisha].

The sources said between [5 and 7 Jun 2016], 3 other elephants died in different forest divisions. On [5 Jun 2016], while an elephant had died due to prolonged illness in Asurkhol forest, a 25-year old tusker died of electrocution in a mango orchard in Hindol range in Dhenkanal district. On [7 Jun 2016], another elephant died at Dhandatopa range under Athmallik division, reportedly due to illness.

[There are 32 elephant preserves in India, with 3 in Odisha, home to 582 elephants; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Elephant. Deogarh, also known as Debagarh is in northern Odisha; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debagarh.

It is good that samples were taken -- and we look forward to learning the results -- but elephant field necropsies result in extensive soil contamination when they have died from anthrax. But until one knows the cause of death -- elephants die from a variety of problems and "anthrax" is merely one and usually infrequent in occurrence -- one is cursed whichever course of action is taken. And elephants in India are regarded seriously. Burning an elephant carcass is easier said than done. If it doesn't have to be opened, the normal acidic anaerobic decomposition will kill the vegetative cells. One can return later to collect the bones and hide for incineration, and soak the ground with formaldehyde. - Mod.MHJ
