Today's Halifax Show has become the latest to be affected by the outbreak of a highly contagious horse disease. The show's 69th instalment in Savile Park will take place without horse classes after an outbreak of equine strangles.

In a statement on Halifax Show's website, organizers said: "We are sorry to announce the cancellation of the horse sections at the 2015 Show on 8 Aug 2015. Cases of equine strangles have been notified in the area. The disease is readily transmitted and in the worst cases can endanger the life of any infected horses. The management committee has therefore decided, with regret to cancel all light horse, heavy horse and donkey events. None of the other small animal or livestock classes are affected by this decision and the rest of the show will continue as planned. We fully expect the horse and donkey classes will return in 2016." It is the first time the show has had to cancel classes because of the disease.

Equine strangles is known to be one of the commonest equine diseases worldwide. It can easily be spread through direct contact between horses, or indirectly through humans and equipment, although it does not affect people.

Clinical signs include depression and dullness, loss of appetite, nasal discharge, development of a cough and fever, while it can cause glands to swell under the jaw or on the neck approximately a week after the onset of clinical signs.

[The organizers are acting prudently to protect equine health as this is a contagious disease. But another question might be, why would someone take a sick animal to an event? Of course, the disease could be incubating and the owner/rider might not know it.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram positive, capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group (serologically distinguishable groups into which most streptococci can be divided and which are based on the polysaccharide antigens present in the cell walls) C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. The affected horses are quite uncomfortable.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3-5 per cent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite). Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease to other horses.
