A comment and question from Mark Lelli DVM
------------------------------------------
This article and the subsequent commentary brings to the surface more than one interesting concept in the epidemiology and transmission of rabies virus to humans. One is the relatively high number of people that become infected with the virus by contact with an infected animal through carcass processing of domestic animals. The presumption is that these animals are alive and rabid at the time of slaughter resulting in human contact with living, infected animals and subsequent human morbidity and mortality.

The other and perhaps more important revelation is that of the possible transmission through contact with a deceased animal carcass. If I understand it correctly, transmission to the man in Viet Nam occurred from a deceased road traffic animal not an injured but still living animal. The article from Hanoi published by the PLoS Medicine journal, original article (ProMED-mail post: Rabies, via dog/cat butchering - Viet Nam, Archive Number: 20090318.1092), states that the dog was said to have been killed in the road traffic accident. While this distinction may seem subtle it does leave open the possibility that transmission of the virus occurred some time after the animal was deceased through contact with the corpse.

If in fact this was true, it brings to the surface an important question for those of us who are asked to process specimens for rabies detection in suspect, and consequently euthanized domestic animals and/or wildlife. Do we know how long an animal infected with rabies remains a source for infectivity after it dies? A better understanding of this would also lead to an improved protocol for possible post exposure treatment.
