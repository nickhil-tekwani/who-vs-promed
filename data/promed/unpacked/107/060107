Two patients have died in Scotland's largest outbreaks of a rare and highly
virulent strain of a hospital superbug. Nine people were taken ill in 2
separate clusters, one in Glasgow and one in Aberdeen, of a form of
_Clostridium difficile_.

It was confirmed yesterday [16 May 2008] that the patients at Aberdeen
Royal Infirmary and Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital were infected by the highly
toxic 027 strain, which has, until now, rarely been seen in Scotland. It
was the 027 strain that was implicated in the deaths of 65 patients at
Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, between 2003 and 2005.

Last night [16 May 2008], Health Protection Scotland (HPS) confirmed that 4
patients at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary were hit by the bug and one later
died, though health officials said the bug was "a contributory factor" but
not the main cause of death. In a separate outbreak, 5 patients at
Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital fell victim to the bug, one of whom later died.
Again, _C. difficile_ was said to be a contributory factor, though not the
main cause of death. One of the Glasgow patients is now said to be fully
recovered.

HPS said laboratory tests had confirmed both "clusters" involved the
virulent 027 strain of the bug but were unrelated to each other. Strict
infection control procedures are being maintained at both hospitals to
control the number of cases. Health chiefs have written to all health
boards reinforcing advice on how to control the bug. Anne Eastaway,
consultant microbiologist at HPS, said: "These 2 clusters are unrelated,
and we are in regular contact with the infection control teams at both NHS
Grampian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. We have previously seen a small
number of isolated cases of this strain in Scotland."

_C. difficile_ is a potentially fatal bug, which mainly affects the
elderly, and usually grows in the large intestine. Spores can survive for a
long time in the environment, with areas around hospital beds and toilet
areas common. Health officials have been concerned that the "hypervirulent"
027 strain could become more common in Scotland as it spreads from England,
and a _C. difficile_ "reference laboratory" has been established in
Scotland to help identify more virulent strains including 027, which might
not be picked up otherwise, and help understand the bug's characteristics.

The 027 strain produces more toxins than other types, has caused large
outbreaks of severe disease in hospitals in Canada and the US since the
beginning of the decade, and has now been detected in more than 80
hospitals in England and Wales. The 1st Scottish case of 027 was diagnosed
in October 2006. Then, in November last year [2007], an unnamed female
patient died in the West of Scotland due to a "combination of factors"
after being infected with the 027 strain.

Figures show all strains of _C. difficile_ caused 100 deaths in Scotland in
2005 against 57 in 2001. Cases increased by 10 per cent in 3 months.
