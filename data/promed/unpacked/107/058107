A division of Long Island [New York state] food producer Hain Celestial is voluntarily recalling several lots of its peanut and almond butters because of possible contamination with _Salmonella_ bacteria. The products are sold as Arrowhead Mills peanut butter and MaraNatha almond and peanut butters as well as private label organic almond butters sold at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. About 45 production lots are affected by the recall. The products are part of Hain Celestial's unit known as nSpired Foods.

A spokesman for The Hain Celestial Group of Lake Success would not discuss the products and referred all questions to its affiliates' websites. Hain Celestial serves as headquarters for a vast organic foods empire in several states.

The contamination was found at nSpired's plant in Ashland, Oregon, where a routine federal inspection turned up evidence of the bacterium in July 2014, according to the FDA. The agency initiated its latest round of analyses on 15 Jul 2014 and an inspection that is still ongoing, an FDA report shows.

Another division, Texas-based Arrowhead Mills, sells organic nut butters produced by the Oregon plant. In a statement Thursday, 21 Aug 2014, Maureen Putman, Arrowhead Mills' president, said her company is working with the FDA to remedy the problem. "All our retail partners have been notified and are removing and destroying the affected Arrowhead Mills products from store shelves and warehouses," Putman said, adding that anyone who has purchased any of the possibly tainted foods to dispose of them and their containers. The company emphasized that products should not be returned to grocers. Products under a variety of brand names are sold throughout the USA as well as in Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the Dominican Republic.

A total of 4 people in Connecticut, Iowa, Tennessee and Texas have become ill as a result of consuming the nut butters, according to Arrowhead Mills. Federal health authorities, however, do not as yet have an updated list of those who've become ill, but at least 1 person required hospitalization, according to the CDC, which Thursday, 21 Aug 2014, identified the contaminating bacterium as _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup.
