Family members told ABC 17 it all started about 2 weeks ago when [JE] of Eugene felt severe neck pain, began shaking, had trouble swallowing and hallucinations. Not long after that, he was admitted to University Hospital where he died last Fri [26 Sep 2014]. Family members said test results last week came back from the CDC and confirmed [JE] had rabies. He died the following day.

The Miller County Health Department said Missouri's Health Department is investigating the cause of death. The department said it can't comment on the cause due to privacy laws, but a spokesman told ABC 17 News rabies is a virus that attacks the central nervous system. "Headache, fevers, and then it'll go into more serious neurological effects like hallucinations or things like that, and if somebody does contract rabies, the likelihood of someone surviving is very small," said Ryan Hobart, the spokesman for the Department of Health and Senior Services.

Hobart said it's rare to catch rabies. "If people have been outdoors, working outdoors, or if they spend a lot of time outside, if they see a wild animal that might have been in the house, usually it's a bat or a skunk; those are usually the animals in Missouri it's occurring with. If they have any feeling that they might have been bitten whatsoever, they should consult their physician immediately," said Hobart.

Officials said that if you are bitten to wash the wound immediately for 10-15 minutes then call your healthcare provider and get tested.

As yet, there is no information as to the probable source of this man's infection. According to the CDC the commonest sources in Missouri are skunks and bats.

See: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/wild_animals.html, and the specific map for skunks predominantly in western Missouri is: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2010-surveillance/rabid-skunks.html, and for bats throughout the state: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2010-surveillance/rabid-bats.html. Note that these data are just up to 2010.

In spite of the 1999 report, see below, raccoon rabies is primarily a problem along the Atlantic coast states and, from the 2010 map, unusual if at all in Missouri raccoons: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2010-surveillance/rabid-raccoons.html.

In the 3 ProMED reports listed below for Missouri, the 2008 human case was ascribed to a bat bite, and the equine case was unknown. As the various reservoir hosts are reflected in their genomic character, we might presume that virus from this recent case will be sent for typing.

Cole County is on the south bank of the Missouri River in central Missouri and includes Jefferson City; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/us_2001/missouri_ref_2001.jpg. This map displays forest cover overlapping Cole County, so we can expect plenty of skunks, raccoons, and bats in the county. - Mod.MHJ
