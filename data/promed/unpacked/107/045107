TOXIC ALGAE - NORTH CAROLINA: AN UPDATE
========================================
[see 951012]
From: Peter_Cowen@ncsu.edu
Date: March 29, 1997
Because of the recent release of the book "Blood in the Waters", there has
been a great deal of discussion lately in the national news concerning
North Carolina waters and toxic algae.
At the present time, four things are clear: 1) There has been no new fish
kills recently, so much of this "news" is material discussed on ProMED-mail
in 1995 2) The present concern is media-mediated i.e. the book and
newsmagazines, TV and otherwise. 3) Physicians in the area of the Nuese
River are concerned about rashes which don't appear to have a known cause.
These rashes could be related to _Pfiesteria piscida_ , could be caused by
something else or could be occuring at no greater incidence than in the
past. 4) To date all evidence is antecodotal. There are proper
epidemiologic studies underway at the medical school at East Carolina
University and other studies at Duke. No conclusions either way yet.
ProMED-mail will keep you updated when results become available.
This present round of worry is another instance where the media spawns
questions faster than controlled studies can offer answers, so there is a
great deal of confusion generated for the public from time to time. So
goes the battle. I hope this update helps.

NORTH CAROLINA ISSUES HEALTH WARNING RELATED TO TOXIC ALGAE
===========================================================
According to a newspaper article (October 7) in the Raleigh (NC)
News and Observer, a health warning, "the first of its type ever
issued in North Carolina, advises people not to swim, fish or
come in contact with waters where a toxic algae has been
attacking menhaden and other fish." Although the association
between the fish kills, caused by Pfiesteria algae, and human
illness is not definite, there have been puzzling symptoms in
some people exposed to the affected fish. Two NC State
University researchers became ill following exposure to the algae
in the lab in 1993. One of the researchers experienced severe
mental impairment. In "recent weeks, some fishermen and divers
on the lower Neuse [River] have developed sores and infections
after being in the water".
"First discovered in 1991, the microscopic Pfiesteria has been
described as a cross between a plant and an animal. In its
predatory stage, the algae poisons fish with a mysterious toxin,
then eats its prey, leaving behind telltale red and black sores."
"Like other forms of algae, Pfiesteria appears to be stimulated
by nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, although the
interaction is not fully understood. Such nutrients come from
farms fertilizers, livestock waste, air pollution and municipal
sewage."
State officials are conducting a health survey of people exposed
to the recent fish kills. The contact person is Dr. Peter Morris
at (919)715-6422.
