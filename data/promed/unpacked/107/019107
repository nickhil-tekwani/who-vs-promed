[1] China restrictions

China's top quarantine watchdog on Thursday [6 Dec 2012] urged intensified efforts to prevent the entry of yellow fever from Sudan.

A total of 329 suspected cases, including 97 deaths, have been reported in Sudan as of 11 Nov [2012], the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website, citing a World Health Organization report.

The administration asked local authorities to boost body temperature monitoring and other medical inspections for travelers from Sudan.

Travelers from Sudan must inform China's entry-exit inspection and quarantine institutions if they develop related symptoms, such as fever and jaundice, the administration said in the statement, adding that infected travellers should be isolated immediately.

The administration also urged local authorities to step up quarantine inspections over vehicles and containers coming from Sudan to prevent the spread of yellow fever.

Yellow fever is a disease spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms take 3-6 days to develop and include fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches.

Chinese travelers to Sudan are advised to get vaccinated against yellow fever and to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, according to the statement.

[Concern of international spread of the yellow fever virus is real. However, at this time of year, with the onset of cold weather and no mosquito vector activity, the threat of ongoing transmission in China is nil except possibly in the tropical far south. - Mod.TY]

[2] Darfur cards

[This report includes information on yellow fever vaccination cards that was not included in previous reports. - Mod.TY]

Several residents from Zalingei locality in Central Darfur complained that security services are preventing anyone who does not have a yellow fever vaccination card to leave the area, they told Radio Dabanga on Thursday, 6 Dec [2012].

According to security forces, this decision was based on instructions they received from the Central Darfur government, witnesses reported.

Citizens from the locality stressed that this decision is causing them much suffering and severe damages, as they are unable to travel to places like Nyala and El-Geneina to do business.

[Residents] explained to Radio Dabanga that those who were vaccinated on the 1st 2 days of the campaign received a card. However, they continued, vaccination cards were no longer available after the 3rd day.

The unavailability of cards has become an obstacle for Zalingei residents to leave the locality, which is especially affecting merchants and patients seeking treatment elsewhere, residents pointed out.

At the same time, witnesses stressed that members of the security services of Central Darfur are 'exploiting' the current situation. They have set-up check points in all access areas leading in and out of the locality and are selling vaccination cards for 30 Sudanese pounds [USD 6.80] each, witnesses asserted.

They demanded that authorities facilitate their travels.

[Apparently, requiring yellow fever vaccination cards for travel is an attempt by the central Darfur government to prevent further spread of the disease to new areas by viremic travelers. However, if it is true that cards are being sold, this defeats the purpose of the travel restrictions. The unavailability of cards for vaccinated individuals is also of concern. Cards should be available only to those individuals receiving the vaccine at the time of their vaccination.

Osman Mohamed Yusuf Kibir, governor of North Darfur, threatened to 'forcibly' vaccinate gold miners in Jebel 'Amer against yellow fever, Radio Dabanga has learned on Thursday, 6 Dec [2012].

During a visit to the mine located in El-Sref Beni Hussein locality, Kibir stressed to the 35 000 workers that vaccination is a 'must', according to a statement.

The governor declared that gold miners who do not respond to the campaign against yellow fever will be vaccinated by the security services. Besides, he added that if anyone refuses to take the shots they will be tried for suicide attempt.

Kibir warned to Jebel 'Amer's newcomers that they can only enter the area after presenting their yellow fever vaccination cards at the gate.

Lastly, he promised to provide drinking water and a mobile clinic to the workers in Jebel 'Amer.

[Recently, 4 yellow fever (YF) patients in the Zalingei hospital came from the gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer in North Darfur, implicating this area as one of active YF virus transmission. Thus, the risk of spread to the mining camps appears to be significant. Previous reports indicated that some of the miners were from Chad. Should they return to that country, there is a real risk of spreading the YF outbreak. Requiring vaccination of the miners does not seem unreasonable. - Mod.TY]

[4] West Darfur

The Minister of Health of West Darfur announced the launch of the vaccination campaign against yellow fever in the locality of Foro Baranga, on Sun 9 Dec [2012].

Ishaq Ahmed Yaqoub told Radio Dabanga that the start of the campaign encountered some difficulties, as a number of vehicles carrying the drugs [vaccines?] were delayed.

He explained that by Monday [10 Dec 2012], or the campaign's 2nd day, 11 per cent of the targeted patients had been vaccinated, adding that vaccines have arrived to the area. The operation will last until 21 Dec [2012], according to the minister.

Yaqoub declared that a total of 51 people died and 233 were infected with yellow [fever virus] in Central Darfur so far. He revealed that most of the new cases come from the gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer, North Darfur.

The minister told Radio Dabanga he expects to have a surplus in vaccines after concluding the campaign in Foro Baranga and added that the northern localities in the state are 'free from the epidemic'.

Nevertheless, he pledged to provide support for campaigns carried out in the north if required. These localities could include: as Sirba, Jebel Moun, and Kulbus, he suggested.

At the same time, an activist from Sirba locality announced that a yellow fever patient died in the area of Bir Kilab. He also suspects that 3 new cases have emerged in the area, 2 of them in Sawanee, near Sirba. On their turn, residents from Sirba locality have complained that the health authorities have ignored them.

The activist told Radio Dabanga that Sirba's residents are living in fear due to the spread of the yellow fever epidemic in nearby villages. Besides, he continued, the locality is densely populated and includes 8 displaced persons camps.

Lastly, residents from Sirba locality called on health authorities and organizations to speed up the delivery of the vaccines to the area before the disease continues to spread.

[One hopes that the vaccination campaign can get ahead of this outbreak. Obviously, early time lines for a campaign of 10-12 days was unrealistic, which is not surprising given the large area and lack of roads and other infrastructure in the Darfur states. The occurrence of cases in the general area of the 8 refugee campus is of serious concern. One hopes that the vaccine arrives in the camps before the virus does.
