There is no evidence that CWD, first identified in 1967, has ever spread to
humans, cattle, or any species other than deer and elk. In one 2000 study,
National Institutes of Health researchers at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in
Hamilton, Montana determined that a molecular barrier appeared to help
prevent CWD from jumping to other species.
However, the researchers were able to get a low quantity of diseased deer
proteins, called prions, to convert healthy human prions to the diseased
form, suggesting it might be possible for humans to get CWD. Byron Caughey,
one of the Rocky Mountain researchers behind the study, cautioned that it
was difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the study about the human
risk of CWD.
"This is a test-tube reaction that is a poor surrogate for actual
transmission studies in the real world, but no one wants to actually test
whether CWD can infect humans," he said. "Our work suggests that while it
may be possible for humans to get CWD, it's likely to be a low-efficiency
process," he said.
Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources spokesman Bob Manwell conceded that the
recommendations on venison were "a little bit vague. (But) it's similar to a
lot of health advice that is given out, where it really comes down to a
personal decision. There is a small risk, and it's the individual's decision
as to how they feel about that," Manwell said.
Manwell said that for now, the state planned to go ahead this fall with a
deer donation program that provided meat to food pantries and needy
families. Hunters donated 3921 deer to the program last year, resulting in
about 176 000 pounds of venison. "Even after the realization that we have
this disease in the state, there has still been demand for the meat,"
Manwell said. "It's really going to be up to individual food pantry
organizations what they want to do about it."

Canada: Deer hunters could be spreading lethal germs
Illness related to mad cow disease, experts say
--------------------------------------------------------
CALGARY - Hunters may be unwittingly spreading Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)
by using deer scents made from the urine of infected animals in game farms,
some scientists and hunting advocates fear.
The packaged scents, spread on the ground by hunters to lure quarry, could
contain prions, the resilient agent scientists blame for CWD, an illness
related to mad cow disease that is associated with animals in fenced game
farms.
Although the link between deer scents and CWD has not been studied, several
experts say there is a "theoretical risk" that CWD could be spread by the
deer attractants.
Rob Miskosky, editor of Alberta Outdoorsmen, says some game farmers are
packaging deer scents to diversify in an industry tainted by outbreaks of
CWD and reeling from bans on shooting captive animals and collapsed Asian
markets for elk antler velvet. One consortium of Alberta game farmers is
constructing a facility capable of collecting 1000 ounces of urine a day
from deer.
Norm Moore, a game farmer and industry spokesman, dismisses the concerns,
saying the industry is strictly monitored for disease. "We have an
identification and tracking system that is second to none in agriculture,"
he said.
Although packaged scents are not tested for safety, Mr. Moore says health
precautions undertaken by game ranchers make it unlikely any disease would
be associated with the packaged urine. "I don't think there are any
regulations specifically for that product, but [game farm] herds would have
to be on the normal health program or they couldn't have the animals," Mr.
Moore said.
Darrel Rowledge, director of the advocacy group Alliance for Public
Wildlife, says it is astonishing such products, which have been used by
hunters for decades, are released into the marketplace untested. Hunters
spread the scents, made from a combination of urine and feces, on their
boots and clothing and on trees, branches, rock, grasses and the ground.
Mr. Miskosky, writing in the current edition of Alberta Outdoorsmen, says
scientific journals confirm TSE prions, the mutant protein causing CWD, have
been found in urine long before the disease is detected in animals and could
remain viable in soil for years. Destroying the prions requires incineration
of an infected animal in temperatures higher than 600 Celsius.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is investigating 1 case of CWD in
Alberta. Dr. George Luterbach, a CFIA veterinarian, said all 72 animals on
the infected farm will be destroyed and a compensation package is being
worked out with the rancher. In Saskatchewan, about 8000 elk from game farms
were destroyed last year after an outbreak of the disease, which was
confirmed in more than 200 animals.
The cost to federal taxpayers of controlling the Saskatchewan outbreak has
been estimated by one animal rights group at $60 million [Canadian],
including compensation to the affected game farmers.
Dr. Luterbach said the agency is also waiting for lab test results on 12
animals from the infected Alberta farm that were sold to other game
ranchers. If the tests come back positive, it is likely all the animals on
the other farms will also be destroyed, he said.
The game farming industry says it is unfairly blamed for CWD. Mr. Moore says
the disease started in the wild in Colorado, spread into a zoo and was then
passed into captive herds when a stricken zoo animal was sold to a game
farm, where it spread among the contained herd. The industry's stringent
testing makes it a lightning rod for CWD because its detection system is
unmatched by public wildlife administrators, he said.
Game farmers sell the meat of wild game such as deer and elk -- which is low
in fat and cholesterol -- to restaurants.

[There are tests that clearly detect prions in urine. So although this is a
theoretical risk, it stands to reason the scents utilizing feces and urine
may be able to spread the disease. There is research indicating prions may
be in saliva, and survive the gastrointestinal track, which suggests
credibility for prions in feces. This may be a theoretical risk at the
moment, but it clearly points to an area where research is lacking. -

Urine tests
-------------
Alternative diagnostic tests in the live animal involve the detection of
disease specific physiological or metabolic markers. These are secondary
substances produced as a result of infection. Such markers, apparently
related, have been identified in serum and in urine. Whether or not they
remain specific to BSE or scrapie remains to be proven.
Changes have been detected in the constituents of urine of CJD patients,
sheep with scrapie and cattle with BSE. Molecules that may be disease
specific have been found in cattle and further work is in progress to
develop and validate a diagnostic test. The time of appearance of this
substance at detectable levels in the disease is unknown. Work is underway
to determine when these changes are first detectable in the long incubation
period of BSE.
