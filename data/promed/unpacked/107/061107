Since [1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified over 2000 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [1 Aug 2017], primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted the declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 15 Dec 2018:
Total outbreak: 3265
Hospitalizations: 1625
Deaths: 21

The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically. Over the past 2 reporting months, the weekly number of reported new cases had remained close to or more than 100. This week, that number reached 143, one of the highest so far. Now we are over 3000, and at this rate, the total number of cases may surpass 3500 by year-end. - Mod.LL

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus [HAV]. This increase in cases has primarily been among injecting and non-injecting drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Officials with the Alabama Department of Public Health are warning residents across north Alabama to take precautions after a case of hepatitis A was discovered in Jackson County. Health Department officials advised in a release that the "outbreak may have spread to surrounding counties."

"People want to take precautions, especially the population that could be high risk," said Dr. Karen Landers, the area 1 health officer. Area 1 covers north Alabama. Landers said the last case of hepatitis A reported in the region was 18 months ago in the northeast part of the county. Health department officials said persons at highest risk for hepatitis A include users of illegal substances, homeless persons, and men with same-sex partners.

Landers said others also may become infected with the hepatitis A virus. She said there is an "effective vaccine" to reduce the risk of developing hepatitis A. "We are in the early stages of this investigation, but we need to make sure everyone knows the importance of getting vaccinated and taking health precautions," Landers said in the release. Landers said anyone wishing to get vaccinated for hepatitis A should contact their healthcare provider or their local pharmacy. "Many local pharmacies do vaccinations," she said.

Ginger Mansell, pharmacist with Specialty Pharmacy of the Shoals on Avalon Avenue in Muscle Shoals, said they have ordered the vaccine. "So far, we haven't had any requests, but we'll have it in today [Fri 28 Dec 2018] just in case," Mansell said.

[Those affected the most by the outbreaks of HAV in certain states of the USA are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spillover into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of these rapidly increasing cases are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

Kentucky remains in 1st place in cases. West Virginia has roared past California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case-number list. With the 2137 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 3265, these 2 states have reported a total of 5402 cases since their outbreaks started and certainly will be well on the way to close to 6000 by year-end. It is not clear what public health steps are being done to stem the tide.

Food-service workers continue to develop acute hepatitis A and put unsuspecting diners at risk. Although many are more local restaurants, recently a case in a food worker in a high-end Japanese restaurant in the Disney World complex was reported (http://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-news/worker-tests-positive-for-hepatitis-a-at-morimoto-asia-restaurant-in-disney-springs).

In the entire year of 2016, CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm). - Mod.LL
