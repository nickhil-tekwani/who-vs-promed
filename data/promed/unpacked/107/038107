Most difficult grapefruit season in Florida for years
-----------------------------------------------------
In 2010 there is less Florida grapefruit available. The supply is
between 30-40 percent less because much of the citrus was damaged by a
disease. Many orchards were destroyed in 2009 because of citrus
canker, leaving the healthy orchards less protected against wind
damage during growing. Because of the high standard of requirements a
large part of the crop is no longer suitable for the European market.
There is a shortage in the popular large sizes and a surplus in the
smaller sizes.

The citrus is checked at least 3 times during picking, packing, and
shipment. As a result arrivals were later than ever. In addition to
the canker the fruit also suffered from frost. "A large part goes to
the processing industry" according to Dutch importer van Duivenbode.
This is really the most difficult season in years. Supply will be very
limited till the end of the 2010 season.

As a result of the strict demands from Europe more and more grapefruit
goes to other markets, [for example] Japan and Korea, where the import
conditions are not as strict. This difficult situation is likely to
remain for the coming years.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_. The disease originated in Asia but is
now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia
where an outbreak was successfully eradicated.

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members
of the family _Rutaceae_, and a number of different strains specialise
in infecting different hosts. The disease can destroy an entire crop
and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries.

Symptoms include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves,
and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well
as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the
fruit is not affected it cannot be sold or processed. The bacterium
can be transmitted by mechanical means, water, or insects within
groves while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant
material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use
of clean planting material, but may also include planting of
windbreaks to reduce insect numbers and wounds serving as ports of
pathogen entry, bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop
varieties.

A group of strains of the related _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_
originating in South America causes a similar disease in some
locations but it is much less widespread and of lower economic
significance.
