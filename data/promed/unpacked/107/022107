There is a new concern about the Rio Grande Valley's sea turtle population.

A sinister virus has migrated to the waters off the tip of South
Padre Island and infected green sea turtles. About 10 turtles have
been diagnosed with fibropapilloma.

Fibropapilloma is a type of herpes [virus] that infects sea turtles,
according to the Marine Animal Rescue Team Blog. The disease results
in growths on the turtles.

Several green sea turtles that were captured for banding have been
diagnosed with fibropapilloma. It's the 1st time Texas sea turtles
have contracted the disease.

"The disease is not fatal, but when the tumors begin to grow over the
eyes and flippers, they can sometimes impede feeding and normal
movement," Dr. Tim Tristan, a Corpus Christi veterinarian, wrote in an e-mail.

"As a result, these individuals may become more susceptible to
starvation, shark attacks, and other environmental factors that they
would normally be able to overcome or avoid. How Rio Grande Valley
sea turtles got the disease remains a mystery," Tristan wrote.

"It is still unknown why we are seeing the disease in South Texas,
which is the reason we are currently investigating the factors that
may be influencing its recent occurrence. Thus far, no Kemp's Ridley
sea turtles have the virus. The disease process has been seen in
Florida for years, yet continued conservation efforts to treat these
turtles seem to be helping," Tristan wrote.

The tumors can be removed with surgery.

"It is worrisome to us," said Donna Shaver, chief of the Division of
Sea Turtle Science and Recovery at Padre Island National Seashore.
Why and how sea turtles catch the virus is not known.

Tristan said it is not known for certain whether the disease can be
transmitted somehow from different species of sea turtles.

[The fibropapillomas are apparently initiated by a herpes virus. This
is not the 1st growth or cancer that seems to have some kind of
relationship with a virus or bacteria. However, the fact that surgery
seems to correct the problem is fascinating in that the virus seems
to be the initiator but not necessarily the sustainer of the problem.

The following web sites are from Japan, but offer some pictures of
the situation.

In 2000, a 4837-bp sequence of a newly found green turtle herpesvirus
(GTHV), implicated in the etiology of green turtle fibropapilloma,
was obtained by researchers at the Retrovirology Research Laboratory,
Pacific Biomedical Research Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa,
Honolulu, in 2000, from tumor tissues of a green turtle with
fibropapilloma. See "Rapid acquisition of entire DNA polymerase gene
of a novel herpesvirus from green turtle fibropapilloma by a genomic
walking technique"; Yu Q, Hu N, Lu Y, Nerurkar VR, Yanagihara R.; J
Virol Methods. 2001 Feb; 91(2):183-95. - Mod.TG]
