A new destructive disease called stem canker was reported in dragon fruit (_Hylocereus polyrhizus_) in Bangladesh [see link below], which forced some farmers to abandon cultivation. The disease has spread since then. In 2019, it had been associated with _Lasiodiplodia_ sp. based mainly on morphology, with _Hylocereus_ as a new host for this genus. A molecular study had to be carried out to confirm the causal agent to species level, as well as determine its phylogeny, epidemiology, and host range.

Of 8 fungal isolates from symptomatic dragon fruit stems, 2 were analysed by morphology, as well as phylogeny of sequence data from 3 different genomic regions. They were identified as _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_. Inoculation trials on dragon fruit stems confirmed Koch's postulate. The isolates were also found pathogenic on mango, guava, banana, and _H. polyrhizus_ fruits.

The data will contribute to understanding the biology of _L. theobromae_ as a newly recognised pathogen of dragon fruit, as well as help to design effective management strategies against this pathogen.

[Dragon fruit (also called pitaya, strawberry pear) is the common name for several cactus species and hybrids, mostly of the genus _Hylocereus_, but also _Stenocereus_ and some other related genera. These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an important fruit crop in these regions because of their high nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp colours are planted commercially. Few pathogens are known to affect the crops, but disease management is especially difficult since dragon fruit is propagated by cuttings, which may spread any pathogens.

The fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was first reported in Cameroon in 1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa. Subsequently it was found to have a wide host range of more than 280 species including many crops such as citrus, grapevine, vegetable hosts, strawberry, sweet potato, and mango. Depending on the host, symptoms may include wilting, fruit rots, dieback, vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of plants. It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough. An increase in virulence has been reported on some hosts, suggesting that new strains of the fungus may be emerging in different areas.
