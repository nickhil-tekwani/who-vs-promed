Anthrax outbreak in Caprivi region
-----------------------------------
2 elephants have died of suspected anthrax in the Caprivi Region, the
Director of Special Support Services in the Ministry of Environment
and Tourism said yesterday [16 Sep 2004].
Dr. Pauline Lindeque said the report of the animal deaths followed
confirmed reports of an anthrax outbreak in the Chobe National Park
in Botswana, which borders the Caprivi. Anthrax was also recently
reported in Zimbabwe, were hundreds of animals are said to have
succumbed to the disease. Lindeque said that some of her Ministry's
officials at Etosha National Park had joined their colleagues in the
Caprivi to probe the deaths of the 2 elephants.
The Director of Parks and Wildlife Management, Ben Beytell, told
journalists in Windhoek yesterday [16 Sep 2004] that there was no
need to panic at this stage, and, that no reports of cattle infection
had been received.
The Ministry has called on the public to report any unexplained
animal deaths to the nearest State Veterinarian, or, to the nearest
offices of the Ministry, as this will help the Ministry assess the
situation and take necessary control measures.
Anthrax is generally of an acute form in wildlife, with animals
showing few symptoms before abruptly collapsing and dying. Blood
discharge from the mouth, nostrils, and anus is characteristic of
anthrax deaths.
The Ministry of Environment and Tourism has appealed to Caprivi
residents not to eat meat from animals that have died under
mysterious circumstances.
