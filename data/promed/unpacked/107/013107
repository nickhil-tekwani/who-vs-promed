A new multistate outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections is "potentially linked" to certain store brands of garden salad mix, according to federal health officials. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both issued safety alerts Friday [19 Jun 2020], advising consumers in 6 Midwestern states to avoid select salads sold at Hy-Vee, Aldi, and Jewel-Osco stores.

Jewel-Osco announced Saturday [20 Jun 2020], it is voluntarily recalling bagged Signature Farms Garden Salad sold in its stores in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. According to the CDC, there have been 76 confirmed illnesses with 16 hospitalizations reported in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Minnesota. The 2 health agencies said their investigation is ongoing and there could be additional retailers and products "impacted by the outbreak."

The pre-packaged, bagged garden salad blends contain iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots. Other types of store brand packaged salads sold at the retailers are not part of the health notices. "The FDA is working with the companies to determine the source of the products, but in the meantime, we are issuing a public warning to consumers to avoid the identified products to prevent additional infections," Frank Yiannas, FDA deputy commissioner for food policy and response, said in a statement.

Consumers are being advised not to eat select brands of garden salad mix that may be linked to a multistate outbreak of _Cyclospora_.

Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite. _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ that can cause symptoms including diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, stomach cramps, bloating, increased gas, nausea, and fatigue, the CDC says. According to the FDA and CDC, the illnesses of the confirmed cases started between 11 May 2020 to 14 Jun 2020.

The affected products include:
- ALDI Little Salad Bar Brand Garden Salad, which were sold in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri.
- All Hy-Vee Brand Garden Salad sold in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, and Nebraska.
- Jewel-Osco Signature Farms Brand Garden Salad sold in Illinois.
- Jewel-Osco recalls Signature Farms Garden Salad

Jewel-Osco, part of Albertsons, announced in a statement Saturday [20 Jun 2020], that it was recalling 12-ounce bags of Signature Farms Garden Salad sold in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, and it advised consumers to discard or return the bags.

The affected bags have "best if used by" dates of 16 May through 4 Jul [2020]. The product has a UPC code of 21130 98135 and includes the plant number S5417.

[Cyclosporiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/) is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. People living or traveling in countries where cyclosporiasis is endemic may be at increased risk of infection. Infected people shed unsporulated (non-infective; immature) _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts in their stool; immature oocysts usually require at least 1-2 weeks under favorable laboratory conditions to sporulate and become infective.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range, 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of sporulated oocysts (the infective form of the parasite).

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
- watery diarrhea (most common)
- loss of appetite
- weight loss
- cramping
- bloating
- increased gas
- nausea
- fatigue

Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include the following:
- vomiting
- low-grade fever

If a person ill from cyclosporiasis is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks to a month or more. Some symptoms, such as diarrhea, can return; and some symptoms, such as fatigue, may continue after the gastrointestinal symptoms have gone away. The infection usually is not life-threatening. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms, particularly persons from areas where cyclosporiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions. - Mod.LL
