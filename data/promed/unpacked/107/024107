The winter vomiting bug [norovirus] has claimed another 141 000 victims in the last week, pushing the annual total up to more than 1.1 million. Health officials said the number of confirmed cases of norovirus [infection] was more than double the level for this time last year [2011], and the toll is expected to rise again.

Latest figures from the Health Protection Agency show there were 3538 confirmed cases before the 492 new ones from last week. The number of confirmed cases of norovirus is up by 83 per cent on this time last year [2011], and the toll is expected to rise. The total of 4030 is more than twice the 1934 cases at this time last year. But this is only a fraction of the true total, as most sufferers do not visit their GP. HPA officials estimate there are 288 victims in the community for every confirmed case. This suggests that approximately 1.15 million adults and children have been hit by the virus.

The agency said that in the 2 weeks up to 23 Dec 2012, there were also 70 reported hospital outbreaks, compared with 61 in the previous fortnight. That brought the number of outbreaks for the season to 538, forcing many wards to close to prevent the illness spreading. The number of cases has risen earlier than expected this year [2012], following a trend seen across Europe and other parts of the world, which has unknown causes.

In Australia, outbreaks began earlier than usual during the winter and have persisted into the summer. John Harris, an HPA norovirus expert, said: "The number of laboratory-confirmed cases has risen once again, as it appears that we have seen the rise that usually begins in January start a little earlier than we expect. Norovirus is very contagious and very unpleasant. To help prevent spread, it's important that people who believe they are unwell maintain good hand hygiene and stay away from hospitals, schools, and care homes, as these closed environments are prone to outbreaks which can cause severe disruption."

Symptoms include a sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhoea, often with headache, raised temperature, and stomach cramps. The illness usually resolves itself in one or 2 days in otherwise healthy people."

Figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show that there were 337 confirmed laboratory reports of norovirus in the week ending 9 Dec 2012 and 236 for the week ending 2 Dec 2012. The latest weekly report is now published.

In this season to date [2012-2013], there have been 3046 confirmed laboratory reports of norovirus. This is 83 per cent higher than the same period in the last season, when there were 1669 cases reported. The figures for the number of hospital outbreaks show that there were 61 hospital outbreaks during the last 2 weeks up to 16 Dec 2012. In the same fortnight in the previous year [2011], there were 35 outbreaks reported by the same time.

The data show that the increase in norovirus laboratory reports is earlier this season [2012-2013] than in previous years; however, there are no indications as to why this is the case. In the same weeks in 2011-2012, there were 257 laboratory reports, and during the 2009-2010 season, which saw a lot more activity than in previous years, there were 469. In this year, the majority of the cases occurred in January 2012 onwards. No 2 years of norovirus activity are alike, and these figures represent a small fraction of the number of confirmed cases that are seen during the peak months, which usually occur between January and April.

Laboratory confirmed reports represent only a small proportion of the actual amount of norovirus activity in the community, because the vast majority of affected people do not access health care services as a result of their illness. It has been estimated that for every confirmed case there are around 288 unreported cases.

Norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by contact with an infected person; by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects or by consuming contaminated food or water. The virus spreads rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals, schools and care homes. Symptoms of norovirus include a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Some people may have a temperature, headache and stomach cramps. The illness usually resolves in one or 2 days, and there are no long-term effects. John Harris, an expert in norovirus at the HPA said: "The number of laboratory confirmed cases has risen again, following the drop in the number we reported last week. This is typical of the norovirus season where the number of laboratory reports fluctuates between October and April with the bulk of cases usually occurring between January and March. Norovirus is very contagious, so we would urge anyone who thinks they may be unwell with norovirus to stay at home and stay away from hospitals and care homes. The infection is short-lived, although it is very unpleasant while you are unwell. Most people will not need to go to see their doctor and will recover in a couple of days. It is important to take plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration."

[This press report (part 1) is supplemented by graphical presentation of data compiled from the present and previous outbreaks.

According to the HPA, indications from Europe and Japan are that norovirus activity also started to increase early. In Australia, the norovirus season also peaks during the winter, but this season [2012-2013], it has gone on longer than usual, and they are seeing cases into their summer [which is now].

It is typical of the norovirus season that the number of laboratory reports fluctuates between October and April with the bulk of cases usually occurring [in the Northern Hemisphere] between January and March. It may be that the final number of cases for this season may not be significantly different from the normal pattern. - Mod.CP
