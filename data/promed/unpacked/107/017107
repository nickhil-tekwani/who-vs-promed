Summary of the recent history of human-elephant-human transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in the United States
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the extent of the recent correspondence in ProMED-mail on human-elephant and elephant-human transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in US zoos, a brief summary of the evolution of the current epidemic in the United States is appropriate.

The current epidemic was 1st identified following the detection of human tuberculosis during 1996, following the detection of _M. tuberculosis_ (TB) in 4 Asian elephants owned by the Hawthorn Circus Corp (3 dead and one living). Subsequent testing of humans and animals at the Hawthorn exotic animal facility in Richmond, Illinois identified an active TB infection in one keeper, and positive TB skin tests from 10 of 22 keepers who had contact with the Hawthorn elephants. TB had been identified previously as the cause of death of Asian elephants at this same facility on 2 occasions, in 1983 and 1994 (Michelak et al. 1998, 2001).

Molecular analyses conducted determined that the TB strain from the active human case at the Hawthorn facility was identical to that from the 1994 case and 3 other elephants from this same facility tested in 1996. The 3 Hawthorn elephant cases in 1996 included 2 elephants that died in California while on lease from the facility to a circus during August 1996, and a still-living elephant resident detected at the facility during epidemiological investigation conducted in the wake of the 2 TB-related elephant deaths in California (Michelak et al. 1998).

In the wake of this incident, the USDA issued new regulatory protocols for the testing, surveillance, and treatment of tuberculosis in captive elephants (USDA APHIS 1998).

Subsequent sampling efforts conducted at facilities with potential epidemiological links to the Hawthorn facility confirmed TB infections by culture from 12 of 118 elephants tested (Mikota et al. 2001). The USDA guidance was updated in 2008, and re-issued in amended form in 2011 (USDA APHIS 2008, 2011).

Two elephants at the Los Angeles Zoo that had been procured from the Hawthorn facility in 1994, the same year another elephant at this facility had died from TB, were subsequently identified by the zoo with active TB infections in 1997 (post-mortem) and 1998, respectively. A subsequent epidemiological investigation identified no active cases of tuberculosis in humans, but found tuberculin skin-test conversions in 55 persons who had been in contact with these elephants at the zoo during training exercise and elephant necropsy activities (Oh et al. 2002).

In 2009, 8 employees of an elephant refuge facility in Tennessee that acquired 10 elephants from Hawthorn between 2004 and 2006 (including 2 female Asian elephants with a history of active TB) were found to have converted from negative to positive, during an epidemiological investigation subsequent to the isolation of _M. tuberculosis_ from a resident elephant in December 2008. One employee had converted in 2006 after close, prolonged contact with a Hawthorn elephant that died at the facilty in 2005. Two Hawthorn elephants acquired in 2004 had a known history of active TB infection, and at least one of these elephants was involved in the 1996 outbreak at the Hawthorn facility in Illinois (Murphree et al. 2011).

The available evidence indicates that the Hawthorn Circus animal facility in Richmond, Illinois was the epicenter for the current elephant-human TB epidemic in North America. The index case for the epidemic may have been an 11-year-old Asian elephant owned by Hawthorn that died in May 1981 (cf Payeur, undated).

The current elephant-human TB epidemic in the United States appears to have been facilitated (and perhaps driven) by the major increase in inter-facility "breeding loan" transfers of female elephants between and among US zoos and circus-owned elephant breeding/holding facilities during the 1980s and 1990s. This phenomenon coincided with the establishment of new artificial insemination-based captive breeding programs for elephants at a number of large US zoos, and the development of several large elephant breeding facilities in Florida by the Disney Corporation, Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus, and Busch Gardens.

This new push for development of captive breeding facilities for Asian elephants in the United States was driven in turn by the listing of Asian elephants under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species in Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1975, and the subsequent imposition of new restrictions on elephant imports to the United States under the Endangered Species Act of 1976. Captive elephant populations in the United States have historically never been self-sustaining, due to limited recruitment due to low rates of fecundity among captive females and a scarcity of mature breeding bulls, coupled with overall high rates of mortality among adults and captive-born calves (Brown et al. 2004).
