Citrus canker crisis deepens in Queensland
---------------------------------------------
Queensland's citrus canker crisis has deepened, with a major exporter
announcing plans to pull out of Australia, and more disease found on an
Emerald orchard.
The California-based Paramount Export Company, a major buyer of Queensland
citrus fruit, decided to close its Australian office, based in Brisbane. A
letter from the company to Queensland growers says the strength of the
Australian dollar is the main factor behind the move. But Paramount's
Australian director Paul McGuire says there doesn't seem to be a way out of
the citrus canker crisis, which has restricted or prevented its sales in a
number of countries.
The Department of Primary Industries has confirmed that canker has been
found on more trees on 2PH Farms at Emerald, where the disease was 1st
detected last month [November 2004].
According to Acting General Manager of Plant Health, Grant Hall, the
destruction zone will be expanded to include about 75 000 trees on that
property. Support for the so-called Pressler plan for the removal of all
citrus trees in the Emerald region is gaining support and now has the
backing of the Queensland and Australian citrus grower groups, and the
State Opposition. The National Management Group on canker is expected to
respond to the proposal next week [4th week of December 2004].
John Pressler, the man with the plan to remove all citrus trees from the
Emerald region to get rid of canker, fears Paramount won't be the only
exporter to pull out of Australia, leaving the AUD 120 million [USD 91
million] trade in jeopardy. "I would think it would be foremost in any
exporter to consider their options, whether to remain in the citrus business."

[Financial considerations aside, the situation at the 2PH Farms at Emerald,
coupled with Paramount's Australian director Paul McGuire's statement,
could force a decision to close operations in Queensland. Clearly, the
Queensland government is on the horns of a dilemma, and the response of the
National Management Group on canker will be a key factor in that decision.
