An unfavourable epidemiological situation with regard to measles incidence has developed in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. According to the press-service of the Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] of Nizhny Novgorod region, 12 cases of the disease have been recorded, in April 2013, including 9 children under 14 years of age.

Among a community of Orthodox believers in the Avtozavodsky district of the city, another 9 cases of measles were recorded, 8 of whom were children. None of these patients had been vaccinated against measles on account of their religious convictions. Measles affected 2 families, who live in a private house with a common entrance. 8 cases of measles were recorded in these 2 families. 5 children were in the same class of a non-governmental educational institution run by a religious organisation, the "Saint Nicholas Orthodox Gymnasium", where 68 pupils and 40 employees have refused to accept immunization on grounds of religious conviction.

The only measure of prevention of measles infection is vaccination, which is available in all countries of the world, using an attenuated live virus vaccine. As prescribed in the national calendar of preventive inoculations of the Russian Federation, vaccination against measles is carried out twice: children under the age of 12 months (primary vaccination) and at 6 years (booster). [Unvaccinated] adults under 35 years of age should be vaccinated twice. If a person was not vaccinated in childhood and never suffered measles, or when data on vaccination has been lost, vaccination should be carried out with an interval of at least 3 months between vaccinations. Refusal on the religious beliefs to accept prophylactic vaccination can result in greater spread of the infection, and result in the emergence of a group of susceptibles and outbreaks of the disease.

In Georgia (Tbilisi) measles cases now exceed 1000. Although vaccination can be obtained free of charge at clinics, compared with previous years, in Georgia the population is contracting measles more frequently. To date, the number of infected persons is approaching the critical point when the outbreak could become an epidemic.

According to Paata Imnadze, head of the scientific council of the National Center for Disease Control, "This is still only an outbreak, but the situation is developing such that it may reach epidemic proportions. Mostly adults are being affected because they have no immunity, as in 2008 when a mass vaccination campaign had to be undertaken. [Then] it was planned to vaccinate millions of people, but only 500 000 were vaccinated. Now we are seeing the consequences of the refusal of many to accept vaccination. Not so long ago, 2 measles deaths were reported: an 11-month-old child and a 19-year-old man. Measles cannot be cured and the best protection is vaccination. The new vaccination programme will cover all regions of Georgia.

Health bosses say they fear a measles outbreak in Birmingham as figures showing more than 40 000 teenagers and children may not be protected properly emerged. Statistics show that in Birmingham and the Black Country a total of more than 11 000 children from the ages of 6 to 10 have never received the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab. A further 40 446 are not recorded as having had the 2nd booster dose in Birmingham alone, which could put them at higher risk of catching the potentially lethal disease.

Health bosses said this meant there was now a chance an outbreak of measles in the region. The figures are based on those who received vaccinations between the ages of 2 and 5 -- the recommended age for the jab. The Government has launched a big push to get at least a million youngsters vaccinated against the disease because many parents didn't have their children immunised during the MMR-autism scare in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

It is hoped that around a million young people will now get the jabs in the new GBP 20 million [approximately USD 31 million] campaign.

Figures released by the government last week [week of 22 Apr 2013] reveal that of 68 cases diagnosed in London between January and March [2013], almost half were from the borough [of Hackney] -- 3 times more than any other part of the capital. This represents more than a 900 per cent increase from the previous 3 months and public health bodies are now concerned about a generation of 10 to 16 year-olds in the borough who were never vaccinated against the disease.

Diane Abbott, shadow public health minister and MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said: "I made sure my son had his MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) jab. "I tried to persuade people that approached me likewise. But public health is now Hackney Council's responsibility. So I am calling on the mayor to have an emergency campaign to encourage Hackney mums to make sure their children have had the jab."

Hackney Council's public health team is working with Homerton University Hospital, Hackney Learning Trust, community health services, GPs, and Public Health England to provide extra immunisation clinics for residents.

Parents are being urged to make sure their children have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Dr Sohail Bhatti, interim director of public health for City and Hackney, said: "Measles is a potentially life-threatening disease which spreads rapidly between children. Please check whether your children's vaccinations are up to date, and if they are not, please contact your GP or visit one of Hackney's drop-in clinics."

Public Health Wales says [the number of cases in the Swansea measles epidemic now stands at 1011], but added that about 5000 youngsters in the area aged between 10 and 18 still need vaccinating. A vaccination programme has been running in schools and hospitals with 4000 receiving the MMR jab in the last month alone.

The outbreak started last November [2012]. A total of 84 people have been treated in hospital since it began while a post-mortem examination into the death of a man who died while suffering from measles proved inconclusive. An inquest into the death of a 25-year-old man from Swansea was opened and adjourned on Tuesday [30 Apr 2013].

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "The efforts to vaccinate susceptible children in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area have been tremendous and we are delighted to see that around half of children needing vaccination have now received the MMR. "But with around 50 000 children (in Wales) in the 10 to 18 age group still not vaccinated and more than 1000 cases now reported to us, we cannot be complacent. Therefore we urge parents of children, and young people themselves, to take up opportunities to receive the MMR vaccine as a matter of urgency. Vaccination sessions are continuing in schools throughout Wales and I urge pupils and their parents to take advantage of these."

Wigan has been hit hardest by a measles outbreak across Greater Manchester, with the North West seeing a huge rise in cases during the 1st 3 months of this year [2013]. By the end of March 2013, 80 cases were confirmed in the county with 55 of them in Wigan. The potential epidemic has led Public Health England, NHS England, and the Department of Health, to launch a catch-up programme to increase MMR vaccination uptake in children and teenagers.

Dr Rosemary McCann, the Interim Director from the Greater Manchester Health Protection Unit, said: "I can't stress enough the importance of parents in Wigan making sure their children have both doses of the MMR vaccine, which gives life-long protection. More than 90 percent of children in the Ashton, Leigh, and Wigan area have had both MMR doses by their 5th birthday -- which means that 366 have not. The catch-up programme aims to vaccinate as many unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10-16 year-olds as possible before the next school year starts. Government officials estimate that approximately 300 000 10-16 year-olds [in England] are not vaccinated. "Those who catch measles have a 1 in 4 chance of being admitted to hospital, a 1 in 6 chance of developing a complication, and a 1 in 500 chance of dying.

There have been no deaths caused by measles in Greater Manchester so far, but a 25-year-old man's death in the badly affected South of Wales is believed to have been caused by measles, which he had at the time of his death. If the virus is found to be the cause of his death he will be the 1st person in the UK to die from the illness since 2008. Further investigations are being undertaken by the Swansea Coroner to establish whether this is the case.

From: Nkoghe Dieudonne <dnkoghe@hotmail.com> [edited]


A measles outbreak began in Libreville (Gabon) and its surrounding area in January 2013. The Gabonese Ministry of Health declared an epidemic after confirmation by the Virology Laboratory of the Libreville University of Health Sciences. To date, 23 cases have been laboratory-confirmed, and other samples from suspected cases are currently being collected throughout the country. The Gabonese government implemented an outbreak response based on a national immunization campaign and vitamin A administration. These activities initially took place from [19-23 Mar 2013] and concerned children aged from 9 months to 10 years living in Libreville and the neighboring commune of Owendo. Subsequently, more than 250 000 children were vaccinated in health centers, approved immunization sites, and primary schools, with support from WHO and UNICEF. The results of this campaign are being analysed.

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a morbillivirus. It only affects humans, is transmitted by aerosols, and rapidly spreads through the community, mainly affecting children under 5 years of age. Vaccination is currently the best preventive treatment. Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in this age class. Several measles outbreaks occurred among children under 5 years of age in 2011 in African countries, including Nigeria, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Ethiopia, in spite of high measles-containing vaccine (MCV) coverage. Older children and young adults were affected in other outbreaks in Burkina Faso, Namibia, Malawi, and South Africa.

No outbreaks had previously been reported in Gabon. From 2009 to 2012, 155 measles cases including 45 deaths were reported, while MCV coverage was estimated at 55 percent in 2007 and 35 percent in 2011. The CIRMF [Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville /International Centre for Medical Research in Franceville] rapid-reaction task force implemented an active surveillance strategy and a research program through sentinel sites in Libreville (North West), Franceville, Koulamoutou (South East), and Makokou (North East). The 1st findings show that older children and young adults are also affected. The surveillance strategy has revealed the spatial and temporal pattern of the epidemic, and the research program has identified the circulating strains.

Ongoing work will show whether the epidemic is due to low MCV coverage or to a non vaccine strain [no such strains are known to exist - Mod.LM].

[Drawing from the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) trends presented in the report and the fact that older and young children are affected by measles in the outbreak, low MCV coverage with accumulation of unvaccinated cohorts is likely to be one of the factors for the current outbreak. The national measles control strategy therefore needs to be reviewed and updated to address the current implementation gaps.

The Health Ministry has intensified its measles vaccination efforts after the cases increased to 3000 between 2012 and 2013, due to a virus that entered the country from Romania.

Almost 3000 measles cases were seen in several cities between 2012 and 2013, due to a virus which came from abroad, said an official from the Ministry, adding that these cases had decreased over the past few weeks. In 2011, only 110 measles cases were seen across Turkey, but this number increased since May 2012 due to a virus which was first carried to Istanbul by a music group who came from Romania, according to the Public Health Agency of Turkey deputy head Mehmet Ali Torunoglu. Some of these cases were treated in intensive care units but there were no casualties, he added. "The cases were first seen in Istanbul and then spread to other cities," said Torunoglu, adding that the majority of cases were observed in big cities such as Ankara, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, and Adana.

Torunoglu said that the cases had decreased in the past weeks. "We used to have around 200 cases in a week. But for the past 4 weeks, our cases decreased to 100 to 200 a week. We are expecting fewer cases in the coming weeks as the incidences decrease during summer time," he said. One third of these cases were seen in children younger than 1-year-old. Also, one third of these cases were among those above the age of 20, he added. Those between one and 19 years of age catching the disease had either not been vaccinated or could not develop immunity despite being vaccinated, Torunoglu added.

"We are working on the vaccination to prevent the spread of this disease. It is usually seen in those of a younger age. We decreased the age of vaccination to 9-month babies on the decision of the Science Council. We repeat the vaccine when they turn 1 year old," said Torunoglu yesterday [29 Apr 2013]. "Also, the family doctors invite those between 1 and 4 years of age who have not completed their vaccinations. We extraordinarily vaccinated the pre-school children this year [2013]. We won't vaccinate pre-school children next year," he added.

Despite the increase in cases last year [2012], the ministry claims that there is no epidemic, but rather a controlled increase in the number of cases. "These cases are still widely seen in Europe. These may enter Turkey due to the human traffic and may spread to Turkey. The Science Council said that this was not an epidemic, but a controlled increase in cases," said Torunoglu. He said that one dose of the vaccination could not protect 100 percent, and those with only one dose were still at risk if they encountered the virus.

It hasn't gotten as much attention as the ongoing measles outbreak in North Carolina [see below], so few people are likely aware that there has also been a measles outbreak in New York City. In fact, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued an alert a few weeks ago notifying residents that:
- they had identified 5 cases of measles in Borough Park, Brooklyn in the past month;
- there were a large number of exposures in the community and that additional cases were expected to be identified;
- all of the confirmed cases, who ranged in age from 10 months to 23 years, were unvaccinated;
- the initial case was from London [UK], where a very large epidemic of measles is underway and measles cases are at an 18 year high.

We had gotten used to hearing about large numbers of measles cases in Europe over the last few years. With more than 30 000 cases of measles in Europe in 2011, 8 deaths, and 27 cases of measles encephalitis, it helped fuel our own record number of cases that year. Fortunately, measles cases have dropped in most of Europe since then, which is likely why cases in the US have also dropped.

This outbreak in New York City is a good reminder that the UK is seeing a large increase in measles cases now, with over 1000 cases in Wales. Even London has seen a doubling of the number of cases this year as compared to the same period in 2012.

A case of measles has been confirmed at Beverly High School, according to officials from both the local school district and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). The latter agency stated that they are currently coordinating an investigation into the report. Nurse Leader Cathy Riccio said the school was notified on 24 Apr 2013 that there had been a confirmed case of measles present at Beverly High School building on 13 Apr 2013 during student testing for the ACT, a college readiness examination.

"This required us to notify all persons who entered the building and obtain proof of immunity," said Riccio. "We notified and confirmed immunity for 21 Beverly High School staff, 95 Beverly High School students, 167 students from the surrounding area, and 61 students who were involved during the day with athletics and entered the high school building." Riccio added that the high school's pair of nurses, Kim Pappas and Cathy Ober, did a fantastic job of notifying students both from Beverly and the surrounding area.

Teresa Kirch, a representative of the Beverly Health Department, referred all inquiries on the measles case to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), the lead agency currently investigating the matter. DPH Media Relations Manager Anne Roach said that the department is currently performing an epidemiological investigation into the reported case of measles at the high school, but that no further information is publicly available due to the ongoing nature of the investigation. Roach added that for the public's benefit, the DPH's fact sheet on measles, its symptoms and how to protect oneself from the disease may be found at http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/cdc/factsheets/measles.pdf.

The measles outbreak reported earlier this month [April 2013] in North Carolina (NC) is spreading, according to the latest numbers from state health officials. North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services public health officials and staff from local health departments are now investigating 19 cases of measles in Stokes, Orange, and Polk counties as part of an outbreak that was first reported in mid-April [2013], according to a news release from the NC Department of Health and Human Services.

Since the outbreak began, state and local public health authorities have notified more than 1000 people in Stokes, Forsyth, Guilford, Orange, Polk, and Chatham counties who may have been exposed to the disease. Most of the cases are associated with people who live in or have visited the Prabhupada Village in Stokes County. As part of the investigation, public health investigators are identifying additional possible exposures based on information from current cases. Investigators have now determined that at least 2 confirmed cases attended the Shakori Hills GrassRoots Festival in Chatham County Friday evening 19 Apr 2013 through Sunday 21 Apr 2013 while infectious and before becoming ill.

"Most of the persons who became infected with measles were individuals both inside and outside this community who were not vaccinated," said Scott Lenhart, Stokes County Health Director. "This is an important reminder that anyone who has not been protected by immunization is highly susceptible to measles."

Stokes County health officials and state public health officials are working closely with the Prabhupada Village community to avoid further spread of illness. Lenhart recommends that any individuals, especially those who are not vaccinated, avoid visiting the Prabhupada Village community until the outbreak is over. As an additional precaution, Stokes County health officials are advising that individuals who are not vaccinated should avoid any highly populated areas in Stokes County during the outbreak.

Measles is a highly contagious illness and unvaccinated populations are at highest risk of becoming sick when exposed to the measles virus. It can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of an infected person. Initial symptoms of this illness may include a fever over 101 deg F [38.3 deg C], runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. After a few days, a rash will begin to appear on the face and spread over the entire body. Persons with measles are considered infectious 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears.

Persons exposed to the measles virus who have not been vaccinated or have not had measles earlier in life are required to stay home for a period of time specified by public health officials because they can begin to pass the infection to others before they show signs of illness. Measles can be prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. It is important for all individuals 12 months of age and older to get vaccinated. Public health officials recommend immunization within 72 hours of exposure for those individuals who have not already been vaccinated to protect against developing the disease.

A man in Stokes County is the source of the measles outbreak after taking a trip to India without receiving the recommended vaccine. Since the measles outbreak started in Stokes county, there have been 19 confirmed cases across the state. WFMY News 2, looked into where the outbreak came from. Scott Lenhart, Stokes County Health Director, told WFMY News 2's Liz Crawford the source is a man in his late 20s or early 30s from the Prabhupada Village in Stokes County. He took a trip to India at the end of March [2013], where he contracted measles and brought it back to the United States.

"In this case, the individual who traveled did not have the recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine prior to leaving the country. The country where he traveled is endemic with measles," explained Amy Parker Fiebelkorn, an epidemiologist for the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the time vaccines are not required, therefore it's up to the traveler to make sure they get vaccinated to protect themselves and prevent outbreaks like this one. Fiebelkorn said, "The best that we can do is inform people of the risks involved in traveling internationally and not being vaccinated and provide the recommendations that we have."

The Guilford County Department of Public Health has one of the only international travel programs in the surrounding area. They encourage clients to come in and talk about their travel plans well before they leave. Connie Weant sees clients that are traveling internationally for business, school, or missionary trips.
