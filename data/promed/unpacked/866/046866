[I asked Chuck Trimarchi, director of the Rabies Laboratory of the NY State
Health Dept. in Albany, and an acknowledged international expert on the
subject, for his views - Mod.JW
I've been following these posts -- my take is that there probably is a
hot epizootic of the the Arctic fox variant of rabies virus in the fox
populations there, with spill-over into wolves and cattle. Rabies in
vulpine foxes with that variant is often quite cyclic and epizootic periods
can be quite intense. An occasional spill-over case in a hare would not be
unexpected, either.
As for the evidence that some of the laboratory diagnoses are difficult to
confirm, I would expect that, too, as sensitive and specific reagents and
optimum fluorescence microscopy equipment is often not widely available.
As for the report that hunters had killed 4000 "rabid" foxes, it is not
unusual for the number of vector animals killed for control efforts to be
mistakenly reported as "cases."
