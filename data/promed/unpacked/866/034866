Colorado State Veterinarian's Office workers are investigating a Weld County horse testing positive for equine herpesvirus. The horse's stable is under quarantine because of a Colorado Department of Agriculture investigation. The horse is undergoing treatment. Other horses that may have come in contact with the affected animal are being monitored but are not showing any signs of illness. The horse's location was not specifically disclosed for privacy reasons, according to state officials.

Symptoms of horses affected with EHV-1 include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, lethargy and an inability to rise.

A horse from Laramie County, Wyoming, euthanized due to a suspected case of rabies has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [Thu 26 Apr 2018].

They Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) said the barrel racing horse was admitted to the Colorado State University (CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital, in Fort Collins, with progressive neurologic issues impacting all 4 limbs as well as the animal's cranial nerves, the EDCC said.

"The horse was recumbent and euthanized for humane reasons," the EDCC stated. "Testing for rabies was negative on [13 Apr 2018]. The horse owner was contacted and, because EHM (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, the neurologic form of EHV-1) had not yet been ruled in or out, they were advised to impose a self-quarantine and implement enhanced monitoring of each horse on the premises to include at least twice daily recording of rectal temperatures with any suspect cases reported immediately."

[It is not quite yet May and we have had 16 reports already of this equine disease. As these articles have stated, EHV is highly contagious and there is currently no vaccine to protect against the neurological form. For any equine groups, USDA, university researchers and pharmaceutical and /or biological companies needing a project this seems like a worthy cause for which all horse owners would be grateful. Hopefully we will have a vaccine sooner rather than later. - Mod.MHJ
