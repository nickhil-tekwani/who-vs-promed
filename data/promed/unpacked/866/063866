Coca-Cola today expanded the second major recall of its products in Europe,
withdrawing small glass bottles of its beverages off shelves in Poland and
replacing them with plastic containers.
The soft-drink giant described the measure as a safety precaution after mold
was found in some bottles of carbonated mineral water. Its news release
contained no figures on the exact number of returnable five-ounce glass
bottles involved in the recall.
Today's announcement came hours after Coca-Cola said it was withdrawing
hundreds of thousands of glass bottles of Bonaqua brand carbonated water
from Polish stores, and only weeks after some Coke products were ordered off
shelves in Belgium, when some 200 people became sick after drinking
beverages made by the company.
Marcin Barcz, Coca-Cola's deputy director for Poland, said health inspectors
detected mold in 1500 glass bottles of the mineral water. He said tests
showed the glass bottles were the source of the mold, which was first
detected by a consumer in Gdansk.
Testing of all Coca-Cola products showed that 99.6 percent of beverages in
the small, returnable bottles was untainted, said Ron Pugsley,
director-general of Coca-Cola Poland Beverages.
Barcz described the mold as "not dangerous for the health,'' but state
health inspectors said it could cause digestive problems.
