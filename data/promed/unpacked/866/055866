PANAMA DISEASE TROPICAL RACE 4, BANANA - PERU: (PIURA) SUSPECTED, ALERT

Peruvian authorities say they have detected a possible case of fusarium wilt tropical race IV (TR4). If confirmed, Peru would be the 2nd country in Latin America to detect TR4, after Colombia in July 2019 [ProMED-mail post 20190820.6630576]. Ecuador -- which lies between Peru and Colombia -- and Central American countries have not yet detected the disease.

The country's phytosanitary watchdog Senasa said it had detected a possible case of the fungus on a 0.5 ha [1.24 acres] field in the northern region of Piura. "As a preventive measure, precise phytosanitary actions have been adopted in the sector and peripheral areas, which will prevent the spread of the quarantined disease, if it is confirmed," Senasa said. A phytosanitary alert has been initiated at the national level to protect all areas of banana and plantain production. Senasa said that field samples have been sent for analysis to its Plant Health Diagnostic Centres, where 4 different testing methods will be used. The results are expected over the coming days.

The banana industry in neighboring Ecuador -- the world's largest banana exporter -- is also on high alert following the development. Ecuador's Agrocalidad asked exporters and producers of the fruit to strengthen measures designed to prevent the fungus' entry into the country.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostems; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades; consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4 (TR4), as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail posts 20210105.8075029, 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

In recent years, TR4 has been reported in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The recent detection in Colombia (ProMED-mail posts 20190820.6630576, 20190712.6564489) was the 1st confirmed report of TR4 in the Americas. TR4 is of great concern worldwide and development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Ecuador borders Piura, the Peruvian region of the suspected TR4 incursion above, and it also shares a border with Colombia. That country is, therefore, at very high risk of a possible presence of TR4 within its territory. If TR4 is confirmed in Peru, trying to trace a possible source of the incursion would be an important next step to attempt to limit or at least delay further incursions in the region.
