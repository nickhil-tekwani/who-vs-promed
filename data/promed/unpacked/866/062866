Wild bird findings confirmed by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories are available at http://1.usa.gov/15xZXSX.

Surveillance for avian influenza is ongoing in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.

USDA is coordinating closely with its partners, including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington State officials, the US Department of the Interior and the US Department of Health and Human Services, on avian influenza surveillance, reporting, and control efforts. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, where we actively look for the disease and provide 100 per cent compensation to affected producers to encourage reporting.

USDA continues to inform OIE and international trading partners of these findings. USDA is working with trading partners to minimize trade impacts on poultry and poultry products as much as possible.

All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, need to continue practicing good biosecurity, preventing contact between their birds and wild birds, and reporting sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7

[2] News report
Date: Wed 22 Apr 2015

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/u-s-chickens-face-worst-bird-flu-in-decades-as-humans-seen-safe


The US poultry industry may be facing the biggest outbreak of deadly bird flu in more than 3 decades, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. "They are dealing with a level of exposure that is probably unprecedented back to the outbreak in 1983 in Delaware and Pennsylvania," said Brian Evans, a deputy director general at the Paris-based intergovernmental group known by its French acronym OIE.

New cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza were reported [Wed 22 Apr 2015] in Wisconsin, including 800 000 egg-laying hens, the 2nd-biggest chicken flock detected during the outbreak. The number of US commercial and backyard poultry flocks ravaged by the disease has climbed to more than 50.

An outbreak of another H5N2 virus in the north east in 1983 and 1984 resulted in the destruction of 17 million chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl to contain and eradicate the disease, according to the USDA. There's no risk from cooked meat or eggs in the current outbreak, Evans said in a telephone interview.

The OIE has reported various strains of bird flu in 26 countries across the globe since [1 Jan 2015], one of the most active years in terms of outbreaks since 2008, based on the group's data. The US and Canada have each reported 3 outbreaks.

The H5N2 strain has also been reported in Canada and parts of Asia, particularly Taiwan and China, Evans said. The genomic makeup "links it very closely" to a 2012 outbreak in Taiwan, he said. "It's a relatively stable strain that has been around for 3, 4 years globally in both wild birds and other populations," Evans said.

There have been no reported human cases related to the bird flu viruses circulating in North America, according to the World Health Organization. Human infections with avian influenza are "rare," though they can't be excluded, according to a WHO report on [Tue 21 Apr 2015].

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] "considers that the risk to the general public from these outbreaks to be low at this time," Alicia Fry of CDC said [Wed 22 Apr 2015] on a conference call alongside the USDA. "That said, human infections with similar avian influenza viruses have occurred, and it is possible that we may see human infections with the viruses" after the US outbreaks, said Fry, an epidemiology and prevention branch medical officer at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in the influenza division.

Taiwan researchers found elevated antibodies against H5N2 in 7 out of 141 people who had been in close contract with infected poultry in the 2012 outbreak, with 2 being the suspected result of subclinical infection.

Globally, "most human infections with avian influenza viruses have occurred in people with direct or close and prolonged contact with infected birds," Fry of CDC said. The 1st cases in the US and Canada were "no doubt" linked to migrating birds, probably waterfowl, passing a Mississippi River flyway, Evans of the OIE said. The subsequent increase probably involves both exposure to wild birds and sick poultry from neighboring farms, he said.

Measures to control the disease can include culling of infected birds and movement restrictions, or vaccination, and it's up to countries to decide how to respond, Evans said.

Zoning and movement controls have proven effective in the past, while vaccinations have to be targeted to virus strains that are circulating, and don't necessarily protect against other variants, he said.

"While we are cautiously optimistic that there will not be human cases, we must be prepared for that possibility, and we are taking routine preparedness steps including studying these viruses further and creating candidate vaccine viruses which could be used to make a vaccine for people if one were needed," Fry said. These measures are "routine," she said.

A bird flu outbreak in the Netherlands that started in November [2014] and was contained by January [2015] through culls and transportation bans resulted in direct costs of 49 million to 56 million euros (USD 53 million to USD 60 million), according to agricultural researcher LEI Wageningen UR.

Controlling the disease will require "significant" cooperation between the US poultry industry and the government, according to Evans, who said the OIE has "every confidence" the US can contain the outbreak. "Lessons are being re-learned," Evans said. "There is a cost to biosecurity. If it's in your backyard and you're dealing with it, you pay a lot more attention."

Sonstegard Foods Co said on [Mon 20 Apr 2015] that the flu affected many of its 3.8 million egg-laying chickens at the Sunrise Farms unit in Osceola County, Iowa.

Wisconsin also said [Wed 22 Apr 2015] that flu was found in a flock of 87 000 turkeys in Jefferson County. 5 cases have been reported in the state. On [Mon 20 Apr 2015], Governor Scott Walker authorized the National Guard to assist authorities in containing the outbreak.

http://www.crowrivermedia.com/independentreview/news/local/is-the-wind-to-blame-bird-flu-s-spread-remains/article_28853d87-2755-5c4c-a251-24b23bf89123.html


The most devastating avian flu outbreak to sweep through Central Minnesota in years has baffled scientists, farmers and poultry companies trying to figure out how exactly it's getting into barns. "Nobody I've talked to has a good handle on how (the virus) works," said Dale Fenrich, who finances poultry farm sales and sells insurance policies to local turkey farmers. "It's the hottest kill they've ever had in the system."

The Department of Natural Resources [DNR] plans to visit Meeker County as soon as this week [week of 20 Apr 2015] to begin taking samples of waterfowl feces in an attempt to pinpoint the virus' location. Officials believe the virus, known as H5N2, entered the region through migrating waterfowl, such as geese and ducks, but it's a mystery why some barns are getting hit while others remain unscathed.

Meanwhile, the DNR is asking the public to stay alert and report any unusual bird die-offs. "If there's a cluster of 5 or more birds, we definitely want to hear about that," said Cory Netland, the region's DNR wildlife manager. The DNR is also asking wild turkey hunters to allow the DNR to take swab samples of their birds' trachea to test for the flu's presence.

The virus is known to kill turkeys within 48 hours, and an estimated 2.1 million birds statewide have either died from infection or been euthanized as a precautionary measure. Health officials say the virus poses a low risk to humans.

Most of Meeker County's turkey production takes place in Acton and Swede Grove townships, on the county's western edge. With 14 farms in Meeker County, Jennie-O Turkey is by far the area's largest producer, according to county feedlot records. Those 14 sites have permits to raise as many as 1 815 050 turkeys, while the next largest producer, Litchfield-based Langmo Farms, has 4 sites with a permitted maximum of 171 500 birds.

One of Jennie-O's sites in Meeker County with a confirmed infection had 310,000 birds -- the largest affected site in all of Minnesota, according to US Department of Agriculture. The Minnesota Animal Health Board's website lists the farm as having been euthanized.

The only farm site listed in feedlot records as having more than 300,000 birds is the Jennie-O Wilcox Lake Farm on State Highway 4, north of Grove City, though the Independent Review has not verified whether the Wilcox site has been affected by avian flu.

The next largest sites in Meeker County, listed as having more than 200 000 turkeys, include 2 Jennie-O farms in Action Township, known as the Buffalo Run and Galaxy Brood farms, according to feedlot records.

When infections occur, the USDA and the Animal Health Board issues alerts identifying flock sizes and counties in which infections are confirmed. But the agencies do not identify the farm's owner or reveal the location, and state law treats turkey farm addresses and other data obtained by the Animal Health Board as private information.

Some farms volunteer more detailed information, and Jennie-O posts some information on its website. According to Jennie-O, 2 cases of avian flu in Meeker County occurred at barns owned by Jennie-O, with a 3rd Meeker County case occurring at a farm owned by an independent contractor.

Throughout the state, Jennie-O has reported 18 confirmed cases at its farm sites. The total number of cases confirmed statewide is 31, including three new cases reported [Tue 21 Apr 2015].

When avian flu is detected at a farm, the farm is placed under quarantine, meaning turkeys cannot enter or leave the affected area. All turkeys at an affected farm are euthanized by covering the birds with a firefighting foam, which suffocates them. The birds are then composted and wood chips are added to help generate heat and accelerate the composting. Barns are then cleaned out and disinfected before any new turkeys can be introduced. The entire process takes about six weeks, after which the farm can return to production.

The USDA compensates farmers for birds which are euthanized, but not for birds killed by the virus itself. The compensation amount depends on the type of turkey and its fair market value.

The Independent Review contacted Jennie-O officials last week [week of 13 Apr 2015] and submitted questions in an email to the company. A company official declined to answer questions, stating the company was in a "quiet period" related to its second quarter earnings report scheduled for [20 May 2015].

Hormel Foods, parent company of Jennie-O, announced [Tue 21 Apr 2015] the avian flu would reduce turkey sales and "pressure earnings" during this year's [2015] 2nd half. "We are experiencing significant challenges in our turkey supply chain due to the recent HPAI (avian flu) outbreaks in Minnesota and Wisconsin," stated Jeffrey M Ettinger, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer.

According to Fenrich, farmers and industry officials are frustrated particularly because the virus has infected flocks inside barns with stringent biosecurity measures. A leading theory among industry officials is that high wind speeds are helping to spread the virus, Fenrich said last week [week of 13 Apr 2015], essentially blowing contaminated particles into barns. "That's what they're all saying," Fenrich said of his conversation with farmers and poultry executives.

The owner of Langmo Farms in Litchfield, considers his operations as having high biosecurity standards, which include reducing traffic in the turkey barns, having employees change clothing and footwear between turkey barns, and even having employees shower between visits to different turkey barns.

"Turkey farmers are really clean people," he said during an interview earlier this month [April 2015]. "I'm probably showering 4 times a day. I wash my truck probably 3 or 4 times a week. You have to."

Contacted on [Tue 21 Apr 2015], [the farmer] said he agreed high winds appear to be the primary culprit in spreading the disease. No scientific evidence confirms his suspicions, he noted, but the randomness of virus' spread -- hitting some barns and farms while skipping others -- points toward wind as the problem. "It's just not reasonable that all these farms are having biosecurity breaches," he said.

Asked what steps could be taken to prevent wind from blowing into barns, he said, "If I knew, I would be really rich." A possible pathway for wind to enter a barn is through its ventilation system, which is needed to maintain a healthy environment for the turkeys. "If you turn the ventilation off, they're all dead," he noted.

[The farmer] questioned whether euthanizing all turkeys at an affected farm is necessary given the apparent randomness of confirmed cases, and evidence indicating farms have succeeded in preventing the virus' "horizontal" spread, meaning from barn to barn. [He] advocated for euthanizing birds only in barns that have tested positive for the virus [and added] that euthanizing all birds at an affected farm puts a financial hardship on producers. While farmers are compensated for any birds euthanized that are not sick, producers face ongoing costs while their barns sit empty for weeks waiting to be restocked, he said.

A researcher at the University of Minnesota said H5N2 is unlike any previous avian flue strains introduced to North America. Describing the virus as "completely, completely weird," Professor Carol Cardona said she's not sure how the strain is spreading or what biosecurity measures can thwart it. "The public wants us to know more than we know," she said. "All we can say is we don't know. This is unprecedented."

Researchers do know the virus is highly pathogenic. One milligram of infected feces contains the equivalent of 10 infectious doses, Cardona noted. "Does it get walked in? Does it get blown in? Does it get picked up by a small bird that goes through a hole in a screen?" she said, noting that multiple factors may be to blame for the virus' spread. She added, "We just don't know what biosecurity (measures) are working to keep it out of most of our 600 turkey farms (in Minnesota)."

In working with the USDA and Animal Health Board to learn more about the virus' spread, the DNR plans to collect samples within a 10 km [6 mi] radius of affected farms, and those samples will be sent to a laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, to test for the virus' presence. A total of 3000 samples are expected to be taken statewide, according to Michelle Carstensen, DNR wildlife health program supervisor. As of [Tue 21 Apr 2015], 908 samples had tested negative for avian flu virus. 5 tested positive, but further testing is needed to determine whether the strain is H5N2, she said.

H5N2 is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, according a USDA veterinarian. Dr John Clifford said last week [week of 13 Apr 2015] the virus could stay in the region for years, causing the most problems during cool months. Heat kills off the virus, and producers are likely to find relief during summer months.

Poultry companies and government officials are quick to note that the virus has affected only a small percentage of turkeys both state- and nationwide, but uncertainty surrounding the virus' transmission is creating stress for producers. Because so little is known about the virus, concerns and debates within the poultry industry are changing daily, Fenrich said. One poultry executive summed up the situation in telling Fenrich that the company's employees "were in crisis mode last week and catastrophe mode this week."

Routine practices, such as restocking farms with new turkeys, are now under scrutiny, Fenrich said. Under normal circumstances, turkeys leave farms for market and are replaced with new, younger birds to be raised. But there is debate among officials whether it's safe to introduce turkeys into any farm located within a 10 km [6 mi] quarantined area, or "hot zone," Fenrich said. "They're worried about these birds getting sick again," Fenrich said of discussions among industry and government officials.

The chart above regarding flyways and strains is very interesting.

The debate about the wind and wild birds is one likely to continue and both sides of this position will continue to collect "data". And likely as not, this question may not be solved for some time yet. - Mod.TG]
