Wound Botulism Outbreak Among Persons Who Use Black Tar Heroin: San Diego County, California, 2017-2018
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peak CM, Rosen H, Kamali A, et al.

During 29 Sep-6 Oct 2017, the County of San Diego Public Health Services (COSD) was notified of 2 patients with suspected wound botulism and a history of using black tar heroin. On 9 Oct 2017, COSD, which had reported an average of one wound botulism case per year during 2001-2016, sent a health alert through the California Health Alert Network, notifying Southern California providers of these 2 patients, including their signs and symptoms and black tar heroin exposure. In collaboration with the California Department of Public Health, COSD conducted an investigation to identify additional cases, determine risk factors for illness, estimate cost of medical care, and develop recommendations to prevent further illness.

By 18 Apr 2018, 9 (8 confirmed and 1 probable) patients with wound botulism were identified, all of whom were hospitalized; 1 of the 9 died. All 9 were persons who inject drugs; 7 specifically reported using black tar heroin, and 6 practiced subcutaneous injection known as skin popping. Clinically compatible signs and symptoms included muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, loss of facial expression, or descending paralysis. All patients were treated with heptavalent botulism antitoxin (BAT). Wound botulism is likely underrecognized because of its rarity and the overlapping signs and symptoms with opioid intoxication, overdose, and other neurologic syndromes including Guillain-Barre syndrome, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Prompt diagnosis, administration of BAT, and provision of supportive care can help stop the progression of paralysis and be lifesaving.

Investigation and Results
----------------
A confirmed case was defined as illness in a resident of San Diego County who had (1) clinically compatible signs or symptoms of botulism during September 2017-May 2018; (2) laboratory detection of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in serum; (3) a history of injection drug use during the 2 weeks before illness onset; and (4) no suspected exposure to a contaminated food. A probable case was defined similarly, but without laboratory confirmation. All wound botulism patients reported to COSD were asked by investigators about potential exposures using a standardized questionnaire. Self-reported history of injection drug use was recorded for each patient, with drug use corroborated by toxicology results when possible. Serum collected from each patient was tested for BoNT by mouse bioassay at the California Department of Public Health's Microbial Diseases Laboratory; serum specimens with indeterminate results were tested by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry at CDC. Direct hospital charges for the outbreak-associated patients were estimated based on hospital charges for wound botulism cases reported to COSD during 2005-2016 from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database.

Among 9 total cases, 8 patients were men; median age was 40 years (range = 25-67 years). Symptom onset dates ranged from 26 Sep 2017, (epidemiologic week 39) to 12 Apr 2018 (epidemiologic week 15) (Figure [for Figure and Tables see original URL. - Mod.LL]). The most frequently reported symptoms were muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, and blurred vision (Table 1). Abscesses were observed for 5 patients. Symptoms of wound botulism were initially attributed to drug intoxication for 4 patients. One patient was admitted for 7 days before receiving BAT and died 9 days later at a long-term care facility. One patient had received the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone without improvement in symptoms, and one patient had received 2 doses of naloxone upon admission after at least one previous emergency department visit associated with wound botulism. A 4th patient, who was evaluated for symptoms of wound botulism and a history of close contact with a person known to have wound botulism, was discharged from the hospital before later being readmitted. All 9 patients required admission to the intensive care unit; 6 required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, one of whom died. Median duration of hospitalization was 15 days (range = 9-67 days) until discharge to long-term care facilities (8, including the patient who died) or departure against medical advice (one). All patients reported history of injecting heroin; 7 reported using black tar heroin, 6 injected heroin by skin popping, and one patient did not report injection method. Toxicology tests performed for 6 patients were all positive for opioids. Two patients reported close contact with each other that included sharing drugs and needles.

In coordination with COSD, the California Department of Public Health authorized BAT, which was released for 9 patients by CDC quarantine stations in Los Angeles (8) and San Francisco (one). Median interval from symptom onset to BAT administration was 6.5 days (range = 2.7-10.5 days) (Table 2). Pre-BAT serum specimens from 9 patients were collected for testing; BoNT type A was confirmed for 6 patients by mouse bioassay and 2 patients by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. BoNT was not detected for one patient; however, that serum sample was frozen and hemolyzed and therefore not in optimal condition for confirmatory testing.

During the 2017-2018 outbreak, all 9 patients were enrolled in public health care programs, including Medi-Cal (7), Medicare (one), and the Veterans Health Administration (one). The total direct hospital costs for this outbreak was estimated at $2.3 million, for 203 total in-patient days charged at the historical median daily rate of $11,506 per day, based on data available for 9 patients hospitalized with wound botulism in San Diego County during 2005-2016 (COSD, unpublished data; 2018).

Public Health Response
-----------------
Health alerts issued by COSD on 9 Oct 2017 and 10 Apr 2018 reminded healthcare providers to educate persons who inject drugs about the risks and symptoms of wound botulism, thoroughly search for wounds, consider a wound botulism diagnosis for patients with injection drug use history and cranial nerve abnormalities or descending paralysis, and consult promptly with local health departments to request BAT (1,2). Within one day of the April 2018 health alert, local clinicians reported suspected clinical wound botulism for 2 currently hospitalized patients. Additional public health communications included presentations to the local infectious diseases medical society, the local chapter of the American College of Surgeons, and the local anti-opioid misuse coalition, and distribution of informational flyers at substance abuse, needle exchange, and methadone clinics. The California Department of Public Health issued a communicable disease brief to local health departments throughout California.

Discussion
-------
Botulism, a nationally notifiable condition, is a rare but serious illness of descending paralysis most commonly caused by the neurotoxin produced by the anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_; wound botulism in particular results from germination of _C. botulinum_ spores in a wound or other necrotic tissue (3,4). The 2017-2018 outbreak of wound botulism among persons who inject drugs in San Diego County was associated with black tar heroin use, possibly through contamination of one or more batches. Black tar heroin use poses a heightened risk for wound botulism attributable to its production, preparation, and practice. Black tar heroin is a dark, gummy drug primarily produced in Mexico and often contains adulterants to increase bulk or contaminants introduced during illicit transport to the USA, such as inside car tires or other unsanitary locations where the drug might be exposed to soil containing _C. botulinum_ spores (3). Preparation of black tar heroin for injection through cooking does not destroy _C. botulinum_ spores, which can survive high heat and later germinate to produce BoNT (5). Skin popping can create an anaerobic environment of necrotic tissue in which BoNT can be readily formed and released (6).

With recent increases in opioid misuse nationwide (7) there is a growing need for awareness of the risks and symptoms of wound botulism among persons who inject drugs. During 2001-2016, in the USA, 353 wound botulism cases were reported to CDC (8); 291 (82%) were from California, including 15 from San Diego County. Although rarely reported outside California, wound botulism likely is underdiagnosed in the USA (5). Diagnosing wound botulism can be challenging because of the complex testing required and symptoms that can overlap with other neurologic syndromes or opioid intoxication and overdose (5,6). In addition, law enforcement authorities throughout the western USA and increasingly in the northeast have confiscated black tar heroin (9), providing evidence of potential exposure to this primary risk factor for wound botulism (3).

Prompt BAT administration can help stop progression of paralysis (10). The median interval between symptom onset and BAT administration in this outbreak (6.5 days) primarily comprised the time from symptom onset to hospital admission (2.0 days) and a suspicion of botulism that prompted a BAT request (2.5 days). Consistent with a previous report (5), costs of inpatient medical care were high and paid at public or hospital expense because the patients lacked private medical insurance. Efforts to improve botulism prevention, identification, and prompt treatment can improve morbidity and mortality outcomes as well as likely lower the monetary burden to the public and health care system (5).

Persons who have symptoms of wound botulism should promptly seek medical care and communicate their specific drug practices to aid diagnosis and accelerate BAT administration. Persons who inject drugs should be aware that, although safe injection practices can reduce the risk for some bloodborne infections (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis), wound botulism remains a risk when injecting or skin popping black tar heroin. Clinicians caring for persons who inject drugs or persons who fail to respond to naloxone need to perform thorough searches for wounds, be alert for wound botulism, and inform patients of this potentially lethal consequence of injection drug use. Health departments can deliver these health messages and emphasize the importance of opioid overdose education, referral of persons who inject drugs to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, and implement timely surveillance and notification of injection drug users when wound botulism clusters are detected.

[Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin) "is heroin acetate. Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in Homebake Heroin in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than that inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least 1 study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection amongst drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).

"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping' or subcutaneous injection predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _Clostridium botulinum_ infection." - Mod.LL
