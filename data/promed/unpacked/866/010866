Cases of anthrax have been reported in several districts of Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions. The Zonal Veterinary Centre (ZVC) has reported that Arusha had 7 cases of anthrax infections, 3 of which occurred in Meru District, 2 in Arusha-Urban, one in Longido, and the other in Arusha-Rural District.

The Hai District of Kilimanjaro Region has suffered one case to date. Hai apparently borders Meru in Arusha, and the latter has been experiencing anthrax attacks for the last 6 years. According to a ZVC report, this year [2013] has seen more anthrax cases than previous years, thus signalling a growing problem which needs drastic measures, especially in Arusha Region. There were only 4 cases of anthrax reported in Arusha last year [2012], all occurring in Meru District. There was also a single case filed in Kilimanjaro Region in 2012 which was reported in Moshi Municipality. In 2011, there was no anthrax in Kilimanjaro Region, but again Arusha suffered five [cases], with Meru having 3, while the other 2 got reported from Arusha City and Arusha-Rural District.

In 2010, there was a single anthrax case in Meru District. Initial remedies taken include the recent mass vaccination of livestock in which Arusha-Rural immunised 11 789 cattle, 1750 goats and 1116 sheep between July 2012 and April 2013. Arusha City in the same period vaccinated 4612 cattle, 4501 goats, 3221 sheep and 1279 pigs. However, the ZVC report, which was tabled before the Regional Consultative Meetings in both Arusha and Kilimanjaro, points out that the number of immunised animals was relatively very small compared to the problem at hand.

[As this report originated at the Zonal Veterinary Centre, we can presume it relates to livestock outbreaks, as the official response has been to vaccinate livestock, not wildlife if one could, in the various areas at risk. Latterly, the Tanzanian official reports to OIE have been uneven, missing data, and what they say here does not quite match the information out of Paris. One can only agree with the report's comment about trivial vaccination cover. In the last 8 years, OIE had only 30 cattle vaccinated in the whole of the country. For some reason -- probably the usual ones to do with relative value and that women and children are responsible for them -- anthrax is currently not reported in sheep and goats; before 2005, it was recognised as a serious problem. One can hope that this report indicates an upgrading in the reporting.
