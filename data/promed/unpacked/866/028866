Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services has confirmed one case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in a Cascade County resident.

The exposure may have occurred during the cleaning of a barn, according to the case investigation. This is the 1st case in Cascade County for 2016.

This is one of 43 hantavirus cases reported in Montana since 1993, according to a release from the Cascade County Health Department. Montana typically sees 1-2 cases a year. Cascade County is the lead for hantavirus infections in Montana.

Hantavirus can cause severe illness and death, with one in 4 of Montana cases resulting in death. CCHD officials are reminding residents of how to protect themselves against infection.

Cleaning activities can disturb nesting materials contaminated with dried saliva, urine, or droppings from infected deer mice. The disturbed nesting materials become airborne, and the air is inhaled causing an exposure to the virus. This exposure leads to a hantavirus infection. A person might also be infected with hantavirus if contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or into the eyes or mouth, according to CCHD.

Symptoms can begin 1-6 weeks after becoming infected with the virus. The illness typically starts with 3-5 days of "flu-like" symptoms including fever, sore muscles, headaches, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Within a few days, the illness rapidly progresses to severe shortness of breath [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome], according to CCHD.

Early diagnosis of hantavirus infection and immediate medical care increase the likelihood of a full recovery. Individuals exposed to rodents or their waste who experience symptoms should immediately seek medical treatment and notify their provider that they have been around rodents or rodent wastes.

The best way to prevent hantavirus transmission is by controlling rodent populations in areas where you live and work.

Here are some tips on hantavirus prevention from CCHD:

- Seal up cracks and gaps in buildings that are larger than a quarter inch, including window and door sills, under sinks around the pipes, in foundations, attics and any rodent entry hole;

- Trap indoor rats and mice with snap traps, and remove rodent food sources; and

- Keep food, including pet food, in rodent-proof containers.

If you find places where rodents have nested, or if you find rodent droppings or waste, follow these steps to help to prevent exposure to hantavirus while cleaning:

- Wear rubber or plastic gloves;

- Thoroughly spray/soak area with a disinfectant or mixture of bleach and water to reduce dry dusty conditions in the area being cleaned (visit http://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

- Wipe or mop the area with a sponge or paper towel and throw away items after use;

- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after removing gloves; and

- Never sweep or vacuum in these areas, as this can stir up dust and aerosolize the droppings.

The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [17 May 2016] that a 30-year-old man from San Juan County has died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). An 84-year-old man from Santa Fe County is currently hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed HPS. These are the 3rd and 4th cases of HPS in New Mexico this year [2016]. An environmental investigation will be conducted at each patient's home to help reduce the risk to others.

Hantaviruses [cause] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. The deer mouse is the main carrier for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.

"Cleaning up rodent droppings and nesting material in enclosed spaces can concentrate the virus in stirred up particles that can be breathed in," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the department's public health veterinarian. "People need to be very careful when they are doing their spring cleaning and when opening up sheds, cabins, and other buildings that have been closed up for the winter. Mice and other rodents may have moved, and there may be fresh droppings and urine on the floor, benches, and other objects. Airing out cabins and sheds before entering them and wetting down droppings with a disinfectant before wiping them up can reduce the likelihood of being exposed to this virus."

The Department of Health urges healthcare workers and the general public to familiarize themselves with the symptoms of hantavirus [infections]. Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, and cough which progresses to respiratory distress. These symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after rodent exposure. Although there is no specific treatment for HPS, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.

Important steps to follow to prevent contracting hantavirus include:
- Air out closed-up buildings before entering.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.
- Don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

The other cases of HPS in New Mexico earlier this year [2016] include a 54-year-old man from Cibola County who died and a 37-year-old woman from Sandoval County who recovered. In 2015, New Mexico had one case of HPS in a 53-year-old woman from Taos County who also survived. In 2014, New Mexico identified 6 HPS cases with 3 deaths.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Ettlestad for sending in the New Mexico press release.

The spring season often brings with it sporadic cases of hantavirus infections, as cabins and other buildings unused over the winter are opened up and cleaned. In the western USA, the virus responsible for these cases is Sin Nombre, as mentioned in the New Mexico report. That virus is also doubtless responsible for the Montana case as well. Both of the above reports describe where deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_, the reservoir host of the virus) occur and nest, leading to exposure to the virus, as well as measures to avoid it. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate. Prompt medical attention is essential.
