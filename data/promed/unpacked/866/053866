The mosquito-borne disease [Japanese] encephalitis has taken more than 350 lives in Assam in the last few weeks. Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome outbreaks have affected 21 districts of Assam, with Sivasagar being the worst affected area.

More than 45 people have succumbed to the disease in Sivasagar alone this year [2014], despite it being the headquarters of the JE vaccination programme, which was started in 2011.

According to doctors, after the commencement of the programme, there was a shortage of vaccines for 2 consecutive years. There was insufficient supply to meet the demands, as the vaccines are produced only in China.

The state could not meet the demands sufficiently, despite receiving a grant of 910.4 crore [Rs 9 104 000 000, equal to USD 148 371 000] from the National Rural Health Mission in 2013. Out of the grant money, 57.41 crore [Rs 574 100 000, equal to USD 148 371 000] was specifically allotted to tackle vector-borne diseases, with a major part to be spent on encephalitis outbreak prevention.

Lack of special care units, laboratories and shortage of medicines for the treatment of encephalitis in district hospitals also reportedly played a part in the massive outbreak of the disease, killing hundreds in the last few weeks.

Meanwhile, 9 districts remained shielded from the encephalitis outbreak because of the vaccination programme in February [2014], according to NDTV.

Mosquitoes, the carriers of the virus, breed in stagnant water pits and paddy fields, areas most prone to JE. Having a moist climate, deep forests, and a dense network of water streams, Assam is highly prone to the disease.

With over 200 deaths reported because of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in West Bengal, the State government has urged the Centre to allow it to go in for an adult vaccination programme to arrest the disease. So far, vaccine has been administered only to children, and according to senior officials of the State Health Department, the cases of vaccinated children affected by the disease is almost nil.

"We have requested the Centre to enlighten us about the pilot project on the adult vaccination conducted in Assam. If the Centre allows us to go ahead, we are ready to vaccinate people," BR Satpathy, Director of Health Services, told The Hindu on Monday [4 Aug 2014].

According to the latest figures available with the Health Department, so far 206 persons have died of AES and JE in the State since January 2014. Of the 206 deaths, 37 are because of JE.

Dr. Satpathy said 92 deaths have occurred in the State in less than a month since 7 Jul 2014, after the outbreak was reported in north Bengal. Of the 92 deaths, 28 are because of JE, he said.

Despite attempts by the State government to contain the spread of encephalitis in north Bengal over the past few days, there have been reports of the mosquito-borne disease spreading to districts of south Bengal as well.

Senior health officials admitted that at least 2 deaths have been reported in the districts of south Bengal. While a child died of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bankura district on Sunday [3 Aug 2014], days ago, a person had died of Japanese encephalitis in Murshidabad district.

The State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the State government of not taking any help from the Centre to tackle the disease despite the Union Health Ministry extending all its support in the matter.

The BJP MP from Darjeeling, SS Ahulwalia, and Congress MP from Berhampore Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue of encephalitis deaths in Parliament on Sunday [3 Aug 2014] and pointed out that the State government has done little to contain the disease.

Meanwhile, another senior health official faced the State government's ire in connection with the outbreak. Anup Roy, Principal of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH), which is dealing with a bulk of patients affected by AES and JE, was suspended on Monday [4 Aug 2014].

Earlier, 3 senior health officials -- medical superintendent of NBMCH and chief medical officer of health of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts -- were suspended by the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who holds the health portfolio.

[In his 3 Aug 2014 comment (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140804.2656983), Dr. T. Jacob John indicated that Assam and the northern part of West Bengal are contiguous and traditionally Japanese encephalitis virus-enzootic areas. He continued, adding that, "the term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is used in the context of JE epidemics to denote encephalitis cases that are not laboratory confirmed for one reason or another. Thus, in Assam and West Bengal, the cases of JE and AES should be added up to see the real magnitude of the JE outbreak. I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES may indeed be West Nile encephalitis."

The type of JE virus vaccine used in the recent past is not stated. China produces a live attenuated JE virus vaccine. The deaths of the 3 previously vaccinated children suggest that the vaccine was an inactivated one of limited duration of protection.

Encephalitis and meningitis have spread to most areas of the northern province of Son La, affecting more than 100 children and killing 13 of them so far this year [2014], health authorities reported on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014].

Currently, the provincial capital Son La City and 10 out of the 11 districts of the province have been stricken by the 2 diseases, the provincial Health Department said.

Nguyen Tran Hien, director of the Hanoi-based Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, said that health experts have taken samples from 73 of the more than 100 child patients for testing, and 31 of them were positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus? antibody?]. Of these 31 kids, 3 had been vaccinated against JE [virus], Hien added.

Chu warned that JE symptoms include high fever, headache, feeling sick, vomiting, seizures, conscious disorder, and coma. JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the Western Pacific, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.

In preventing JE, the National Extended Vaccination Program and the local Health Department have decided to vaccinate all the children under 15 that have yet to receive vaccination against the 2 diseases in the province, Hien said.

When asked why many children have now contracted the deadly disease despite the provincial health authorities launching a vaccination drive against JE in 2007, Hien explained that, in that year, only 50 percent of local children were given vaccination due to a shortage of vaccine shots.

[The 2 Jul 2014 edition of Tuoitre News (http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/20720/viral-encephalitis-affects-325-people-kills-5-in-vietnam) reported that viral encephalitis had spread to 31 provinces and cities in Viet Nam, affecting 325 people and killing 5 of them in the 1st 6 months of this year [2014], health authorities said. - Mod.TY]

[Unfortunately, the above report does not indicate what proportions of the more than 100 cases are due to JE virus infections and to meningitis. However, the sample of 73 cases laboratory tested indicated that 42 per cent were due to JE virus infections. This is not surprising, since Viet Nam has had active JE virus transmission this year (2014). Most cases of Japanese encephalitis there occur in the south during the rainy and early dry season, shifting to the north of the country during late summer and autumn. Nationally, 73 per cent of the population lives in areas of risk to JE virus infection.

Wild birds, especially ardeids, are reservoirs of JEV. Pigs are amplifying hosts. Several _Culex_ mosquito species are efficient vectors of the virus, transmitting the virus among wild birds and pigs and to humans. Vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only measures available to avoid infection and disease.
