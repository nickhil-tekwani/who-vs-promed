Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Goats / 10 000 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 14 000 / 12 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, in percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 0.16 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 0.09 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering, vectors
Epidemiological comments: There were floods along the Ewaso Basin due to heavy rainfall around Mount Kenya region since October 2020. Livestock migrated to graze on the green marshy areas along the riverbanks. Surveillance in livestock was prompted by suspicion of Rift Valley fever in humans.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, quarantine, disinfection, ante- and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exist), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Regional veterinary investigation laboratory, Garissa (local laboratory) / Goats / IgM-capture ELISA / 7 Jan 2021 / Positive
Regional veterinary investigation laboratory, Garissa (local laboratory) / Sheep / IgM-capture ELISA / 7 Jan 2021 / Positive

["Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa, such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels. People can get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, or through bites from infected mosquitoes. Spread from person to person has not been documented.

"Although RVF often causes severe illness in animals, most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain)." (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/rvf/index.html).

"In June 2018, the Ministry of Health for Kenya confirmed an outbreak of RVF. A total of 26 human cases were reported from Wajir (24 cases, including the 1st patient) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] = 23%). A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, were reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals." (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/rvf/outbreaks/summaries.html).

The latest Food Chain Crisis - Early Warning Bulletin, July-September 2020, issue no. 36, mentioned: "According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, the areas suitable for RVF vector amplification for May 2020 persist in the region, particularly in Burundi, south and central Ethiopia, Kenya, small hotspots in Rwanda, southern Somalia, eastern and southern regions of South Sudan, northern Uganda and the northern part of the United Republic of Tanzania, and to a lesser extent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea and Sudan. In addition, some hotspots are also predicted in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, southern Chad along the border with Niger, Egypt (along the river Nile), Nigeria and Yemen. In October-November 2019, cases of RVF in humans and animals were confirmed in River Nile and Red Sea States (northeastern Sudan), and sporadic cases in humans were reported in White Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and Khartoum states. Since December 2019, cases have also been reported in southern Libya, likely due to the movement of infected animals from neighboring countries.

"Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks in the region, animal movement and the informal marketing of infected animals, as well as the current and forecasted suitability of conditions for vector amplification, the whole region remains at high risk of RVF occurrence." The bulletin is available at http://www.fao.org/3/cb0160en/cb0160en.pdf.

In the epidemiological comment was mentioned that "Surveillance in livestock was prompted by suspicion of Rift Valley fever in humans." In case suspected or confirmed human cases in Isiolo and/or Garissa or other locations in Kenya are known to have occurred since late 2020, their data deserve becoming public at the earliest. - Mod.CRD/AS
