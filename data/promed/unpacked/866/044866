65 children poisoned by food at school breakfast
-------------------------------------------------
Food poisoning struck 65 children in Guangdong Province on Mon 29 Mar 2004,
leaving 10 in serious condition. The 10 were still in hospital in Dianbai
County Tue 30 Mar receiving intravenous fluid drip treatment. All of them
are now in stable condition and out of life-threatening danger, said a
doctor from Dianbai County People's Hospital.
The 65 children were sent to hospitals for treatment at about noon on 29
Mar 2004 after exhibiting headaches, cramps, and vomiting following a
breakfast in the school canteen at about 7 am. They were taken to local
clinics and hospitals and diagnosed with food poisoning. Most of them had
to receive gastric lavage and intravenous drip treatment.
Apart from the 10 seriously ill, the rest were sent home, the doctor said.
"No deaths have, so far, been reported," the doctor added.
All the victims are aged 13 to 17 and are students at the county's Wangling
Middle School, which has 1450 students.
Officials believe the food they ate was contaminated with some kind of rat
poison. An investigation is under way.

[The etiology of the illness is as yet unclear. Given the short incubation
period of about 5 hours, poisons, toxic metals, and staphylococcal
enterotoxin should be considered. - Mod.LL]
