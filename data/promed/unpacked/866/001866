Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 4 Jan 2016
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Bluetongue virus
Serotype: Pending
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
New outbreaks (1)
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Aug 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 241 / 1 / - / - / -

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Sheep / 0.41 / ** / ** / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 2 Sep 2020, a singular case of Bluetongue was confirmed on clinical suspicion in an ovine animal (male), out of 241 animals from a non-professional holding (backyard) in Turcesti, Valcea County. There were tested 63 animals (60 ovine animals and 3 bovine animals), and the infection was confirmed by the real-time RT-PCR test in only one animal. Disease was confirmed at the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health, the National Reference Laboratory. Serotype is not identified yet; the results are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; zoning; disinfection; control of vectors; vector surveillance; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health (national laboratory) / Sheep / Real-time PCR / 2 Sep 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[BTV serotype 4 has been reported as spreading in North Macedonia (66 outbreaks reported throughout the country since early July 2020) and in Greece (77 outbreaks reported in the northern/central provinces, as well as in the islands along the Turkish coast, since late July 2020). In both countries, clinical cases and mortalities have been observed in sheep flocks and in mixed sheep/goat flocks. Goats, similar to cattle, are known to be readily bitten and BTV-infected by the vector (_Culicoides_ midges) but rarely show clinical signs. In case mixed sheep/goat flocks are involved, the OIE reports do not allow differentiating the number of cases in each species. This is demonstrated in the summary of the Greek event (as of 3 Sep 2020):

Total outbreaks = 77 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 9226 / 206 / 12 / 0 / 0
Sheep and goats / 14 438 / 577 / 78 / 0 / 0

It may be assumed that in the mixed flocks, most of the cases (or all?) involved sheep of susceptible breeds.

The spread of the virus to neighboring Romania is not surprising; the serotyping is pending, most likely serotype 4. The reported outbreaks in the east Aegean Greek islands along the Turkish coast are indicative of BTV-4 circulating within Turkey's mainland. Further spread to other Balkan countries is anticipated during the current season, which may continue until October (2020). Preventive vaccination of susceptible sheep breeds throughout the region is warranted.
