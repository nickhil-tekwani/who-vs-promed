The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [reports] 16 people [have been] poisoned by yellowfin tuna steaks, [forcing] Kroger [grocery stores] to recall the tainted product. The scombroid poisoning stemmed from yellowfin tuna steaks sold in Kroger stores, the FDA said in an alert.

The improperly stored tuna was sold in Kroger stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The FDA is advising consumers "to not eat yellowfin tuna steaks from the seafood counter or seasoned yellowfin tuna steaks in store-prepped Styrofoam trays from Kroger retail stores," the alert stated. The steaks "may cause scombroid poisoning."

Consumers of these products who are experiencing symptoms of scombroid poisoning should contact their healthcare provider. Consumers of these products who have recently experienced symptoms of scombroid poisoning should report their symptoms to their local Health Department, the department added.

The FDA became aware of the issue on [4 Sep 2019] and alerted Kroger, which the next day agreed to recall all yellowfin tuna steaks from stores in the aforementioned states. The company also began notifying customers who bought the steaks to dispose of them or return them to a store.

The FDA is working with Kroger, the distributor, and state and local partners to remove all contaminated product from the market. The Kroger grocery store didn't immediately respond to a request for comment and has not issued a statement on the recall.

[Since the previous ProMail post Scombroid fish poisoning - USA: (OH) 20190907.6662594, the investigation seems to have greatly expanded.

What is scombroid fish poisoning?
Scombroid fish poisoning, also known as histamine fish poisoning, is an allergic-type reaction that occurs within a few hours of eating fish contaminated with high levels of histamine. When certain types of fish are not properly refrigerated, bacteria in the fish can multiply, break down the flesh of the fish, and produce high amounts of histamine. The most common sources of illness are finfish such as tuna, mackerel, amberjack and bonito. Other fish, such as mahi mahi, bluefish, marlin, and escolar, can also cause scombroid fish poisoning.

How common is scombroid fish poisoning?
Scombroid fish poisoning occurs worldwide. Between 10 and 35 scombroid fish poisoning cases are reported each year in California. There may be many more unreported cases from people who did not seek medical care.

How do people get scombroid fish poisoning?
People get scombroid fish poisoning when they eat fish contaminated with high levels of histamines. Histamine-contaminated fish often have a metallic, sharp, or peppery taste, smell bad, or have a "honey-combed" appearance. However, some contaminated fish will look, smell, and taste normal.

What are the symptoms of scombroid fish poisoning?
Scombroid fish poisoning resembles an allergic reaction and occurs within minutes to hours of eating fish contaminated with histamine. The most common symptoms are rash, diarrhea, reddening or flushing of the face and sometimes the neck, arms, and upper part of the body, sweating, headache, and vomiting. Burning sensation or swelling of the mouth, difficulty swallowing, stomach pain, and heart palpitations may also occur.

How is scombroid fish poisoning diagnosed?
There are no specific diagnostic tests for scombroid fish poisoning. Diagnosis is generally made based on symptoms and a recent history of eating fish a short time before symptoms appeared. If scombroid fish poisoning is suspected, laboratory testing may be done on any uneaten fish.

How is scombroid fish poisoning treated?
Most people have mild symptoms that resolve within a few hours. Treatment is often unnecessary, but antihistamines or epinephrine can help severe cases or patients with other medical conditions.

How can you prevent scombroid fish poisoning?
Histamine formation depends on the temperature at which the fish is kept from the time it is caught to the time it is eaten. The best prevention is to keep fish appropriately refrigerated, when it is being transported or stored, until it is cooked and eaten. Do not purchase or eat fish with a bad odor or a "honey-combed" appearance. Since histamines are heat-resistant, cooking spoiled fish will not make it safe to eat.

Where can I get more information on scombroid fish poisoning?
More information on scombroid fish poisoning is available from the FDA's Bad Bug Book (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/ucm297627.pdf) and
the FDA, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Fish and Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guidance, 4th edition (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/ucm251970.pdf).

Fish in the Scombridae family (tuna, mackerel, skipjack and bonito) are the most common vehicles for scombroid fish poisoning. Other fish, however, have been implicated in scombroid fish poisoning, and include mahi mahi, bluefish, marlin, and escolar. When susceptible fish are not promptly and continuously refrigerated, bacteria can metabolize naturally occurring histamine to produce scombrotoxin, which consists of histamine and other amines. The presence of 50 ppm or more histamine in fish is indicative of decomposition whether or not there is gross evidence of spoilage, such as bad odor. When illness results from consumption, histamine levels in implicated fish have commonly been at least 200 ppm and often greater than 500 ppm. Histamine is heat resistant and can therefore cause illness even when fish is properly canned or cooked thoroughly. While some contaminated fish will not show any outward signs of spoilage, others will show such signs as a bad odor. Cooked fish that has spoiled may have a "honey-combed" appearance. - Mod.TG
