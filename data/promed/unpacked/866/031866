Warning from environmental health as blue-green algae is discovered
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Environmental Health has received notification from SEPA [Scottish Environment Protection Agency] that there is blue-green algae in the Lunnister Loch, Sullom and Spiggie Loch, Dunrossness. Blue-green algae has also been found in Tingwall Loch, which runs into Asta Loch and Clickimin Loch.

The council says notices will be posted next to the lochs warning that contact with algal scum should be avoided. Adjoining landowners have been advised of the situation, as well as the anglers' association, RSPB [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds], and the NHS [National Health Service] Shetland.

At this stage, the SIC [Shetland Islands Council] says there is no adverse effect on water supplies.
