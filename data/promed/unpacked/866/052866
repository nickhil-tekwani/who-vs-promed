- Olympic Games. 28 May 2018. (reported) Based on current assessment, cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics will not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus. Brazil is 1 of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice.

[More than 100 medical experts, academia and scientists on Friday, 27 May 2016, have called for the Rio Olympic Games to be postponed or moved because of fears that the event could speed up the spread of the Zika virus around the world. This position runs counter to that of the WHO (see above) and of Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who declared on Thursday (26 May 2016) that there was no public health reason to cancel or delay this summer's Games (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sport-olympics-zika-idUSKCN0YI2CA). - Mod.TY]

[2] Ocular pathology

Homero Augusto de Miranda II, MD, Marcelo Cavalcante Costa, MD, Maria Auxiliadora Monteiro Frazão, MD, Natália Simão, MD, Sandra Franchischini, MD, Darius M. Moshfeghi, MD. Expanded Spectrum of Congenital Ocular Findings in Microcephaly with Presumed Zika Infection.

Purpose
To describe the ocular findings of 3 cases of suspected congenital Zika viral infection with microcephaly and maculopathy.

Design
Retrospective, consecutive case series.

Participants
3 male infants born in northern Brazil whose mothers demonstrated a viral syndrome during the 1st trimester and who subsequently were born with microcephaly.

Methods
Observational report of macular findings.

Main Outcome Measures
Continued observation.

Results
3 male infants were born with microcephaly to mothers who had a viral syndrome during the 1st trimester of gestation in an area that subsequently has demonstrated epidemic Zika infection, a flavivirus related to dengue. Ocular examination was performed. All 6 eyes demonstrated a pigmentary maculopathy ranging from mild to pronounced. In 4 eyes, well-delineated macular chorioretinal atrophy with a hyperpigmented ring developed. 3 eyes demonstrated vascular tortuosity and 2 eyes demonstrated a pronounced early termination of the retinal vasculature on photographic evaluation. 2 eyes demonstrated a washed out peripheral retina with a hypolucent spot. One eye had scattered subretinal hemorrhages external to the macula. Finally, one eye demonstrated peripheral pigmentary changes and clustered atrophic lesions resembling grouped congenital albinotic spots (polar bear tracks).

Conclusions
Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly in children of mothers with a viral syndrome during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Ocular findings previously described a pigmentary retinopathy and atrophy that now can be expanded to include torpedo maculopathy, vascular changes, and hemorrhagic retinopathy. Ophthalmologic screening guidelines need to be defined to determine which children would benefit from newborn screening in affected regions.

[The case for Zika virus etiology would have been stronger if there was virological or serological evidence of Zika virus infection of the mothers. One hopes that these 3 retrospective cases will elicit development of the ophthalmologic screening that the authors call for, and more complete eye examinations of infants with microcephaly and infants born to mothers who had been infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. - Mod.TY]

[3] ELISA diagnostics

Van Esbroeck M, Meersman K, Michiels J, Ariën KK, Van den Bossche D. Letter to the editor: Specificity of Zika virus ELISA: interference with malaria.

We evaluated the specificity of this test on convalescent samples of 10 PCR-confirmed dengue patients (n = 3 DENV-1, n = 4 DENV-2, n = 2 DENV-3 and n = 1 DENV-4) with high IgM antibody ratios and a positive (n = 9) or negative (n = 1) result for IgG antibodies. We also tested the assay on 10 samples with high titres of neutralising antibodies against yellow fever virus and on 5 samples positive for rheumatoid factor. Except for one borderline result (ratio between 0.8 and 1.1) of ZIKV IgM in the convalescent sample from a patient infected with DENV-1 after a stay in Thailand, all results for ZIKV IgM and IgG were negative.

However, when we tested samples from malaria patients with a current infection (thick smear and PCR-positive) with _Plasmodium falciparum_ (n = 12), _P. falciparum_/_P. ovale_ (n = 1), _P. vivax_ (n = 3), _P. ovale_ (n = 5) or _P. malariae_ (n = 5), or a recently treated _P. falciparum_ infection (microscopy-negative, PCR-positive) (n = 8), 14 of these 34 samples tested positive or borderline for ZIKV IgM, IgG or both. Positive or borderline results for both ZIKV IgM and IgG were registered in 2 of 13 samples from patients with a current infection with _P. falciparum_ (including the patient with the mixed _P. falciparum_/_P. ovale_ infection) and in one of 8 samples from patients with a recently treated _P. falciparum_ infection. 9 samples tested positive or borderline for ZIKV IgM only: 4 from patients with a current _P. falciparum_, 2 each from patients with a _P. vivax_ and recently treated _P. falciparum_ infection, and one from a patient with a _P. malariae_ infection. Finally, one of 13 samples from patients with a current _P. falciparum_ infection and one of 5 samples from patients with a _P. ovale_ infection tested positive for ZIKV IgG only.

Virus neutralisation tests could not demonstrate a ZIKV infection in 11 of the 14 samples with positive or borderline results. Notably, we confirmed a recent ZIKV infection in one patient with a recently treated _P. falciparum_ infection who had travelled in several African countries in the 1st half of 2015 and most recently in Cameroon (ZIKV IgM and IgG ratios in the ELISA were 2.61 and 7.50 respectively). The results from 2 patients with _P. ovale_ (ZikV IgG ratio: 1.84) and _P. vivax_ (ZIKV IgM ratio: 0.87) infection were not conclusive. The samples from patients with a current or recently treated _P. falciparum_ infection with false positive ZIKV ELISA results showed ratios between 1.10 and 6.93 for ZIKV IgM and between 0.92 and 7.02 for IgG. One sample from a patient with a _P. vivax_ infection tested borderline for ZIKV IgM. The ELISA ratio for ZIKV IgM in the sample from the patient with a _P. malariae_ infection was 1.10.

False [Zika ELISA] positive results were not correlated with parasite densities.

[A rapid, specific diagnostic test is important for Zika virus infections, given the clinical similarity of dengue and chikungunya symptoms. This has become more urgent given the fetal neurological damage that can occur when pregnant women are infected with Zika virus. The above study points to the risk of malaria as a cause of false positive results of tests for Zika virus infections, and malaria should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results of the ELISA test the authors used in their study. - Mod.TY]

Highlights
- Zika virus (ZIKV) infects and replicates in primary human placental macrophages
- ZIKV also infects human placental cytotrophoblasts, but with delayed replication kinetics
- ZIKV replication coincides with IFN and antiviral gene induction, but minimal cell death

Summary
The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has been directly linked to increased cases of microcephaly in newborns. Current evidence indicates that ZIKV is transmitted vertically from mother to fetus. However, the mechanism of intrauterine transmission and the cell types involved remain unknown. We demonstrate that the contemporary ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (PR 2015) infects and replicates in primary human placental macrophages, called Hofbauer cells, and to a lesser extent in cytotrophoblasts, isolated from villous tissue of full-term placentae. Viral replication coincides with induction of type I interferon (IFN), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral gene expression, but with minimal cell death. Our results suggest a mechanism for intrauterine transmission in which ZIKV gains access to the fetal compartment by directly infecting placental cells and disrupting the placental barrier.
