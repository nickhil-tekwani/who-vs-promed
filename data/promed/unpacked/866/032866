[1] Booster dose
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021

Federal regulators are likely to approve a 3rd COVID-19 shot for vaccinated adults starting at least 6 months after the 2nd dose rather than the 8-month gap they previously announced, a person familiar with the plans said, as the Biden administration steps up preparations for delivering boosters to the public.

Data from vaccine manufacturers and other countries under review by the Food and Drug Administration is based on boosters being given at 6 months, the person said. The person said approval for boosters for all 3 COVID-19 shots being administered in the US -- those manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson & Johnson -- is expected in mid-September [2021].

A White House spokesman declined to comment. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on interactions with vaccine manufacturers.

Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday [25 Aug 2021] that they had asked US health regulators to authorize boosters of their COVID-19 vaccine and submitted additional data showing a 3rd dose improves protection against the virus. The FDA granted full approval to the vaccine on Monday [23 Aug 2021]. Biden administration officials have said they hope full approval will encourage more people to get vaccinated, pushing up inoculation rates that recently climbed past 60% of the eligible US population.

Pfizer said it couldn't comment on potential regulatory decisions. Moderna said Wednesday [25 Aug 2021] that it had completed filing for full approval of its vaccine, which uses similar mRNA technology as the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Full approval of Moderna's vaccine is expected in about 3 months, the person familiar with the matter said. Johnson & Johnson has said it plans to file for approval later this year [2021].

Federal officials last week recommended that adults who received a 2-dose regimen of mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer's begin receiving booster shots in September [2021]. Officials said at the time that the shots would be administered about 8 months after the 2nd dose for people ages 18 and older. Boosters will be administered at the 80 000 pharmacies and other vaccination sites operating across the US.

The effort hinges on FDA clearance of the additional shots, and a recommendation by a vaccine advisory committee of outside experts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health authorities already have authorized booster shots for people 12 years old and above whose immune systems are compromised. People 65 and older and individuals in chronic-care facilities are expected to get boosters first, along with health workers and anyone else who was vaccinated earliest, according to federal health officials.

Some public-health experts have said boosters aren't necessary based on data that shows ongoing protection against hospitalizations and death from the initial round of shots. Vin Gupta, health adviser to the Biden administration's postelection transition team, said he believes boosters should be reserved for people with compromised immune systems, older people, and people with comorbidities such as diabetes. "I don't think there's any compelling data for boosters for everyone at 8 months," Dr. Gupta said.

Leana Wen, health policy professor at George Washington University, said approving boosters starting at 6 months after a previous dose makes sense based on available data on waning immunity. "That doesn't mean every patient needs to get a booster at 6 months," she said.

Studies indicate the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is still highly effective in people 6 months after their 2nd dose. Yet there is some evidence its efficacy might diminish over longer periods, and the shot isn't as effective against the contagious delta variant, prompting research into adding a 3rd dose.

Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday [25 Aug 2021] that the 3rd dose generated a stronger immune system against the original COVID-19 strain compared with the original 2-dose course.

The submission includes data from a late-stage trial of 306 subjects between 18 and 55 years who received a 3rd dose between 4.8 and 8 months after completing the 2-dose course of vaccination, Pfizer said. Neutralizing antibodies -- which play a key role in the immune system -- were more than 3 times as much when measured one month after the 3rd dose, compared with one month after the 2nd dose.

The administration of a 3rd dose also appeared safe in the trial, the companies said.

The companies didn't say whether the data included how well a booster shot worked against the contagious delta variant. However, the companies earlier this month [August 2021] had submitted to regulators separate results from a small, early-stage study showing a 3rd dose of their vaccine generated higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original virus and against the beta and delta variants than the standard 2-dose regimen.

Other vaccine makers also are studying whether booster doses could help maintain protection against the virus. On Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], Johnson & Johnson said that a 2nd dose of its vaccine was found in a study to generate a strong immune response, justifying a booster shot.

[2] New York: increased number of deaths
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QYET7A3V2801


Delivering another blow to what's left of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's legacy, New York's new governor acknowledged on her 1st day in office that the state has had nearly 12 000 more deaths from COVID-19 than Cuomo told the public.

"The public deserves a clear, honest picture of what's happening. And that's whether it's good or bad, they need to know the truth. And that's how we restore confidence," Gov. Kathy Hochul said on NPR.

In its 1st daily update on the outbreak Tuesday evening [24 Aug 2021], Hochul's office reported that nearly 55 400 people have died of the coronavirus in New York based on death certificate data submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That's up from about 43 400 that Cuomo reported to the public as of Monday [23 Aug 2021], his last day in office. The Democrat who was once widely acclaimed for his leadership during the COVID-19 outbreak resigned in the face of an impeachment drive after being accused of sexually harassing at least 11 women, allegations he disputed. The higher number is not entirely new. Federal health officials and some academic institutions tracking COVID-19 deaths in the US have been using the higher tally for many months because of known gaps in the data Cuomo had been choosing to publicize.

But Hochul, who was lieutenant governor before being propelled to the state's highest office, said it is vital to be fully transparent about the numbers. "There's a lot of things that weren't happening, and I'm going to make them happen," she said Wednesday [25 Aug 2021] on MSNBC. "Transparency will be the hallmark of my administration."

Cuomo's lawyer, Rita Glavin, and his campaign staff did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Associated Press first reported in July [2021] on the large discrepancy between the figures publicized by the Cuomo administration and numbers the state was reporting to the CDC. The count used by Cuomo in his news media briefings and on the state's COVID-19 fatality tracker included only laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths reported through a state system that collects data from hospitals, nursing homes, and adult care facilities. That meant the tally excluded people who died at home, in hospice, in prisons, or at state-run homes for people with disabilities. It also excluded people who probably died of COVID-19 but never got a positive test to confirm the diagnosis. "There are presumed and confirmed deaths. People should know both," Hochul said. By Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], the state's website included the higher tally.

During the spring of 2020, when New York was the deadliest hot spot in the US, Cuomo emerged in the eyes of many Americans as a hero of the pandemic for his daily PowerPoint briefings and stern but reassuring language. He won an international Emmy and wrote a book on leadership in a crisis. But Cuomo's critics long charged that he was manipulating coronavirus statistics to burnish his image. Months later, it turned out that his administration had minimized the death toll among nursing home residents by excluding several thousand who had succumbed after being transferred to hospitals. Cuomo used those lower numbers last year [2020] to erroneously claim that New York was seeing a much smaller percentage of nursing home residents dying of COVID-19 than other states.

Federal prosecutors have been investigating his administration's handling of the data. The state Assembly Judiciary committee has also been investigating the matter. This week, in the wake of the sexual harassment scandal, Cuomo's Emmy was revoked. And the publisher of his book has said it will no longer print hardcover copies and will not come out with a paperback edition.

[3] WHO: global plateau in cases
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/who-sees-signs-global-covid-19-plateau


After a steady rise for nearly 2 months, the pace of the world's COVID-19 cases seems to be plateauing, though levels continue to rise in the Western Pacific and Americas regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest pandemic snapshot.

Also, an American intelligence probe into the source of SARS-CoV-2, presented to President Biden yesterday, was inconclusive, while authors of a report that detailed the WHO's joint mission to China warned that the window is closing for key studies on the virus origin [read https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/science/lab-leak-covid.html and https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/embattled-who-virus-origins-team-says-window-closing-for-probe]

The world reported 4.5 million cases last week, showing signs of stabilization, the WHO said in its situation report. However, cases in the Western Pacific region rose 20%, led by increases in places like Japan and the Philippines, while infections in the Americas, fueled by surges in the United States and other countries, increased by 8% [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---24-august-2021].

Globally, deaths stayed the same as last week, with 68 000 more fatalities reported. However, levels rose in the Europe and Americas region.

At a WHO media briefing today, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, warned that though stable, cases are still at a very high level, with the situation varying by region, country, province, and even town.

"As long as this virus is circulating anywhere, it's a threat everywhere," he said.

"There are no shortcuts. WHO continues to recommend a comprehensive, risk-based approach of proven public health and social measures, in combination with equitable vaccination."

The 5 countries that reported the most cases last week are the United States, Iran, India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Few countries reported large increases for the week, though cases were up 34% in Japan and 25% in the Philippines.

7 more countries reported their first detections of the highly transmissible delta (1617.2) variant, raising the total to 163.

At a briefing today, officials from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said the United States, Mexico, and Brazil continue to report high case numbers, with levels rising in parts of Central America and the Caribbean region.

They added that though hospitalizations in South American countries are dropping, cases are still high and that countries should stay on top of new outbreaks.

Officials said vaccination is the weak spot of the Americas response, with only 3% fully vaccinated in Guatemala and just over 4% immunized in Jamaica. Vaccination in Haiti has been delayed in the aftermath of Haiti's natural disasters.

Meanwhile, the WHO's African regional office said in its latest weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report that cases have declined for the 6th week in a row in its 3rd wave, which started in the middle of May [2021]. However, weekly cases were up by 20% or more in 16 countries. Vaccine supply is improving, with immunizations nearly tripling since June.

A 90-day US intelligence investigation into the source of SARS-CoV-2 ordered by President Biden in May [2021], due yesterday, yielded inconclusive results, sources familiar with the report told the Washington Post. The intelligence community is taking steps to declassify parts of the report for possible public release.

In March [2021], an international joint mission to China that was led by the WHO didn't rule out a lab source, but said a jump from an intermediate host to a human was the most likely scenario. However, suspicions have swirled around a possible lab leak in Wuhan, mainly fueled by political tensions. China has denied the lab leak theories, with some Chinese officials pushing a narrative that a leak at an Army infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland, is the source.

The WHO has been caught in the crossfire over the virus source, fending off charges that it has been too deferential to China, but also facing pushback from China after asking for more raw data and stored blood samples to review. China has also rejected a WHO outline for a 2nd phase of study into the virus source.

In a related development, the authors of the WHO China joint mission said today in a report to Nature that the search for the origin is at a "critical juncture," with the window rapidly closing on the biological feasibility of conducting critical trace-back studies on people and animals.

Authors of the March [2021] WHO report into how COVID-19 emerged warn that further delay makes crucial inquiry biologically difficult [Koopmans M, Daszak P, Dedkov VG et al. Origins of SARS-CoV-2: window is closing for key scientific studies. Nature 25 Aug 2021].

"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies wane, so collecting further samples and testing people who might have been exposed before December 2019 will yield diminishing returns," they wrote, adding that wildlife farms that supplied cities across China, including Wuhan, are now closed and animals have been culled, making any spillover evidence hard to find.

While praising a recent WHO announcement about the formation of an expert committee to oversee future origin investigations, they raised concerns that the new process risks adding several months of delay. And they called on the science community to join forces to expedite the phase 2 study areas they outlined while there is still time.

WHO officials today said setting up the new group won't delay progress on the studies, which it has been advocating for months. Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, said the expert group's formation is moving ahead swiftly and that the terms of reference, timelines, and expectations have already been made public.
