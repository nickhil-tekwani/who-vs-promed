The Western Regional Health Directorate had recorded one death among the 25 confirmed cases of the cholera disease within the region. So far, a total of 87 suspected cases had been recorded since the 1st case on 27 Jul 2014. Mr. Francis Anliah, Regional Disease Control Officer, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that the cases were recorded from Ellembelle, Shama, Wassa East, Tarkwa, Axim and Sekondi/Takoradi and said operators of districts facilities have been schooled to do surveillance in controlling the spread of the disease.

He added that the Health Directorate was also carrying out awareness creation and community durbars [formal meetings] to educate Ghanaians on the need for a clean and healthy environment. The Disease Control Officer said the hospitals were up to the task of containing the spread but entreated the public to limit hand shaking and ensure that they properly washed their hands with soap and water.

Two out of the 3 cholera patients admitted to Lukanga Clinic have been discharged. Central Province Deputy Permanent Secretary Ronald Sinyangwe said health personnel were working round the clock to ensure that no new cases were recorded.

Mr Sinyangwe disclosed that as of Mon 8 Sep 2014, only one patient was still admitted to the cholera centre and was responding well to treatment. He said more health personnel and fishery officers had been sent to the area to help establish the source of the epidemic.

Mr Sinyangwe added that the government was doing everything possible to ensure that the disease was contained. He said health personnel were carrying out sensitization campaigns in the area as well as distributing chlorine. "Everything is been done to ensure that the outbreak is contained; the health personnel are distributing chlorine and educating the residents on prevention of the disease," Mr Sinyangwe said.

Mr Sinyangwe has since called on the residents to ensure that they treat their drinking water as a preventive measure. Last week, 2 people died of cholera in the area.

[3] Cholera - India (Odisha State)

Three persons died of suspected cholera in the last 24 hours in Bargarh's Attabira block. The deceased were adults from Mirdhapara village. They died within a span of a few hours on Wed 10 Sep 2014.

A team of doctors has been camping in the village since Wed 10 Sep 2014. The team collected blood samples of patients, including those of the deceased, to ascertain the disease. The doctors also collected water samples from the village.

Locals alleged the disease broke out at Attabira for lack of awareness among the people about hygiene. "The situation is under control, and there is no need to panic," said CDMO (Bargarh) Prakash Pradhan.

He said the 3 deceased are from 2 families. "From this angle, we cannot term it as an epidemic. However, bleaching powder is being sprinkled, and tubewells and drains are being disinfected as a precautionary measure," said Pradhan.
