Hong Kong health officials continue their investigation into a cluster of _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex infection linked to Kam's KS-MED solution for wound care.

To date, a total of 181 patients were known to be affected; many are renal patients. Officials report prepacked aqueous chlorhexidine product tested positive for _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex by the Hospital Authority.

Based on the findings, health officials urge members of the public not to use the product, which is available for sale in shops in some hospitals, local shops, and pharmacies for wound care.

"Members of the public, especially those who have a weakened immune system, such as renal patients, should pay extra attention to personal hygiene. Antiseptic products not indicated for wound care should not be used for that purpose or on broken skin. The public should also follow the instructions given by healthcare professionals on wound care and should seek medical advice if in doubt," a spokesman for the Department of Health said.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), _B. cepacia_ poses the greatest threat to hospitalized patients, critically ill patients, and people with health problems such as weakened immune systems and chronic lung diseases. The symptoms of _B. cepacia_ infections vary widely from none to serious respiratory infections. It can spread from person-to-person by direct contact and is often resistant to common antibiotics.

[_Burkholderia cepacia_ complex (BCC) is a group of related, non-lactose fermenting, Gram-negative bacterial species that, in individuals with impaired host defenses, is pathogenic and can cause life-threatening infections (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180). BCC infections include respiratory tract infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis, bacteremia in the presence of an infected indwelling intravascular catheter or contaminated intravenous fluids, skin and soft-tissue infections, surgical-wound infections, and urinary tract infections (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/outbreak-of-burkholderia-cepacia-bacteremia-caused-by-contaminated-chlorhexidine-in-a-hemodialysis-unit/85154B587466D8DD5BFC9F9971CDF95E and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272638600701636). In one of these outbreaks in a hemodialysis center, BCC infection was due to contaminated water used to dilute the chlorhexidine solution that was used for disinfection of skin prior to catheter insertion and during follow-up care.

BCC is resistant to many antiseptics and disinfectants and can contaminate antiseptic solutions, such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products, and is known to survive in these antiseptics and disinfectants (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794566).

Chlorhexidine is a positively charged, membrane-active agent that binds to and disrupts bacterial cell membrane function. Biofilm formation is thought to be one of the factors that accounts for the survival of BCC in chlorhexidine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3088199/).

BCC is also usually resistant to aminoglycosides, 1st- and 2nd-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin and ticarcillin, and polymyxin B (http://www.antimicrobe.org/b19.asp). BCC is often susceptible to trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), cefepime, meropenem, and minocycline, and has varying susceptibility to tigecycline and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.ML
