The Centers for Disease Control [CDC] says a multistate outbreak of E. coli has sickened 7 people, sending 5 to the hospital adding on 24 Sep 2016 that the outbreak of _E. coli_, which can cause intestinal illnesses, likely is linked to beef products from Adams Farms Slaughterhouse in Athol, Massachusetts.

People from 1 year old to 74 years old have become sick. They're from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. No deaths have been reported.

The CDC says 5 people who were interviewed said they'd eaten ground beef in the week before getting sick and that tests conducted in Connecticut on leftover ground beef from an ill person's home and a restaurant found _E. coli_. The CDC says Adams Farm Slaughterhouse on Sat 24 Sep 2016, recalled various cuts of beef, veal and bison products.

CDC is collaborating with public health and regulatory officials in multiple states and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 (EHEC O157:H7) infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on EHEC bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. In this outbreak, the outbreak strain was defined by PFGE.

A total of 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O157:H7 have been reported from 4 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is:

State / Case Count
------------------
Connecticut / 2
Massachusetts / 3
Pennsylvania / 1
West Virginia / 1

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 27 Jun 2016 to 4 Sep 2016. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 74, with a median age of 25. A total of 57 percent of ill people are female. Up to 5 ill people have been hospitalized. No one has developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory evidence indicate that beef products produced by Adams Farm Slaughterhouse in Athol, Massachusetts are a likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. All 5 (100 percent) of the 5 people reached for interview reported eating ground beef in the week before they became ill. Preliminary traceback information indicates that ill people ate ground beef which had been produced by Adams Farm Slaughterhouse.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health collected leftover ground beef from an ill person's home and from a restaurant for testing; that beef had been produced by Adams Farm Slaughterhouse. Test results showed the outbreak strain of EHEC O157:H7 in both samples of the leftover ground beef.

On 24 Sep 2016, Adams Farm Slaughterhouse recalled various cuts of beef, veal, and bison products due to possible _E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination. The products originated from animals slaughtered on 15, 25, and 27 Jul 2016 and 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 24 and 26 Aug 2016, and further processed and packed on various dates between 21 Jul 2016, and 22 Sep 2016. These items were shipped to farmer's markets, retail locations, and restaurants in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and eastern New York. The products may have been shipped to neighboring states. The products subject to recall have establishment number EST. 5497 inside the USDA mark of inspection and include several lot numbers and cuts of meat. The full list can be found on the USDA website.

This investigation is ongoing, and we will update the public when more information becomes available. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview those people about foods they ate before they got sick.
