Outbreak of tomato spotted wilt in Massachusetts tomato crop [edited]
[An] ... outbreak of Tomato spotted wilt [tospo]virus (TSWV) [has been
reported] in [a greenhouse tomato crop] in eastern Massachusetts. [The
causal virus was identified as TSWV using] immunostrips ... (Agdia, Inc.);
[tests for Iris necrotic spot tospovirus (INSV) were negative.]
The planting had about 40 000 plants, [containing] 5 or 6 cultivars.
[Disease] incidence varied from 18 to 50 [percent], depending on cultivar.
The highest incidence of disease occurred in the open pollinated cultivars
'Gold Nugget', 'Yellow Pear' and 'Washington Cherry'. [The] source of [TSWV
is] ... not clear but [the] greenhouse also contained hanging baskets of
_Diascia_, _Portulacca_, _Baucopa_ and _Monopsis_ ... that appeared very
healthy. ... No thrips were evident in the greenhouse. Symptoms occurred in
tomato plants about 3 weeks after planting.

[This is the third reported outbreak of tomato spotted wilt disease in
tomato in the eastern United States this year, the others being in Virginia
and North Carolina. Greenhouse operations require very strict monitoring for
the presence of the thrips vector followed by appropriate control measures.
Many thanks to Rob Wick for reporting this outbreak. - Mod.DH]
