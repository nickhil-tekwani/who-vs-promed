Since the beginning of 2007, the Health Protection Agency (HPA)
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) has reported on 51 human
isolates of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype] Senftenberg in England
and Wales. This represents a significant rise compared to fewer than
10 in the same time period in 2006 and 2005. Of the 51 isolates, 35
(69 percent) have been received since 8 Apr 2007 (Week 15).
Fresh basil, sampled in May 2007 as part of a United Kingdom wide
survey of fresh herbs on retail sale, was found to be contaminated
with _S._ Senftenberg. The HPA launched microbiological and
epidemiological investigations to elucidate the causes of this
outbreak.
Molecular microbiology
All presumptive isolates of _S._ Senftenberg were confirmed by the
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens and were further examined using
plasmid profiling and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The
strains of _S._ Senftenberg found on the basil samples and
predominating human infections in England and Wales since week 15 had
the PFGE profile of SSFTXB.0014.
Epidemiology
For the purpose of investigating this outbreak, a case was defined as
a resident of England and Wales infected with a confirmed or
provisionally confirmed isolate of fully sensitive _S._ Senftenberg
received by LEP on or after 8 Apr 2007. Cases reporting foreign
travel or close contact with a person with gastrointestinal disease
symptoms in the 5 days prior to the onset of disease were excluded
from this definition.
A total of 30 patients reported from all HPA regions in England and
Wales, fulfilling the case definition. Dates of onset of illness were
available for 23 cases, ranging from 5 Mar to 12 May 2007 (Figure 1,
for figures see original URL - Mod.LL]). Females (60 percent) were
overrepresented compared to males (40 percent). Most of the cases
were adults (Figure 2).
PFGE results are available for 29 of the 30 primary cases. With the
exception of a single isolate, all are the outbreak strain. The
non-outbreak strain isolate was isolated from a 3 month old infant
with a diet restricted to formula milk.
A total of 30 cases were admitted to hospital as a result of their
infections. Another 4 reported serious underlying illnesses and
antimicrobial treatment and were admitted to a hospital but not as a
result of their infection. To date, 3 of the hospitalized patients
are known to have recovered and 2 of them have been interviewed. For
one, exposure was likely to have occurred prior to hospital admission
and for the other, the diet was extremely restricted but may have
included food purchased outside the hospital. A single patient died
but this is not thought to be as a result of salmonellosis.
In Scotland, 3 cases were reported in Apr 2007, all of which shared
the same plasmid and PFGE profile as the cases in England and Wales.
One of these patients reported travel to Tenerife.
Altogether, 20 out of 30 cases in England and Wales were interviewed
using a standardized questionnaire. Basil consumption was not
reported frequently. Consumption of poultry, eggs, milk cheeses,
desserts, salads, fruits and confectionery were reported by 60
percent or more of the cases however, no particular food product was
identified. A total of 30 percent of the interviewees reported having
consumed fresh herbs in the 3 days before the onset of illness; 40
percent reported consumption of bagged salad.
In addition, 5 travel-associated cases of _S._ Senftenberg have been
identified in England and Wales. One patient who reported visiting
Morocco presented with the same outbreak strain. Of the remaining
travel-associated cases, 3 isolates were distinct from the outbreak
strain and the result for one is pending.
Food microbiology
A UK study of the microbiological quality of retail fresh herbs
carried out by the HPA Centre for Infections (CfI), the HPA Regional
Microbiology Network (RMN) and the Local Authorities Coordinators of
Regulatory Services (LACORS) commenced in May 2007. To date, 7
samples of pre-packed fresh basil, grown in Israel, have tested
positive for _S._ Senftenberg by HPA Regional Microbiology Network
Food, Water and Environmental Laboratories in Newcastle, London,
Bristol, and a NPHS-Wales Microbiology laboratory in Carmarthen.
In addition, fresh basil purchased from a supermarket in the Shetland
Islands which was the subject of a customer complaint was also found
to be contaminated with the outbreak strain of _S._ Senftenberg.
International dimension
On 25 May 2007, an enquiry was sent to Enter-net (the international
surveillance network for the enteric infections Salmonella, VTEC O157
and Campylobacter ? see
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>), asking whether
other countries had observed cases or products with the same
characteristics.
An increase in cases of _S._ Senftenberg was reported from Denmark,
with a total of 11 cases in 2007 compared to none in the first 6
months of 2006. The PFGE profiles for 3 of these cases matched those
of the UK cases. Of these, 2 reported that their exposure probably
occurred while visiting the USA, Poland or the UK.
Two cases of _S._ Senftenberg infection were reported in the
Netherlands in January and 3 in May 2007. Of these 5 cases, 2 matched
with the outbreak profile. One patient diagnosed in May 2007 reported
eating a mixed pasta salad, possibly mixed with fresh basil in the
week before symptom onset. The other case matching the
outbreak-strain was diagnosed early in January 2007 and is awaiting
interview.
The USA also reported recent human isolates of _S._ Senftenberg with
the same PFGE profile as the outbreak strain and are conducting an
investigation. Cases of _S._ Senftenberg have also been reported in
Israel, and are currently under investigation.
Action
The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a public statement on 25
May 2007 warning consumers not to eat basil from the same batches
that were found to be contaminated at the time (1) and this was
accompanied by a withdrawal of potentially affected product from the
shelves of 3 UK supermarket chains. An information notice was posted
on the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) operated by the
European Commission on 25 May 2007 and updated on 1 June. A Health
Protection Report on the investigation was published on 1 June 2007
(2) and information on the outbreak was posted on the EU Early
Warning and Response System on 1 June 2007. Investigations by the FSA
and the UK retailers are ongoing [3].
Discussion
The production of ready-to-eat vegetables on sale in the UK and
elsewhere is closely controlled using the principles of Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), together with good
practice industry guides, which places less emphasis on end-product
testing. However, this incident highlights the role of targeted
microbiological food surveillance in identifying food safety
incidents thus providing an opportunity to review and inform HACCP
procedures. In addition, the use of analytical epidemiology in
isolation to investigate outbreaks such as these may be restricted by
the number of people affected, complex distribution of products
through different outlets or the widespread use of a contaminated
product as an ingredient in a variety of foods which inevitably
affects recall.
Our investigations have confirmed that _S._ Senftenberg of an
indistinguishable plasmid and PFGE profile has been identified from
fresh basil grown in Israel and from human infections in the UK and
Scotland as well as in individuals who report travel to Tenerife and
Morocco. _S._ Senftenberg with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern has
been reported by Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA. A combination
of food surveillance, molecular microbiology and epidemiology
communicated through established national and international networks
means that information has been gathered quickly and communicated
effectively.
