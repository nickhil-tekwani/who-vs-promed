The authorities are calling for vigilance regarding leptospirosis, as the risk of an outbreak is significant because of the rainy season. 6 cases have been reported since early January [2015]. 2 teenagers are currently hospitalized at Taaone [Tahiti].

Last year [2014], leptospirosis affected 129 people and killed 2.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Tahiti, which is located within the Society Islands in the South Pacific Ocean, is the largest and most populous (population 183 645 inhabitants in 2012) island of French Polynesia, where its capital, Papeete, is located (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti). Tahiti is the economic, cultural, and political center of French Polynesia. The urban area of Papeete had a total population of 133 627 inhabitants in 2012 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papeete).

Tahiti is referred to as a "high island", that is, an island of volcanic origin with high mountains, valleys, and rivers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_island). November to April is the wet season, the wettest month of which is January with 13.2 in (340 mm) of rain in Papeete (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti#Climate). Heavy rains in January in Tahiti have caused flooding (http://www.ladepeche.pf/Des-inondations-avenue-du-Prince-Hinoi_a2737.html and (http://world.einnews.com/article__detail/245091179?lcode=JzLZ6DjktQZbiDy1MPCY3Q%3D%3D). - Mod.ML
