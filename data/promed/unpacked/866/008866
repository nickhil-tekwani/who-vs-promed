Regional update, pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-------------------------------------
The information contained within this update is obtained from data
provided by Ministries of Health of Member States and National
Influenza Centers through reports sent to Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) or updates on their Web pages.

Weekly Summary
---------------------
- This week, El Salvador reported an increasing trend in acute
respiratory disease, high intensity and moderate impact of acute
respiratory disease on health care services.

- Influenza activity remains low in the southern cone of South
America and in North America.

- Influenza activity remains moderate in some countries in Central
America, the Caribbean, and Andean countries. The type and subytpes
circulating in each country differ.

- In the Southern Cone, the predominant virus circulating is RSV
[respiratory syncytial virus]; in Central America, the Caribbean, and
the Andean countries, there is a mixed pattern of circulation

- One new confirmed death was reported this week; in total there have
been 8533 cumulative confirmed deaths in 28 countries of the Region

I - Evolution of the pandemic
-----------------------------
South America
-------------
- Southern Cone
Influenza activity was reported as regional in Brazil and with no
activity in Uruguay. In both countries, the trends in acute
respiratory disease were reported as unchanged.

In Epidemiologic Week (EW) 28, Paraguay reported a decrease of 6.5
percent in influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient consultations as
compared to the previous EW, which is about half of what was observed
during the same period in 2009. Severe acute respiratory infection
(SARI) activity in children under 5 years of age remained within the
range of what is expected for this time of year. Paraguay reported
predominant circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV);
additionally, since EW 21, counts of pandemic influenza have been
increasing and influenza type B was detected between EW 25-27.

- Andean
In EW 29, influenza activity was reported as regional in Peru,
localized in Venezuela, and with no activity in Ecuador. All these
countries reported decreasing or unchanged trends in acute respiratory disease.

Peru, in EW 28, nationally, reported low influenza activity; at the
regional level, 20 of 24 departments reported no influenza activity.
However, 13 of 24 departments reported increasing trends of acute
respiratory disease.

Colombia continues to report a predominance of pandemic influenza and
some seasonal influenza A/H3 activity.

Central America
---------------
Influenza activity was reported as localized in El Salvador and
regional in Honduras and Panama. El Salvador reported an increasing
trend in acute respiratory disease for the third consecutive week,
while Honduras and Panama reported decreasing trends this week. All
these countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health care
services, except El Salvador, which reported high intensity and
moderate impact of acute respiratory disease on health care services.
El Salvador, in EW 28, reported an increase in acute respiratory
illness (ARI) cases compared to the previous week, especially in the
regions of La Paz, San Salvador, La Union and La Libertad, with high
rates in children < 5 years of age.

In Panama, in EW 29 at the national level, ILI activity continues to
decrease. Regionally, however, 7 of 14 regions are still above their
epidemic thresholds of ILI activity, but overall trend is decreasing.

Circulation of respiratory viruses is variable in Central America.
Costa Rica, during EWs 25-28, reported an increase in the number of
seasonal influenza A/H3 virus, and continued predominance of RSV. In
EW 29, El Salvador reported the predominant circulation of seasonal
influenza A/H3 and RSV, and few cases of influenza B and pandemic
influenza. Nicaragua reported the circulation of influenza B virus,
seasonal influenza A/H3, and RSV. Panama reported that the
predominant respiratory virus circulating is the seasonal influenza
virus A/H3. Honduras has not isolated pandemic influenza virus since
EW 24; and currently, the predominant respiratory virus is the
seasonal influenza virus (influenza A/H3), with only a small percentage of RSV.

Caribbean
---------
Influenza activity was reported as widespread in Jamaica, regional in
Cuba and with no activity in Dominica, Dominican Republic and St.
Lucia. Trends of acute respiratory disease were reported as unchanged
in Dominican Republic, Jamaica and St. Lucia; and decreasing in Cuba
and Dominica. All countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute
respiratory disease, and low impact of acute respiratory disease on
health care services.

The circulation of respiratory viruses is variable in the Caribbean.
CAREC* reported the predominance of influenza B virus since EW 18,
but RSV and pandemic influenza have also been reported. Cuba reported
the predominance of influenza A virus among circulating respiratory
viruses, of which pandemic influenza was the most common subtype;
additionally, other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza, adenovirus
and RSV) continue to circulate. Dominican Republic reported a higher
percentage of influenza viruses among positive samples, compared to
previous weeks, especially seasonal influenza (influenza A/H3) in
addition to the ongoing circulation of adenovirus and parainfluenza
virus. (*Participating CAREC member countries, which include,
Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and
Trinidad and Tobago, were assessed together.

North America
-------------
Influenza activity remains low in this region. The trends in acute
respiratory disease were reported as unchanged in the United States.
In the United States in EW 29, the proportion of outpatient
consultations for ILI continued to remain below the national
baseline. All the sub-national surveillance regions reported the
proportion of ILI to be below their region-specific baselines. The
proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was
slightly above the epidemic threshold. No influenza-associated
pediatric deaths were reported this week.

The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in United
States remains low.
