Serum Cross-Reactive Antibody Response to a Novel Influenza A (H1N1)
Virus After Vaccination with Seasonal Influenza Vaccine
--------------------------------------------
As of 19 May 2009, a total of 5469 confirmed or probable cases of
human infection with a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus had been
documented in 47 states and the District of Columbia (1,2). In
addition, the virus had spread to 41 countries (3), with a total of
4774 cases reported in countries outside the United States. Because
producing a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus vaccine will take several
months (4), determining whether receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine
might offer any protection against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
is important. Therefore, using stored serum specimens collected
during previous vaccine studies, CDC assessed the level of
cross-reactive antibody to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in
cohorts of children and adults before and after they had been
vaccinated with the 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, or 2008-09 influenza
season vaccines. The results indicated that before vaccination, no
cross-reactive antibody to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus existed
among children. Among adults, before vaccination, cross-reactive
antibody was detected in 6-9 percent of those aged 18-64 years and in
33 percent of those aged greater than 60 years. Previous vaccination
of children with any of 4 seasonal trivalent, inactivated influenza
vaccines (TIV) or with live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) did
not elicit a cross-reactive antibody response to the novel influenza
A (H1N1) virus. Among adults, vaccination with seasonal TIV resulted
in a 2-fold increase in cross-reactive antibody response to the novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus among those aged 18-64 years, compared with
a 12-fold to 19-fold increase in cross-reactive antibody response to
the seasonal H1N1 strain; no increase in cross-reactive antibody
response to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus was observed among
adults aged greater than 60 years. These data suggest that receipt of
recent (2005-2009) seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to elicit
a protective antibody response to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.


Serum specimens were provided to CDC from academic, government, and
industry partners for use as part of the public health response to
the emergence of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. The specimens
had been collected from healthy human participants, with written,
informed consent. All participants had been vaccinated either 1)
intramuscularly with licensed TIV developed for the northern
hemisphere 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, or 2008-09 influenza seasons or
2) intranasally with licensed LAIV developed for the northern
hemisphere 2005-06 or 2006-07 influenza seasons. The serum specimens
were grouped for influenza serology testing by the age of
participants and formulation of the vaccines.


Microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays
were performed at CDC, according to standard MN and HI procedures
(5,6). As with vaccine production, the seasonal influenza A (H1N1)
viruses used in this study (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 [2005-06 and
2006-07], A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 [2007-08], and A/Brisbane/59/2007
[2008-09]) were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus used in the study was A/California/04/2009,
which was grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. All procedures
were performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory using biosafety
level 3 practices. The HI assay was performed using 0.5 percent
turkey red blood cells. Serum specimens were treated with
receptor-destroying enzymes. Sera containing nonspecific agglutinins
were heme-adsorbed and tested at an initial dilution of 1:10. For the
MN assay, serum specimens were heat inactivated (at 133 F [56 C], for
30 minutes) and tested at an initial dilution of 1:10. For
calculation of geometric mean titer (GMT) estimates, a titer of less
than 10 was assigned a value of 5, and a titer of greater than or
equal to 1280 was assigned a value of 1280. Statistical significance
was determined using a paired t-test.

An initial comparison between the HI and MN assays was made for
panels of sera from children aged 6 months to 9 years (n=28), adults
aged 18-59 years (n=30), and adults aged greater than 60 years
(n=42). Although the estimated correlation between HI and MN titers
was high (r=0.82) for the seasonal vaccine strains, the MN assay
generally yielded higher titers and detected more seroconversions
(i.e., 4-fold or greater increases in antibody titers) to
A/California/04/2009 than the HI assay. Therefore, the MN assay was
used to assess the level of cross-reactive antibody to
A/California/04/2009 in populations before and after vaccination with
seasonal influenza vaccines. Although serum HI antibody titers of 40
are associated with at least a 50 percent reduction in risk for
influenza infection or disease in populations (7), no such correlate
of protection exists for MN antibody titers. Therefore, a linear
regression model was used to predict the MN titer for seasonal
influenza A (H1N1) viruses that corresponded to an HI titer of 40 and
to measure titer achievement against the seasonal vaccine strain and
the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. In the pediatric population, an
HI titer of 40 corresponded to an MN titer of 40, whereas in the
adult population, the corresponding MN titer was greater than or equal to 160.

Among 79 children ranging in age from 6 months to 9 years, little
evidence was found of prevaccination cross-reactive antibodies to
A/California/04/2009 [data tabulated in the original test]. In
addition, after vaccination with seasonal TIV, no seroconversions to
A/California/04/2009 virus were detected, whereas seroconversions to
the seasonal vaccine strains were detected in 67-100 percent of
children. Children vaccinated with LAIV also had no seroconversions
to the A/California/04/2009 virus.

Consistent with previous reports (4), vaccination of adults with
seasonal TIV resulted in seroconversion to the seasonal influenza A
(H1N1) vaccine strain in 74 percent of adults aged 18-64 years, 78
percent of adults aged 18-40 years, and 54 percent of adults aged
greater than 60 years [data tabulated in the original text]. In
contrast, seroconversion to the A/California/04/2009 virus was
detected in 19 percent of adults aged 18-64 years and 3 percent of
adults aged greater than 60 years who received the 2007-08 vaccine
and in 12 percent of adults aged 18-40 years who received the 2008-09
vaccine. Compared with responses to the seasonal influenza A (H1N1)
vaccine virus, postvaccination to prevaccination GMT ratios for the
response to A/California/04/2009 virus were 5-fold to 10-fold lower
among all adults. However, 6 percent of adults aged 18-40 years, 9
percent of adults 18-64 years, and 33 percent of adults aged greater
than 60 years had prevaccination MN titers of greater than or equal
to 160. After vaccination with seasonal vaccine, 7 percent of adults
aged 18-40 years, 25 percent of adults aged 18-64 years, and 43
percent of adults aged greater than 60 years had postvaccination
titers of greater than or equal to 160 to A/California/04/2009. The
prevaccination GMT of adults aged greater than 60 years against the
novel 2009 H1N1 strain was significantly higher than against the
seasonal 2007-08 H1N1 vaccine component (p less than 0.001).

MMWR Editorial Note:
The results in this report suggest that vaccination with recent
(2005-2009) seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide
protection against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. Although
vaccination of adults with seasonal TIV generally resulted in a small
increase in antibodies against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus,
whether such levels of cross-reactive antibody provide any protection
against infection with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus is unknown.
These results are consistent with the substantial degree of genetic
divergence of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin from
recent seasonal human H1N1 viruses; A/California/04/09 shares only
72-73 percent amino acid identity in the HA1 portion of the
hemagglutinin molecule with the seasonal viruses used in this study.
For comparison, the amino acid sequence identity in the HA1 portion
among seasonal vaccine strains used in this study is 97-98 percent.

Although the number of sera from children tested in this analysis was
small, results indicate that U.S. children are largely serologically
naive to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus and that vaccination with
seasonal TIV or LAIV does not elicit any measurable level of
cross-reactive antibody to the novel virus. Results among adults
suggest that some degree of preexisting immunity to the novel H1N1
strains exists, especially among adults aged greater than 60 years.
One possible explanation is that some adults in this age group have
had previous exposure, either through infection or vaccination, to an
influenza A (H1N1) virus that is genetically and antigenically more
closely related to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus than are
contemporary seasonal H1N1 strains. Ongoing assessment of the
cross-reactive antibody response among persons in different age
groups might identify a particular age group that would allow further
clarification of the cross-reactive serologic response. Development
of a strain-specific vaccine against the novel influenza A (H1N1)
virus is needed for optimal protection against the virus among
persons of all ages.

[Although vaccination of adults with trivalent inactivated seasonal
influenza vaccine generally resulted in a small increase in
antibodies against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus, whether such
levels of cross-reactive antibody provide any protection against
infection with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus is unknown. Also some
degree of preexisting immunity to the novel H1N1 strains exists,
especially among adults aged greater than 60 years, suggesting
previous exposure to an H1N1 strain more closely related to the
current novel H1N1 strain.

Overall, the results in this report suggest that vaccination with
recent (2005-2009) seasonal influenza vaccines is unlikely to provide
protection against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. Development of
a strain-specific vaccine against the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
will be needed for optimal protection against the virus among persons
of all ages. - Mod.CP]
