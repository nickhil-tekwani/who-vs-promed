Eighty-eight cases of human African trypanosomiasis, otherwise called "sleeping sickness", have been recorded for the 1st 3/4 of the current year [2022]. This was announced in Bandundu on Monday [7 Nov 2022] by the coordinating physician provincial level of the African Human Rights national trypanosomiasis control program (PNLTHA) in Kwilu, Dr Pathou Nganzobo.

Dr Pathou Nganzobo published these data on the occasion of a roundtable organized on political advocacy for the elimination of sleeping sickness in the DRC by 2030. According to him, 15 health zones are affected out of the 24 in this province.

Dr Nganzobo talks about the difficulties encountered in the fight against this disease and also announces the allocation of a budget of 9 million Congolese francs [USD 4400] by the provincial government of Kwilu for the impetus to eradicate trypanosomiasis: "We mainly came up against the problem of financing. We were in a project with IMT Invers and the Liverpool Tropical Medicine school, which ended on 31 Dec 2021. So it is time to renew the project; we spent almost a whole quarter without activity, which is a great difficulty for us. Now the provincial government has promised 9 million Congolese francs [USD 4400] for the momentum of the elimination of sleeping sickness already included in the budget proposal that he is going to submit to the provincial assembly. The main focus will be on sensitization".

Dr Nganzobo urges the population to be aware that trypanosomiasis really exists and asks them to contribute in the struggle; in particular through environmental sanitation and participation in screening.

[HAT, also called sleeping sickness, is considered a neglected tropical disease. The Democratic Republic of Congo has set itself the goal of eradicating it by 2030. However, on the ground, the reality is quite different, because 15 areas are still endemic out of the 24 health zones in the Kwilu province alone. The high authorities of the country call on service providers, populations, politico-administrative authorities, technical and financial partners, funders and communicators to redouble their efforts to to change the trends further. - Mod.BM

Human African trypanosomiasis, HAT, or sleeping sickness, is endemic in Congo DR especially in the western and southern provinces. See a recent review of eradication in Africa: (Franco JR, Cecchi G, Paone M, et al. The elimination of human African trypanosomiasis: Achievements in relation to WHO road map targets for 2020. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2022 Jan 18; 16(1): e0010047; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010047). - Mod.EP

Kwilu is a province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's one of the 21 provinces created in the 2015 repartitioning. Kwilu, Kwango, and Mai-Ndombe provinces are the result of the dismemberment of the former Bandundu province. Kwilu was formed from the Kwilu district and the independently administered cities of Bandundu and Kikwit. Bandundu is the provincial capital.

The province is located in the southwest of Congo DR and takes its name from the Kwilu River, which crosses it from south to north. - Mod.LXL
