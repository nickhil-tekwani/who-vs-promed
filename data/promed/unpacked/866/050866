Epidemic Cases Reported in Afar, Somali State
February 13, 1998
Addis Ababa - Ethiopia's Health Mister was quick to assure journalists on
February 11 that the epidemic cases reported in the Afar and Somali states
are not indicators of the Rift Valley fever pitch that has blighted some
neighbouring countries.
"There is not a single case that indicates the occurrence of the Rift Valley
fever that has hit neighbouring countries," Health Minster Dr. Adem Ibrahim
said.
The diseases in the Somali and Afar states are identified as malaria,
diarrhoea, tuberculosis, measles and malnutrition, he stated. The outbreak
has surfaced due to the recent overflowing of the Wabe Shebelle River, he
added.
Dr. Adem, together with a WHO representative led a team to visit the
affected zones of the Somali state, namely, Kebridehar, Gode, Mustahil and
Ferfer and some areas in the Afar state.
Dr. Wendson Mwambazi, a representative of the World Health Organisation
(WHO) said on his part that the situation is not so acute but chronic.
