Trials confirm SCN resistance problems
--------------------------------------

Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) isn't a new problem; but as this year's [2016] Iowa State University [ISU] SCN-resistant soybean variety trials show, nematodes are reproducing at heightened levels throughout the state in varieties with the commonest source of genetic resistance. Trials evaluate how well soybean varieties limit reproduction of the worms.

Greg Tylka, ISU, said farms lost yield to SCN in 2016, but in dryer years it could be 5 times worse. [There are] 2 main sources of genetic resistance in soybeans -- PI88788 and Peking (PI 548402). Almost all the varieties available for 25 years contained the PI88788 source of resistance.

Troy Bauer, DuPont Pioneer, agreed that "prolonged, widespread use" has led to increased SCN reproduction on varieties with PI88788 resistance. Reproduction levels higher than 10 per cent in varieties were only found at 4 sites in 2011, compared to 8 sites in 2016. Differences exist among varieties with the same resistance source because multiple genes are involved.

Crop rotation and rotation of sources of resistance are important, he said. "We're trying to advance Peking sources of resistance. In the long term, ever-increasing nematode numbers will seriously reduce yields."

[Soybean cyst nematode (_Heterodera glycines_) is considered one of the most destructive pests of the crop, with potential yield losses of more than 30 per cent. Symptoms are distributed unevenly in affected fields and may include yellowing and stunting of plants as well as reduced nodulation of roots leading to loss of plant vigour. Symptom severity depends on nematode numbers and environmental conditions. SCN has also been reported to contribute to disease complexes such as sudden death syndrome and top dieback.

Cyst nematodes can often persist in the soil for many years and are spread by plant material, soil and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Control measures are generally aimed at keeping nematode levels below economic thresholds. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures (exclusion, long crop rotations with non-host species), nematicides and use of resistant crop varieties.

Other species in the genus are known to affect crops like maize (_H. zeae_), cereals (_H. avenae_) and sugar beet (_H. schachtii_).

Pathogen strains with resistance to agrochemicals, increased host range or an ability to overcome resistance of crop varieties are emerging frequently worldwide. The story above illustrates once again that ongoing crop breeding programmes are required to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
