Egypt Reports 3rd H5N1 Avian Influenza Case Of 2014
------------------------
A 86-year-old woman from the capital city of Damanhur in the Egyptian coastal governorate of Beheira is the latest human case of H5N1 avian influenza in the North African country, according to a EGYNews rport Saturday (computer translated).

The report notes that the elderly woman is hospitalized in intensive care and is currently in "poor condition".

She also has the underlying condition of diabetes. She is being treated with Tamiflu.

This human H5N1 avian flu case follows 2 confirmed cases 2 weeks ago (one case was from Damanhur also) (see prior ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (88): Egypt, H5N1, RFI 20140324.2353435 for details).

Since 2006, Egypt has reported 175 (not including this current case) cases of human H5N1 bird flu with 63 deaths (Case fatality ratio - 36 percent).

According to the WHO, the primary risk factor for human infection with the virus appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments.

[In the most recent WHO Influenza at the Human Animal Interface monthly Summary and assessment as of 24 March 2014 there was confirmation of the 2 cases reported in ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (88): Egypt, H5N1, RFI 20140324.2353435. (see
http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_24March14.pdf?ua=1 for the full report).

In this summary report, during the period 2003 to [24 Mar 2014], there were 664 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported including 391 deaths, from a total of 15 countries that have been reported to WHO. This represents an increase of 6 cases and 3 deaths since the last report (as of 25 Feb 2014). Of note, all 6 of the cases reported in the past month have a history of exposure to dead or sick poultry. During the period 2005 through the beginning of 2014, there have been a total of 173 laboratory confirmed cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection including 63 deaths reported by Egypt (see http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140124CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1 for a table showing the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2014). (This table is current as of 24 Jan 2014 and does not include cases confirmed in Egypt (2), Viet Nam (1), Cambodia (13), and China (2) since 24 Jan 2014). With the addition of this current case and the 2 cases reported last month (March 2014) the total number of cases of human avian influenza A(H5N1) reported in Egypt will increase to 176 including 63 deaths.
