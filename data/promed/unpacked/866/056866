After avoiding Polk County for 10 years, citrus canker [CC] appears to be
making up for lost time. Officials with the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services on Thursday reported a "highly suspect" new outbreak of
CC south of Lake Wales and 2 new confirmed discoveries near a previous finding
in Davenport. If confirmed, the Lake Wales discovery would mark the 4th
outbreak of the bacterial disease in Polk since the county's 1st outbreak in
May [2005]. CC first reappeared in Florida in 1995 near Miami.
The most rapid spread of CC has come since hurricanes Charley, Frances and
Jeanne swept through the Florida citrus belt in 2004. Nearly 55 000 acres of
commercial citrus grove will be destroyed because of CC discovered from 12 Aug
2004, the day before Charley struck, through Friday, according to state
agriculture department figures. That included 177 acres destroyed in Polk
County through 26 Aug 2005 and another 915 acres slated for destruction.
Before Charley, only about 16 000 acres had been destroyed.
Denise Feiber, a department spokeswoman, said Thursday officials were
investigating the "highly suspect" CC discovery in a grove south of Lake Wales
near the northwest corner of Crooked Lake. The suspected CC was reported by
the grove's owner, Bill Cooley. Cooley could not be reached Thursday.
Confirmed outbreaks of CC were discovered in 2 more commercial groves near a
14-acre grove owned by Tommy Thayer on U.S. 27 [highway] about 2 miles north
of Haines City, Feiber said. The agriculture department reported 24 Aug [2005]
it found canker on more than 100 orange trees in Thayer's grove. The discovery
led to a survey of all other citrus trees within a 2-mile radius. That
uncovered infected orange trees in the 2 neighboring groves. one of the
properties was identified as the "Webbs Canoy grove," Feiber said. She had no
identification for the owner of the other grove.
CC is a bacterial disease characterized by the lesions it leaves on citrus
trees and fruit. It can weaken trees and result in reduced fruit production,
but it does not kill citrus trees. CC is harmless to humans and animals. CC
has the greatest impact on the marketing of fresh Florida citrus because the
lesions make the fruit unattractive to consumers.
Annually about 70 percent of the state's tangerines and other specialty citrus
and about 40 percent of grapefruit goes to the fresh market, but only about 5
percent of the state's oranges. The rest goes to orange juice.
There is no cure for CC, so the state-federal Citrus Canker Eradication
Program attempts to control its spread by cutting down and burning infected
trees and all other exposed trees within a 1900-foot radius. In a commercial
grove, that radius can encompass up to 250 acres around a single infected
tree. That is why the post-hurricanes outbreak has led to destruction of
nearly 55 000 acres.
Before the hurricanes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had
compensated commercial growers an average $7600 an acre for destroying their
property. Because of the widespread destruction since then, the amount of
unpaid compensation has grown to more than $450 million for claims covering
about 60 000 acres, according to a USDA official.
Andy LaVigne, the chief executive at Lakeland-based Florida Citrus Mutual, the
state's largest growers representative, said he met in Washington earlier this
week with USDA officials about more money for compensation. He acknowledged
the impact of Hurricane Katrina has made that task more difficult.

[CC has caused exceptionally high crop losses in the Florida citrus industry.
The hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 have taken a heavy toll on growers.
Eradication is the only option for managing the disease for citrus growers.
John-Thor Dahlburg, a Los Angeles Times staff writer, likened 2004's
hurricanes to dropping a bacteriological bomb on Florida's already sorely
challenged citrus industry, widely dispersing a virulently contagious germ
that causes CC. Florida officials say the possibility that hurricanes could
further scatter the bacteria has created the most serious threat in decades to
the state's signature crops.
State agriculture officials say they have no yardstick to determine when --
and if -- they should abandon the attempt to wipe out citrus canker despite
spending 10 years and about $650 million in what has, so far, been a losing
battle. Florida Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Liz Compton, in a piece
published in the Orlando Sentinel, said the state has not decided the
conditions under which it would drop its controversial eradication policy in
favor of other approaches. The ultimate cost of the eradication program could
top $1 billion.
