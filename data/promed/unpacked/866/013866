The toxic algal bloom sitting on the outskirts of the Marlborough Sounds
and threatening the $120 million mussel export industry appears to be
breaking up in some areas. The director of the Marine Farming Association,
Paul Lupi, said latest test results showed the bloom may have dissipated
from the Brothers Islands west to the Chetwode Islands.
The bloom was first discovered in May in Manukau Harbour. However, the
bloom can still be found in low concentrations along the entire length of
Tory Channel and occupies some areas of the Cook Strait. Since May the
bloom extended itself along the entire west coast of the North Island and
prompted a ban on collecting shellfish in areas where the algae has been
found.
The discovery of the bloom at the entrance to the Marlborough Sounds caused
concern because of the mussel and scallop industries in the area. The algae
is harmless to shellfish but can cause paralytic poisoning in people who
eat affected shellfish.
Mr Lupi said the tests had shown the bloom has not moved around to the East
Coast of the North Island.
