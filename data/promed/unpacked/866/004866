Over 500 rare Central Asian antelopes [saiga antelope, _Saiga tatarica_] have been found dead from unknown causes in northern Kazakhstan.

The news will disappoint conservationists trying to boost numbers of the endangered saiga, a distinctive creature with a long, humped nose that permits it to filter air during the dusty summer months and breathe warm air during cold spells.

A total of 543 saiga corpses have been found in Kostanay region in the far north of the country, Kazakhstan Today quoted the Emergencies Ministry as saying. The majority were does (508); 31 calves were also found dead. The cause of death is being investigated.

As well as roaming the steppes of Kazakhstan, the saiga also lives in remote areas of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia and Russia. It is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.

Kazakhstan is home to the largest numbers of saigas in the world, but a population that numbered over a million in the 1970s has been decimated.

The World Wildlife Fund identifies loss of habitat and poaching as the major threats: The horn of the male saiga is particularly prized in Chinese medicine for use as a painkiller and antibiotic, creating a thriving and illegal trade.

Nevertheless, conservation efforts appear to be paying off in Kazakhstan: Last year [2011], officials estimated that the country's saiga population had reached 100 000, up from 85 000 the year before.

The biggest blow to conservation in Kazakhstan in recent years came from the death of nearly 12 000 saigas in 2010 in an epidemic of pasteurellosis, a disease of the respiratory tract. Last year [2011], another, smaller outbreak killed over 400 of the animals.

[The saiga is a Critically Endangered antelope which originally inhabited a vast area of the Eurasian steppe. Pictures of a saiga can be seen at: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Mongolia_Saiga_tatarica.jpg and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Saiga.jpg.

Saiga populations suffer large, apparently spontaneous disease outbreaks, causing massive die-offs. There have been a number of previous events recorded in Kazakhstan: 1955, 1956, 1958, 1967, 1969, 1974, 1981, 1984, 1988, 2010 and 2011, with Foot and Mouth Disease and pasteurellosis as the attributed causes in most events. The underlying predisposing factor, however, remains unknown. An assessment conducted by the Saiga Conservation Alliance concludes: "The current most plausible hypothesis for the die off of saigas in West Kazakhstan in 2010 and 2011 is that, after calving, adult saigas entered an area of relatively rich pastures. This was a time of rapid growth of vegetation. After eating the vegetation, saigas developed problems with their ruminal function. This led to bloating, mild diarrhoea and a respiratory based sudden death syndrome, similar to 'Fog Fever,'" (from: http://www.saigak.biodiversity.ru/eng/publications/saiganewseng14.pdf).
