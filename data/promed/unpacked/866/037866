Re: Avian influenza (180): Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------------
Kindly be aware that Saudi officials already banned importation of
meat and live animals from Sudan as soon as RVF was confirmed in
humans by both the MOH, WHO and US NAMRU3 laboratories and later in
animals by declaration of the deputy minister of animal health in
Sudan.

The official authority in the Saudi MOH as well those in the MOA have
taken all possible efforts and secured measures to insure that the
country and the pilgrims are safe and protected.

The health officials in the KSA have been recently discussing and
almost have approved the new plans to launch a huge research
facility, i.e. Saudi-CDC, so as to enable the country to perform and
conduct ongoing and active surveillance on a long list of diseases of
special concern, especially those of zoonotic importance.

The recent outbreaks of RVF in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as
several other emerging diseases, have made such integrated research
facilities badly needed not only for Saudi interests but also for
regional and global interests.

I fully agree with and support Dr. Fagbo's comments on the AI issue
and would like to assure everyone that there are neither grounds nor
scientific rationale for the disturbing newswire regarding the threat
of AI to the pilgrims.

[The information supplied by Dr Salman is much appreciated. We are
particularly grateful for the provided data on measures taken by the
Saudi authorities concerning the importation of meat and live animals
from Sudan, data requested in our previous posting thus far not
available.

A considerable proportion of the meat from animals slaughtered during
Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), which is the most important feast
of the Muslim calendar, is distributed to the needy and the poor
within and outside the Kingdom, fulfilling the traditional obligation
of sharing and bestowing it. The wholesomeness of the meat is to be
secured by antemortem and post-slaughter inspection activities,
carried out by veterinarians and meat inspectors.

This year's feast is due to begin on 20 Dec 2007, concluding the
pilgrimage to Mecca. Eid al-Adha commemorates Ibrahim's (Abraham's)
willingness to obey God by sacrificing his son, Ishmael. - Mod.AS]
