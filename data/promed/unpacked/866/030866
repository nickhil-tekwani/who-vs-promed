Doctors of Sudan expect the cause of an unknown fever to be found in contaminated floodwater, as the country continues to fight against the coronavirus. Now, 8 people have lost their lives in Sudan's Northern state due to an unknown fever, the Ministry of Health of Sudan has revealed.

"The ministry received a report on Sat 19 Sep 2020 concerning 41 cases of fever in Northern state, including 8 deaths," the official statement read. It also added that a medical team has been sent to investigate the cases and to try to identify the disease that has caused the deadly fever. "Samples were taken for laboratory examination to confirm the diagnosis and to strengthen interventions to prevent and control the disease," the statement mentioned.

The doctors and experts of Sudan expect the cause of the fever to be found in contaminated floodwater that immersed large parts of the nation in recent weeks. Stagnant water has the ability to start outbreaks of deadly diseases like cholera, malaria, or dengue fever.

Since the month of June 2020, 121 people have lost their lives in Sudan, and 54 others have been injured due to the flash floods. On 5 Sep 2020, the Sudanese Defence and Security Council designated the nation a natural disaster area and declared a nationwide state of emergency for 3 months. Amidst all these difficulties, the deadly fever has killed 8 and increased fears among the people about a new and unknown disease outbreak.
