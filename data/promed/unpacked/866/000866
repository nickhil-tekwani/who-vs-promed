The HONG KONG Department of Health was put on alert on Friday after news
that a disease had killed more than 1.7 million chickens in Guangzhou in the
past few months. The Guangzhou government said the epidemic was under control.
Unqualified vets and poor knowledge of disease prevention were to blame for
the chicken plague, China's official "Nanfang Daily" said on Friday. The
paper said the outbreak was started late last year in southern Guangzhou,
and soon spread to most parts of the city. To date the plague had cost at
least 10 million yuan (HK$9.3 million).
A Guangzhou resident contacted by the "Hong Kong Standard" on Friday said
people there were still buying chicken and the price had not been affected
by the incident. Another resident was unaware of the outbreak since it had
not been reported on local television.
