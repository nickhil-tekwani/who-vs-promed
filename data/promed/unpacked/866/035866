Please note that sulfonamides haven't been recomended for meningococcal
disease since the early '70s, as widespread resistance was detetected around
'63 or '65, initially in the U.S.A. and Africa and later worldwide. During
the '72-'75 epidemics (serotypes A and C) in Brazil, sulfonamides were
already out of use.
Penicillin is the drug of choice. Resistance is still very rare.
In some African countries, cloramphenicol in an oil base is used
IM (3g every 3 days, 2x or 3x), as a less costly and more convenient, albeit
less efficacious alternative.
[I quote Benenson's "Control of Communicable Diseases in Man -- admittedly
the 15th edn. (1990): "If the organisms are sensitive to sulfonamides,
meningococci usually disappear from the nasopharynx within 24 hours after
institution of treatment. Penicillin will temporarily suppress the
organisms, but it does not usually eradicate them from the oro-nasopharynx."
Thanks, Luiz, for the clarification - Mod.JW]
Concerning the epidemic close to Santo Domingo, it is unusual to report an
epidemic of meningococcemia, as this is only a more severe form of
meningococcal disease that never occurs on its own. If there were 14 cases,
there must have been something around 200 cases of meningococcal disease.
