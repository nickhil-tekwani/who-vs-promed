A 9-year-old girl died on Fri, 26 Aug 2005, after contracting food poisoning,
Captain Johnny Thiyo, police spokesperson, said. The drama started that day
when a giraffe was shot dead on the farm Grootfontein in the Waterberg region
of Limpopo.
Thiyo said the farmer had been trying to tame the giraffe, but had been
unsuccessful. The giraffe became sick and the farmer decided to put it down.
The farmer asked workers on the farm to burn the carcass and to bury it
afterwards.
"However, the workers decided to slaughter the giraffe and divided the meat
between them," Thiyo said. The farmer was not aware of this. The workers took
some of the meat to their homes and families.
The girl ate some of the meat at her neighbors' house that night and, shortly
after the meal, she fell ill and died before a doctor could be called out.
A neighbor and a 10-year-old boy also became ill, and an ambulance was called
out that took them to Modimolle Hospital.
Ofentshe Ledwaba of the department of health in the Waterberg area said on
Tue, 30 Aug 2005, that the man and boy were still being treated in hospital
for food poisoning. "The man was unconscious until Mon, 29 Aug 2005, but
regained consciousness. His condition is satisfactory."
Thiyo said some of the workers kept their portions of the meat for Sunday's
main meal. 7 people became ill of the meat on Sunday night and early on Monday
morning. Ambulances were called to the farm to take the people to hospital in
Modimolle. Ledwaba said these people were treated and discharged later.

would be appreciated. - Mod.LL]
