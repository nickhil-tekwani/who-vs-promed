Mr Hamilton (the minister of health, social services and public safety): "The Public Health Agency (PHA) has been coordinating the response to the cluster of cases of pneumococcal disease at Harland and Wolff. There have been 4 confirmed cases, with onset dates between 28 Apr and 6 May [2015]. All have been treated in hospital.

"It has been recognised for some time that there is an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease associated with welding. The green book, which is the UK's authoritative guidance on vaccination, provides specific guidance about protecting those at risk of frequent or continuous occupational exposure to metal fumes, including welders. The key preventative measures are pneumococcal vaccine, prophylactic use of antibiotics and measures to limit exposure to metal fumes and dust.

"The PHA led a risk assessment process at Harland and Wolff, which identified the workers at immediate risk requiring public health intervention. They are being offered antibiotic prophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccine. About 450 workers were given antibiotics and vaccine over the weekend [16-17 May 2015], with a further 150 being seen today [18 May 2015]. The Public Health Agency expects to complete this work at Harland and Wolff by 9.00 pm today [18 May 2015], and that no further clinics will be needed.

"Vaccination may reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease but it does not replace measures to prevent or reduce exposure. Ongoing prevention is primarily a matter for Harland and Wolff's occupational health department, with support and guidance from the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland." [...]

"Pneumococcal vaccination programmes are in place but are targeted at specific demographic cohorts; namely, babies, people aged 65 and over and anyone between the ages of 2 and 65 with a long-term health condition. That is a national policy, and it is based on advice and recommendations that come from the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. So, that is in place for those specific groups of people in the wider population. That is obviously then added to by outbreaks such as this, where there are clusters of pneumococcal disease and vaccinations are issued as appropriate."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Irene Lai for her submission.

The report above says that the cluster of cases of pneumococcal disease at Harland and Wolff involved 4 confirmed patients, with onsets of disease in a 9 day period between 28 Apr and 6 May 2015. The report above implies, although does not say so directly, that they were welders and were exposed to metal fumes, but had not been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, even though the UK in 2011 recommended pneumococcal vaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine-23 valent (PPV23) for those workers "at risk of frequent or continuous occupational exposure to metal fumes, including welders" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639542/ and http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_131000.pdf).

The UK's Health Protection Agency's (HPA's) "Interim UK guidelines for the public health management of clusters of serious pneumococcal disease in closed settings" issued in 2008 (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/328250/pneumococcal_disease_-_July_2008.pdf) note that a suspect cluster is defined as 2 or more cases of serious pneumococcal disease occurring in a closed setting within a 14-day period. Once 2 or more of the cases are found to be infected by the same pneumococcal serotype, the cluster is considered "confirmed", in which case "close contacts" are identified.

Close contacts are individuals who have had "significant" contact with a cluster case in a closed setting 48 hours before onset of symptoms in the case until completion of 24 hours of systemic antibiotic treatment. Examples of a closed setting given by the guidelines are: "a place such as a children's day-care centre, school, residential home, hospital ward, military establishment, prison, homeless shelter, household and other similar settings". Chemoprophylaxis of "close contacts" is recommended for up to 14 days after onset in last case, with either amoxicillin for 7 days, azithromycin for 3 days, or rifampin for 4 days.

The cluster has presumably been confirmed -- that is, at least 2 of the 4 cases are infected by the same serotype, since 450 additional workers at Harland and Wolff and 150 others, who are presumably being considered "close contacts", were being offered chemoprophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccination. We are not told if any of the "close contacts" included family members. Presumably none of the 450 workers or the 150 others had previously received pneumococcal vaccination.

The report still does not tell us characteristics of the 4 patients, such as age, sex, or medical conditions predisposing to pneumococcal disease (for example, chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction), how the diagnoses were confirmed, the types of pneumococcal infection involved in the outbreak, or serotypes or genotypes of the _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ causing the infections.

We do not know if the 4 workers with pneumococcal infection or any of the other 600 "close contacts" given chemoprophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccination worked in the same location, or some other location considered to be a "closed setting", or if any of the 600 individuals were pneumococcal carriers of the outbreak strain(s). More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
