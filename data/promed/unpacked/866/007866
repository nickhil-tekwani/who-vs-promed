Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Epidemic in Uganda May Have Been Contained
------------------------------------------------------------------
Although 4 more people have died from Ebola virus infection in the northern
Ugandan district of Gulu, the epidemic [appears to have been contained,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wed 29 Nov 2000. "The more
recent cases in Gulu arose from victims who had already contracted the
disease but were undiscovered by the authorities," WHO Country
Representative for Uganda, Dr. Oladapo Walker, told the UN Integrated
Regional Information Network. To date, the epidemic has claimed 149 lives
out of 357 reported cases. Most of the cases arose in Gulu where the
disease first broke out and where 140 people have died from Ebola virus
infection. No new cases have been reported in the districts of Mbarara and
Masindi, where incidents of Ebola have also been confirmed.
The European Union has announced the allocation of US $312 000 through its
humanitarian aid office (ECHO) for surveillance and control of the disease,
case management of Ebola hemorrrhagic fever patients, and public education
measures. Dr. Walker described the international community's response to
the crisis as a "great success." In areas of Sudan and the Democratic
Republic of Congo, where Ebola fever [had occurred previously, mortality
rates ranged between 80-90 percent, while in Uganda the mortality rates
remained around 30 percent. "The credit for the low mortality rate of the
Ebola fever epidemic in Uganda goes to the national task force for putting
up the idea of active searches for potential cases," Dr. Walker said. He
also praised the Ugandan Health Ministry for setting up the task force and
responding rapidly to the crisis. The national task force is constituted by
WHO, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
the Ugandan Health Ministry and non-governmental organizations.

[It is perhaps still premature to claim containment of the epidemic,
particularly as the 4 most recent deaths were individuals who had escaped
detection. The lower mortality rate compared with previous epidemics may be
a property of the virus strain rather than a consequence of superior public
health measures. - Mod.CP
