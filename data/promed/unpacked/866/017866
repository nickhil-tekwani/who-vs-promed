[1] G7 summit: super-spreading event
Date: Sat 19 Jun 2021

Britain's recent G7 summit of world leaders was a superspreader event that has led to a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections in the surrounding communities, according to the latest data.

Cornwall business leaders, politicians and residents are calling for the Government to "save the summer" following a huge rise in COVID-19 infections following the visit from world leaders, their entourages, the world's media and thousands of police last weekend.

Areas of Cornwall where G7 events were focused saw infections rise more than 2000% in the 7 days leading up to the end of the meeting between global leaders .

One concerned local: "It looks like a superspreader event to me, and now it's spreading."

The area around Carbis Bay, where the summit took place, and Falmouth, where the world's media were based along with many of the 6000 of officers policing the event and protesters, are now suffering some of the highest rates of infection in the country.

The rate of COVID-19 infections in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly during the week to, and including, [13 Jun 2021] has risen from 2.8 per 100 000 people on the Sunday before G7 began to 81.7 per 100 000. This compares to a national average of 77.4 per 100 000.

But it is in the areas most closely linked to G7 events where rates are of particular concern to local health chiefs.

The rate of infection in St Ives and Halsetown has risen 2450% in the 7 day period to 733.2 per 100 000 people in the 7 days to [13 Jun 2021], when the summit came to an end. In the council ward of St Ives East, Lelant & Carbis Bay the rate has risen by 800% to 294.9 per 100 000 people in the same period.

In a number of Falmouth council wards the rates are now more than 500 per 100 000, with Falmouth East hit by a 2000% rise in infections to 600 per 100 000.

As a result of the surge in infections in Cornwall, local leaders are calling on the Government to immediately bring the spread under control with surge testing in high case areas and additional vaccines to immunise younger people, who dominate the hospitality staff in the county.

While only one person is currently being treated for COVID in Cornwall, health chiefs' fear this number will rise significantly due to the lag between infection and hospitalization. The dominant Delta variant, which was originally discovered in India, is twice as likely to result in younger people requiring medical intervention.

On [Fri 18 Jun 2021], the Government authorized surge testing in some areas of Surrey, where levels of infection are significantly lower than in St Ives and Falmouth. However, Downing Street did not respond to questions on whether it would bring in similar measures or local restrictions to help stem the rise in infections in Cornwall.

Kim Conchie, chief executive of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said: "The largely unvaccinated young staff in our hospitality businesses are catching the Delta variant and they and their colleagues are having to isolate as a result. This is closing down pubs, bars and hotels at a frightening rate.

"We need surge testing, and if the Government wants to save the staycation, not only in Cornwall, but across all the holiday destinations in the UK, then perhaps it should look at providing extra doses in places like Cornwall to ensure the hospitality sector isn't being forced to close due to staff shortages caused by COVID infections."

Munira Wilson MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for health, said: "That the conference may have led to a surge in COVID cases is disheartening. It shows we still need to remain aware of the risks of large gatherings and that the Government should stay vigilant.

The COVID-19 death toll in Brazil passed 500 000 over the weekend, marking the 2nd-highest official count for one country behind the U.S. -- though experts estimate India has also seen well over that many deaths. Thousands took to the streets across the country this weekend to protest the government's response to the pandemic. ... The country currently averages around 2000 deaths per day, and experts worry it will only get worse. Just 11% of residents have been fully vaccinated as winter begins in the Southern Hemisphere, increasing the risk of infection.

The highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus is gaining steam in undervaccinated pockets of the U.S., according to a study. Coupled with accelerating cases in the South, the finding casts a pall on the inoculation effort in the country even though 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated.

India gave more than 8.5 million doses on [Mon 21 Jun 2021], setting a daily record for the nation. In Japan, the Tokyo Olympics will limit the number of spectators to 10 000 people per venue.

Canada announced a loosening of travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said

England is on track for curbs to be lifted in July, while Germany warned a 4th wave is possible.

South Africa is planning to make vaccines locally using messenger RNA.

Key Developments:
- Global Tracker: Cases exceed 178.6 million; deaths pass 3.86 million
- Vaccine Tracker: More than 2.62 billion doses administered
- Delta variant seen spreading in undervaccinated U.S. counties
- COVID counting sees new era as threat shifts away from cases
- Many Brazilians insist on Pfizer even with 500 000 dead
- COVID rebounds in U.S. south, with many shunning vaccines

India Hits Daily Vaccination Record
------------------------------------
India said it administered a record 8.5 million vaccine doses on [Mon 21 Jun 2021], the first day vaccines were available free to all adults. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the numbers were "gladdening" but the nation's inoculation drive has a long way to go -- about 283 million doses have been given in India, enough to cover only about 10% of its population.

COVID Rebounds in U.S. South (3:50 p.m. NY)
-------------------------------------------
COVID-19 transmission is accelerating in several poorly vaccinated states, primarily in the South, and more young people are turning up at hospitals. The data present the clearest sign of a rebound in the U.S. in months.

In Missouri, Arkansas and Utah, the 7-day average of hospital admissions with confirmed COVID-19 has increased more than 30% in the past 2 weeks, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. In Mississippi, the hospitalization rate is up 5% in the period.

South Africa Plans to Make Vaccine
-----------------------------------
South Africa is planning to make vaccines locally using messenger RNA, the breakthrough technology of the global inoculation effort against COVID-19. The manufacturing will be conducted by the state-owned Biovac Institute, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told reporters [Mon 21 Jun 2021]. That will be part of a broader vaccine technology-transfer hub in the country, he said.

The WHO is speaking to a number of drugmakers about establishing the hub, though the talks are so far mainly with "smaller companies," said Soumya Swaminathan, WHO's chief scientist. "We are having discussions with the larger companies with proven mRNA technology," she added.

U.S. Says 150 Million Fully Vaccinated
----------------------------------------
The U.S. said 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to a statement on Twitter by Cyrus Shahpar, White House COVID data director. Cyrus Shahpar @cyrusshahpar46

Canada Begins to Ease Border Rules
-----------------------------------
The Canadian government announced a loosening of COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people amid warnings that a return to a completely open border will take a while longer.

Fully vaccinated Canadians and residents will exempt from the mandatory 3-day hotel stay as well as a 14-day quarantine requirement on arrival to the country, Justin Trudeau's government said in a statement on [Mon 21 Jun 2021]. Travelers will still need to have tested negative for COVID-19 before their trip, and take a 2nd test at the border.

The move -- effective [5 Jul 2021] -- is a first, incremental step to ease restrictions amid mounting impatience for the government to reopen the border between the U.S. and Canada. A fuller reopening won't happen until 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, Canada's border chief said on [Sun 20 Jun 2021]. The world's longest undefended border has been closed to most travel since March [2020]. On [Fri 18 Jun 2021], the government extended the restrictions until at least 21 Jul.

Germany Sees Potential for 4th Wave
-------------------------------------
German Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of the possibility of a 4th wave of the pandemic as the delta variant spreads, saying it's important to remain cautious as the country plans for a potentially challenging autumn and winter.

"As you can see in the U.K., there is a risk," Spahn said in an online panel hosted by industry group BDI. "Just remember the figures they had just some weeks ago regarding vaccination as well as the infection rate, and actually how quickly that can change."

Kenya to Receive More Vaccines
------------------------------
Kenya will receive 358 000 AstraZeneca doses donated by Denmark on [Mon 21 Jun 2021] to shore up depleting stocks for the 2nd round of vaccinations, according to Willis Akhwale, chairman of the COVID-19 vaccine advisory task force.

A total of 1.18 million vaccines have so far been administered across Kenya, but fewer than 200 000 people had received a second dose as at [20 Jun 2021], according to the Health Ministry.

Johnson Says Curbs to Be Lifted as Planned
------------------------------------------
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England is on course to be able to lift coronavirus restrictions as planned on [19 Jul 2021], despite the spread of the delta variant. But Johnson also warned that foreign travel is likely to continue to be disrupted this year [2021], with delays and complications for travelers.
