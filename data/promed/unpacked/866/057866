RABBIT VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC DISEASES - RFI
========================================
Subject: Requesting update on VHD outbreaks
Dear Promed-AHEAD [& Epivet-l] subscribers,
While not a medical researcher (I'm a computer programmer), I am extremely
interested in the latest news of the lapine VHD (calicivirus) outbreaks in
Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain.
I am a subscriber to a mailing list (with international readership) devoted
to the rabbit as a companion animal. As a result we are *extremely*
concerned about the progress this disease is making. While most of our
readership is based in the United States, we want to stay aware of the
latest news in order to take action to protect our rabbits if (when?) VHD
makes it to the US.
I would appreciate any information you can provide. You may post privately
to <snevel@schwab.com> if this information is of insufficient interest to
the list at large.
