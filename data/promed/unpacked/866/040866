The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported yesterday [29 Nov 2022] on a local confirmed case of paratyphoid fever in a 10-year-old girl living in the northern region. Paratyphoid fever was confirmed on 25 Nov 2022. She had no recent travel history at home and abroad. Family members and classmates who lived with [her] had no suspected symptoms.

According to statistics from the CDC, as of 27 Nov 2022, there were 6 confirmed cases of paratyphoid fever, all of which were local cases, aged between 10s and 40s. From 2018 to 2021, the cumulative number of local cases was 1, 3, 0, and 1.

_Salmonella enterica_ serotypes Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, and Paratyphi C cause potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening bacteremic illnesses referred to as paratyphoid fever. Humans are the only source of these bacteria; no animal or environmental reservoirs have been identified. Paratyphoid fever is acquired through consumption of water or food contaminated by feces of an acutely infected or convalescent person or a chronic, asymptomatic carrier.

[The specific serotype of the organism is not stated. Paratyphoid fever is like typhoid fever in that both are enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and, rarely now, C. _Salmonella_ Paratyphi, also referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi, types B and C, also have species, now serotypes, Schottmuelleri and Hirschfeldii, respectively. Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish.

In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting for up to 45% of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although initially quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more resistant to quinolones; in contrast, _S._ Typhi has manifested resistance for some time.

In a report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household, such as food from street vendors and flooding.
