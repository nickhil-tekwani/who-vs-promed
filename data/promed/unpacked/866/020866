["Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) infect the respiratory tract, the clinical outcome of which can vary in severity from subclinical to severe respiratory disease. Clinical infection is characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, cough, and mandibular lymphadenopathy. Infection of the respiratory tract with EHV-1 and EHV-4 typically first occurs in foals in the 1st weeks or months of life, but recurrent clinical infections are seen in weanlings, yearlings, and young horses entering training, especially when horses from different sources are commingled. Equine herpesvirus type 1 can cause major outbreaks of abortion in naive mares, the birth of weak nonviable foals, or a sporadic neurologic disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy [EHM]) secondary to lytic infection of endothelial cells resulting in the development of [thrombi] in the small blood vessels supplying the spinal cord and brain."

"Recently, a genetic variant of EHV-1 has been described (defined by a single point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase [DNApol] gene) that is more commonly associated with neurologic disease (EHM). This mutation results in the presence of either aspartic acid (D) or an asparagine (N) residue at position 752. Molecular diagnostic techniques can identify EHV-1 strains carrying these genetic markers. The finding of a neuropathogenic variant of the virus can have implications for the management of EHV-1 outbreaks, or individual horses actively infected with these strains. It is important to understand that both virus genotypes can and do cause neurological disease. However, infection with D752 strains can result in a higher clinical attack rate and a higher case fatality rate. It is estimated that 80-90% of neurological disease is caused by D752 isolates, and 10-20% by N752 isolates. It is possible that 5-10% of all horses normally carry the D752 form (this estimate is based on limited studies at this time). In the face of an active outbreak of EHV-1 disease, identification of a D752 isolate may be grounds for increased concern about the risk of development of neurological disease" (Source: American Association of Equine Practitioners https://aaep.org/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/equine-herpesvirus-rhinopneumonitis).

It is unknown if this case in Norway is linked to the current outbreak in Europe, where several countries have confirmed cases since February 2021; see ProMED reports below.

The latest information (updates, timeline, reports) on the outbreak of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1, neurological form) in Europe, which originated in Valencia, Spain in February 2021, is available on the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) website at https://inside.fei.org/fei/ehv-1. - Mod.CRD
