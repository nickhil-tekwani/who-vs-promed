A total of 408 cases of the hand, foot and mouth disease have been reported
in Sibu Division so far this year. About 302 cases were reported in this
district alone. The others are in Mukah, Dalat and Kanowit districts. State
Assistant Minister of Environment and Public Health Dr Soon Choon Teck said
109 cases were reported in the division this month. "There had been one
casualty and 90 children aged between a few months and six years were
referred to the Sibu Hospital but 87 of them had been discharged," he told
a media conference on Wednesday. Dr Soon said parents need not panic as
the disease was under control, judging from the number of children who had
recovered. He said the disease was not uncommon here but nobody could tell
when it would become serious. "For instance in 1997 the situation was
serious with 3559 cases but dropped to 458 cases in 1988 and only 65 in
1999," he said.
Lately, it was showing an increase statewide but this is not a cause for
concern as all cases had been investigated and taken care of, he said. Dr
Soon advised parents not to send their sick children to school but instead
take them to the doctor. They should take them to the nearest hospital as
soon as possible for treatment if their sickness persisted, he added.
