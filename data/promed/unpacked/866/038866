The war against the bacterial equine disease glanders in Bahrain --
which is believed to have claimed 126 [equine] victims -- is almost
won, according to ministry officials.

But international expert Dr Ulrich Wernery -- who predicted it would
take a year to rid the island of the scourge -- is urging caution and
believes there is a discrepancy over the number of destroyed animals.

The Ministry of Municipalities Affairs & Agriculture claims that
every horse that has tested positive has been destroyed, and
currently all horses and ponies on the island are being re-tested to
ensure Bahrain is completely free of the disease.

Since May [2010], all equine shows have been cancelled, movement
between stables suspended and horse trading banned to prevent the
spread of the highly-contagious condition, which is incurable and can
lead to its victims suffering an agonising illness and eventual
death. Some animals, however, can carry glanders and show no symptoms
for several months.

Dr Salman Abdul Nabi Alkuzaei, Assistant Under-Secretary for
Agriculture Affairs, said: "We have now begun re-testing the
'negative' horses. We sent a completed report to the international
authority, Office International des Epizooties (World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE)) in Paris, France, and have received a reply
allowing us to lift the ban of horse trade in Bahrain. By the end of
October [2010], the ban will be lifted, and things will become normal
once again."

The authorities would welcome Bahrain being declared officially
"glanders free" before an international agriculture exhibition is
staged here in November 2010 and the start of the regional racing
season, which would normally attract entries from the kingdom's
leading stables [see commentary].

Dr Wernery, scientific director of the Central Veterinary Research
Laboratory (CVRL) based in Dubai, was called in by the government in
mid-May 2010 to give his expert opinion about the spread of the
disease, which had already led to several horses and ponies being
destroyed, stables installing special precautions and public
demonstrations of anger.

He said: "There were a total of 4050 horses in Bahrain, and every
single one of them was tested. Of this, 126 horses were positive with
the disease, which equals to 3 per cent of the total horse
population. From government veterinarians, we have come to know that
53 of the affected horses have been killed. However, we are not quite
sure about the remaining 73. We have heard that some owners have
refused to hand over their horses because they are not receiving any
form of compensation."

The 2 bodies are also in dispute over whether glanders has spread
into the camel population in Bahrain. Dr Wernery claims 3 camels have
tested positive which had been living in close proximity to horses
carrying the disease.

He said: "This was a very interesting find for me as a scientist,
because it rarely happens. There are around 2000 camels in Bahrain,
and we are not 100 per cent sure how many are affected. My personal
view is that they should all be tested."

One sick camel was destroyed by a veterinarian in Bahrain; a post
mortem was carried out, and samples were sent to the CVRL in Dubai.
Dr Wernery said: "We isolated the bacteria from the camel, which had
shown very typical clinical signs of the disease, and confirmed the
bacteria identification through an independent laboratory in Europe.
We also tested around 60 donkeys from the same premises, but they
were all negative. There have been cases in the past where donkeys
have been affected, but it was camels in this instance."

The Bahrain authorities strongly dispute his conclusions. Dr Salman
said: "It may have been some seasonal disease that people have got
confused with glanders."

Many horse and stable owners on the island are furious that no
compensation was offered to owners of animals which had tested
positive to glanders, and others have voiced concern that not all
riders have kept horses in secure paddocks during the outbreak.

Horse-loving businesswoman Britta Tappendorf, 39, from Barbar, even
created a page on the social networking site Facebook entitled "Stop
Glanders in Bahrain." She lost a horse to the disease from her
collection of 7.

She said: "There are still instances of glanders, and I know of
someone who just recently lost a horse to the disease. The man from
Tubli bought it thinking that the island was clear of the disease,
but it started showing odd symptoms and soon fell ill. The horse was
bought from Salmabad, and its owner had hidden the fact that it had
glanders. It would appear some people are willing to sell off horses
carrying the disease because they know they will receive no
government compensation and cannot afford the losses."

Strict rules are still in place at the Dilmun Stables, which has been
glanders-free throughout the outbreak, thanks partly to its
isolation. Visitors must soak their shoes in a disinfectant wash
before entering the premises.

Manager Lisa Powick welcomes the news that all horses on the island
will be undergoing a compulsory 2nd test. "Nothing would make me
happier than to see Bahrain rid of this disease."

She believes it would be helpful if the testing process could be
speeded up, because it can currently take 3 weeks to receive results.

According to Dr Wernery's team, the disease entered Bahrain as a
result of a "known infected horse" being brought unwittingly into the
kingdom from Kuwait. Dr Salman says the government is now enforcing
"stricter regulations" to ensure this incident can never be repeated.

Officials also say "no promises" were made over the compensation
issue, and none was included in the BD 150 000 [USD 397 825] set
aside by the cabinet to fight the disease.

[On 22 Aug 2010, Bahrain submitted to the OIE its follow-up report No
2 on glanders, declaring the event, which had started on 12 Apr 2010,
as "resolved". The report included the following epidemiological
comments:

"All horses positive to CFT were euthanized as well as 10 doubtful
cases. Retesting (complement fixation test [CFT] and c-ELISA) was
performed on 650 horses in the area of the outbreaks with negative
results. Camels that lived with horses were also checked, and 62
samples were taken and sent to the Central Veterinary Research
Laboratory (CVRL) to be tested for CFT and c-ELISA. Two cases were
also tested by mallein test. They were all negative" (see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9624>.).

According to Article 12.10.2 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
a country may be considered free from glanders when: "1. glanders is
notifiable in the country; 2. no case of glanders has been reported
during the past 3 years, or no case has been reported for a period of
at least 6 months and a surveillance programme is in place
demonstrating the absence of the disease in accordance with general
recommendations on animal health surveillance".

Animals that test positive for glanders are euthanised except in
endemic areas. In an outbreak, the premises should be quarantined,
thoroughly cleaned, and disinfected. All contaminated bedding and
food should be burned or buried, and equipment and other fomites
should be disinfected. Carcasses should be burned or buried. Whenever
possible, susceptible animals should be kept away from contaminated
premises for several months (see "Prevention" in ref. 1).

For the "recommendations on animal health surveillance", subscribers
are referred to chapter 1.4 of the Code, at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.1.4.htm#chapitre_1.1.4>.

Glanders is an important zoonotic disease. According to CDC, its
causative agent, _Burkholderia mallei_, is a potential agent for
biological warfare and of biological terrorism. It was used by
Germany against Allied forces during World War I, and again in World
War II by Japanese forces. It has also been suggested that _B mallei_
was used on a limited basis against the mujahideen in Afghanistan in
the 1980's. For additional information, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/glanders/>.

The major known animal hosts for _B. mallei_ are horses, mules and
donkeys, but other species of mammals, such as dogs, cats, goats,
sheep and camels have reportedly been infected. Members of the cat
family seem to be particularly susceptible to this disease. Cattle,
pigs and birds are highly resistant to this disease. (Ref 1).

It will help if the information on the glanders case in a Bahraini
camel is officially confirmed. If Prof. Wernery has been cited
accurately, his information deserves to be seriously considered,
regarding both animal and human health. Prof. Ulrich Wernery is one
of the 2 OIE-recognised glanders experts, worldwide.
