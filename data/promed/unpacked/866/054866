Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 12 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 11
Sheep/goats (mixed herd) / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 2

[I agree with the supposition that, as the animals are housed, and it being winter, they were fed contaminated feed or fomites. Canadian experience has shown us that hay and silage can get contaminated by the unknowing folding in of dead animals during haymaking, or from contaminated bloody hay. The inclusion of contaminated soil is not unknown. Contaminated livestock feed and minerals were not uncommon in pre-Mad Cow days and especially in the Soviet times.

When examining possible contaminated feed, if they come up negative on the 1st laboratory pass, it is worth retrying after diluting the feed and especially any mineral mix. Back in 1972, I investigated an anthrax outbreak at a government institute, and the feed and mineral supplements came up negative. Twenty years later, my able colleague Peter Turnbull revisited the mineral mix, diluted it x400, and bingo! There it was at 200 spores/gm. For reference, see the citation below.

My then-graduate student Kimothy Smith confirmed these findings in our lab at LSU.

With heartfelt thanks to my colleague Mod.CRD. - Mod.MHJ
