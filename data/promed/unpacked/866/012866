[This is the 1st official OIE report notifying MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in an African country. All previous reports came from Asian countries as follows (with year of 1st report):

Qatar, 2013; Oman, 2014; Kuwait, 2014; Iran, 2014; Saudi Arabia, 2016; Jordan, 2016.

Dromedary camels have been confirmed by several studies to be the reservoir of the MERS-CoV infection in humans. Zoonotic transmissions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans were reported on multiple occasions. MERS-CoV has never been reported as a disease in camels, though in experimental infections MERS-CoV has been associated with mild upper respiratory signs. Positive PCR results for MERS-CoV or isolation of the virus from camels are notifiable to the OIE because MERS is an emerging disease with a significant public health impact.

The MERS-CoV case definition for reporting to OIE, updated in May 2017, follows:
1. Confirmed case
"A dromedary camel with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, with or without clinical signs."
2. Suspected case
"Observed clinical signs of mild respiratory infection (rhinitis in young dromedaries); and
direct epidemiologic links with a confirmed human or camel MERS-CoV case; and
testing for MERS-CoV is unavailable, negative or inconclusive on a single inadequate specimen."

As indicated by the submitters, the above OIE report from Kenya is based upon laboratory findings obtained within research projects in Kenya. The report names 2 foreign laboratories which provided the published diagnoses, one in Germany (test date 8 Dec 2017) and the other one in China (test date 1 Mar 2018).

The 2 laboratories contributed to the publication of the 2 following papers:
1. Kiambi S, Corman VM, Sitawa R, Githinji J, et al. Detection of distinct MERS-Coronavirus strains in dromedary camels from Kenya, 2017. Emerging Microbes & Infections 2018 7:1, 1-4. DOI: 10.1038/s41426-018-0193-z; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41426-018-0193-z.pdf.
The respective laboratory: Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany.
2. Ommeh S, Zhang W, Zohaib A, et al. Genetic evidence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and widespread seroprevalence among camels in Kenya. Virol Sin 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-018-0076-4 (this paper was reviewed in 20190105.6240916).
The respective laboratory: CAS Key Laboratory for Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.

The latter paper included the following final remark:

"We predict that MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels has low pathogenicity in humans, and neutralization antibody levels either decreased quickly or were undetectable in the neutralization assay; 2nd, other coronaviruses are closely related to MERS-CoV but distinct at the virus neutralization epitopes. Additional studies focusing on surveillance in humans, other wildlife species, and camels are needed to determine the prevalence of MERS-CoV in the general Kenyan population and identify the risk factors of infection." - Mod.AS
