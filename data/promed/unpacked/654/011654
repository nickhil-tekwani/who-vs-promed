Two people in South Hall are receiving treatment after coming in contact with a rabid cat, Hall County [Georgia, USA] officials said.

Officials reported 2 rabies incidents on opposite ends of the county. The 1st incident involved a rabid raccoon and a dog around Lee Road in North Hall.

"The 2nd incident occurred in the Muskie Lanie area of south Hall County following contact between a cat and 2 people," Hall County spokeswoman Katie Crumley wrote in a news release.

Both the raccoon and cat tested positive for rabies at the Georgia Public Health Lab in Decatur. The 2 incidents mark the 5th and 6th confirmed cases for the year [2016] in Hall County.

Anyone noticing an animal acting abnormally should call Hall County Animal Services at 770-531-6830 or dispatch at 770-536-8812 during non-working hours.

[Hall County is in northeast Georgia, equidistant from North and South Carolina, and northeast of Atlanta; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/states/georgia.gif.

The raccoon presumably had a raccoon rabies virus and the cat may have gotten infected from playing with a sick rabid bat. Remember to keep your companion animals up to date on their rabies shots, and that goes for veterinarians too. It is better to be vaccinated before you say, "Oh, shoot." - Mod.MHJ
