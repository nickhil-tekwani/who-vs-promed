On 13 Dec 2006, 2 German patients with severe falciparum malaria after
returning from Goa were reported to TropNetEurop
(<http://www.tropnet.net>). Possibly coincidentally, we currently see an
increase of malaria reports from India in our network, see page 3 of the
current network report
(<http://www.tropnet.net/reports_friends/pdf_reports_friends/nov06_dengue2006_friends.pdf>).
Since December 2006 we have been watching the situation closely and asked
our members to report additional cases. The new case from Denmark was
reported yesterday. As yet, TropNetEurop centers have not discussed a
change of their malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations for travel to
India (see
<http://www.tropnet.net/publications/pdf_publications/Behrens_2006_MalarJ.pdf>).
These may be modified if further cases are observed.

[After the above report was submitted, a 4th case from Sweden also imported
from Goa was reported by Dr Jelinek through TropNetEurope. Falciparum
malaria is a serious, potentially life-threatening infection which needs
prompt treatment. A cluster of 4 cases in returning European travellers,
within a short time period, points to the present high risk of _P.
falciparum_ infection.
Malaria prophylaxis should probably be recommended for visits to Goa until
further notice. A comment from the Indian Ministry of Health will be much
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
