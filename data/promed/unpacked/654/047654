Bovine TB: 33 farms under restrictions
--------------------------------------
Several cases of bovine tuberculosis [bTB] have been detected in the Austrian Vorarlberg regions. 20 cows and calves had to be slaughtered and the test results for 100 more dairy cows are awaited.

TB was confirmed on 9 farms; one farm had all its stock slaughtered because one animal had open lesions. A further 24 holdings are under restriction as contacts. The animals shared pasture with the infected animals and are now awaiting a 2nd test.

Infection is from animal to animal, and the bacterium can be transmitted through inhalation or contaminated water or feed.

The highest risk for humans is milk from infected animals. Mycobacteria are killed by pasteurisation. It can take years for an infected individual to show symptoms, like coughing or emaciation.

Infection can occur between humans and animals and vice versa. _Mycobacterium bovis_, the causative agent of cattle TB, occurs in cattle worldwide.

In Europe, the incidence of disease has currently increased in Spain, Ireland, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, according to the German Federal Ministry.

Many countries are free from bTB, which means that, according to the EU definition, at least 99.9 percent of the cattle farms of a country are free from TB. Germany is considered free of tuberculosis. Nevertheless, according to FLI, the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, on a few holdings animals are found to be infected.

Six cattle farms in Tirol under TB restrictions
-----------------------------------------------
After TB was detected on farms in Vorarlberg, now 6 cattle holdings in Tirol [Tyrol] are under restrictions. 2 holdings are located in the district of Landeck and 2 in Ausserfern.

According to Paul Ortner of the district veterinary office, there are confirmed cases of tuberculosis as well as suspects. So far, testing in Landeck revealed 3 positive animals.

The disease was detected in the early stages, while a case in Vorarlberg had open lesions.

All animals tested positive are from a region bordering Vorarlberg or have been grazing in Vorarlberg last summer.

Hunters are tested for tuberculosis
-----------------------------------
After several cases of TB have been detected in cattle over the last weeks, 19 hunters will be tested as a precaution. According to the health authorities this is a routine measure.

The hunters in question are from TB affected regions and had been in contact with red deer (shooting, cutting up carcasses). They have to undergo a blood test.

The reason for surveillance is a case of clinical disease of a cow resulting in the depopulation of the holding.

[4] Vorarlberg, hunting season regulated

Josef Moosbrucker, president of the chamber of agriculture, is pleased that the hunting community will help to combat TB and increase shooting of TB infected red deer.

"I thank (head of county hunters) Reinhard Metzler for his clear statement," said Moosbrugger on Friday [19 Feb 2016], referring to the announcements Metzler made on Vorarlberg Today.

Hunters start hunting deer in March [2016]
------------------------------------------
The head of Vorarlberg hunters had stated in the interview that a "massive intervention" was necessary to deal with the TB infected deer population and announced measures. Among other things, the hunting season will start much earlier this spring [2016]: in March already.

"That's of the utmost importance for the grazing period. A smaller red deer population will reduce the contact between cattle and deer, and thus also the risk of infection."

Moosbrugger hopes that with joint efforts the TB situation will improve.

Metzler announced that in addition to the earlier start of the hunting season, no age restrictions will be in place. In practice, this means that every deer, regardless of age or sex, can be shot.

Hunters are increasingly under fire since it was revealed that the hunting quotas are not met, especially in the TB hotspot areas such as in Silbertal. Deer are the main hosts of the disease; almost every 4th animal is infected.

So far the worst case this year [2016] was culling out of a farm in Bartholomaeberg last Monday [15 Feb 2016?], where the entire stock of 18 animals had to be killed. This year 9 farms were already affected, 6 of which were completely restricted.

[_Mycobacterium caprae_ has been identified during recent years in Austrian and German cattle in the alpine region.

According to Austria's semi-annual reports to the OIE since 2013, the following bTB cases have been reported; all within the Alpine region (Tirol and Vorarlberg provinces):
2013: Tirol (2 in February, 1 in October). Vorarlberg (2 in February). Total 5 cases.
2014: Tirol (1 in January, 2 in February). Vorarlberg (6 in February, 1 in March). Total 10.
2015: Tirol (1 in March). Vorarlberg (2 in February, 1 in March). Total 4.

According to Germany's semi-annual reports for the same period:
2013: April (1), May (2), June (1); total 4, locations not given.
2014: February (1, Niedersachsen), May (1, Saarland); total 2.
2015: February (2), April (1); total 3, locations not given.

Additional diagnosed cases in German bovines, referring to both _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. caprae_, are presented in the reports of the German Federal Research Institute for Animal Health (FLI); http://tsis.fli.bund.de/Reports/Info_SO.aspx?ts=204 (in German).

As indicated in the commentary of posting 20130317.1590824 (2013), "the role of wildlife as bTB reservoirs has become a matter of discussion between farmers and the organized hunters. During the winter months, red deer are kept and fed in enclosures. This leads to rather crowded conditions and a massive increase in the deer population and to weaker deer (infected with TB?) since animals which would otherwise die somewhere in the Alps during the winter, are kept alive and might become an ongoing source of infection. One of the sites suspected to enhance infection are the mentioned enclosures, where sometimes young cattle are housed for several days to become adapted to the Alps."

The above comment is in line with the results of a study in the Alpine Region by a team composed of Austrian, German, Italian and Swiss researchers (Ref 1; thanks to Sabine Zentis), from which the abstract and conclusions are presented.

1. Abstract
"To estimate the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the Alpine region, we studied the epidemiology of _Mycobacterium caprae_ in wildlife during the 2009-2012 hunting seasons. Free-ranging red deer (_Cervus elaphus_) were a maintenance host in a hot-spot area, mainly located in Austria."

2. The authors concluded (references omitted):
"Supplementary feeding is common in the hotspot area to prevent migration and to keep red deer populations high. In the hot-spot area, the overall density is 5.6 animals/sq km but because of aggregation, which is considered the main cause of bovine tuberculosis maintenance in wildlife, winter habitats of red deer around feeding sites have up to 46.2 animals/sq km km2. Low (0.5-2.5 and 2-4/sq km) or medium densities (9.7 deer/sq km) with prevalence estimates of 0 percent were found in Switzerland. Brescia, the only place in Italy where _M. caprae_ was found in red deer, is considered a high-density region (16 animals/sq km), but management strategies promoting aggregation are largely absent in Italy and Switzerland. Furthermore, red deer in the hot-spot area are a reservoir for bovine tuberculosis and are the source of _M. caprae_ infections for domestic cattle grazing on Alpine pastures during the summer. Molecular-epidemiologic studies indicate that _M. caprae_ isolates from red deer and cattle are of the same genotype.

"Our finding that retropharyngeal lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes were often the primary site of infection suggests oral rather than aerosol transmission. Oral transmission does not require direct contact, either among red deer or between red deer and cattle."

According to chapter 2.4.7 ("Bovine tuberculosis") of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (updated 2009), _M. caprae_ is "known to be zoonotic. In central Europe, _M. caprae_ has been identified as a common cause of bovine tuberculosis. Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_ and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis" (see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf).

The national and international consequences of the described situation are a matter for clarification (comment in 20130317.1590824).
