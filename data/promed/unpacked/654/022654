[1] Thailand: suspected case to undergo post mortem

A thorough post-mortem will be carried out on the body of a
60-year-old man from the northeastern province of Nong Bua Lam Phu to
find out if he was infected with H5N1 avian flu virus, according to
the Thai Public Health Ministry's epidemiology bureau. If the result,
due in 2 weeks, comes back positive, the man would be the country's
17th bird flu fatality.
The man fell ill and was admitted to a local hospital last week
shortly after many of his backyard chickens died of unknown causes.
Laboratory tests showed that he was infected with a bacterium, not
the influenza virus. However, his condition continued to deteriorate
until he died on Thursday [10 Aug 2006], said Vipon Ratchtapongtorn,
Deputy Director of Nong Bua Lam Phu Hospital. Kamnuan Ungchusak,
Director of the Epidemiology Bureau, said the case was "uncommon," as
the man died from flu-like symptoms despite testing negative for
influenza [viruses].
"A thorough disease investigation is urgently needed in this case,"
said Dr Kamnuan, adding that the bureau would send a team of experts
to Nong Bua Lam Phu today to carry out the post-mortem. The doctors
would also collect tissue samples from the victim.
According to the Livestock Development Department (LDD), there were
reports of poultry dying en masse in 15 tambons in the province.
Seven samples tested negative for H5N1, while results for the other 8
tambons were pending.
In Bangkok, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's (BMA) bird flu
control and surveillance centre said another 2 villagers had been put
on the city's bird flu surveillance list -- a 56-year-old woman from
Bang Sue district and a 5-year-old girl from Nong Khaem district. The
BMA also revealed that 6 fighting cocks in Phaya Thai district died
of unknown causes on Thursday [10 Aug 2006], prompting officials to
put the area under quarantine for 10 days and to send the carcasses
for bird flu diagnosis at the LDD's National Institute of Animal
Health. Director of the LDD's disease control bureau Nirundorn
Aungtragoolsuk played down fears of a re-emergence of bird flu in the
city, saying that the examination of chicken carcasses from Phaya
Thai district showed they did not die from H5N1. The fighting cocks
died from another disease because they did not suffer internal lung
and kidney bleeding, which was a common symptom in bird flu-infected
fowl, said Dr Nirundorn.
State zoos countrywide have been told to step up bird flu prevention
measures to ensure their wild animals do not contract the virus. The
measures include covering bird cages with large plastic sheets to
prevent contact with pigeons and crows, which might be carriers of
H5N1. The zoos will also no longer feed animals with raw chicken to
avoid possible bird flu infections. In 2004, a number of tigers at a
private zoo in Chon Buri died from bird flu. Veterinarians suspected
they contracted the virus from raw chickens they ate. State zoos
might be temporarily closed if the outbreak intensified, said Sopon
Damnui, governor of the Zoological Park Organisation.

[2] China: delayed confirmation of 1st case due to communications problems
Date: Thu 10 Aug 2006
From: Joseph P. Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>

A Chinese health official said on Thursday [10 Aug 2006] that
communication problems were behind China's 2.5-year delay in
reporting the country's 1st human case of H5N1 avian influenza. China
on Tuesday acknowledged that a 24-year-old soldier based in Beijing
had contracted bird flu in late 2003, confirming details disclosed by
Chinese researchers in June letter to a U.S. medical journal.
Previously, the government had said the 1st case had occurred at the
end of 2005, and the delay in reporting the earlier case has prompted
the U.N.'s health agency to call for greater transparency.
"This issue has exposed problems in our scientific research
organisations," Jiang Zuojun, Vice Minister of Health, said at a news
conference. China now has confirmed 20 cases, 13 of which were fatal,
including the 2003 case that was confirmed on Tuesday [8 Aug 2006],
the WHO announced. The virus has killed 137 people worldwide since 2003.
China's Health Ministry had said military scientists first tested the
soldier and found he had been infected with HN51 but did not tell the
Health Ministry until much later. "Their communications with disease
prevention organisations should be strengthened in future," Jiang said.
China confirmed the case only after Chinese researchers published a
letter in the New England Journal of Medicine in June saying a
soldier, who had died after being admitted to hospital in November
2003 for respiratory distress and pneumonia, had been infected with
H5N1. Subsequent tests in cooperation with the World Health
Organisation (WHO) confirmed the researchers' findings. WHO stated
that the soldier was the 1st confirmed case in the world's present
outbreak, preceding a case in Vietnam.
The case of the soldier had spurred questions on whether other human
H5N1 infections in China had developed prior to its 1st reported
human case, near the end of 2005. Jiang said there were no recorded
cases of bird flu prior to the soldier because there were no data. He
said the soldier's disease was initially a puzzle only confirmed as
bird flu by lengthy tests. "At the time, we had incomplete standards
for diagnosis... From the data we have at hand, which starts from
2003, that was the first case," he said.
The scientists' findings were one of the clearest indications yet
that the virus might have been present in the vast country for much
longer than had been reported. Experts in Hong Kong have long
insisted that the virus has long been present in mainland China, but
Chinese authorities have denied that.

[ProMED-mail has reported previously on 8 Aug 2006 that the World
Health Organization (WHO) had announced that the Ministry of Health
in China had retrospectively confirmed a fatal human case of H5N1
infection; see parts 1 & 2 of ProMED-mail post entitled: Avian
influenza, human (115): multicountry 20060808.2223 and
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_08_08/en/index.html>.
The case is the military serviceman described above, now considered
to be the earliest known instance of human H5N1 infection in mainland
China. This retrospectively confirmed case has been added to the WHO
Cumulative Table of Laboratory Confirmed Cases and brings
thecumulative total number of human H5N1 cases in China to 20, of
which13 have been fatal.
Dr Dudley, however, has pointed out the following inaccuracies in
these statements that deserve correction and comment.
Firstly, the November 2003 case cited above is not the 1st
WHO-recognized, laboratory-confirmed case in China during 2003.
During February of that year, 2 human H5N1 cases (one fatal) from a
family cluster were confirmed in Hong Kong during February 2003,
after a 3rd family member died in Fujian province from a suspected
but undiagnosed case; see, Peiris, J.S., et al. Re-emergence of fatal
human influenza A subtype H5N1 disease. Lancet. 2004 Feb
21;363(9409):582-3, and Edwards, L.E. Antigenic characteristics of
recent avian influenza A H5N1 viruses isolated from humans.

Avian Influenza Timeline
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_15.02.pdf>.
Secondly, the November 2003 case in China occurred after the date of
the 1st known H5N1 fatality in Viet Nam, which was confirmed
retroactively from a child who died in Hanoi on 31 Oct 2003.

This Moderator does not disagree with Joe Dudley's observations, but
considers that these inaccuracies may in part be a product of the
changing status of Hong Kong from British colony to SAR of China
during this period. Perhaps it is time to resolve the discrepancy? - Mod.CP]

[3] Indonesia: open access decision
Date: Fri 11 Aug 2006

The scientific community may soon have a clearer picture of what is
going on with the H5N1 avian flu virus in Indonesia, the country
which most concerns many experts following the worrisome virus. After
hoarding for months the genetic blueprints of the viruses isolated
from both poultry and people, Indonesian officials have done an
about-face and are sharing a large number of both avian and human
viral isolates. A scientist with the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organization confirmed Thursday that Indonesia recently sent 91 avian
viruses to the Geelong Laboratory in Australia, a reference lab for the FAO.
Last week the country's health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari,
announced that Indonesia wanted the genetic sequences of all the
viruses isolated from human cases in Indonesia to be put into
open-access databases where any scientist could study them. The
ability to compare the viruses spreading through bird populations to
the ones that have jumped into people should provide badly needed
insight into the H5N1 situation in Indonesia, where investigators
have often been stumped trying to determine how people contracted the
virus. A number of investigations have shown few if any links between
human cases and infected birds.
Sequence data for viruses isolated from about 40 human cases have in
recent days been placed in public-access databases. When the World
Health Organization learned Indonesia was willing to share the data,
it asked the 2 laboratories that had sequenced the viruses for
Indonesia to put the information into the public domain. Up until
then the data had been stored in a password-protected database
accessible only to scientists working for the WHO or for laboratories
that do this type of work for the organization. Last Friday,
scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
transferred the data into the open-access database housed by the U.S.
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, whose
computers also host the password-protected databank. The CDC was also
in the process of logging the material into a 2nd public-access
database, Genbank, the Director of the agency's influenza division,
Dr. Nancy Cox, said earlier this week. The 2nd laboratory, at the Un!
iversity of Hong Kong, is run by noted influenza expert Dr. Malik
Peiris. In an interview Thursday, he confirmed that his team put the
data into the Los Alamos database last Saturday.
As for the human isolates, Peiris said there is a lot of overlap
between the viruses his lab sequenced and the work done by the CDC.
Peiris said the viruses isolated from human cases showed no evidence
of having swapped genes -- the process is called reassortment -- with
flu viruses from humans, pigs or other mammals. Reassortment is one
of the ways an avian flu virus could acquire the ability to spread
easily to and among people, a development that would lead to a flu pandemic.
"There isn't anything (evident in the human isolates) that rings
particular alarm bells as such," Peiris said. But he suggested the
viruses that infected people in Indonesia are only one part of the
picture of what is going on there. "It is probably important to have
more avian virus sequences from the same geographical areas where the
human cases are coming from," he said from Hong Kong.
