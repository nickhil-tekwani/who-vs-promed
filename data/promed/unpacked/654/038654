The H5N1 strain of bird flu virus has been found in dozens of dead birds in
Russia's southern province of Volgograd, officials in the province told
AFP. "Today the provincial veterinary laboratory confirmed the presence of
the H5N1 virus in the blood of dead birds" found at a farmyard at the
village of Vesyoly, a statement from the Volgograd provincial
administration said.
Preventive work including disinfection is being carried out and 2 million
doses of bird flu vaccine have been sent to the province from Moscow, the
statement said.
Russia's chief veterinarian warned last week that bird flu was posing a
growing threat to the country. "In 2005 the virus affected 62 towns in 10
Russian regions, while since the start of 2006, already 56 towns in nine
regions have been affected," Sergei Dankvert said at a veterinarians'
conference.
The outbreak in Volgograd follows outbreaks in several other parts of
southern Russia as well as in nearby Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia.

On 31 Mar 2006 the Danish Veterinary and Food Research Institute detected
high pathogenic avian influenza (H5) in 2 wild birds from 2 locations:
- in a tufted duck (_Aythya fuligula_) found near Skaelskor in Western
Zealand County.
- in a mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) found dead near Vang on the island Bornholm.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration is implementing measures in
accordance with Commission Decision 2006/115/EC including establishing
protection and surveillance zones on both locations.

[The Island of Bornholm has been added today to the territories with
affected wildlife; see also the updated map on the same website.
The meticulous Danish surveillance is helpful in obtaining a clearer
picture of the H5N1 situation in wildlife in Northern Europe. It may be
assumed that similar situation might prevail in other countries.
A screening programme for avian influenza in domestic fowl has been
operational in Denmark since 2002; throughout the said period and to the
present day, the Danish poultry industry has remained free of HPAI. Details
of the screening programme, including number and size of sampled pools and
the testing results, are available on the said website. - Mod.AS]

[3] Israel, 9th outbreak

Israel began culling 20 000 chickens on Friday [31 Mar 2006] which are
believed to have been exposed to the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus at a
collective farm in southern Israel, a government official said.
Moshe Chaimovitz, head of the Israeli Agricultural Ministry's veterinary
service, told Reuters that tests showed the presence of H5N1 at Kibbutz
Kerem Shalom, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip and Egypt. "We are
checking into how the outbreak occurred," he said.
Israel has culled more than 1.2 million turkeys and chickens in several
other farms after detecting the H5N1 virus for the first time in Israel
early in March 2006. There have been no human cases.
Agriculture Minister Zeev Boim said on Sunday that the disease had been
eradicated, but that another flare-up was possible. The Israeli government
approved compensation of 15 million shekels (USD 3.1 million) to farmers of
affected areas.
The H5N1 strain has also been confirmed in poultry in the densely populated
Gaza Strip.
In a show of cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,
Israel has carried out testing on birds on behalf of the Palestinians and
said it would supply Palestinian teams with protective clothing and
professional assistance. Cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority is becoming increasingly rare as the militant Islamist Hamas
movement swore in its government this week after winning an election in
January.
The H5N1 virus has spread from Asia to the Middle East, Europe and Africa
in recent months, with migratory birds seen as the main culprits in
spreading bird flu.

[Kerem Shalom is situated on the southern tip of the Gaza strip and the
Egyptian border (Map <http://www.eyeonisrael.com/>, go to square 9), rather
near the first outbreaks in Israel, in Ein Hashlosha and Holit, 2 weeks ago
(15-16 Mar 2006).
8 of the outbreaks, including the current one, are close to the Gaza strip
or might have had contacts among them. One outbreak, in the Jordan valley
(Beqaot), is rather distant while sharing the same ecological/geographic
situation, and a major flyway, with the affected location in neighbouring
Jordan. - Mod.AS]
