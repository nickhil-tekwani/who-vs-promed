2003/092 Surveys on viruses and viroids of stone fruits in Syria
----------------------------------------------------------------
Stone fruits are important crops in Syria, particularly in southern and
central parts of the country (total area is about 82 759 ha with an annual
production of 257 000 tonnes). Surveys for stone fruit viruses and viroids
were undertaken in 7 Syrian Governorates (Damascus, Daraa, Al Swidaa, Homs,
Hama, Edleb, and Aleppo) representing the main stone fruit-growing areas.
Samples were collected from private and commercial orchards, varietal
collections, and national mother blocks used for seed and budwood
production and tested (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
herbaceous and woody indicators, dot-blot). 1 337 samples were tested (444
apricot, 283 peach, 246 cherry, 222 almond, and 142 plum).
The overall infection rate was 13 per cent (peach 24 per cent, cherry 16
per cent, almond 13.5 per cent, apricot 6 per cent, plum 5 per cent).
The following pathogens were detected: prunus necrotic ringspot ilarvirus,
prune dwarf ilarvirus, apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus, plum pox
potyvirus (PPV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest), apple mosaic ilarvirus (EPPO A2
quarantine pest), peach latent mosaic pelamoviroid, and hop stunt
hostuviroid. Plum pox potyvirus (PPV-M strain) was detected in 1 apricot
tree. PPV had previously been reported from Syria, but it seems that the
destruction of infected trees carried out by local institutions was
effective in controlling the disease.
It was concluded that the sanitary situation of stone-fruit trees in Syria
was generally satisfactory but implementation of national certification
programmes was considered desirable.

[Presumably many of the trees have been established for many years, hence
it is not unreasonable that several viruses and viroids would be detected.
It is gratifying that an array of diagnostic tests (ELISA, indicator plants
and dot blots) are being used in disease diagnosis. - Mod.DH]
