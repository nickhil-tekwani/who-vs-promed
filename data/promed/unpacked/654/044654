A viral outbreak has decimated Grand Forks' [British Columbia] bighorn sheep population, according to a non-profit society dedicated to supporting sheep in the wild.

Peter Gutsche, director of the Wild Sheep Society of BC, said more than 20 bighorns were found dead near the city Wednesday morning [25 Aug 2021].

The death toll is likely to rise as society volunteers continue to search the area, Gutsche added.

The suspected culprit is a hemorrhagic disease commonly known as bluetongue, named after the swelling it causes in its oxygen-starved victims.

Bluetongue is a prolific killer of white-tailed deer in the United States and Southern Canada but is also known to kill free-ranging bighorns in the Okanagan and Kootenay areas, according to a BC Government fact sheet. The disease is spread by so-called "no-see-ums," tiny biting flies that prefer the warm, dry temperatures that see bighorns congregating around watering holes every year between August and October.

Infected deer have been shown to lose their fear of humans and stop eating within a week of exposure. The disease causes extensive internal bleeding, causing infected animals to lose their balance. Death usually follows within 2 to 3 days of the onset of symptoms.

The virus does not affect humans but can infect some domestic animals. Domestic animals infected with the virus typically don't develop Bluetongue disease, the fact sheet explained.

[Bighorn sheep populations are often affected by outbreaks of pneumonia. Bluetongue has been reported less frequently. Bluetongue virus is capable of inducing a severe hemorrhagic disease with high mortality in domestic and wild ruminants, including domestic sheep, bighorn sheep (_Ovis canadensis_), white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_). - Mod.PMB
