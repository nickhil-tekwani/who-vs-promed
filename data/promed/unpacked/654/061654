Comment on the Feasibility of Control of Human Rabies by Dog Restraint
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[The following is a response provoked by the Moderator's comment appended
to the last post in this thread that: "Under the prevailing circumstances,
the leashing or muzzling of dogs would be a more cost-effective interim
method of protecting both the dog population and the human population in
the absence of adequate supplies of animal and human vaccines."
This is the second time this bizarre suggestion has been advanced, and I'm
getting the impression that the moderator [there were 2 in question has
never visited any part of the world where street dogs are a regular part of
the urban habitat, or never paid any serious attention to how the dogs live.
Most of the dogs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and much of the rest of
Asia, Africa, and Latin America NEVER had human owners or lived with
people. They are quasi-wildlife, living among people just like pigeons,
rats, squirrels, monkeys, et al.; are mostly much smaller, more
intelligent, and better behaved than American dogs; are an essential part
of the urban sanitation system, such as it is, in cities which are largely
without regular garbage collection, underground sewers, sewage treatment,
or systems for the disposal of animal carcasses; and are also an essential
part of protecting the human population from more dangerous beasts such as
leopards, jaguars, the occasional marauding lion, baboons, and hyenas.
The street dogs of Asia, Africa, and Latin America tend to become dangerous
only when infected by rabies. Exclusive of rabies cases, dogs in India
inflict life-threatening or fatal bites at about a tenth the per capita
rate of U.S. dogs, even though most Indian dogs roam free while most
American dogs are confined most of the time.
Statistics are not as readily available from elsewhere in the
underdeveloped world, but from what I have seen, observing street dogs on
every continent, the free-roaming dogs of most of Africa, Asia, and Latin
America all behave similarly (although the owned watchdogs of South Africa
and Latin America are comparable in size and reactivity to U.S. pit bull
terriers and Rottweilers). There is an effective response to rabies among
street dogs: mass vaccination. Raboral, in particular, works wonders. There
is also a popular but ineffective response: killing dogs, which just opens
habitat, resulting in larger litter sizes among the survivors and as many
dogs as ever within 6 to 8 months after each massacre.
To close the habitat, you'll need to bring sanitation up to First World
standards, which is how the U.S. no longer has the unowned street dogs who
were still ubiquitous as recently as the 1930s. But we haven't totally
closed the habitat, just diminished the food sources to the point that they
now only support feral cats.
Bottom line: You could leash and muzzle every owned dog in Afghanistan (a
handful of trained fighting and herding dogs) and not in the least affect
the rabies vector.

[The offending observation was made in the context of the apparent
inability of the Pakistani Health Authorities to provide adequate supplies
of human vaccine. It seems unlikely that comprehensive canine vaccination
would receive any higher priority.
Although, for the reasons outlined above, dog control could not be
implemented widely, it might be a feasible protective measure in local
situations. It should be remembered that rabies was endemic in Victorian
England and Wales (a period when there was much poverty and social
deprivation), and that attempts at control by detention and destruction of
dogs failed, prior to strict implementation of the Dog Muzzling Orders of
1885 and 1889, which contributed to the eradication of the disease by 1903.
