Health authorities in Niassa province are worried about the increase in deaths from malaria. In the first 3 months of this year [2022], the province recorded 40 deaths from the disease. This represents an increase of around 29% compared with the same period last year [2021], when around 109 000 cases and 34 deaths were recorded.

Director of the provincial health service, Jos√© Manuel, said that the provincial government was developing a strategic plan for the distribution of mosquito nets, with a view to reducing the number of cases. Manuel was speaking this Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] at the 6th ordinary session of the Council and State Representation Service.

[The whole of Mozambique is endemic for malaria. The WHO World Malaria Report 2021 estimated that in 2020 the annual number of malaria cases in Mozambique was between 7 209 000 and 10 007 802 (https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2021). The WHO report also estimated that the annual number of presumed and confirmed cases increased from 3 381 371 in 2010 to 11 331 009 in 2020. Thus it is not surprising that a single province in Mozambique is experiencing an increase in fatal outcomes from malaria. - Mod.EP
