More bighorns killed in effort to stop pneumonia outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
Montana State wildlife officials killed 5 more sick bighorn sheep in
West Riverside on Friday [15 Jan 2009], and planned to continue
attempts to stop a disease outbreak through the weekend. [On 14 Jan
2010, they killed 7. This brings the total to 12. - Mod.TG] A herd of
22 sick bighorn sheep moved back into residential yards at the base of
Woody Mountain, where they've been congregating for months. Department
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) technicians were able to tranquilize
5 and remove them for mercy killing.

"Most of those sheep were coughing and unstable on their feet," FWP
spokeswoman Vivica Crowser said. "But there were still quite a few
that are spry and wary."

Crowser advised residents to leave the sheep alone and call for a game
warden to handle any infected or dead animals. The wild sheep are
dying from a highly infectious strain of pneumonia. While it is not
transmittable to humans or pets, the bighorns are still unpredictable
and unsafe to approach.

FWP technicians have killed 12 bighorns since the disease outbreak was
1st reported on Tuesday [12 Jan 2010]. An aerial survey found about 65
sheep living on or around Woody Mountain, which stands between the
Marshall Mountain Ski Area and the Blackfoot River north of West
Riverside. About 160 to 180 bighorns live in the mountains on either
side of the river north of Bonner.

A similar outbreak killed 77 bighorns in a herd of nearly 225 animals
south of Darby last fall. [Previous news articles place this event in
November of 2009. Please see ProMED-mail 20091126.4055 - Mod.TG]

U.S. Forest Service and Nature Conservancy lands around Woody Mountain
were closed to the public on Friday and will remain so indefinitely so
FWP hunters can safely examine and cull the remaining infected sheep
there, Crowser said. The dead sheep are being examined in a mobile
veterinary lab to confirm the disease diagnosis.
