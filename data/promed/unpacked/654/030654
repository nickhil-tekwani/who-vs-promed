Disease risk to mozzarella output
---------------------------------
The production of one of Italy's best known exports, mozzarella, is
under threat from an infection spreading through herds of water
buffalo. The Italian government has set up an emergency commission to
try and stop the spread of the disease, which affects milk production.

The plains of Campania, around Naples, are home to large buffalo
herds. As much as 30 percent of the herd which live in the shadow of
Mount Vesuvius are reported to be infected. The area is the exalted
home of mozzarella di bufala: not only an essential part of the
Italian diet, but one of Italy's most important exports.

But the Neapolitan farmers who make this famous milky cheese are
facing a crisis. In the next 2 months, the Italian government will
start the slaughter of 32 000 buffalo, infected with Brucellosis -- a
contagious bacterial disease that in livestock leads to abortion,
infertility and reduced milk production.

It can be transmitted through food to humans, causing severe
intermittent fever -- though the milk which produces the cheese is
perfectly safe when it is pasteurised.

Brucellosis has been present in the herd for 10 years. But the
Italian papers say the local vets who are supposed to test and put
down infected animals have been intimidated by the local mafia -- the
Camorra -- who also control some of the farms. Consequently, it is
reported, the disease has been allowed to spread to almost 30 percent
of the herd.

Caserta, one of 2 key mozzarella-producing areas, is the worst
affected. In the coming weeks, armed police will accompany government
vets to help with the cull. They say every infected animal destroyed
will be burnt -- and it is estimated the cost to the Italian
government will be 66m euros (USD 97m; BP 49m).

[Bovine brucellosis, a disease affecting mainly cattle and buffaloes,
is a highly contagious disease caused by _Brucella abortus_. Its
dominant feature is late-term abortion and infertility in cattle. The
disease is also a serious zoonosis, causing undulant fever in humans.
_B. abortus_ is transmitted to humans mainly in the following 2
routes: by direct contact with affected animals or their
post-partum/post-abortion secretions, or by the ingestion of
contaminated, unpasteurised food products, mainly dairy products.

Brucellosis is an OIE and EU listed, notifiable disease. In Italy,
the following control measures are officially applied: screening,
surveillance, movement control, zoning and stamping out. Vaccination
is prohibited.

According to the most recent (2006) available data on the OIE WAHID
interface, the number of new Italian outbreaks during 2006 was, for
the whole country, 3357 -- of which 387 were in Campania. The other
affected regions were Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Lazio, Molise,
Puglia, Sicilia, Valle D'aosta and Marche.

Cattle and buffaloes can also be infected by _B. melitensis_, a
bacterium mainly infecting goats and sheep and the causative agent of
Malta Fever in humans. It is probable that cross infection into
bovines occur in Italy as well, since _B. melitensis_ is endemic in
the south of the country: during 2006, 4374 new outbreaks were
reported from the 5 heaviest infected regions, of which 383 were in
Campania. The other regions were Basilicata (61), Calabria (663),
Puglia ( 372) and Sicilia (2895).

The requirement to destroy infected animals while refraining from
vaccination is prescribed by EU regulations. - Mod.AS]
