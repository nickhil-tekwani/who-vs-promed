In the past 2 days since the last ProMED update on 16 Apr 2015, there has been only 1 newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported (on 17 Apr 2015). There have been no reports of new fatalities nor of new recoveries during this period.

As of today, 18 Apr 2015 there have been a total of:
979 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia including
427 deaths
548 recoveries and
4 currently active cases

The newly confirmed case on 17 Apr 2015 involved a 65 year old non-healthcare worker, Saudi male reported from Dhuba, who was noted to be in Stable condition. He did not have a history of contact with suspected or confirmed case(s) of MERS-CoV in either the healthcare environment or in the community. No further information on this case was available (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2015-04-17-001.aspx).

[The downward trend of reported cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia continues. As of the most recent ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) tally effective 16 Apr 2015, there have been a total of 1123 cases of MERS-CoV reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 463 deaths (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-18-April-2015.pdf).

In a collaborative effort between the Saudi Ministry of Health, King Saud University, Riyadh, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, the US CDC, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, we are monitoring the evolution and transmission patterns of the MERS-coronavirus. A set of 22 new MERS-CoV sequences from April-November 2014 have just been completed. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis and a link to the sequence data can be found on the Virological MERS-CoV site (http://virological.org/c/mers-coronavirus).

In a collaborative effort between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Ministry of Health, King Saud University, Riyadh, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, the US CDC, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, we are monitoring the evolution and transmission patterns of MERS-CoV

Summary
-------
PCR-positive upper respiratory samples from confirmed MERS cases identified from May-November 2014 in Jeddah and Riyadh, [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] were amplified and subjected to deep sequencing with paired 149 nt Illumina MiSeq data followed by de novo assembly [1,2]. 22 samples yielded phylogenetically useful sequences and 8 samples yielded full MERS-CoV genomes (greater than 28 000 nt). The novel sequences are available at the following link in a simple alignment or as an alignment with all available MERS-CoV genomic data. (https://tinyurl.com/MERS-CoV-15May15)

Disclaimer
----------
We make these sequence data publically available with the hope that they are useful for other scientists and the caveat that they are preliminary and still undergoing quality control. A manuscript analyzing the phylogenetic patterns in more detail is in preparation. If investigators would like to use these sequence data for publication prior to release of our paper, please contact us.

Phylogenetic patterns
---------------------
The recent MERS-CoV sequences fell into 3 main groups [see Figure 1 -- Bayesian phylogeny of 157 MERS-CoV isolates inferred from a multiple sequence alignment of 30055 nucleotides -- available at the source URL]. 6 of the novel Riyadh sequences clustered in the Riyadh_KKUH clade, comprising Riyadh sequences from April 2014 [3], and Indiana_USA_2014 (obtained from a health care worker (HCW) who had worked in Riyadh and then traveled to the USA [4]). A 2nd group of 6 newly generated Riyadh sequences clustered in the Hafr-al-Batin_1 (HAB_1) lineage and also included the 2 most recent sequences from November 2014, both from a single patient. The novel Jeddah sequences form part of the Jeddah_KFH clade and are related to Florida_USA_2014 (from a HCW who had worked in Jeddah and traveled to the USA [4]) and to other published Jeddah sequences from April 2014 [3].

The large Riyadh outbreak in the Spring 2014 appeared to be the result of multiple independent viruses (see also the blue clades 1-6 in [3]). The new sequence data identified an additional MERS-CoV source comprising Riyadh_KKUH_104_25Apr14, Riyadh_KKUH_105_25Apr14, Riyadh_KKUH_173_27Apr14, Riyadh_KKUH_294b_06May14, and possibly Riyadh_KKUH_395_17May14.

The 2 most recent sequences (Riyadh_KKUH_643_02Nov14 and Riyadh_KKUH_665_19Nov14) were of interest as there was a modest increase in cases reported in Riyadh in November 2014 (some with camel contact some with hospital contact). These 2 sequences, although clustering in the HAB_1 lineage, encode an altered spike protein with unique polymorphisms (Figure 2 -- Protein changes in the spike encoded by recent MERS-CoV -- available at the source URL), suggesting a recombinant.

Spike protein changes
---------------------
It is important to monitor evolution in the coronavirus spike region. Changes in the spike protein accompanied the evolution of the SARS coronavirus and may be an important marker of increased transmissibility. Multiple changes in spike protein were observed in the recent samples, with changes in or near to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Figure 2). An L411F change near the RBD was present in Indiana_USA_2014 and the related Riyadh sequences, while the novel Riyadh sequences in the HAB_1 clade have R542T, which lies within the RBD. However, neither of these Riyadh changes appeared in the 2 most recent Riyadh sequences (Riyadh_KKUH_643_02Nov14, Riyadh_KKUH_665_19Nov14), which display a T477A change near the RBD. The Jeddah sequences encoded a Q833R change. None of the recent changes were found to be under positive selection using any of the selection methods within the Datamonkey suite [5].

Evolutionary rate
-----------------
The updated evolutionary rate of the virus is 8.37x10-4 (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 6.71x10-4, 1.01x10-3). From the phylogeny, the root of the tree (last common ancestor between human MERS and the Egyptian camels) is September 2010 (95 percent CI: November 2009, June 2011). The last common ancestor between clade A (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) and B (rest of human isolates) is October 2010 (95 percent CI: January 2010, June 2011) and the root of clade B is November 2011(95 percent CI: June 2011, April 2012).
