Famed Plum Park will cut down its trees
---------------------------------------
A Tokyo park once named Japan's best for viewing plum blossoms is cutting down all its trees after losing a 5-year battle with plum pox. Umeno Koen in western Tokyo's Ome City closed after its annual plum blossom festival.

The park's remaining 1266 trees will be felled after the clearing of some 2600 others failed to contain a 2009 outbreak of the disease [see ProMED-mail post 20100424.1317]. Ome plans to wait until the area has been free of plum pox for 3 years before replanting.

The discovery of the virus in Umeno Koen was the 1st instance of the disease in Japan, according to Ome City.

Regulated area expanded for _Plum pox virus_
--------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has expanded the current regulated area for _Plum pox virus_ in the Niagara region to better prevent the spread and protect fruit trees and industry.

This expansion is in response to the confirmed finding of the disease approximately 900 meters inside the western edge of the existing regulated area. The regulated area has been expanded by 800 meters based on international standards. It is forbidden to move potentially infested material, such as infected wood and nursery stock, out of regulated areas.

The CFIA will continue its surveillance and monitoring activities across Canada to prevent the spread of the _Plum pox virus_ and will adjust its approach to address new findings should they occur.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into 6 strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species (see link below).

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools) and grafting, as well as with infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. Resistant cultivars are available for several types of stone fruits, including plum.

PPV was reported for the 1st time in Japan in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100424.1317). Detection occurred on apricots in the Tokyo area, including Ome, from where the virus spread to other hosts, including the famous plum trees. Because eradication attempts of PPV have rarely been successful in the past and highly mobile aphid vectors are involved, the drastic procedures taken in Ome appear justified.

In Canada, the virus was first detected in Nova Scotia and Ontario in 2000 (ProMED-mail post 20000626.1057), but has been declared eradicated from Nova Scotia since then.
