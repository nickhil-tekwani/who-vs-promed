Kidney damage is painless and silent, and it's the latest ailment to be identified afflicting a large swath of COVID-19 survivors. Injury to the blood-filtering organ can occur among people who recover from the coronavirus at home, and escalates with the severity of COVID, a study found. Even non-hospitalized patients with no renal problems have almost a 2fold higher risk of developing end-stage kidney disease, compared with someone who never had COVID.

The findings, reported on [Wed 1 Sep 2021] in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, highlight yet another pernicious burden of the pandemic that's sickened more than 200 million people globally. The data show 7.8 extra people needing dialysis or a kidney transplant per 10 000 of these mild-to-moderate COVID patients. "This is not a small number, if you multiply by the huge number of Americans and also globally who might be ending up with end-stage kidney disease," said Ziyad Al-Aly, director of the clinical epidemiology center at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri. "This is really huge, and it will literally shape our lives for probably the next decade or more."

Al-Aly, who led the study, and his colleagues in April [2021] mined data collected during the routine delivery of care from the Veterans Health Administration to document the cascade of debilitating effects that plague COVID survivors months after diagnosis, from blood clots, stroke, diabetes and breathing difficulties to heart, liver and kidney damage, depression, anxiety and memory loss.

Al-Aly's latest research compared the risks of kidney-related conditions in 89 216 VA users who survived COVID against more than 1.7 million counterparts without the pandemic disease. "What's really problematic about kidney disease is that it's really silent, that it doesn't really manifest in pain or any other symptoms," said Al-Aly, who also works as a nephrologist. Al-Aly and colleagues found non-hospitalized COVID patients have a 23% increased risk of suffering acute kidney injury within 6 months -- a condition that impedes the removal of waste and toxins from the blood.

Doctors caring for COVID survivors must also be alert for a broad spectrum of kidney disease among these patients, according to Al-Aly.

"If this is really happening at a wider scale -- and we think it is -- it's just a matter of time before we see all of these people hitting the clinics, needing dialysis, needing transplantation that places a lot of burden on the patient himself or herself, and really is very costly to the health care system," he said.

Known as the silent killer, kidney dysfunction and disease tend to be free of pain and other symptoms -- so much so that the National Kidney Foundation estimates that 90% of people with ailing kidneys don't know it. Kidney disease affects 37 million people in the U.S. and is one of the nation's leading causes of death.

"Our findings emphasize the critical importance of paying attention to kidney function and disease in caring for patients who have had COVID-19," said senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University. "If kidney care isn't an integral part of COVID-19 post-acute care strategy, then we will miss opportunities to help potentially hundreds of thousands of people who have no idea that their kidney function has declined due to this virus. This is in addition to the millions of Americans who suffer from kidney disease not caused by COVID-19."

[B] Overview
Date: Wed 1 Sep 2021

After a year and a half, the risk of long COVID, for both unvaccinated and vaccinated people, is one of the pandemic's biggest and least-addressed unknowns. The condition affects many young, healthy, and athletic people, and even now "none of us can predict who's going to have persistent symptoms," Lekshmi Santhosh, the medical director of a long-COVID clinic at UC San Francisco, told me. A small number of fully vaccinated people have become long-haulers after breakthrough infections, although no one knows how common such cases are, because they aren't being tracked. Mysteries abound; meanwhile, millions of long-haulers are sick.

Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale who has carefully listened to and worked with long-haulers, told me that she has 2 hypotheses about why they are sick. The 1st is that the virus might persist in some bodily reservoir, either as a replicating entity or as ghostly fragments that haunt a patient's cells and trigger immune overreactions. The 2nd is that long COVID is an autoimmune disease in which the patient's immune system mistakenly attacks their own body. (That might be because it's trying to target viral molecules that mimic human ones, or because its ability to restrain itself has been disrupted by the virus.)

Both ideas, and others, might be right. But even on its own, the autoimmune hypothesis, for which Iwasaki and others have evidence, would account for several of long COVID's supposedly perplexing features. Long-haulers might produce self-directed antibodies that attack different body parts, such as connective tissues or the nervous system, which would explain why their symptoms are both numerous and diverse. In some people, a small amount of virus might be enough to trigger an autoimmune response, which might be why some fully vaccinated individuals still developed long COVID. If that's true, it could also explain why a number of long-haulers have tested negative for antibodies. "If breakthrough infections with presumably limited viral spread can cause long COVID by eliciting autoimmune responses, then people who had limited infections--and therefore, a limited antibody response--could similarly develop long COVID," Iwasaki said.

These ideas still need to be confirmed. But at minimum, they suggest that unusual patterns of negative tests or varied symptoms are clues to be explained, not absurdities to be explained away.

One of the biggest misconceptions about long COVID is that it is entirely new. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus may have emerged in 2019, but many infections can lead to similar long-term symptoms. Long COVID shares traits with chronic illnesses including ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Although long COVID isn't identical to any of them, the overlaps are substantial. "There are likely several things unique to COVID-19, but we're not starting from scratch," McCorkell told me.

For example, many long-haulers have the hallmark symptom of ME/CFS [Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome] - post-exertional malaise, in which mild bursts of activity trigger dramatic crashes. Clusters of ME/CFS have followed many disease outbreaks, including the original SARS epidemic, in 2003. And when the pandemic began in 2020, ME/CFS researchers and patients saw long COVID coming before anyone else did. "For years, we've been shouting from the rooftops that this is something that happens after an infectious onset, but it's been hard to get people to pay attention," Michael VanElzakker of Harvard, who is one of the few scientists to study the condition, told me. Much like long COVID, ME/CFS has been trivialized as a psychological condition, its patients mocked and its researchers underfunded. "It's a terrible outrage," Maureen Hanson, a molecular biologist at Cornell who also works on ME/CFS, told me. "If we had a better understanding of it, we'd be ahead of the game" with long COVID.

No one knows the odds of developing long COVID after a breakthrough infection. The only formal data come from an Israeli study that tested about 1500 fully vaccinated health-care workers and found 39 breakthrough cases, of whom 7 still had symptoms after 6 weeks. In the U.S., support groups have begun seeing small numbers of long-haulers who were fully vaccinated, as have a few long-COVID clinics. In those still-rare cases, the condition is playing out much as it did in the pre-vaccine era. "I've only seen 3 or 4, but they look like long COVID," Putrino told me. "We need to understand what the rate is." [Bergwerk M, Gonen T, Lustig Y, et al. Covid-19 Breakthrough Infections in Vaccinated Health Care Workers. NEJM. July 28, 2021 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2109072]. Some scientists have argued that the rate theoretically should be low: mild infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated people aren't equivalent because in the former, the immune system should be stamping on the virus. But that might not make a difference if, for example, long COVID is an autoimmune disease. With so much uncertainty around the condition's nature and roots, confident predictions are unwarranted.

"My hope is that what we're seeing with long COVID is an immune system's overreaction to a novel virus," Putrino told me. As immune systems become familiar with that virus, through vaccinations, boosters, or natural encounters, the likelihood of developing long COVID should hopefully fall, he added. But even in that scenario, long COVID will still exist, just as ME/CFS and other related illnesses still do.

[2] US: cases rise
Date: Wed 1 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-19-cases-reach-new-daily-highs-across-us


The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is now 160 506, the highest it's been since [25 Jan 2021], according to the Washington Post tracker. Despite 3 authorized vaccines, American cities and states have seen large late-summer outbreaks due to the highly transmissible Delta (B1617.2) variant.

August [2021] was the 4th-worst month of the pandemic for new COVID-19 cases, with 4.22 million reported, according to USA Today. The 28 605 deaths is more than 3 times the number reported in July [2021]. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/09/01/covid-vaccines-mask-mandates-hospitalizations-cases/5672901001/].

Alabama, Oregon, and Hawaii have set records for their 7-day new case averages. Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Mississippi, and Kentucky are also approaching new records.

The high numbers come just days before Americans look to celebrate summer's end with Labor Day parties, and millions of school age children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine are due back in classrooms.

Yesterday [Tue 31 Aug 2021] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, warned unvaccinated Americans to refrain from traveling over the holiday weekend.

According to the New York Times tracker, the country recorded 160 041 cases, including 1346 deaths yesterday [Tue 31 Aug 2021].

Vaccination rates rose in August
--------------------------------
The summer surge of virus activity has prompted more Americans to get vaccinated. White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said yesterday [Tue 31 Aug 2021] that about 14 million Americans received their first COVID-19 shot in August [2021], which is nearly 4 million more than in July [2021], NPR reports. [https://www.npr.org/2021/08/31/1032994955/vaccination-rates-rose-in-august-as-covid-cases-surge-due-to-the-delta-variant]

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 52.6% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 61.9% have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Among eligible Americans, those 12 and older, 72.4% have had at least one dose, and 61.5% are fully vaccinated. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

According to the CDC, roughly 550 000 vaccines are currently be administered daily in the United States.

Within 3 weeks, the Biden administration said the 1st recipients of the mRNA 2-dose vaccine made by Pfizer should receive a 3rd booster dose. The announcement has led 2 of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top vaccine regulators, Marion Gruber, MD, and Philip Krause, MD, to announce they are leaving the agency this fall, the New York Times reports.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/us/politics/fda-vaccine-regulators-booster-shots.html]

Neither Gruber nor Krause allegedly believe there is enough data to support the use of boosters at this point, and felt the Biden administration was rushing the FDA.

The White House has said the FDA has to approve the booster shots before they become available, but also publicly stated a deadline of [20 Sep 2021].

Politico has also reported officials inside the FDA were angered at the deadline, and feel pressured to collect and analyze data that clearly demonstrate the boosters' benefits before the deadline. Pfizer submitted booster dose application data to the FDA on [27 Aug 2021], but neither Moderna nor Johnson & Johnson have submitted any data. [https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/31/biden-booster-plan-fda-508149]

Other US developments
---------------------
- Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf yesterday [Tue 31 Aug 2021] issued a mask mandate for all K-12 schools and child care facilities, Reuters reports. The order goes into effect on [7 Sep 2021].

Pre-hospital antiplatelet therapy linked to lower COVID-19 death rates
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-hospital antiplatelet therapy, most commonly aspirin, was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality rates for COVID-19 patients, according to a study this week in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

The researchers matched 6781 COVID-19 US patients who received antiplatelet therapy before hospital admission with 10 566 who did not receive antiplatelet therapy from February to September 2020. In this 1:1.6 ratio, data showed that those who received antiplatelet therapy had an in-hospital mortality rate of 18.9%, whereas those in the control group had a 21.5% in-hospital mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76 - 0.87). The antiplatelet therapy group also showed a lower rate of pulmonary embolism (2.2% vs 3.0%) but a higher rate of nosebleeds (0.9% vs 0.4%). No other clotting complications occurred.

Pre-matching, the total pool of patients was 34 675 people 50 or older across 90 US health systems (median age, 69 years). Almost 20% (6781) had received pre-hospital antiplatelet therapy, with aspirin being the most common (83.9%), followed by clopidogrel (8.2%), and dual antiplatelet therapy occurred in 7.4%. About 30% of patients who didn't receive pre-hospital antiplatelet therapy later received it during their hospitalization.

"Importantly, most patients in the antiplatelet therapy arm received aspirin, which is a widely available medication that is inexpensive and has a well described risk profile," the researchers write. "Future studies are necessary to determine if mortality outcomes are different for P2Y12 antagonists, COX-1 inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors." [Chow JH, Yin, Yamane DP, et al. Association of Pre-Hospital Antiplatelet Therapy with Survival in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. First published: 29 Aug 2021. https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15517]

Study: High-risk allergy patients have low reaction rates to Pfizer vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of 429 patients considered to be high-risk for allergic reactions against the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, 98% had no allergic reaction, according to a JAMA Network Open study yesterday [Tue 31 Aug 2021].

From [27 Dec 2020] to [22 Feb 2021], 8102 Israeli patients with allergies applied to the COVID-19 vaccine referral center at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv. Overall, 85% were referred to receiving vaccination in regular settings, 1219 received further assessment, and 429 (5.3%) were considered high-risk and received the Pfizer vaccine under medical supervision.

After the 1st dose, 97.9% of the high-risk group had no allergic reactions. Of the 218 who received their 2nd dose during the study period, 98.2% had no allergic reactions.

A total of 9 patients experienced allergic reactions after the 1st dose; 6 had mild reactions that resolved with antihistamines during the observation period, and 3 had anaphylaxis within 10 to 20 minutes post-vaccination. The anaphylaxis resolved within 2 to 6 hours after adrenaline, antihistamines, an inhaled bronchodilator, and - for one patient - systemic glucocorticoids. None required hospitalization.

After the 2nd dose, 4 patients had minor allergic reactions, which were treated with antihistamines and bronchodilators. Three of the 4 had experienced mild reactions after the 1st dose and had received premedication prior to the 2nd.

"We enabled immunization of most patients with allergies by using a simple algorithm that included a referral center, a risk assessment questionnaire, and a safe environment for immunization of highly allergic patients with observation after immunization," write the researchers.

The high-risk group was 70.9% women, and the mean age was 52 years. Most had a history of anaphylaxis (63.2%), and many had multiple allergies (30.3%), had multiple drug allergies (32.9%), and carried an adrenaline syringe (22.1%).

"Interestingly, the low-risk allergy groups included many of those overrepresented in anaphylaxis reports in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): those who had chronic urticaria; sensitivity to foods, venoms, or aeroallergens; or nonanaphylactic reactions to drugs or contrast media," notes Elizabeth J. Phillips, MD, of Vanderbilt University, in a related commentary. [Shavit R, Maoz-Segal R, Iancovici-Kidon M, et al. Prevalence of Allergic Reactions After Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccination Among Adults With High Allergy Risk. JAMA Netw Open. 2021;4(8):e2122255. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.22255
