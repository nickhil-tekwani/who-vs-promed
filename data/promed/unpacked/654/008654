Vets have issued a warning to pet owners after a disease known to kill rabbits "swiftly and suddenly" was detected in Swanwick. Vets4Pets, in Nottingham Road, Somercotes, has asked rabbit owners to ensure their pets are properly vaccinated following an outbreak of rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease in the area.

The highly contagious virus has been described as a swift and sudden killer and often gives little warning at all. In some cases, rabbits have been known to bleed from the nose, mouth and rectum. The disease can be spread through direct contact or through clothes, shoes and car tyres. It can also be spread through fur and meat from infected rabbits and rodents.

Rabbit owner Nathan Bradley, 29, of Swanwick, lost his 2 bunnies to the disease. Now he is appealing for more rabbit owners to get their pets vaccinated so they don't go through the same heartbreak his family has. The father-of-2 said his daughter, Olivia, aged 8, went out to feed rabbits Berry and Rose last weekend and found Rose dead in her hutch.

The family visited Vets4Pets who informed them it was most likely rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease that had killed one-year-old rabbit (Rose) as her death was so sudden. They told them that the other rabbit (Berry) would most likely have the deadly virus too and it would also prove fatal.

Just a few days later, on [22 Nov 2018], Mr. Bradley woke to Berry scratching loudly in her cage. He looked over and saw she had rolled onto her side and was convulsing. He said: "We lay her on my wife's lap wrapped in a towel around her to help soothe and keep her warm and gently stroking her. She succumbed after a few more convulsions. It was very hard to watch. We felt very helpless."

Now Mr. Bradley says he "will never make the same mistake again" after explaining to his heartbroken children that their beloved bunnies had died. He added: "People have said to us it's only a rabbit. I'd implore them to tell that to a heartbroken child and see the response. A pet to us is part of the family. We were naive because we didn't get ours vaccinated. Unfortunately we have learnt the hard way that this is not the case."

"We don't want anyone to go through the unnecessary heartache of the loss of a pet through lack of vaccinations."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways.
- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Death from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was 1st identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the UK.
- Although RHD-2 is less virulent than RHD-1, its difficult early diagnosis means it is more challenging given rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period of time without any visible signs of infection. Hence diagnosis of RHD-2 presents a new challenge for the UK.

[A vaccine against RHD-1 has been available for some time and is highly effective at preventing RHD-1 infections, but will not be effective against the RHD-2 virus (https://www.thebritishrabbitcouncil.org/Facts%20Sheet%20RHD-2.pdf). - Mod.ML] RHD-2 has been found recently circulating in the UK, for which vaccination should also include coverage against this viral type. Specific vaccines against RHD-2 are available in Europe (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/veterinary/EPAR/eravac>).
