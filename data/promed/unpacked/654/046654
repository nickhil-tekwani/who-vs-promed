Epidemiological comments
From March to June 2015, 4 deer (_Mazama nana_) in a zoo in an ecological reserve of the company Itaipu Binacional showed clinical signs and death. As part of a research project on diseases in cervids in the ecological reserve, samples were sent to the Research Laboratory on Animal Virology of the Federal University of Minas Gerais and tested negative for epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus and positive for bluetongue virus. The samples were tested by viral isolation and typing and serotype 3 of bluetongue virus was identified in one animal.

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Research Laboratory on Animal Virology of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (local laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Pygmy brocket / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 22 Dec 2015 / Positive
Pygmy brocket / serotyping / 22 Dec 2015 / Positive
Pygmy brocket / virus isolation / 22 Dec 2015 / Positive
Pygmy brocket / virus sequencing / 22 Dec 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The 1st published report of bluetongue virus (BTV) infection in South America was a case from Brazil in 1978. Subsequently, serological surveys have determined that the infection is widespread in sheep, cattle, goats, and water buffalo but generally without clinical signs.

Brocket deer (_Mazama_ spp.) are neotropical cervids of small to medium size. Out of the 10 species of _Mazama_, the pigmy brocket (_Mazama nana_) is the smallest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_brocket#/media/File:Mazama_nana.jpg).

Serosurveys of free-ranging wild deer in South America suggest that BTV circulates in their populations. - Mod.PMB
