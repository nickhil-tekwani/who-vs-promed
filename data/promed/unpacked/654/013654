South Carolina's state veterinarian announced Monday [22 Jul 2019] that the state's 1st case this year [2019] of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been confirmed in Chesterfield County. The infected horse, a year-old Appaloosa colt, had not been vaccinated and did not survive.

"This is a clarion call for vaccinations against diseases like EEE and West Nile virus (WNV)," said Boyd Parr, South Carolina state veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock Poultry Health, a state agency responsible for protecting the health of animals and consumers through control of disease and inspection of meat and poultry products. "Horse owners should check with their veterinarian to be sure their horses' vaccinations are up-to-date."

The EEE and WNV viruses are mosquito-borne and fast acting. Symptoms of EEE in horses usually develop from 2-5 days after exposure. The signs include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, the inability to stand, muscle twitching, or death.

"These diseases have a very high mortality rate in infected, unvaccinated horses: between 30% and 40% for West Nile and 90% for EEE," said Sean Eastman, veterinarian and director of field services for the Livestock Poultry Health Animal Health Programs. "Although not directly communicable from horses to people, both EEE and WNV have a human health significance, and cases can be prevented through effective vaccination and mosquito management strategies."

Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center currently provides testing for EEE and WNV at no charge, thanks to an agreement with the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). The current agreement expires 31 Jul [2019], but DHEC is exploring its options for continuing this surveillance program after July [2019].

Widespread vaccination last year [2018] held the number of S.C. cases to only one of EEE -- also in Chesterfield County -- and 4 of West Nile. In contrast, in 2013 the Palmetto State led the nation in cases of the disease with 49 EEE-infected horses, all unvaccinated. Of those, 48 died.

In addition to EEE and WNV, other neurologic diseases, including rabies and EHV-1, can infect horses. Any livestock that display neurologic symptoms -- stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension -- must be reported to the state veterinarian at 803-788-2260 within 48 hours, according to state law.

A list of reportable diseases, along with other resources, is published on the LPH website at http://www.clemson.edu/public/lph/ahp/reportable-diseases.

Seven horses in Mississippi were confirmed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in June and early July [2019] by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Following are the reports by county.

Jackson County: 5 cases

- A 2-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was confirmed positive on 19 Jun 2019. He was euthanized. He was unvaccinated.
- An 11-year-old Miniature Horse stallion was confirmed positive on 25 Jun 2019. He was euthanized. He was under-vaccinated.
- An 8-year-old Miniature Horse stallion was confirmed positive on 26 Jun 2019. He is deceased. He was under-vaccinated.
- A 3-year-old Thoroughbred mare was confirmed positive on 10 Jul 2019. She was euthanized. She was under-vaccinated.

Greene County: one case
- A 6-year-old Quarter Horse mare was confirmed positive on 25 Jun 2019. She was euthanized. She was under-vaccinated.

Hancock County: one case
- A suckling Quarter Horse filly was confirmed positive on 7 Jul 2019. She is deceased. She was under-vaccinated.

An approximately 12-year-old mare in Ocean County contracted the 1st reported case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses, in New Jersey in 2019. The horse had been vaccinated against EEE in April of this year [2019] before it was euthanized on Tuesday [23 Jun 2019].

"Horse owners need to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes," New Jersey secretary of agriculture Doug Fisher said. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as EEE and West Nile Virus."

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile Virus infection. West Nile virus is a viral disease that affects horses' neurological system and is transmitted by a mosquito bite.

The [EEE] virus spreads between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans being incidental hosts. EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus, according to Fisher.

In 2018, New Jersey had 5 cases of EEE and one case of West Nile virus (WNV).

Effective equine vaccines for EEE and WNV are available commercially. Horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against both EEE and WNV.

[According to the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP),

"- Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: Annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals of high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 4-6-month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.
- Adult horses previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4-6-week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.
- Pregnant mares previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: Vaccinate 4-6 weeks before foaling.
- Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: Immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4-6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season, whichever occurs 1st.
- Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: Administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4-6 months of age. A 4-6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10-12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

In the southeastern U.S., due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2-3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10-12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

- Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and an 8-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3-4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

Note: Foals in the southeastern USA: The primary vaccination series should be initiated at 3 months of age due to early seasonal vector presence.

- Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: Recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk of susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID)."

This is the 1st time news reports have covered the term "under-vaccinated." Typically, it takes a series of a minimum of 2 vaccines administered about 3 weeks apart to build immunity. EEE is usually combined in a vaccine containing West Nile virus (WNV) and usually western equine encephalitis (WEE). The vaccines are very effective when given as recommended. The immunity of an under-vaccinated horse may not have been appropriately activated as perhaps only one vaccine instead of the series of 2 was given. Or the animal may have been vaccinated last year [2018] but not boosted this year [2019]. Only the initial vaccine is required in the series of 2 followed by an annual booster. However, protection to EEE is the 1st to wane, and in areas with high mosquito burdens or where EEE is known to circulate, it is often recommended to vaccinate approximately every 3-4 months. - Mod.TG]
