UK: Hepatitis A Outbreak in Men who have Sex with Men, London, Aug-Sep 2004
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A in gay men in southeast London has been
identified. 9 cases have so far been reported, all with symptom onset
dates between mid-Aug and mid-Sep 2004 (1). 5 of the affected men reported
visiting a gay pub in Southwark, southeast London, in the 2 months before
they became unwell. One of the 9 patients is a secondary case, who has a
history of household contact with one of the 5 patients who had visited the
pub. The pub is, in effect, a public sex environment that includes a dark
room' where sexual activities that carry a high risk of hepatitis A
transmission occur. Of the 8 patients whose vaccination status is known,
none had previously been vaccinated against hepatitis A.
The local health protection unit is working with a number of agencies
(including local health authorities and social and health groups that work
with gay men) to advise gay men locally of the risk, and how this might be
minimised, including advice on immunisation. Increasing community outreach
work at this and similar venues, and actions to improve hygiene at the pub
are being considered.
Outbreaks of hepatitis A in men who have sex with men (MSM) have been
reported from Denmark and the Netherlands in May 2004, and in France in
2000 (2-5). Studies have established risk factors for acquiring infection.
Following a series of outbreaks of hepatitis A amongst MSM in the United
Kingdom including a large outbreak in London in 1997 (5), national
recommendations for hepatitis A vaccination were extended to include MSM
whose sexual behaviour is likely to put them at risk (6,7). The provision
of hepatitis A vaccination for MSM at genitourinary medicine clinics and
outreach services appears to have been successful in controlling the 1997
outbreak. The outbreak reported here may indicate the need to increase
hepatitis A vaccination offered to MSM through these services in order to
prevent a more wide-scale problem.
The outbreak investigation team is interested in hearing about cases which
may be related to this outbreak. Please contact Donal O'Sullivan at
