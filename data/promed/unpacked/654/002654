USDA confirms additional cases of virulent Newcastle disease in backyard birds in California
---------------------------------------------------------------
The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed three additional cases of virulent Newcastle disease in backyard exhibition chickens in California -- one in Riverside County and two in San Bernardino County.

A complete list of confirmed cases is available on our website at <www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd>.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found [previously] in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

[The 3 new outbreaks were confirmed on 13 Jul 2018. This brings the total to 55 outbreaks in this epidemic. One must ask why it continues. Are these backyard poultry keepers refusing to vaccinate their birds or have them vaccinated? With so many outbreaks in San Bernardino County there must be a spatial and temporal pattern to the outbreaks, plus some indication of how and why it continues to spread. The causes for the outbreaks in Riverside should be instructive. - Mod.MHJ
