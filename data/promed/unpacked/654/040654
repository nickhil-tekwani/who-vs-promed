At least 10 more chikungunya suspected cases were reported in Karachi, taking the number of reported cases to 4078 in the city since 1 Jan 2017.

According to a report issued by Health Department Sindh, a total of 4808 suspected chikungunya cases have been reported throughout Sindh province; out of them, 4078 were from Karachi and 730 from other districts of the province. A total of 26 chikungunya suspected cases have been reported in Karachi this month [December 2017] so far. No deaths were reported from this mosquito-borne disease.

Chikungunya is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, and major symptoms include high fever, joint pain, joint swelling, rash, headache, muscle pain, nausea, and fatigue.

Chikungunya is rarely fatal, and the death rate from the disease is less than one per cent. In 2016, there were a total of 405 suspected chikungunya cases throughout Karachi.

[Chikungunya cases were 1st reported from Karachi last year [2016], and since then, cases have been reported from other provinces as well. _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ are the principal mosquito vectors and quite widespread; therefore, there is need to develop medium and long term vector management programs to control both these diseases during the low vector activity period in the colder months to reduce their impact on the health system year after year. - Mod.UBA
