First Report of Sudden Death Syndrome of Soybean in Delaware and Eastern
Shore of Maryland.
---------------------------
R. P. Mulrooney and N. Fisher Gregory, Department of Plant and Soil
Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark 19717; S. D. Walker, Sussex
Cooperative Extension, University of Delaware, Georgetown 19947; and A.-M.
Webster, Somerset Cooperative Extension, University of Maryland, Princess
Anne 21853. Plant Dis. 86:696, 2002; published on-line as D-2002-0418-03N,
2002. Accepted for publication 14 Apr 2002.

In August and September of 2000, soybean (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.) ...
from 2 fields in Sussex County, Delaware, and 1 field from Somerset County
on the eastern shore of Maryland exhibited typical symptoms of sudden death
syndrome [SDS]. The season had been wetter and cooler than normal.

Leaf symptoms [included small chlorotic spots, elongated regions of
interveinal necrosis and leaf drop]. Severely infected plants were easily
pulled from the soil and had taproots with blue sporodochia, necrotic
cortical tissue, and necrosis of secondary roots (2).

[Tissue sections (basal stems, taproots, vascular elements, blue
sporodochia)] from infected plants ... were plated on water agar (WA)
amended with neomycin and streptomycin, WA with antibiotics and
chloramphenicol, and acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolates were
slow-growing on PDA, often staining agar dark maroon, produced little
aerial mycelium, and formed macroconidia in blue sporodochia. The fungus
was identified as _Fusarium solani_ [Fs] (Mart.) Sacc. based on spore
morphology.

In preliminary pathogenicity tests, plugs (5 mm) of the fungus from
14-day-old cultures were placed next to the stem just below the soil line
of 14-day-old plant of soybean cvs. Essex and Lee 74. [Results showed
mottling, rugosity, and leaf cupping (70 percent), severe interveinal leaf
necrosis (6 percent) and distinct stem lesions at the soil line (52
percent]. Control plants were symptomless. Fs ... was recovered from all
symptomatic plants and presumed to be Fs .. f. sp. _glycines_ based on
spore morphology, color, lack of microconidia, and symptoms (1).

In more [extensive] tests, 11 isolates of Fs ... f. sp. _glycines_ were
used to inoculate Essex soybean plants as previously described. 56 ... days
after inoculation plant height was reduced 12 [percent] compared with
symptomless, ... noninoculated controls. Lesions produced on the lower stem
and taproot of the inoculated plants averaged 4.5 cm long. Most plants had
mild foliar symptoms [mottling, rugosity, and leaf cupping]. Only 3 plants
had severe foliage symptoms. Fs ... f. sp. _glycines_ was recovered from 56
[percent] of inoculated plants, completing Koch's postulates for all 11
isolates.

SDS ... was not observed in 2001. Soybean is an important crop in the
region; 250 000 ha were harvested in 2000 on the Delmarva Peninsula, which
includes the 3 counties of Delaware, 9 eastern shore counties of Maryland,
and 2 counties of Virginia. SDS ... could be a serious threat to profitable
soybean production.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of SDS from this area ... and
represents the most eastern occurrence of this disease [to be] reported in
the United States.

[The nematode _Heterodora glycines_ and the fungal pathogen are often
associated with SDS-infected soybean. Interaction between the nematode and
the fungus has been reported to hasten the onset and increase the severity
of foliar symptoms of the disease. Crop losses are usually in the range of
5-15 percent. The distinctive blue color of SDS-infected soybean stems
serves to distinguish SDS from other fungal pathogens (brown stem rot
[_Phialophora gregata_), red crown rot (_Cylindrocladium crotalariae_), and
stem canker (_Diaporthe phaseolorum_ var. _caulivora_). Disease management
relies on the use of resistant cultivars, delayed planting (which reduces
SDS incidence and severity), and provision of good soil drainage. - Mod.DH]
