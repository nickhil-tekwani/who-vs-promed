I'm curious why this [Ron St. John's comments regarding needed skills in
treating dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome cases. - Mod.CHC
is the case, since my impression is that the best that can be done
clinically for dengue are non-specific supportive measures, and that if the
person progresses to DIC, that there is little that can be done that isn't
done for DIC regardless of the etiology.

[DHF/DSS cases in children vs in adults, very ill vs extremely ill, and
other extenuating circumstances form a constellation of confounding
problems in treating certain patients. Mild dengue fever is treated as one
would treat any mild viral infection. Complicated cases (DHF/DSS are
complex diseases) are not. My father said that 50% of physicians graduated
in the lower half of their class. That's not true but surely some docs are
better than others, some have more experience than others, some have more
training and knowledge than others. The problem with dengue is that so
many people think it is a disease like measles, and often it progresses to
something else, much more serious and needful of expert care.
ProMED-mail is not a bulletin board for treatment regimens but, in light of
the serious nature of DHF/DSS, we would appreciate it if someone
knowledgeable would provide our readers with insight as to the special
needs of DHF/DSS patients. - Mod.CHC
