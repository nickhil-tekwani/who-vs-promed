Measles vaccine
---------------
On 30 May the Cuban authorities informed the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) about events attributed to vaccinations during the
follow-up measles vaccination campaign. In this campaign a total of 750 000
children between 4 and 9 years of age were vaccinated without any reported
adverse reactions.
The information available at the moment is the following:
1. Initial information indicated that preliminary results showed Gram
positive aerobic bacilli were encountered in vaccine vials "apparently
closed". This information did not definitively specify that the vaccine
vials were previously closed.
2. The identification of "Gram positive aerobic bacilli" suggests the
possibility of external contamination. If this was the case, the events are
probably related to operational aspects of the program.
3. According to communications from Cuba, during 2002 a total of 750 000
doses of this same vaccine were given to children aged 4 to 9 years without
adverse events being reported. Likewise, since 1971 the authorities have
clarified that Cuba has protected more than 4 million children against
measles using the triple vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella.
4. The scientific literature has reported similar events in the past (for
example, adverse reactions after measles vaccination in India and Algeria).
These investigations concluded that the deaths following administration of
the measles vaccine were related to toxic shock syndrome resulting from the
use of non-sterile syringes and the use of the reconstituted vaccine out of
the time range specified for administration, resulting in contamination.
[The measles vaccine comes in a lyophilized form (freeze dried) that is
reconstituted with diluent on the day of use of the vaccine. Standard
practice is to have vials of diluent distributed and stored with the
vaccine vials so that appropriate diluent and amounts are used routinely
for vaccination activities. Current recommendations are to discard any
unused vaccine from reconstituted vials at the end of a vaccination
session. - Mod.MPP]
5. A team of personnel from the Division of Vaccines and Immunizations/PAHO
is presently in the field collaborating with the investigation and
specimens of the vaccine vials have been sent for sterility testing.
Actions to take:
1. It is imperative to continue the measles vaccination activities, not to
stop for whatever circumstance, complying with norms for biosafety and
policies on open vaccine vials.
2. It is necessary to transmit to countries the successes of the public
health immunization programs and the millions of children in the Americas
who are protected daily from infectious diseases thanks to vaccination,
which demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination as well as the safety of
the vaccines.
3. We will keep countries continually updated with the results of the
investigation.

[Our thanks to the Pan American Health Organization for this update on the
status of the investigation of this adverse event following measles
immunization in Cuba. While the first news article posted on this event
seemed to suggest that there was a contaminated batch of vaccine, the
report of 3 deaths with another 42 affected children when about 750 000
children had been vaccinated with the same vaccine without any untoward
effects lead us to speculate that this was probably a localized problem.
Training for vaccination programs includes procedures for reconstitution of
lyophilized vaccines, including the importance of keeping the vaccine vials
and the appropriate diluents stored in close proximity, and in
refrigerators and freezers used exclusively for vaccines to avoid
inadvertent mixing up of products and vials. In addition, training
specifies the need to use sterile needles and syringes for all doses of
vaccine administered, and to discard any unused re-constituted measles
vaccine at the end of a vaccination session.
If this adverse event is related to administration of bacterially
contaminated vaccine coming from already opened/reconstituted vials of
vaccine, it suggests that the contamination occurred locally. Contamination
could have occurred during reconstitution of the vaccine, or during the
vaccination session when multiple doses of vaccine were taken from the
vials. The removal of each dose offers an opportunity for contamination of
the remaining vaccine in the vial. If unused measles vaccine at the end of
the vaccination session was stored and then used on subsequent days, the
possibility for bacterial growth and contamination could have been further
enhanced.
The articles referred to in this posting are listed below. The authors
studied adverse events reported following receipt of measles vaccine. In
their abstract (1) they mention that following 40 reported incidents of
severe reactions or deaths in the field, 59 intact samples (unopened/unused
vials) of vaccine produced by different manufacturers were tested and found
to be safe, that is -- they were not toxic and were sterile. Tests on
reconstituted or used vials identified a few that were toxic and many that
were unsterile. Reactions occurred in 115 vaccine recipeints and 79
children died. These reactions were characterized by high fever, vomiting,
and profuse watery diarrhea, resulting in death within 24 hours. The
authors concluded that reactions to the vaccines were likely to be related
to toxic shock syndrome, probably due to the use of unsterile syringes and
needles and perhaps to the use of reconstituted vaccines kept beyond their
specified time for administration that had become contaminated.
The above information from PAHO also mentions preliminary identification of
"Gram positive aerobic bacilli". The use of quotation marks suggests that
identification of the bacteria is not yet complete. Contamination of
injection vials (vaccines and other injectable medications) frequently
involves bacteria found on skin, such as staphylococci or streptococci,
both of which are Gram positive cocci. Toxic shock syndrome is a clinical
syndrome characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, vomiting,
diarrhea, muscle pains, and rash followed by hypotension and multisystem
failure, followed by desquamation. It results from toxin producing
_Staphylococcus aureus_. As yet we have no data on the clinical syndromes
of the children who suffered adverse events following the vaccinations. We
await further information on this event. - Mod.MPP]
