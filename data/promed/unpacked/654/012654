--------------------------------------------------------------------
We have had no confirmed cases in Lothian (the region in which
Edinburgh sits and is the major city of -- not "Fife"). This is
interesting in itself in that Edinburgh is the 2nd largest
conurbation in Scotland and is in the central belt of Scotland, only
50 miles [80 km] from Glasgow where most cases have occurred. This is
considered to be a reflection of the different drug distribution
networks in the respective areas.

Please advise MHJ that Edinburgh is not part of "Fife" either
geographically (it is separated by a large body of water known as the
Firth of Forth), health region wise (Lothian not Fife) or indeed
culturally; they are completely separate jurisdictions. Indeed I
expect that the good residents of Edinburgh would be horrified if
anyone dared to suggest that they were in any way associated with "Fife."

[Mea culpa. My only excuse is that that my grandmother came from
Glasgow, where her father was a policeman. And yes, the good
residents of Edinburgh are different from the rest of us. With Fife
on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, this latest outbreak would
be in line with the extra-Glasgow cases, and thus part of that drug
dispersal pattern. - Mod.MHJ]
