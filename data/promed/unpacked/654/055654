Recent tests carried out by the Livestock Department within the Ministry of Agriculture detected brucellosis bacteria in livestock in Savusavu and Taveuni [Cakaudrove province].

The ministry's senior livestock officer Anasa Ralogaivau said brucellosis was a highly contagious zoonosis caused by consumption of unpasteurised milk or undercooked meat from infected animals, or by close contact with their secretions.

Mr Ralogaivau said after the discovery, transportation of cows and cattle out of the 2 areas had been restricted.

He said that the brucellosis bacteria were also found in the Tailevu [province] area. "Movement of such livestock out of the Tailevu area to any part of the country was also restricted," he said.

"The movement of livestock from affected areas to other parts of the country is currently banned. "In Vanua Levu [Island], positive risk areas include Savusavu and Taveuni. "Movement of animals out of restricted areas is a worry."

Mr Ralogaivau has advised those moving livestock during traditional functions to seek assistance from the ministry.

[Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease affecting humans and many animal species. In humans, the disease is characterized by fever and nonspecific influenza-like symptoms frequently including myalgia, arthralgia, and night sweats. Without appropriate treatment, brucellosis can become chronic, and life-threatening complications can arise. Human brucellosis transmitted by cattle was once common in the United States. Control strategies have focused on elimination of brucellosis through vaccination and surveillance of cattle herds, in addition to milk pasteurization. Because of these measures, domestically acquired human cases are now rare in the USA.

Fiji was free of the disease until recently. The cattle population has been reportedly free of the disease for many years until a re-emergence occurred in the Fiji Islands (Viti Levu) in 2009. The Fiji outbreak of _Brucella abortus_ occurred in cattle in 2009 (Wainivesi basin) in Tailevu province.

"Prior to the outbreak, Fiji declared freedom from _B. abortus_ to OIE in 1996 after a successful eradication campaign. During the course of the outbreak investigation, serum samples were collected from between 9790 and 21 624 cattle per annum between 2009 and 2013 from 87 farms on the main island of Fiji (Viti Levu). Blood samples were tested for brucellosis using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) in 2009 and the indirect ELISA test in subsequent years. At the time of the outbreak in Fiji (2009) the apparent prevalence in cattle was 1.50 percent and this has fluctuated since the outbreak. The true prevalence (TP) for the main island in Fiji for the indirect ELISA tests was 2.40 percent in 2010, reached a peak of 3.49 percent in 2011 then reduced to 0.12 percent by 2013. The significant reduction in prevalence compared to 2010 is most likely due to the control programs being implemented in Fiji.

"The re-emergence of _B. abortus_ in Fiji could be attributed to the lack of monitoring for the disease until 2009, combined with inadequate management of exposed animals, thus illustrating how important it is for authorities not to become complacent. Continued awareness and monitoring for brucellosis is essential if future outbreaks are to be avoided."

Clearly, monitoring is occurring or they would not have found these cases.
