More than 1000 people infected with hepatitis A [virus] have been
hospitalized in the Nizhniy Novgorod region [oblast] of Russia after an
epidemic situation there deteriorated, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported
on Thursday [29 Sep 2005]. "The hepatitis A epidemiological situation has
exacerbated since 5 Sep 2005 in the cities of Nizhny Novgorod, Dzerzhinsk
and Balakhna," a spokesman of the Emergency Situations Ministry was
reported as saying on Thursday [29 Sep 2005].
At present, 1034 people diagnosed with hepatitis A [virus infection] have
been hospitalized, 956 of them in Nizhniy Novgorod (the 3rd largest city in
Russia), 32 in Dzerzhinsk and 46 in Balakhna. A total of 211 children were
also admitted to hospital.
Over the past 24 hours alone, 54 people diagnosed with hepatitis have been
taken to hospital, while 75 have been discharged after treatment, the
Ministry spokesman said. The spokesman added that anti-epidemic measures
are being taken in the Nizhniy Novgorod region.
Preliminary reports on the [source of the] epidemic point to [defects] in
the region's sewer system as the probable cause of the outbreak [of
hepatitis A virus infection]. Last week, a local report stated that more
than 20 900 people living in Nizhniy Novgorod have been inoculated against
hepatitis [A virus infection]. People living in parts of Dzerzhinsk and
Balakhna will also be inoculated.

[The outbreak of hepatitis A in Nizhniy Novgorod has not been contained
yet. Since Tue 20 Sep 2005 the number of cases of hepatitis A infection has
increased from 822 (including 150 teens and children) to 1034 (including
211 children). As frequently the case in Russia, inadequacy of the public
water and sewerage systems appears to be responsible for outbreaks of
hepatitis A and other enteric infections.
Nizhniy Novgorod (in the Soviet period, known as Gorky) is the 3rd largest
city in Russia. For a map showing the locations of the 3 cities of Nizhniy
