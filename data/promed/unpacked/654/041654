Utah: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection Reported
---------------------------------------------------
Utah public health officials report that a Utah resident has
contracted West Nile virus infection. The person was exposed to West
Nile virus in Uintah County. The patient is alive and is recovering
from the infection.
In 2003, West Nile virus has been detected in 8 Utah counties
including Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, Grand, Sanpete, Uintah, Utah, and
Wayne. Prior to this human case, public health officials identified
West Nile virus in mosquitoes and horses in Uintah County this
summer. 12 of the 21 Utah horses infected with West Nile virus are
from Uintah County.
West Nile is transmitted to both humans and horses by mosquitoes.
Most people who are infected with West Nile virus do not show any
symptoms. Some (about 1 in 5) have flu-like symptoms with fever,
muscle aches, and possibly a rash. Fewer still (about 1 in 150)
develop more severe illness affecting the brain and spinal cord. They
may have symptoms such as headache, paralysis, and stiff neck. People
over the age of 50 are more likely to develop serious illness.
As of today [19 Sep 2003], 4325 people in the United States have been
infected with West Nile virus this year, and 81 have died. Colorado
has had the highest number of individuals infected this year, along
with the most deaths from the disease.
