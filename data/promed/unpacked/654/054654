A 2nd letter, received today [16 May 2005] by Wellington's Dominion Post
newspaper, has stated that the claims made last week are a hoax and that no
foot and mouth (FMD) virus was released in New Zealand.
Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Marshall said that document examination
was not complete, but Police believed there were strong similarities
between the 2nd letter and the original letter sent to the Prime Minister's
office last week.
"Forensic examination will continue, so we can become certain of the link
between the 2 letters. We have received additional confirmation from a 2nd
overseas law enforcement agency which has analyzed the 1st letter and
concluded that it posed a very low threat. The 2nd agency is a reputable
North American law enforcement organization, and its preliminary assessment
matches that provided by Victoria Police in Australia."
MAF Director of Biosecurity Dr. Barry O'Neil said the new information
reinforced the strong and growing conviction that the claims were a hoax.
"Intensive surveillance on the island and extensive investigations over the
past week have shown no evidence of clinical signs of foot and mouth
disease or factual substance to the original letter. Given the potential
implications for New Zealand's agricultural sector and our international
trading obligations, MAF always felt the need to act in a cautious manner
to ensure New Zealand's economy and trading partners were protected. As a
result of this additional information and the surveillance results thus
far, MAF now intends to remove the legal restrictions covering the movement
of animals and risk goods off Waiheke Island by 5 p.m. on Tue 17 May 2005.
MAF will, however, continue with a low level of monitoring of livestock on
the island until 23 May 2005," Dr. O'Neil said.
Dr. O'Neil said New Zealand had always been Foot-and-Mouth-Disease-free but
had to take a prudent and cautionary approach to the claimed threats. We
acknowledge the tremendous support of Waiheke Islanders and the New Zealand
public.
New Zealand Food Safety Authority Executive Director Dr. Andrew McKenzie
said: "New Zealand's trading partners and OIE (the world animal health
organization) will be informed of these developments and our intentions
overnight. We gratefully acknowledge the responsible positions of our
trading partners and are grateful for their offers of assistance."
Mr. Marshall said: "Despite receipt of the 2nd letter, as these claims have
recklessly endangered New Zealand's agricultural sector, there will be no
let up in the investigation to identify and prosecute the perpetrator."
No further press comment will be made tonight [16 May 2005]. Media are
invited to a press conference at MAF, ASB Bank House, 101-103 The Terrace,
Wellington at 6 a.m. on Tue 17 May 2005.

[We are delighted that New Zealand does not have FMD. However, we hope this
event has made everyone more biosecurity-conscious. We wish the law
enforcement officials luck and success in capturing the perpetrator of this
criminal hoax. - Mod.TG]
