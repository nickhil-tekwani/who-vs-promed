According to the official news agency, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation,
the death toll by 16 May 2004 had reached 40 in Makueni and Kitui Districts
of Kenya. There were others who were admitted to the district hospital with
jaundice, leg edema and hepatomegaly. Maize samples showed high levels of
aflatoxin. There were deaths reported in animals and poultry as well (maize
meal is a component of animal and poultry feeds).

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Sharif for this follow-up information.
The death of animals (?livestock) and poultry related to ingestion of maize
meal is further supportive evidence that ingestion of maize and maize
products was responsible for this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
