Hepatitis B hits Kitgum and Gulu
--------------------------------
A dangerous type of hepatitis has broken out in Kitgum and Gulu,
Parliament has heard. Kitgum district MP (Member of Parliament)
Beatrice Anywar said 12 cases of hepatitis B had been confirmed at St.
Joseph's Hospital, Lacor. She said the patients were from Kitgum town
council, Muchuni and Adelang. Hepatitis B is an infectious disease
caused by hepatitis B virus which affects the liver and causes
hepatitis.

About a quarter of the world's population, over 2 billion people, have
been infected with the hepatitis B virus. This includes 350 million
chronic carriers of the virus. Transmission of hepatitis B occurs
through exposure to blood or body fluids such as semen and vaginal
fluids of infected people. Other risk factors include working in a
health care setting, blood transfusions, dialysis, acupuncture,
tattooing and extended overseas travel. The infection is preventable
by vaccination. Infection at birth is a major route of infection in
developing countries.

Anywar named Acholi, Karamoja and Lango as the regions suspected to be
harbouring the virus. She was concerned about the lack of reagents for
testing and appealed to the government to provide the reagents.

Anywar urged the Ministry of Health to provide Parliament with a
statement on the spread of the disease and the steps being taken to
fight it, a request to which health state minister Richard Nduhuura
obliged.

Gulu MP Betty Aol Ocan said the disease was also reported in Gulu
where seven people had died.

Mbarara Municipality MP Medard Bitekyerezo said western Uganda was
also affected. "It means the whole country is under attack," he said.

[The WHO estimates indicate that close to half of the global
population lives in areas with high endemicity (more than 8 percent of
the population are HBsAg-positive) for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection. A national survey conducted by the Uganda Ministry of
Health in 2004/05 indicated that one in 10 Ugandans had chronic HBV
infection, with the North East, North Central, and West Nile
sub-regions having considerably higher levels of infection of 24, 21,
and 18 percent respectively
http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/AIS2/AIS2.pdf. Gulu and Kitgum,
where the current cases HBV cases have been reported, are located in
the North Central sub-region.

Due to the high endemicity of HBV chronic infection in these settings,
most transmission occurs perinatally or in early childhood and hence
WHO recommends routine infant vaccination as well as vaccination of
high risk groups and health care workers in risk settings. Performance
reports from the districts indicate that 71 percent and 89 percent of
infants in Kitgum and Gulu districts respectively received 3 doses of
the pentavalent diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HBV, and Haemophilus
influenza type b vaccine during 2009/10
(http://www.health.go.ug/docs/AHSPR09.pdf). Hence, more investments
need to be made in improving routine immunisation coverage so that
infants are protected from HBV infection and its long term
complications like liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

[A detailed description of Kitgum District is available at:
http://www.kitgum.go.ug/overview/health.htm. Here it is stated that
Kitgum district has a total of 35 health facilities. Out of these, 28
(80 percent) are functional; while 7 (20 percent) of the units are
non-functional. Most of the non-functional health units have either
just been completed and not yet opened or have no health staff posted
to run them. The health sector operates with less than 70 percent of
its established and approved staffing level.

The burdens of diseases are mainly communicable and therefore
preventable through appropriate public health intervention. The
district had a cholera outbreak that was considered the longest
outbreak ever in the history of the nation. However the 10 major
causes, in-order of importance, are namely: Malaria, acute respiratory
infections, intestinal worms, diarrhoeal diseases, anemia,
malnutrition, HIV/AIDS and injuries.

In addition, an extensive epidemic of hepatitis E virus infection
among internal displaced was recorded in in 2009 (see: Hepatitis E
virus - Uganda (04): (KT) 20090530.2012). Subsequently a national
survey revealed that hepatitis B virus infection is highly endemic in
Uganda. According to J Bwogi et al. (Afr Health Sci 2009 Jun
;9(2):98-108) hepatitis B virus transmission occurs mainly in
childhood and adulthood. More than 1.4 million adults are chronically
infected with some communities disproportionately affected. A
hepatitis B infant immunization programme needs to be developed
further with catch-up vaccination considered for older children.

It is not clear from the above press report whether Kitgum and Gulu
are among the disproportionately affected regions. Further information
would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
