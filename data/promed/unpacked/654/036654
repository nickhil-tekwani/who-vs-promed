The Department of Primary Industries has confirmed 5 more cases of
anthrax cattle deaths in the Goulburn Valley in northeast Victoria
this week, bringing the total anthrax death toll to 34.
The cattle losses are on farms already affected by the disease during
the past 3-and-a-half weeks. So far, 8 properties in Stanhope and one
at Tatura have had stock losses to anthrax.
A mass-vaccination program including 32 000 cattle is continuing.

The situation has gone quiet following our vaccination program, with
no new [farms affected in] the past week. In that week, there have
been 4 cases on farms that have already had a case and have been
vaccinated. This was not unexpected. By the way, we have not deployed
mass-use of antibiotics, as these are milking dairy herds, and that
would require all milk on those farms to be discarded for a
considerable period at massive cost (some of these are large herds).
We are quietly confident that the situation is well contained. This
confidence is added to by our surveillance program, whereby all dead
stock collected from farms in the wider area are tested at a
temporary laboratory we have set up at the knackery. The lab
continues to find no positives among that group. We will operate the
lab for the duration of the summer, augmenting farmer/vet
notification of unexpected/sudden deaths, when we test on farms using
smears and our rapid immunochromatographic assay (hand held kit).

[Five vs. 4 cases? Probably journalistic inexactitude. When I was a
lad in England, the routine was to have the farmer check every cow's
temperature at morning and evening milking, i.e. put a hand on her,
and if she felt warm, check her, and all fevered cows would be given
Penicillin-Streptomycin. This would stop some if not all of those
vaccinated but incubating cows from dying. One ongoing question is
whether a cow undergoing routine antimastitic treatment with
intra-mammary antibiotics has enough circulating antibiotics to kill
the vaccine but not to stop an incubating infection. I have long
suspected that might be the case. - Mod.MHJ]
