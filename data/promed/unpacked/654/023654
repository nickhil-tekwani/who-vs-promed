Illinois: Crow Tests West Nile Virus-positive in Winnebago County
--------------------------------------------------
It's started a little earlier than usual, but West Nile Virus has
returned to the stateline. A crow found dead in Winnebago County has
tested positive for the virus. It's the 1st bird for the county, but
the 5th for the state.
The health department says they're hoping that there are no human
cases in the stateline area in 2004. Since West Nile has been around
for a few years, people may have built up some immunity to the virus.
[Not very likely -- Illinois has had around 1000 cases since 2002, &
serosurveys suggest the prevalence of antibodies resulting from symptomless
and low grade infections is low, so probably only a few hundred more people
than that in the state currently have antibody -- not enough to block an
epidemic. If anyone has contrary data, please let us know. - Mod.JW]

Illinois: West Nile Virus Found in McHenry and Kane Counties
----------------------------------------------------
Birds in 3 northeastern Illinois counties have tested positive for
West Nile virus, state health officials said Mon 7 Jun 2004. Dead
blue jays were found in Kane, McHenry and Madison counties, Illinois
Public Health Director Dr. Eric E. Whitaker said.
8 birds have now been confirmed positive for West Nile virus since
health departments began surveillance for the mosquito-borne disease
on 1 May 2004. In addition, 2 mosquito pools in DuPage County have
been confirmed positive for West Nile virus.
In 2003, 54 human cases of the disease, including one fatality, were
reported in Illinois. In 2002, the state led the nation with 884
cases.

California: Authorities Battle Spread of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------------
More than 80 infected birds have already been found in San Bernardino
County; only 3 human cases have been reported in California so far
[all of them during 2003].
In the last 5 years more than 13 000 people have been infected with
West Nile virus, and 560 have died. Today, as the virus sweeps
throughout the state, health officials are urging residents to pay
more attention to mosquitoes. "California has all the ingredients,"
said Dr. John Edman, professor of medical entomology and director of
the Center for Vector-borne Diseases at UC Davis. There are about 40
species of mosquitoes that are known vectors for West Nile virus,
Edman said. The best vector is the _Culex_ mosquito because it feeds
off animals and birds [as well as humans]. There are at least 4 types
[species] of _Culex_ mosquitoes in California. Because of this, health
officials worry it may be California's year. History has shown that the virus
tends to be worse its 2nd year in an area. Such was the case in
Colorado, which led the nation with 2947 of the 9862 human cases
during 2003. Of the 262 deaths linked to West Nile virus in the
country, Colorado accounted for 61. Only 3 human cases have been
reported in California, all of them in 2003.
John Pape, an epidemiologist for the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment, said areas that had some West Nile virus
activity in 2002 were hardest hit in 2003. "If your area had positive
birds, mosquitoes and a few human cases, you're probably in a
high-risk area," he said. "I don't think people here felt it was that
big of a deal and therefore didn't pay attention to the
recommendations." Edman said California could have 10 times as many
human cases as Colorado because of its larger population. "30 000
human cases could have a huge impact on California from a public
health and economic standpoint," he said.
West Nile was first found in the United States in New York. Shortly
after, the Centers for Disease Control began alerting states about a
westward push. The San Bernardino County Public Health Department
quickly began working with the state Department of Health Services
and the CDC on a prevention plan, said Eric Frykman, interim public
health officer for the county. Dead birds found in and around
personal properties should be reported. In the United States, West
Nile virus has been detected in at least 138 species of dead birds,
according to the CDC. "The virus attacks their central nervous
systems," said Edman, the professor at UC Davis, which is the testing
site for West Nile in California. "Before they die, (infected birds)
lie around on the ground and become vulnerable to mosquitoes."
West Nile virus infection could also lower the state's bird and horse
population, though there is a vaccine for horses. The virus also has
been detected in cats and dogs, but there aren't as many deaths as
with birds [I believe no more than a handful -- does anybody have the
figures? - Mod.JW]
During 2003, 9 birds tested positive for West Nile virus in San
Bernardino County. Already in 2004, 84 have tested positive (82
American crows and 2 scrub Jays). 75 birds were collected between 14
and 21 May 2004 in Bloomington, Colton, Fontana, Highland, Loma Linda,
Ontario, Redlands, Rialto & San Bernardino.
As of Tue 8 Jun 2004, more than 209 birds have tested positive for
West Nile virus in California: 98 in Los Angeles County; 84 in San
Bernardino County; 26 in Riverside County; and one in Ventura County.
Terri Smith, a county public health environmental health specialist,
said that whenever a bird tests positive for West Nile virus,
surveillance occurs within a 1-mile radius from where the bird was
located. Door-to-door checks and inspections of known water sources
in the area are done. What health officials are finding is that there
is an abundance of mosquito breeding grounds on private properties.
Consequently, in 2003 after the positive birds were found, county
public health officials flew over the areas where the birds were
located and discovered that one in 5 swimming pools were green with
algae. In addition to surveying communities for West Nile,
vector-control staff use "sentinel chickens" to test for viruses at
their East Fifth Street office and their station in Needles serving
the Parker Dam area. The test involves drawing blood from the
chickens biweekly. The blood is sent to a state laboratory and tested
for St. Louis encephalitis, western equine encephalitis and West Nile
viruses. Chickens are tested because they survive West Nile virus
infection and other infections more than any other animal, health
officials said.

[West Nile virus reports from the USA continue to be sporadic.
National reports have not yet appeared. So far surveillance in Canada
has resulted only in the detection of West Nile virus in a fraction
of dead birds examined in Ontario. The confirmed West Nile
virus-positive birds were found in all 12 counties in the province. -
Mod.CP]
[As many of the States in the USA are just beginning formal surveillance for
WNV, one would expect that reports of WNV positive birds and mosquito pools
will start increasing as official surveillance begins -- a result of 'seek
and ye shall find'. - Mod.MP]
