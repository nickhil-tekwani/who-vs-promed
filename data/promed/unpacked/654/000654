Since entering Turkey in 2013, followed by Russia and Greece more recently, a dangerous cattle virus has spread throughout the Balkans and now threatens to move further into Europe. To stop its progress and increase preparedness, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] is concentrating its efforts and technical capacities on 2 regional projects aimed at prevention and control of the virus.

In most cases the lumpy skin disease virus is transmitted by insects. Lumpy skin disease gets its name from the characteristic nodules that appear beneath the skin of infected animals.

Lumpy skin disease can mean economic losses due to temporary declines in milk production, lower market weights, sterility in bulls, and secondary infections that can even lead to the animals' death. The skin nodules also reduce the value of hides. Countries may also fear trade restrictions, should the virus enter their national territory.

"This is the 1st time in history that this virus has emerged in Europe," said Andriy Rozstalnyy, FAO animal production and health officer. "So, as step zero, we should collect and analyse data on the spread of the virus and its financial consequences. Only after an assessment of the epidemiological situation can we move further to identify possible ways of handling it." A cost-benefit analysis will be used to compare outbreak control options. Next, a field manual will be produced specifically for the Eurasian continent -- an important practical output from one of the FAO projects, financed by the government of Hungary.

Since few veterinarians in Europe have ever encountered lumpy skin disease, step-by-step guidelines are needed to ensure proper surveillance procedures are followed. Later, the manual will be translated into several national languages. "A series of workshops is already in preparation to spur the development of country-specific awareness strategies," Rozstalnyy added. These workshops will increase understanding of the disease, an essential step towards bringing any transboundary animal disease under control.

Georgia, which saw its 1st cases in late 2016, will receive special attention. At the request of national veterinary services, the country will host a mission by FAO experts. The FAO team will carry out an evaluation of Georgia's situation and provide training to assist national authorities in coming to grips with the disease.

At a 3 day regional workshop in Budapest planned for [March 2017], experts from across Europe and Central Asia will review and revise current strategies and update their knowledge of tools and approaches for preventing, monitoring and coping with the disease. Topics to be covered include risk communication and awareness, vaccination plans, and proper laboratory testing methods.

"We are still in time now, before spring -- when the awakening mosquitoes, flies and other insect vectors of the lumpy skin disease increases the risk of spreading," said Rozstalnyy.

[The above information was released by FAO's Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (Budapest, Hungary).

A commendable initiative called Standing Group of Experts on Lumpy Skin Disease in South East Europe (hereafter referred as 'SGE LSD') was launched on [4-5 Jul 2016] under the GF-TADs [Global Framework for the progressive control of Transboundary Animal Diseases] umbrella to build up a closer cooperation among countries affected by lumpy skin disease (LSD) and thereby, address the disease in a more collaborative and harmonised manner across the region.

The Standing Group of Experts on LSD [LSD SGE] builds on the successful experience of a similar mechanism for African swine fever in the Baltic and Eastern Europe region established in 2014.

Governance

LSD SGE members:
- chair: president of the GF-TADs for Europe (Dr B Van Goethem);
- vice-chairs: president of the Bureau of the OIE Regional Commission for Europe [Dr M Balodis]; vice-president of the Bureau of the OIE Regional Commission for Europe and vice-president of the GF-TADs for Europe [Dr U Herzog];
- affected and at-risk countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Kosovo, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey and Russia;
- observer country: EU Presidency (currently Slovakia);
- organizations: EC - OIE - FAO;
- experts: designated on an ad hoc basis;
- secretariat: OIE sub-regional representation in Brussels (rsr.bruxelles@oie.int)

SGE LSD has held, so far, 3 meetings:
1. on [4-5 Jul 2016], in Brussels, Belgium;
2. on [21 Sep 2106] in Lisbon, Portugal;
3. on [12-13 Dec 2016] in Istanbul, Turkey.

Links to the reports of all the said 3 meetings are available at
http://web.oie.int/RR-Europe/eng/Regprog/en_GF_TADS%20-%20Standing%20Group%20LSD.htm#LSD3.

The 3rd, recent meeting included 8 country presentations and 5 expert presentations, which are already available at the above URL for the benefit of interested subscribers. The next meeting (LSD4) will be held in Paris in [May 2017], in the margins of the 85th OIE General Session. - Mod.AS
