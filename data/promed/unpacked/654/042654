Egypt announces 2 new human infections of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Two new human infections of bird flu were reported in Egypt on Sunday [2
Apr 2006], as the country is battling the highly contagious disease.
Egyptian Minister of Health and Population Hatem el-Gabali announced the 2
new human cases at the Cairo International Airport before departing for
France on a visit.
Two young girls from the governorate of Kafr-el-Sheikh, some 125 km north
of Cairo, had tested positive for bird flu after "playing with infected
poultry," Gabali told reporters at the airport.
The latest infections brought to 7 the number of human cases infected with
the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in the populous north African country.
Two of the victims have died, and the others either have recovered or are
still being treated at hospitals.
Egypt reported the outbreak of bird flu in dead poultry on 17 Feb 2006, and
the 1st human bird flu case was announced on 18 Mar 2006.
The Egyptian government has since taken measures to curb the spread of the
fatal disease.
The deadly H5N1 strain has killed over 100 people worldwide since its
latest outbreak in southeast Asia in late 2003, according to the World
Health Organization. Most victims were infected after close contact with
sick birds.
The virus currently can only jump from birds to humans, but scientists fear
that it could mutate into a form capable of passing easily among humans and
thus spark a global human flu pandemic.

Samples from 4 patients, previously announced by the Egyptian Ministry of
Health as infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, have now been
tested in a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Positive
H5N1 results were obtained for all 4 patients. WHO has updated its
cumulative number of cases accordingly.
The 4 cases were described in WHO updates issued on 20 and 29 Mar 2006. Two
of the patients died. 2 patients fully recovered and have now been
discharged from hospital.
A 5th patient, previously announced by the Ministry of Health, remains
hospitalized. External diagnostic confirmation of this patient, an
18-year-old girl from the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, is pending.
On 2 Apr 2006, Egyptian authorities announced that an additional 2
residents of Kafr El-Sheikh, a 6-year-old girl and her 18-month-old sister,
were shown to have H5N1 infections in local laboratory tests. Further
diagnostic confirmation is pending. Both girls remain hospitalized in
stable condition.
Egypt is the 9th country to report laboratory-confirmed human cases in the
current outbreak, which began in Viet Nam in December 2003. 4 of these
countries reported their 1st human cases this year [2006]: Turkey, Iraq,
Azerbaijan, and Egypt.
