The item on ProMED-mail March 25 by James Meek headed "Three teams, three
predictive models" makes the statement "The three models are relatively
crude... " and goes on to specify weaknesses which would obviously be of
concern in interpreting the predictions if they were true of particular
models. The author does not appear to have adequately differentiated among
the models in making this statement, which is quite inaccurate about at
least one of the models.
The model used by the Weybridge team to predict an epidemic size of the
order of 4400 farms (with current controls and epidemiological assumptions)
is the Interspread model developed progressively over the last decade by my
research group at the EpiCentre, Massey University, New Zealand,
particularly by Dr Robert Sanson and Mark Stern.
It is a full stochastic geographical model of the livestock farms of an
affected country, which has been populated with a comprehensive spatial
data set of UK livestock farms by a joint team from Massey and the UK
Veterinary Laboratories Agency since the epidemic started in February. The
epidemiological parameters in the model have been derived from careful
review of the literature, and from various analyses of the detailed 1967/68
UK outbreak data (supplied by Dr Martin Hugh-Jones).
Other features of the model are based as far as possible on specific
research we undertook to answer questions, or on literature review. A range
of adjustments has been made to the model by the joint team in the last
month, to give the best possible approximation to current UK circumstances
in running the model.
The structure of the model allows a broad range of control options to be
considered, and the model uses as its starting point the true recorded
state of the epidemic on whatever is chosen as Day Zero for the particular
simulation. A classical swine fever variant of Interspread was used by
Wageningen University to analyze the 1997/98 Dutch [Classical swine fever
(hog cholera) epidemic, and the expected epidemic curve and outbreak size
predicted by the model (381 affected farms) matched closely with reality
(429 affected), although the confidence intervals on the prediction were of
course quite wide.
Therefore the predictions derived from Interspread should provide a
valuable guide to the expected scale of the epidemic under the control
program assumptions applied, and can provide quite detailed insights into
the expected effects of modifications to the control strategy. Naturally,
we do not expect the outbreak to reach the predicted size of 4400 farms
because measures will be taken to prevent that, but the model should help
considerably in deciding what measures will be most effective in curtailing
further growth of the outbreak.
