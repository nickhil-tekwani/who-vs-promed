["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a systemic virus infection of horses, donkeys, their crossbreeds, and zebras. The causative agent, a lentivirus from the family of retroviruses, replicates in monocytes and macrophages and causes lifelong persistent infection accompanied by more or less severe immunopathological processes.

The disease is notifiable and is regimented in Germany by the regulation for protection against equine infectious anemia (2000, Federal Law Gazette I p. 531), which imposes mandatory culling of positive animals as well as movement bans and testing of affected and contact holdings. Immunoprophylaxis is not available. A risk for humans does not exist.

EIA occurs worldwide and is reported in larger numbers in North and South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and in Southern and Eastern Europe. In Northern and Central Europe, sporadic cases are registered. The virus is not endemic in Germany; isolated outbreaks, however, occur repeatedly. In most cases so far, an association with imported horses could be established." Source: Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, national reference laboratory for equine infectious anemia (EIA) https://www.fli.de/en/institutes/institute-of-diagnostic-virology-ivd/reference-laboratories/nrl-for-eia/.

In March 2018, one outbreak of EIA was reported in Germany. This outbreak was located in the province of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. A total of one case was diagnosed from a susceptible population of 15 animals (Equidae). The affected animal (case) was destroyed. The event was resolved in June 2018.
