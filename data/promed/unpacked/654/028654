Dr Javed Hayyat, in charge of the Infection Control Committee at Holy
Family Hospital (HFH), has stated that there have been no reported deaths
of [suspected] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patients in Holy
Family Hospital (HFH). Two patients who were suffering from dengue fever
were mistakenly diagnosed with Congo fever [CCHF].

Talking to the Express Tribune, Dr Hayyat said the hospital mistakenly
announced incorrect figures because the staff got confused between the test
reports of dengue and Congo [CCHF] patients issued by the National
Institute of Health (NIH). "The hospital administration received
information of test reports from NIH on the phone and mistakenly declared 2
patients positive for dengue [fever] as positive for [CCHF]," he explained.

The 1st patient suspected of CCHF was brought to the hospital on 14 Sep
2010. Since then, 20 more CCHF-suspected patients have been admitted, 10 of
whom were tested positive by the NIH. He said only 3 of the patients
diagnosed with CCHF are currently [still] in the hospital; the rest have
been discharged after full recovery.

Dr Hayyat said there has been no decline in the number of patients with
suspected CCHF and dengue coming to the hospital. A total of 139 patients
with suspected dengue fever have been admitted to the hospital since 19 Jan
2010, 15 [of whom] had positive tests for the disease by NIH. He said the
hospital is awaiting test results from NIH for 37 inpatients suspected of
having dengue fever.

[Apart from presumptive seasonal cases of CCHF in Baluchistan, there have
only been 3 reliably confirmed cases elsewhere in Pakistan. These were
described in detail in the preceding post entitled "Crimean-Congo hem.
fever - Pakistan (07): revised data, WHO 20101009.3670".

In view of the misdiagnoses reported above, independent confirmation of the
new suspected CCHF cases admitted to the HFH and the 10 apparently
NIH-confirmed CCHF cases is urgently required. Likewise, the status of the
presumed nosocomial infections previously described (about which there is
some uncertainty) also needs independent verification.
