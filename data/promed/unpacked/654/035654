Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 8
---------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 6 Apr 2005, 200 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Angola. Of these cases, 173 have died. Kuanza Sul has reported
its 1st case, bringing the number of affected provinces to 6, all
concentrated in the north-western part of the country.
For laboratory work, Marburg virus has been classified as an extremely
hazardous pathogen and can be handled safely only in specialized
high-containment laboratories. WHO has established an international network
of expert laboratories for the diagnosis of Marburg and other viral
haemorrhagic fevers. Within this network, laboratories in Canada, Germany,
South Africa, and the USA are providing diagnostic support for the Angolan
outbreak. All have experience in working with Marburg virus.
Scientists from these laboratories are sharing test results and information
on laboratory techniques in a virtual network and during weekly
teleconferences. To ensure accurate tracking of the outbreak, members of
the network are also standardizing methods for sample collection, testing,
and the interpretation of results. The various diagnostic tests for Marburg
haemorrhagic fever require skilled technical interpretation, as findings
can vary according to the phase of the patient's illness, the way in which
samples were taken, and the type of test used.
In Angola, a portable field laboratory is now operating in Uige and a 2nd
one should be operational in Luanda shortly. Field laboratories provide
rapid and sufficiently reliable results for use during an outbreak, when
decisions about appropriate case management and contact tracing need to be
made quickly. The laboratory network is providing backup support for
situations in which exceptionally precise diagnostic results are important
because of the implications for control measures. Such situations include
the possible exportation of a case to another country, and a suspected case
in a person who may have placed numerous other people at unusually high risk.
Sophisticated laboratory studies of the virus may help shed some light on
certain unusual features of the outbreak, including the high fatality rate
and the overwhelming concentration of initial cases in children under the
age of 5 years. In this regard, comparisons of the virus with strains from
previous outbreaks may be instructive.
A longer-term objective, whose achievement has long proved elusive, is to
determine where Marburg virus hides in nature between outbreaks. Studies of
viruses from Angola may offer some clues. Prior to the present outbreak,
Angola was not considered to fall within the geographical "hot zone",
thought to be in central and eastern Africa, for outbreaks and sporadic
cases of this rare disease.
Laboratories in the Marburg virtual network include: Canadian National
Microbiology Laboratory, Uige, Angola; Bernhard-Nocht-Institut f�r
Tropenmedizin, Hamburg, Germany; Institut f�r Virologie, Marburg, Germany;
National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health
Laboratory, Special Pathogens Unit, Sandringham, South Africa; and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Special Pathogen Branch,
Atlanta, USA.

[This update reports a dramatic increase in the number of cases and deaths.
The WHO update released yesterday gave the number of cases as 181 and the
number of deaths as 156. The update released today reports 19 additional
cases and another 17 deaths. - Mod.CP]
