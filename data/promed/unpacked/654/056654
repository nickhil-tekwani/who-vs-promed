A rare case of bovine tuberculosis has been confirmed in a South Dakota beef herd, according to State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven.

He said Thursday [2 Mar 2017] that the suspect animals were identified in February 2017 by meat inspectors during routine slaughter inspection of otherwise healthy-appearing animals. The cattle were traced to a herd in Harding County, northwest of Rapid City. Herd testing and laboratory confirmation has revealed additional infected animals.

"We are working closely with the affected herd owner and USDA officials and will be working with area veterinarians and other herd owners to evaluate the extent of the disease," Oedekoven said in a release.

Oedekoven said adjacent herds will be tested and that bovine TB is not a food safety threat, thanks to milk pasteurization and meat inspection programs.

Bovine TB is a respiratory disease. Infected animals may be capable of transmitting an infection to other animals even if they appear healthy. The United States has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to a cooperative eradication campaign.

["Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present."

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
