Leptospirosis in Dog Handlers and Military Working Dogs at Lackland AFB.
------------------------------------------------
4 students in the Lackland Air Force base (San Antonio, Texas) Dog Handler
course reported flu-like symptoms on 1 Sep 2004 and were referred to the
Infectious Disease Service, Brooke Army Medical Center for possible
Leptospirosis. Concurrently, the DOD (Department of Defense) Veterinary
Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory, FSH, found positive titers to 3
Leptospirosis serovars and identified the organism via dark field
microscope from 3 military working dogs (MWDs) in medical therapy for renal
failure. Inpatient and outpatient logs back to 28 Jun 2004 reveal no other
potential cases, and San Antonio Metropolitan Health Department is unaware
of any local cases.
Ongoing epidemiological investigation includes serology and culture of
other MWD handlers and MWDs with possible exposure, and environmental
sampling with possible rodent capture to identify the source of the
outbreak. The Medio Creek area of Lackland has been placed off-limits by
the 341st TRS Command until further notice.

[This is unusual, as the MWDs are very well cared for, and are generally
vaccinated against such diseases. Leptospirosis can be transmitted from the
urine of rats and other animals. The MWDs are not usually kept in
rodent-infested areas. So the epidemiology for the dogs and their handlers
is interesting. - Mod.TG]
