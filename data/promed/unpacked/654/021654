Influenza at the human-animal interface (HAI)
Summary and assessment, 8 Dec 2017 to 25 Jan 2018
-------------------------------------------------
New infections: Since the previous update, new human infections with avian influenza A(H5N6) and A(H7N9) viruses, and influenza A(H1N1)v and A(H3N2)v viruses were reported.

Risk assessment: The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. Further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected.

IHR compliance: All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and its heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those, that is, A(H1) or A(H3), circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.

Avian influenza viruses
-----------------------
Current situation:
Avian influenza A(H5) viruses
-----------------------------
Since the last update on 7 Dec 2017, one new laboratory-confirmed human case of influenza A(H5N6) virus infection was reported to WHO.
- A 3-year-old female resident of Fujian Province, China, developed symptoms on 19 Dec 2017. She was diagnosed and treated as an outpatient and has recovered. The patient had exposure to live poultry before illness onset; no further human cases were reported among her close contacts. Additional information on the virus from the case is anticipated.

A total of 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014.

According to the animal health authorities in China, influenza A(H5N6) viruses have been detected in poultry in the 1st half of 2017 in many provinces in the country, including those that have reported human cases. Influenza A(H5) subtype viruses have the potential to infect humans and thus far, no human cases, other than those with influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses, have been reported to WHO. According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Influenza A(H5N6) viruses have recently been detected in parts of Europe and Asia, however these A(H5N6) viruses are different from the A(H5N6) influenza viruses which have infected humans in China.

Risk assessment
1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses will occur?
Most human cases were exposed to A(H5) viruses through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected.
2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H5) viruses?
Even though small clusters of A(H5) virus infections have been reported previously including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this and other A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.
3. What is the likelihood of international spread of avian influenza A(H5) viruses by travellers?
Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as evidence suggests these viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.

Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses
-------------------------------
Since the last update on 7 Dec 2017, one new laboratory-confirmed human case of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection was reported to WHO. A 72-year-old male resident of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, developed symptoms on 3 January[2018]. He was hospitalized on 6 Jan 2018 and passed away on 10 Jan 2018. The patient had exposure to a live poultry market before illness onset; no further human cases were reported among his close contacts. Additional information on the virus from the case is anticipated.

Since 2013, a total of 1566 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 613 deaths, have been reported to WHO (Figure 1 -- [available at the source URL above]). If the incidence of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of reported human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are therefore expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

The agricultural authorities in China have announced that vaccination of domestic poultry against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses has commenced, in addition to the ongoing poultry vaccination program against avian influenza A(H5) viruses. Overall, the risk assessment has not changed.

Risk assessment
1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses will occur? Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus likely continues to circulate in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected.
2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses? Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.
3. What is the likelihood of international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by travelers? Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.

Overall risk management recommendations
---------------------------------------
- WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance.
- WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.
- Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, especially over the coming winter months. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.
- All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.
- It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.
