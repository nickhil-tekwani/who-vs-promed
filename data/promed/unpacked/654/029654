[Avian mycoplasmosis is caused by several pathogenic mycoplasmas of which _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ (MG) and _M. synoviae_ (MS) are the most important; they are the only ones listed by the OIE. Both occur worldwide.

MG causes chronic respiratory disease of domestic poultry, especially in the presence of management stresses and/or other respiratory pathogens. Disease is characterised by coryza, conjunctivitis, sneezing, and by sinusitis, particularly in turkeys and game birds. It can result in loss of production and downgrading of meat-type birds, and loss of egg production. MS may cause respiratory disease, synovitis, or may result in a silent infection. MG and MS strains vary in infectivity and virulence, and infections may sometimes be unapparent.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual, chapter 2.3.5 "Avian mycoplasmosis (_Mycoplasma gallisepticum, _M. synoviae_)" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.05_%20AVIAN_MYCO.pdf.

Avian mycoplasmosis is not a public health threat. - Mod.CRD
