[A month] after the 1st case of cholera in the province of Cienfuegos was unofficially reported, the number of infected by the disease has been triggered, affecting tens of citizens throughout the length and width of the southern central territory.

The most significant outbreaks are located currently in the Reina barrio, the oldest and most unhealthy of the capital city of Cienfuegos and in Miramontes, a hamlet located in the boundaries of the neighborhood of Caunao. The polyclinic located in this neighborhood has been conditioned to admit only patients referred with cholera. A worker told us that the 1st level of the building is overcrowded because they are setting up the upper floor.

All the neighborhoods in the city of Cienfuegos have confirmed cases of infection. We have been able to verify the presence of the epidemic in at least 3 of the 8 municipalities of the province.

Both the Gustavo Aldereguia Lima Provincial Hospital and the Paquito Gomez Pediatric Hospital have set aside rooms for cholera patients. Each municipality has at least a polyclinic where the cases that come under suspicion of cholera are received and later referred [to the provincial hospital] for medical care.

In Reina, to date, 32 patients have been counted, 3 of them in extremely serious condition. Miramontes has had a similar number. A nurse who works at the Rehabilitation Center of the polyclinic area 1 told us that stocks of both doxycycline and azithromycin, 2 antimicrobials that are being supplied for preventive therapy, are beginning to be exhausted.

Despite being in quarantine, health authorities continue to allow the free flow of passers-by who enter and leave the district without any requirements.

It is suspected that many infections are spread through the consumption of fish that have their habitat in the bay where the sewage of the city is released and also mixed with the drinking water that flows through a system that is more than 100 years old and therefore has many defects which facilitate the contamination of the water.

For the 1st time in Reina, messages are being spread by outdoor speakers warning the public of the presence of cholera in a clear and direct language.

[ProMED-mail first posted regarding cases of cholera in the south central Cuban province of Cienfuegos at the beginning of May 2013. Cases and deaths from cholera continue to be reported primarily from non-government sources. Most of the cases appear to be occurring in the eastern provinces of Holguin, Guantanamo, and Granma, although the infection is also occurring in the western capital of Havana, where a number of foreign travelers from Latin America and Europe were recently diagnosed with cholera on their return home. Granma province is the site of the original cluster of cases beginning in June 2012.
