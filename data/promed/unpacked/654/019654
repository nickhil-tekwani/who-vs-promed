Visceral leishmaniasis, commonly known as kala-azar, is the most deadly parasitic disease after malaria. It affects poor people in arid and semi-arid regions.

Eastern Africa is the most affected in Africa, with an estimated 29 000 to 56 000 cases every year.

Like all neglected diseases, kala-azar affects mainly the poorest populations that have little or no purchasing power. These population groups are usually overlooked and often do not have access to life-saving treatments.

Furthermore, private pharmaceutical companies lack interest in producing new drugs for patients suffering from neglected diseases since they cannot recoup their investments in drug development.

Research for new treatments is, therefore, not prioritised, making drugs unavailable, inaccessible, and unaffordable.

In 2003, 4 countries -- Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda -- partnered to create the Leishmaniasis East Africa Platform (LEAP), the main mandate of which was to research new treatment options for kala-azar and support their access.

[More information on the Leishmaniasis East Africa Platform (LEAP), can be found at http://www.dndi.org/strengthening-capacity/leap-platform.html.

Leishmaniasis control is primarily based on control of the sandfly vector and the rodent reservoirs. However, human can also act as reservoirs and mortality in untreated cases of visceral leishmaniasis approach 100 percent.

Visceral leishmaniasis is also an HIV-associated disease and has a more rapid course in HIV infected persons where treatment also is difficult even in patients with a high CD4 T cell count. The LEAP initiative is therefore an important and very welcome initiative to improve treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa. - Mod.EP]
