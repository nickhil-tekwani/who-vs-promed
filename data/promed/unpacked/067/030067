Confirmed: [5 Jul 2021]
Reported: 28 Jul 2021
Reason for notification: Recurrence
Last occurrence: 17 Mar 2021
Causal agent: Rift Valley fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Kikuyu, Kiambu
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Jun 2021
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 23 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: The outbreak is affecting a herd of dairy cattle in a zero grazed system of production presenting with non-specific abortions occurring at any stage. Affected cattle did not present any other disease symptom prior to the sudden abortion. There was no noticeable change in their feeding and production.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Vectors
Epidemiological comments: This is a localized outbreak that can be attributed to cryptic RVF transmission in vegetative riverine and wet areas (areas with a lot of dams, ponds and artificial lakes) that are conducive for mosquito breeding.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, quarantine, screening, movement control inside the country

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratories Kabete (national laboratory) / Cattle / Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM-capture ELISA) / 5 Jul 2021 / Positive

"RVFV is endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and continues to cause sporadic outbreaks that are of veterinary and public health concern. Although RVFV is primarily a disease of domestic and wild animals, there can be spillover to humans during outbreaks than can lead in rare cases to lethal hemorrhagic disease in humans. RVFV outbreaks occur in 7-10-year cycles presumably as the number of seropositive animals in the population decrease, and/or ideal weather conditions for the mosquito vectors are present. It has also been suggested that recently emerged strains of RVFV might be more virulent to humans. Thus, RVF is clearly a disease that requires a 'One Health' approach to mitigation strategies as it is a potential threat to animal and public health, economy, and food security." - Mod.CRD
