A total of 6 adults and 3 children of a commune were recently infected and are being taken care of by the hospital of Limoges.

"We cannot talk about an epidemic," says Gérard Defougère, Mayor of the Magny, "but we must remain very vigilant." This is the result of the discovery, 10 days ago, of a case of hepatitis A in the commune. "It was an adult who showed signs of extreme fatigue," continued the first magistrate. And then another case arrived and then another ... "some in the school environment", since 3 children were affected.

The Regional Health Agency was of course alerted and immediately advocated stronger hygiene measures and the drinking of bottled water.

"We have listed 6 cases of adults and 3 cases in children" who were taken in charge at the hospital of Limoges. "The first case has been discharged. As for the origins of the virus, this is currently unknown. Analyses are ongoing. All that is certain is that it is necessary to accentuate the hygiene measures by regularly washing the hands and avoiding drinking water of a doubtful origin."

[With a cluster of acute hepatitis A in a small area in central France, a food or waterborne source is likely. Since, especially in children, hepatitis A infection can be asymptomatic or can be anicteric (without jaundice); it is likely that there are a substantial number of unrecognized cases. ProMED awaits more information regarding the cluster which may also result in secondary cases especially in household or daycare settings - Mod.LL
