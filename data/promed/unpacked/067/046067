Saigon Tiep Thi newspaper Monday [17 Sep 2012] quoted doctors at the HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City] Hospital of Tropical Diseases as saying they found the amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_, which causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, in a sample sent by the Center for Forensic Science. No further information is available yet, and the identity of the dead boy is not known.

Dr Phan Van Hieu, director of the center, which is run by the city Health Department, told the newspaper that an investigation has begun. The results are expected later this week, Hieu told Tuoi Tre newspaper.

Tran Phu Manh Sieu, director of the Preventive Health Department, told Thanh Nien that he has yet to receive a report on the case.

Earlier this month [September 2012], the Ministry of Health said that a 27-year-old man was the 1st ever victim of the disease in Viet Nam. He had been hospitalized on [30 Jul 2012] and died 3 days later.

The man, belonging to the central province of Phu Yen, was suspected of contracting the amoeba when swimming in a lake to catch oysters in a village near his hometown.

Saigon Tiep Thi quoted experts as saying that the 2 cases proved that the amoeba does pose a threat in Viet Nam but was never detected or mentioned before due to lack of knowledge and equipment.

The HCMC Hospital of Tropical Diseases had diagnosed the 1st case only with support from British experts.

[The newswire reports the 2nd detected case of meningoencephalitis caused by _Naegleria fowleri_ in Viet Nam. The 1st case was reported in the previous PRO/MBDS post "Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary - Viet Nam: Phu Yen 20120912.2259."

It seems that the detection of these cases in Viet Nam is due to improved testing equipment and technical support from international experts.

[Free living amoeba is probably found worldwide if you look for it, and as noted in the moderator's comment above, new equipment for detection and diagnosis has been introduced, which explains the present reports from Viet Nam. - Mod.EP]
