The 2nd reported case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in New Mexico has left a 9 year old Farmington boy fighting for his life in a Colorado hospital.

For the last month, GH said his family has been left with a lot of questions "They realized that he wasn't doing good, but they still didn't know it was that serious," GH said. In January [2018], he said his son came down with what they thought was the flu. "You usually take them in, and you send them back out with the medicine, and you're fine, so this time I thought the same thing," GH said.

The Farmington family said they were in and out of the hospital for days until the 9 year old got really sick. On his birthday, he was air-lifted to the Children's Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. "And 4 days ago, they found the hantavirus. He tested positive for that," he said.

This appears to be the 2nd case of the virus reported in the Farmington area in one month. Last week, KRQE News 13 told you about KL. The 27 year old is still at the University of New Mexico Hospital fighting for her life after doctors say she tested positive for the virus in January [2018].

Both families said they're still trying to figure out how their loved ones contracted it. The Department of Health said that it is aware of the 2 cases. However, it says it cannot confirm that it is 100 per cent [a] hantavirus [infection] without further testing.

[The hantavirus involved in this current New Mexico case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. As the above report notes, there is no information about the circumstances or the location under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY
