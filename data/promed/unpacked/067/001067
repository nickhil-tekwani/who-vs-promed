This year's [2015] 3rd human case of the plague in New Mexico was confirmed by health officials [Thu 3 Sep 2015]. The case was confirmed in a 59-year-old woman from Bernalillo County, who is recovering. The other cases in the state occurred in a 52-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, who died from the illness and in a 65-year-old man from Bernalillo County who recovered.

"All 3 of New Mexico's human plague cases in 2015 have been septicemic plague, which is less common and more difficult to recognize," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "I urge all health care providers who see patients with a fever of unknown origin, and who are presenting from plague endemic areas of the state to consider plague in their diagnosis." Septicemic plague accounts for as much as 25 percent of New Mexico cases.

Septicemic plague has no specific features or detectable swollen lymph node, by which it can be distinguished from other infectious diseases, although abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are common.

Plague is a potentially fatal illness in people that occurs in many parts of New Mexico. It is caused by bacteria found in rodents, especially ground squirrels, rabbits, and hares. Most human cases of plague are acquired through the bite of infected fleas. Dogs and cats are also susceptible to plague and are infected either through bites of infected fleas or by eating an animal that has died from the disease.

Symptoms of plague in people usually develop 2 to 8 days after exposure. Typical symptoms include sudden fever, chills, headaches, and swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin areas. As stated earlier, no detectable swollen lymph node is found in cases of primary septicemic plague. In addition to the 3 human cases, there have been 7 cases of plague this year [2015] in dogs and cats, including pets from Bernalillo, Santa Fe, and Torrance counties.

[The following was extracted from Prentice MB, Rahalison L: Plague. Lancet. 2007; 369(9568): 1196-207 with the citations removed:

Some plague cases (10-25 percent) present with primary septicemia (hypotension, shock) without lymph nodes being obviously affected and these patients have higher mortality than those with bubonic plague. The term septicemic plague can be confusing, since most patients with buboes have detectable bacteraemia at some stage and can also have high-density bacteraemia with systemic signs of sepsis. Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites. - Mod.LL
