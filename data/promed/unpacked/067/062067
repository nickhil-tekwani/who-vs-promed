An injured elk killed by a Division of Wildlife officer on 6 September in
Routt County tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). This is the
first time an elk with the disease has been found outside the endemic area
of north eastern Colorado. An area resident had first called the division
to report an injured elk along a county road. The wildlife officer found
the elk in poor condition, with an injured jaw. The animal was tested for
CWD as part of the agency's disease surveillance effort. The results of 2
different tests performed at Colorado State University's diagnostic
laboratory confirmed the elk was infected with CWD.
"This is disappointing, but not a surprise," said Jeff Ver Steeg, the
Division of Wildlife's terrestrial wildlife manager. "Earlier this year we
found 10 wild mule deer with CWD in Routt County, so we knew it was
possible that other deer may have the disease in that area. We were hoping
we would not find it in elk."
Nearly 700 deer and elk have been submitted for testing to the Division of
Wildlife by Colorado hunters so far in September, and testing has been
completed on more than 400 at Colorado State. So far 6 animals have tested
positive -- 2 deer and 2 elk from the established area in northeastern
Colorado, one deer west of Chatfield Reservoir, and the Routt County elk.
"We are continuing to encourage hunters to submit deer and elk for testing
as part of our surveillance program," Ver Steeg said. "When the hunting
season is completed and we've had time to evaluate all of the test results,
we will determine what additional management we may need to undertake in
specific areas."
CWD is a fatal neurological disease of deer and elk, which has been
established in a portion of north eastern Colorado and south eastern
Wyoming for over 2 decades. About 5 per cent of deer and less than 1 per
cent of elk are infected within the established area. The only other area
where the disease has been found in Colorado is in Routt County in north
western Colorado.
An aberrant protein found in the brain, nervous system, and lymphatic
tissue of deer and elk causes the disease. State and federal health
officials have found no link between CWD and any illness in humans or any
other species. As a precaution, hunters are urged not to eat the meat of
any animal infected with CWD or any other disease. Hunters may submit deer
and elk for CWD testing at Division of Wildlife offices around the state
