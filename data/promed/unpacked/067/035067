Rare crop disease hits Lainya
-----------------------------
An official in Lainya County of Central Equatoria State says the county has been hit by a rare crop disease that has destroyed huge amounts of crops. This has affected the level of cultivation, and hinders the struggle to achieve food security in the area.

Huda Micah [Lainya county Commissioner, said] that the disease is spreading quickly [in] the county. She said [it] is a significant threat to farmers. "We have not yet identified what kind of disease it is. It is only affecting crops like beans, even sorghums now", she said.

She also said the State Ministry of Agriculture has sent an assessment team to investigate the crops disease.

[Since beans and sorghums are from very diverse plant families in the dicot and monocot groups, respectively, the problems described above may be due to different diseases for the different hosts. Both legumes and cereals can be affected by a wide range of pathogens many of which are known to occur in the region. Reliable diagnosis will be crucial for development of control strategies in any affected crops.
