A plane from the Dominican Republic to Britain [Scotland] was temporarily
quarantined on arrival at Glasgow airport on Thu 9 Aug 2007, after
passengers fell sick with a stomach bug, a spokesman said. Some 27
passengers fell ill on the MyTravel flight, which landed at the Scottish
airport on Thursday [9 Aug 2007] morning.
"The aircraft was quarantined on arrival," said Donald Morrison, a
spokesman for the British Airports Authority (BAA) in Scotland, adding that
a team of 4 doctors was organized to check the passengers over. "They were
diagnosed with norovirus infection, more commonly known as winter vomiting
bug," he added. The passengers had all stayed at the same hotel in the
Dominican Republic, one of the world's poorest countries. All affected
passengers received treatment and none required hospitalization.
"The aircraft has since left the airport on another flight," Morrison
added. He did not say where the passengers had picked up the bug but the
Evening Times newspaper in Glasgow said they had been staying at the same
hotel on the Caribbean island where a number of people recently caught a
similar illness.

[Outbreaks of norovirus infection are common in situations where people
from diverse backgrounds congregate, such as at hotels, camps, and on
cruise ships. The report above is unique in that it records a quarantine
incident affecting passengers on an aircraft. The passengers were allowed
to disperse following medical assessment. It is not stated what if any
steps were taken to disinfect the aircraft. Disinfection procedures
allowing the rapid turn-round of cruise ships have been developed, which
appear to be effective and could be implemented in passenger aircraft (see
