Brucellosis in sheep and goats (excluding _Brucella ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Pathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle (see OIE Terrestrial Manual Chapter 2.4.3 Bovine brucellosis at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf).

In most circumstances, the primary route of transmission of _Brucella_ is the placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have a full-term parturition. Shedding of _Brucella_ is also common in udder secretions and semen, and _Brucella_ may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen, and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides, and testes), and from arthritic lesions.

The World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory biosafety manual classifies _Brucella_ (and particularly _B. melitensis_) in Risk group III. Brucellosis is readily transmissible to humans, causing acute febrile illness -- undulant fever -- which may progress to a more chronic form and can also produce serious complications affecting the musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Infection is often due to occupational exposure and is essentially acquired by the oral, respiratory, or conjunctival routes, but ingestion of dairy products constitutes the main risk to the general public. There is an occupational risk to veterinarians, abattoir workers, and farmers who handle infected animals and aborted fetuses or placentas. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections, and strict safety precautions should be observed when handling cultures and heavily infected samples, such as products of abortion.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.7.2 "Caprine and ovine brucellosis (excluding _Brucella ovis_)", version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2009 at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.02_CAPRINE_OVINE_BRUC.pdf

Quantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database indicates that during 2012, 1603 outbreaks were reported in Europe: Armenia (49), Azerbaijan (48), Bosnia and Herzegovina (31), Former Yug Rep of Macedonia (15), France (3), Greece (32), Italy (330), Portugal (133), Russia (26), Serbia (2), Spain (244), and Turkey (690).

During 2010, Croatia reported 7 outbreaks to the OIE, these were located in the regions of Lika-Senj (4) and Split-Dalmatia (3). This and additional data on these events can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary?reportid
(Note: to view the information on _Brucella melitensis_, scroll down to the name of the disease and choose time period).

During 2012 several countries reported human cases of brucellosis to the OIE through the annual report. Although the type of brucella species which affected humans was not specified, it is worth mentioning the number of human cases reported in Azerbaijan (275), Bosnia and Herzegovina (68), Greece (123), Former Yug Rep of Macedonia (82), Portugal (47), and Turkey (6759).
