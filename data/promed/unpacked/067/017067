AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN - EAST ASIA (191): INDONESIA, VIET NAM: CORRECTION
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

Sponsored in part by Elsevier, publisher of
Tropical Infectious Diseases, 2nd edition

CORRECTION: Dr. Olav Hungnes <Olav.Hungnes@fhi.no> (Dept.of Airborne
Infections, Div. of Infectious Disease Control, Norwegian Inst. of Public
Health, Oslo, Norway), Dr. Joe Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com> and
correspondent David Price have pointed out that the edited report from the
Irish newspaper "Evening Echo," posted as part [2] of the ProMED-mail post
"Avian influenza, human - East Asia (190): Indonesia, Viet Nam," is indeed
an echo! This article matches word-for-word parts of the text of a report
from "Sunday Business Post Online," another Irish news provider, which was
posted on ProMED-mail in March 2005 as part [2] of "Avian influenza, human
- East Asia (47): Viet Nam."
Probably, this error is a consequence of the fact that the original texts
of the reports as received from the correspondents, the 1st in March 2005
and the 2nd in December 2005, were both dated "12/03/05." In Europe, this
date would be read as the 12th March 2005, and, across the Atlantic, as the
3rd of December 2005 (and, no doubt, by search engines as either). When
moderating the report received in December 2005, I [Mod.CP] suggested the
information should interpreted with caution, because I could find no recent
references to the patient at the center of the story nor to some other
material which I edited out as inconsistent with recent events in Viet Nam.
Dr. Hungnes has also provided, as follows, the clarification that I had
suggested should be awaited. The H5N1 infection of the nurse at the center
of the report was never confirmed. In addition to the 21-year-old male, his
14-year-old sister, and their grandfather, a 26-year-old male nurse who
tended to the 21-year-old was also diagnosed with H5N1 infection.
We are grateful to Dr. Hungnes, Dr. Dudley and David Price for detecting
this error, and our apologies for misleading anyone. - Mods.CP/MPP
