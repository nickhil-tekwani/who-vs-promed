---------------------------------
In 2017, several cases of relapsing fever in Texas were reported among cave workers. The Israeli equivalent of the disease is in fact known as "cave fever," with most cases reported among tourists in caves. [1,2]

Notably, an American tourist acquired "cave fever" in Israel in 1988. The regional pathogen, _Borrelia persica_ is found in approximately 10 percent of caves and is transmitted by _Ornithodorus tholozani_, an argassid ("soft") tick. The annual incidence has remained fairly stable at 5 to 15 cases for the past 5 decades. See graph at: https://www.gideononline.com/2018/04/21/cave-fever-in-the-united-states-and-israel/.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Berger for his continued contributions.

In 2000, ProMED-mail posted a report from Dr. Itzhaki concerning occasional outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) among military personnel in Israel during the previous several decades, as well as cases of TBRF in tourists returning home from Israel (Borreliosis, relapsing fever, soldiers - Israel 20000423.0602). In a subsequent ProMED-mail post, Dr. Berger reported that TBRF in Israel is most often acquired in caves and bunkers (underground bomb shelters?), that TBRF in Israel is due to _Borrelia persica_, that the local vector, _Ornithodoros tholozani_, is widely distributed in the northern highlands, coastal plain and Negev desert, and that approximately 10% of caves in Israel are infested (Borreliosis, relapsing fever - Israel: background 20000423.0607). Another report says that 30-60% of caves in Israel were found to be infested and that PCR studies of _Borrelia_ infection of _O. tholozani_ ticks collected in caves showed very variable rates, ranging from less than 2% to 40% (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14607059).

Physicians should be aware of TBRF in returning febrile tourists who spent time in caves in Israel (https://www.israel21c.org/top-10-caves-of-israel/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367340/) or elsewhere (http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(11)00069-X/pdf). - Mod.ML
