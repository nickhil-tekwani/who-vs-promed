SR feels lucky to be alive after several visits to the hospital in October [2020]. She had several symptoms that overlap with COVID-19, but was eventually diagnosed with a hantavirus [infection] -- an extremely rare and often fatal disease.

"I had a high fever, headaches," she said.

SR said her symptoms began a few days after a hiking and camping trip on the Colorado Trail. She took a COVID-19 test, which came back negative as her symptoms worsened. "I had low oxygen. I went to the hospital, assumed I had COVID, again ... negative," she said.

After a 2nd trip to the hospital, medical experts tested for several influenzas and did imaging screenings before a pulmonologist determined her diagnosis was the rare hantavirus [infection].

"I had fluid around my lungs, fluid around my heart," she said. "Because it's so rare, I was actually kind of blown away. I actually got this disease and didn't die."

According to the CDC, hantavirus is spread through the air by deer mice droppings or fluids.

Medical experts do not know where SR contracted the hantavirus, but she wants others to know the disease exists in Colorado.

"It may not be COVID," SR said. "If you have been around mice, let your doctor know about that event."

The CDC says symptoms of hantavirus [infection] can include fatigue, fever, body aches and stomach problems. According to UCHealth, there have been 151 cases in Colorado since 1993.

"I'm very grateful to our doctors and medical system for figuring this out," SR said. "I feel lucky to be on the green side. That's what I feel."

[This is the 2nd case of a hantavirus infection in Colorado that ProMED has posted this year (2020). One was posted last year (2019) and ProMED posted 3 Colorado cases in 2018.

The specific circumstances under which the case above contracted the infection was not indicated but probably involved an area where mouse droppings indicated that the rodent reservoir of the virus was present. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus (SNV). Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious and progress swiftly, so patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

The clinical diagnosis for the 1st 2020 case was hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome that suggests that SEOV (Seoul orthohantavirus) was the etiological agent. Although the Colorado state diagnostic laboratory reported seropositive results for SNV, the authors of the report point out that serologic cross-reactivity makes a definitive diagnosis uncertain (see Hantavirus - Americas (03): USA (CO) 20200206.6958611).

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions indicated above and those that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of SNV. An image can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
