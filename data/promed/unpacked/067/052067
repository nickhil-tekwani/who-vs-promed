Abstract
---------
We report genetic evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) circulation from southern and northeastern Brazilian states isolated from equine red blood cells. In the northeastern state, the 10th human case was also detected, presenting neuroinvasive disease compatible with WNV infection. Our analyses demonstrate much is still unknown on the virus' local epidemiology. We advocate for a shift to active surveillance, to ensure adequate control for future epidemics with spillover potential to humans.

Text
----
West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family, was first identified in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937, but is nowadays commonly found in Africa, Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia (1-3).

WNV transmission is maintained in a mosquito-bird cycle, for which the genus _Culex_ [spp.], in particular _Cx. pipiens_, are considered the principal vectors (4). WNV can infect humans, equines and other mammals, but these are considered "dead-end" hosts, given their weak potential to function as amplifying hosts to spread infection onwards (5,6). Around 80% of WNV infections in humans are asymptomatic, while the rest may develop mild or severe disease. Mild disease includes fever, headache, tiredness and vomiting (7,8), while severe disease (neuroinvasive) is characterized by high fever, coma, convulsions and paralysis (7,8). Equine infections can occasionally cause neurological disease and death (7,8), such that equines typically serve as sentinel species for WNV outbreaks with potential for spillover into human populations.

We report genetic evidence of WNV circulation from southern and northeastern Brazilian states isolated from equine red blood cells. In the northeastern state the 10th human case was also detected, presenting neuroinvasive disease compatible with WNV infection. Our analyses demonstrate much is still unknown on the virus' local epidemiology. We advocate for a shift to active surveillance, to ensure adequate control for future epidemics with spillover potential to humans.

Genome detection of WNV in South America [was] originally reported in horses (Argentina in 2006) and captive flamingos (Colombia in 2012) (9,10). The 1st ever sequenced genome in Brazil was in 2019, when the virus was isolated from a horse sickened with severe neurological disease in the Esprito Santo state (11). Despite multiple studies reporting serological evidence suggestive of WNV circulation in Brazil (11-13) and reports human WNV disease confirmed cases in the Piaui state (13), much is unknown about genomic diversity, evolution and transmission dynamics across the country.

Here, we report genetic evidence of WNV circulation in 3 Brazilian states extracted from equine red blood cells (RBCs) with neurological or ophthalmic disease and use a computational approach to explore the theoretical transmission potential of WNV within of those states.

Samples (RBCs) from 3 horses with suspected WNV infection obtained from southern (Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo) and northeastern (Piaui) Brazilian states were sent for molecular diagnosis at the Departamento de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

Conclusion
-----------
Our analyses indicate that additional data are required to better identify routes of WNV importation into Brazil, and to understand its local transmission dynamics. Critically, it is still uncertain where in the country WNV is endemic. Indeed, if under-reporting is frequent, the data presented in this article are compatible with both sporadic or endemic local transmission. Furthermore, the detection of WNV RNA from equine whole blood presented in this study proved to be an effective diagnostic method in horses. Shifting from passive to active WNV screening and sequencing in equines and birds in Brazil must be implemented to better understand the virus' local epidemiology, and to be able to act accordingly to prevent any future epidemics with significant spillover to humans.

[Since equines are known to have the disease, then it is clearly circulating in the region. Perhaps mosquito testing should also be considered. Mosquitoes can be trapped and tested or even sequenced for more information regarding any strain difference between horse and mosquito.

Please also note West Nile virus was shown in horses the Brazilian states of Espirito Santo and Ceara in 2019 (see ProMED post West Nile virus (19): Americas (Brazil) horse, OIE 20190725.6586397). - Mod.TG
