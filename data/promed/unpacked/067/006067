Poliomyelitis vaccination for Cape Verdians in The Netherlands
--------------------------------------------------------------
We learned from the polio-eradication web-site
<http://www.polioeradication.org/afpextract.asp> that there has been a
recent increase of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Cape Verde (435 000
inhabitants). WHO confirmed that Poliovirus type 1 has been isolated. The
Cape Verdian health authorities have organised a vaccination campaign with
a first round in mid October (children under 5 years of age) and a second
round in November starting this week (children under 15 years of age). See
also <http://www.polioeradication.org/nidcalendar.htm>.
The Netherlands has a small community of 20 000 Cape Verdians, mainly
living in the Rotterdam area. There is weekly air traffic of Cape Verdians
to and from their country of origin. After consultation with WHO-Europe,
the Municipal Health Services in The Netherlands that have large
populations of Cape Verdians in their catchment area, decided to offer
vaccination to under-vaccinated Cape Verdians. On Thu 23 Nov 2000, Cape
Verdians living in The Netherlands will be informed through the media
(press, radio) on how to obtain vaccination, which will be available from
Sat 25 Nov 2000.
