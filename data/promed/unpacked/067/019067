University of Massachusetts Amherst officials say a student on campus has been diagnosed with meningitis weeks after another student fell ill with a related illness and are suggesting students consider an additional vaccination as a precaution.

A student was diagnosed with a meningococcal illness last month [October 2017] that was later determined to be a strain of the disease not covered by the vaccine students must have to attend the school. The 2nd student, who lives in a residence hall, was diagnosed on [Sun 12 Nov 2017] with bacterial meningitis.

"It is not known yet whether the 1st case led to the 2nd case," University Health Services [UHS] Executive Director George Corey said at a press conference [Tue 14 Nov 2017] afternoon. UMass Amherst is the state's largest public university and more than 3-quarters of its 21 000 undergraduate students are from the state.

Meningococcal disease can lead to meningitis -- a potentially deadly infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord -- and infections of the blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even when treated, meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 percent of infected people, the center says. As many as 10 to 20 percent of survivors suffer disabilities like hearing loss, brain damage, kidney failure and amputations. "Meningococcal disease often occurs without warning - even among people who are otherwise healthy," the center says.

The university said it is reaching out to those close to the student diagnosed this weekend, who is in stable condition at an area hospital. The student diagnosed [24 Oct 2017] is also in stable condition, the university said.

"Because these 2 students were not in close contact with each other, these 2 cases raise our level of concern," Corey said in a statement. "UHS is working in consultation with federal and state public health officials, and will be updating advice as more information becomes available."

The student diagnosed [24 Oct 2017] has a serogroup B infection, a strain not covered by the meningitis vaccine required for college attendance. That vaccine covers strains A, C, Y and W, the university said. The serogroup B vaccine is available on campus.

Meningococcal disease spreads via close contact like coughing or kissing or lengthy contact among people living in the same household. The university advised students not to "swap saliva" and to avoid sharing food and drinks, cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing and wash hands regularly.

"As with all vaccines, protection is not immediate and should be thought of as a wise precaution for this winter and for several years to come," Corey said in a statement.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ann Yao Zhang for submitting the above information regarding meningococcus group B disease on the University of Massachusetts Amherst with 2 primary cases of meningococcus disease within 1 month. The 1st case was caused by serogroup B; the 2nd case's serogroup is still pending.

A primary case is a case that occurs in the absence of previous known close contact with another case-patient.

An outbreak is defined by the occurrence of at least 3 confirmed or probable primary cases of the same serogroup meningococcal disease during a period of 3 months or less, with a resulting primary attack rate of 10 or more cases per 100 000 population. If both cases are caused by serogroup B, 2 primary cases in 21 000 UMass Amherst undergraduates gives a primary attack rate of 9.5 / 100 000.

In some instances the attack rate will be greater than 10 cases per 100 000 population with only 2 or 3 cases. According to the CDC, "in these situations, vaccination may be considered after only 2 primary cases are identified. Examples of an organization-based outbreak include cases in schools, churches, and universities" (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

Outbreaks of meningococcal disease are usually caused by the same or closely related strains. Molecular genotyping will help characterize an outbreak clone. - Mod.ML
