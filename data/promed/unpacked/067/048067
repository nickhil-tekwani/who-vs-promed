Arunachal Pradesh has sounded a high alert following the death of a 10 year old girl and reports of 11 other people being affected by Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the state.

A 10 year old girl of Sippi village in Upper Subansiri district, who was admitted to Arunachal State Hospital died on Thursday [24 Jul 2014], state epidemiologist Dr L Jampa told PTI on Saturday [26 Jul 2014]. The other affected people include children in the age group of 1-14 years besides an 18 year old, he stated. They were undergoing treatment at the Arunachal State Hospital [ASH] since last week, while 2 cases being treated in Guwahati Medical College Hospital in Assam were reportedly improving, he said.

Anticipating similar cases associated with convulsions, seizures, rigidity, and also loss of consciousness, the state health department has geared up its surveillance mechanism besides initiating testing facility at the ASH.

Delhi-based National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)'s central division has been requested to provide sufficient JE-virus testing kits to the state urgently and the RMRC-ICMR [Regional Medical Research Centre-Indian Council of Medical Research] at Dibrugarh [Assam] has been requested to assist in the laboratory testing and confirmation of the JE infection, Dr Jampa said.

The statement said 4 cases have been tested positive for the JE virus in ASH laboratory of which one had also been confirmed as positive JEV by RMRC, Dibrugarh.

Health & Family Welfare minister Kalikho Pul has appealed to the civil society to remain alert to prevent the spread of the disease by following the do's [actions? - Mod.SH] suggested by the department. He said preventing the virus [mosquito vectors] from breeding in stagnant water sources could go a long way in averting the disease.

Between June-August last year [2013] 14 cases, all from Assam, were reported at Rama Krishna Mission Hospital, and 10 encephalitis cases were reported for the 1st time in the state in 2010.

[Japanese encephalitis virus infections are suspected in all of these cases. The monsoon has begun, which signals the beginning of the JE virus transmission season. Laboratory tests confirmed JE virus infection in 4 of the patients and the status of the remaining patients awaits laboratory confirmation. The report above does not provide information about the vaccination status of the affected individuals or of the population in the area where they live.
