One person has died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at Naguru Hospital in Kampala today [24 Aug 2018], the Ministry of Health has confirmed.

Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the ministry's senior spokesperson, said that the deceased is a 32-year-old female from Bukerere, in Mukono District.

"The Ministry of Health has dispatched rapid response teams to trace her contacts. She will be accorded a safe burial by our medical teams to avoid future spread of the disease. The burial will take place in Sembabule District," Mr Ainebyoona said.

Blood samples were collected on Wednesday [22 Aug 2018] and taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, where they tested positive for CCHF.

The CCHF is a viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted to humans through tick bites. It can also be transmitted through contact with the blood of infected animals. The case fertility ranges between 10-40 per cent and can be treated.

"The general public is advised to use protective gear and gloves when in close contact with infected persons; regular hand washing is recommended, avoid tick-to-human transmission by wearing protective clothes like long sleeved shirts and a pair of trousers," Mr Ainebyoona added.

Uganda last recorded cases of CCHF in May this year [2018] when a 35-year-old male from Nkoko sub-county in Bugangaizi County, Kakumiro District died of the disease at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.

Other cases had also been recorded earlier in January 2018 when 4 cases and one death were confirmed in Nakaseke District.

Those infected with the virus present symptoms such as muscle aches, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light), according to WHO.

[The best protection against CCHF is use of protective measures and strict implementation of infection control once a case is detected. There is neither a vaccine, nor any definitive anti-viral therapy available. Only supportive treatment can be provided to patients. In countries where other hemorrhagic fevers such as Marburg, Ebola and dengue are also reported, differential diagnosis is complicated, particularly if the detailed epidemiological information is unavailable. - Mod.UBA
