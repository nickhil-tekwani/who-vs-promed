Horse farm reopens after viral quarantine
----------------------------------
A horse barn that was placed under quarantine by an area veterinarian to contain a virus has re-opened 2 weeks later, though the quarantine was expected to last anywhere from 3 weeks to a month.

Horses at Seaview Farm, also known in Rockport [MA] as Lane's farm, tested positive for equine coronavirus, a highly contagious disease that can cause gastrointestinal, respiratory and neurological signs.

One horse died of the disease on 13 April 2012, according to the animal's owner, while another horse had died of unknown causes earlier in the week, but seemed to have similar signs.

The owner of the horse who died posted on a website asking other horse owners and veterinarians for their input on the situation.

Kenneth Lane, owner of Seaview Farm, a boarding stable, told the Times on Tuesday that there were no sick horses at his farm and that he had nothing to say about rumors of a quarantine. Subsequent phone calls to the farm Tuesday and Wednesday were not returned.

The veterinarian who cared for the sick horses also did not return phone calls, but in an email to those who board their horses at Seaview farm, she attempted to calm fears while maintaining caution.

"We have confirmed a diagnosis of equine coronavirus as a cause of the high fevers and associated signs. This is an unusual disease, so data is somewhat limited," Kelly Butterworth, the veterinarian, wrote.

Butterworth wrote that, while she hoped the worst of the disease was passed at the end of April, the quarantine could continue beyond that.

According to Krissie Burnham, owner of Sandy Bay Stables in Rockport, she was called by Butterworth and told to stay out of the Seaview Farm barn for a month in order to prevent the disease from spreading to the horses in her barn.

Coronavirus generally strikes cows, dogs and humans, with varyingly severe effects. The only other outbreak of equine coronavirus in the United States took place in California, and the doctor managing that outbreak is helping to manage this one, according to the email from Butterworth.

The source of the outbreak in Rockport is unknown.

"The vets told the barn manager not to send the horse he was selling to a registered quarter horse auction. Thank God he didn't send him, because about 3 days later that horse had a fever," wrote Wendy Prendergast, who owned the horse who died, named Aesop.

Burnham said that, when she heard about the outbreak, she volunteered to do non-barn chores to help the workers at Seaview Farm, but was told her help was not needed.

Burnham said she was surprised when she saw that Seaview Farm had reopened, saying she would expect more caution.

"People in the horse community should know about this," said Burnham.

[Cornavirus is a gastrointestinal disease that affects horses causing ulcers and colic.

Coronaviruses have now been recognized as important pathogens in several captive or wild ruminant species in the United States (Alekseev et al., 2008), including white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), elk (_Cervus elephus_), sambar deer (_Cervus unicolor_) and waterbuck (_Kobus ellipsiprymnus_). In addition, some caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_), musk oxen (_Ovibus moschatus_) and sitatunga (_Tragelaphus spekei_) have been found to be seropositive for coronavirus.

Coronavirus infection can result in clinically mild-to-severe and sometimes bloody diarrhea. Similarly, coronaviruses have also been shown to cause diarrhea in many ruminants, including cattle, horses, deer and antelopes. In cattle, coronavirus infection can also cause respiratory symptoms.

Serological detection of coronaviruses has low sensitivity and is not very specific. However, PCR detection of coronaviruses can provide rapid, specific and sensitive determination of the presence of the virus.

This article provides no indication of how the veterinarian diagnosed this virus vs colic from other causes. While the disease may have been at the farm, searches of government sites from the state reveal no quarantine. Some cached websites indicate the alleged event happened about the 1st of May. If a quarantine was there it has been removed from any official pages.

Authorities with accurate insight and information are encouraged to let us know the truth of the situation.
