Abstract
---------
We describe the 1st genome isolation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Kenya. This fatal zoonotic pathogen was 1st described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 79.50-84.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28%; 95% CI, 71.14-77.19) than male camels (P  <  0.001) (53.74%; 95% CI, 48.48-58.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses. None of the human plasma screened contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. This study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels. Further one-health surveillance approaches in camels, wildlife, and human populations are needed.

[While the above and earlier papers clearly indicate the presence of (clade C2) MERS-CoV in Kenya's camel population, its results underline the absence of human infection. The following data, included in the paper under the subtitle "MERS-CoV seroprevalence in humans in Kenya," complete the picture:

"A total of 486 human plasma samples were collected from 10 counties in Kenya from March 2017 to June 2018, among which 231 (48.63%) subjects were male and 244 (51.37%) were female; gender data for 11 human samples were missing. Among the humans sampled, 95.27% stated that they have had close contact with livestock including camels. In this group, 300 people stated they have regular contact with camels as herdsmen.

"[A total of] 20 of the 486 human plasma samples showed positive results by ELISA. Of these, 8 were from West Pokot, 5 were from Tana River, 4 were from Garissa, 2 were from Wajir, and one was from Isiolo Counties. Of seropositive samples 10 were male and 9 were female; gender data of one ELISA reactive sample were missing. Of the 20 ELISA-positive individuals, 12 were in frequent contact with camels. A micro-neutralization test was performed on all ELISA-reactive samples and none were positive in the neutralization assay."

The absence of human disease in Kenya's human population, particularly related to those in contact with camels, in spite of an apparent wide circulation of the virus in the camel population, is in sharp contrast with the situation in Saudi Arabia. There, contact with camels has been shown to be a main factor in human disease (see Reference 1, as well as Item 3 in 20180818.5972601).

Earlier research indicated that the human and camel virus from the Arabian peninsula belonged to MERS-CoV clade B; on the other hand, all the Kenyan sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, associated with the African clade. - Mod.AS
