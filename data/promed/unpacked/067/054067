A 32-year old female visited to our hospital's OPD [outpatient department, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu] on 8 Dec 2017 to seek advice and treatment after a tick bite. She noticed a tick attached inside her left ear (photo shared with me) on [1 Dec 2017]. She developed itching, severe pain, and swelling in her left ear, enlarged left cervical lymph node, and progressive pain in her left arm but without fever. She had a history of travel to Jhapa district [Province One, eastern Nepal] (on [28 Nov 2017]). Her family physician advised her to visit our hospital for further evaluation and adequate treatment.

The tick photo was submitted to the Tick Encounter Resource Centre (TERC), USA to identify the tick. They think it could be a _Hyalomma_ tick, although a clearer brighter view of picture was requested. The _Hyalomma_ tick is considered to be the primary vector for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), indicating that there is a high probability of CCHF circulating in Nepal. Nevertheless, CCHF has not yet been reported in Nepal. Very recently, for the 1st time, another tick borne illness, Lyme disease was reported in Nepal [1].

[Dr Pun is thanked for sending in this report. He does not indicate that the tick transmitted any pathogen to the woman, so perhaps her pain and swelling at the site of the bite and the enlarged cervical lymph node was an inflammatory reaction to tick saliva (see https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150925131412.htm). Tick saliva has been linked to allergic reactions following the consumption of meat. Tick bites can be serious, leading to paralysis (see http://columbia-lyme.org/patients/tbd_paralysis.html). - Mod.TY
