At least 3 patients in the provinces of Albay and Camarines Norte have died from measles, with almost 200 more suspected cases in the Bicol region, the Department of Health (DOH) said Thu [6 Sep 2018]. Dr. Rita Mae Ang-Bon, the family cluster head of DOH Bicol, said they have recorded 187 suspected cases of measles throughout the region from 1 Jan to 1 Sep this year [2018]. "[The number of cases] is high compared [with] 2017 covering the same period, which only reached up to 54 suspected cases," Bon said.

The DOH has recorded 12 measles cases in Albay, 38 in Camarines Norte, 60 in Camarines Sur, 3 in Catanduanes, 62 in Masbate, and 12 in Sorsogon. Meanwhile, simultaneous school-based measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations were done by the DOH nationwide to protect students from the diseases.

As Moldovan authorities struggle to contain an ongoing outbreak of measles, the head of the country's Orthodox Church has told clergy to offer special prayers for an end to the epidemic. The head of Moldova's Orthodox Church, Vladimir, which is subordinated canonically to Moscow, has urged his priests in an internal memo to help deal with the current epidemic measles through special prayers.

Clergy should "serve in churches and pray for a stop to the measles epidemic and contagious disease," the Metropolitan of Chisinau and All Moldova wrote in an internal memo. "This situation without precedent in the last 10 years has had very serious effects, especially among children," the memo adds, urging priests to pray on their "knees and with hot tears for the help and mercy of God and the healing of diseases for those who suffer."

Europe has confronted a measles epidemic since the beginning of this year [2018], but Moldova has been hard hit by the number of cases and on 25 Aug [2018] declared an "orange" alert. Last week [around 29 Aug 2018], the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection issued a note saying that around 170 cases had been registered in Moldova.

The Ministry of Health says the disease is 6 times more contagious than flu. Vaccination provides 100% protection. However, 2 of 10 children in urban areas in Moldova are not immunized. "The start of the new school year is a risk, and parents are urged to immunize children with the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella," the authorities have said.

They also recommend citizens to protect themselves during their travels, as more than 41 000 cases of measles were recorded in Europe in the 1st half on this year [2018] compared with around 24 000 recorded during 2017.

[It would be good if the churches would also advocate for vaccination of all children. Prayer alone will not prevent infection with measles. The immunization rate is only 80%, not high enough to prevent spread of virus. - Mod.LK

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed Wed [5 Sep 2018] a case of measles in Houston, according to the City's Health Department. The Health Department detailed that a young boy, between the age of 1 and 3 years, contracted the illness. The boy was being treated at Texas Children's Hospital.

This is the 1st case of measles in Houston since 2013. The Health Department has found that, so far, no other persons who could have been exposed are at risk of having contracted the illness.

Houston has averaged fewer than one reported case of measles each year over the past decade. [...]

[4] Texas: Southwest Airlines alert

A Texas resident sick with measles may have exposed passengers on 4 Southwest Airlines flights to the highly contagious virus, officials said. The individual took flights connecting through Houston's Hobby Airport on 21 and 22 Aug 2018, the Houston Health Department announced Thursday [6 Sep 2018].

The passenger was diagnosed with measles after traveling, a Southwest representative told TIME, but health department said the person was contagious at the time of the flights. Southwest Airlines is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to notify passengers on 4 flights of the possible exposure, the airline said [see source URL above for specifics of the flights].

Widespread and effective vaccination has made measles rare in the United States, but 107 cases across 21 states were reported during the first 6 months of this year [2018] alone, in part because of lingering antivaccine sentiment. [...]

[5] North Dakota: follow-up testing NOT measles

CDC: Measles Case Testing In Burleigh County Comes Back Negative
North Dakota Department of Health has determined that the threat of measles for this specific situation to be over.
--------------------------------------
North Dakota does not have its 1st case of measles since 2011 after all. After subsequent testing, the CDC found the individual believed to have measles in Burleigh County actually does not have measles. The North Dakota Department of Health has determined that the threat of measles for this specific situation to be over.

The last case of measles was in Cass County 7 years ago.

On [Thu 6, Sep 2018], the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) was notified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that subsequent testing found the individual with measles in Burleigh County to be negative. Therefore, the NDDoH has determined that the threat of measles for this specific situation to be over. Children and employees who are currently being excluded from school and other activities, may return to school tomorrow, [7 Sep 2018]. Other individuals contacted by the NDDoH about a potential exposure no longer need to watch for symptoms of measles. Initial test results on this individual were positive for measles.

Based on symptoms and travel history, the individual was originally determined to be a case of measles. To protect the health of the public, notifications and prevention activities were initiated by the NDDoH. Per protocol, the NDDoH sends samples to the CDC for additional screening and confirmation. Laboratory tests can sometimes produce false positives; however, this is rare.

"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world," said Molly Howell, immunization program manager for the NDDoH. "We acted quickly and appropriately based on the testing and information that we had on hand at the time to prevent the spread of measles in the community. We appreciate the cooperation of this individual, schools and community members in response to this situation."

Measles cases are occurring in the United States and around the World. All children are recommended to be vaccinated against measles at ages 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years. Measles is included in a combination vaccine with mumps and rubella (known as MMR vaccine). All adults born in 1957 or later should have at least one dose of MMR vaccine. All health care workers should have two doses of MMR vaccine.
