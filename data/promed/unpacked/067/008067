Defra has confirmed the discovery of bluetongue serotype 1 (BTV-1) in
5 imported cattle on a farm near Blackpool, Lancashire [For Defra's
official news release, see item 2].

It is the 1st time BTV-1 has been found in the UK and arrived after
the pedigree cattle were imported from southwest France.

The cattle were immediately culled by Defra vets along with one other
animal from the same consignment, which tested positive for
bluetongue, although the serotype is not yet known.

The discovery will be a major worry to livestock farmers, as there is
currently no [BTV-1] vaccine available for use in the UK.

Defra said there was no evidence of the disease circulating, so no
movement controls or additional restrictions had been put in place.

Chief veterinary officer Nigel Gibbens said: "Taking into account the
epidemiological evidence and the consideration of the risk
represented to British livestock, I have taken the decision to cull
these animals. This incident shows how important it is for farmers to
consider potential disease risks when buying stock. Buyers need to
consider how best to protect their own businesses and those of their
neighbours and make sure they are clear about the stock they are
intending to buy."

Following the discovery, the NFU reiterated calls for farmers to
stand together and suspend imports of cattle and sheep from areas
where bluetongue is circulating.

NFU president Peter Kendall said: "The health and welfare of our
cattle and sheep sectors must be our paramount concern, and this
recent incident is a major concern for all livestock keepers. In
light of the uncertainty and the enormous risk to our industry, it is
only right we do all we can to protect our livestock sector, and, at
the moment, I believe this means that we should suspend imports from
BTV areas. I am sure no farmer wants to import BTV-1 into the
country, and therefore until we are confident the controls on moving
animals from BTV areas as set out in the EU regulations are working
effectively to protect our livestock, we should suspend imports from
these areas."

Defra will now be working to establish how the infected cattle
arrived in England after it emerged they were vaccinated against
BTV-1 in France.

Defra said there was no wrong-doing on the farmer's part, as the
import occurred in line with EU rules, leaving at least 60 days after
they were vaccinated before they were moved.

Defra today [25 Nov 2008] announced the detection of Bluetongue
(Serotype 1) (BTV-1) in 5 imported cattle on a premises near
Blackpool in Lancashire.

The animals originated from within the BTV-1 and 8 Restricted Zone in
the southwest of France and were detected as a result of post-import
testing carried out by Defra on all bluetongue-susceptible animals
arriving from continental Europe. The animals' documentation complied
with the EU bluetongue rules governing the movement of livestock, as
the movement occurred at least 60 days after they had been vaccinated.

This response is in accordance with Defra's Bluetongue Control
Strategy. The premises are now under restriction while an
epidemiological investigation takes place. This will include further
checks on the other animals present on the premises.

Defra continues to test all susceptible animals imported to the UK
from continental Europe for all strains of bluetongue and continues
to urge industry to consider the risks and check the health and
vaccination status of animals when sourcing any animals from within
the UK or abroad.

In line with EU legislation and the UK Control Strategy agreed to
with industry, control measures are in place in the UK and abroad to
prevent the spread of bluetongue from existing zones around Europe:

- Restricted Zones around infected premises where disease is
circulating (such as the BTV-8 Protection Zone in the UK);
- Controls on movements of animals out of these zones to minimise the
risk of disease spread by animal movement;
- Vaccination programmes to protect animals from disease and prevent
its spread (as rolled out for BTV-8 in the UK in 2008);
- Surveillance to detect disease, including post import testing in
the UK to look for disease in imported animals.

Notes to editors
1. On 24 Nov 2008, there were 148 confirmed premises affected by
bluetongue (BTV-8) in England and Wales.

[These animals were tested BTV-1-positive by PCR. ProMED-mail has
been kindly informed by the IAH at Pirbright that they were
attempting to isolate virus from the samples and that circulation
will only be confirmed if there is onward transmission of the virus
to UK animals.

Obviously, similar importations earlier in the season, when
temperatures were higher, could have a less fortunate outcome. -

Farming leaders have called for a suspension of all cattle and sheep
imports from bluetongue virus areas.

It follows the discovery on Tuesday [25 Nov 2008] of 5 imported
cattle infected with the new bluetongue-1 virus (BTV-1) for which
there is no UK vaccine available [see commentary re. vaccines].

Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), called
for a suspension of imports of cattle and sheep from areas where
bluetongue is known to be circulating.

He said: "As an industry, we need to know more about how these
animals, which we understand had been vaccinated for BTV-1 in France,
tested positive for the virus when they arrived in England. I am sure
that no farmer wants to import BTV-1 into the country, and,
therefore, until we are confident that the controls on moving animals
from BTV areas are working effectively to protect our livestock, then
we should suspend imports from these areas."

Peter Morris, chief executive of the National Sheep Association
(NSA), called for a halt to all imports from countries where BTV-1 is
known to be present.

He was concerned BTV-1 had been found in the UK.

"But perhaps more worrying is the fact that the importation appears
to have been perfectly legal and legitimate, as the animals were said
to have been vaccinated against BTV-1 several weeks ago and had met
the requirements, which then allowed them to be legitimately moved
out of the BTV-1 zone," he said.

The NSA has always said farmers take too big a risk when they import
animals from areas where bluetongue is known to be present.

Mr Morris said: "NSA believes that in the absence of vaccine and with
no BTV-1 virus known to be circulating, halting imports into the UK
from bluetongue areas is the only sensible and responsible thing to
do, even if it is not in line with the wishes of the EU Commission or
obeying the current regulation."

[4] The Netherlands, BTV-1 ex France, BTV-6

Agriculture, ref VD. 2008/2408 [trans. by communicator, edited]

Bluetongue situation in the Netherlands as of 25 Nov 2008
---------------------------------------------------------
Situation of BTV-1
------------------
At the beginning of October 2008, older bulls from France were
imported via Belgium to a farm in Ophemert (Gelderland). During a
routine inspection in Belgium, the animals tested PCR-positive for
BTV-1. An outbreak of bluetongue should be declared only if virus
circulation has taken place. Following the discovery of BTV-1,
investigations started. Blood samples of all ruminants on the farm
and in a radius of one km around the holding were taken for
investigation. This investigation revealed that no spread of BTV-1
has occurred. The animal from France, infected with BTV-1, was put
down.

[The above report is in need of clarification. If the French-origin
animals were found positive underway in Belgium, why have they been
allowed to continue their transportation to the Netherlands? What led
the Dutch authorities to cull just a single animal? Was this animal
viraemic, as opposed to the other, reportedly PCR-positive animals? -
Mod.AS]

Situation of BTV-6
------------------
So far, a total of 13 animals on 13 farms have been found to be
infected with BTV serotype 6. The virus seems to be widespread in the
Netherlands. It remains unclear whether the bluetongue virus type 6
is a vaccine virus, a vaccine virus that has regained virulence, or a
field virus. Several studies, such as research into the spread,
research of the properties of the virus, and research into the
genetic profile of the virus, need to be verified. I expect to obtain
the results of these investigations during the course of December
2008.

Agreements have been reached with France and Belgium on the transport
of animals for slaughter from the Dutch containment area to
slaughterhouses in these countries.

The amended rules came into force on Tue 18 Nov 2008 at 4 PM. Animals
for slaughter from the containment area can be transported to
slaughterhouses in France under the terms of the Bluetongue-enactment.

Belgium has indicated that, so far, only 3 slaughterhouses are
designated to receive slaughter calves under the terms of the
Bluetongue-enactment. Belgium doesn't accept sheep for slaughter
because of the poorer traceability of sheep.

State of emergency measure
--------------------------
At this time, I am looking for measures to support companies that
have continuous problems as a direct result of government measures to
control animal diseases and who, under their own power or with the
help of banks, cannot cope, and so government could give them
assistance. I want to apply this measure because of the outbreak of
bluetongue.

[The Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality G. Verburg]

[5] EU Bluetongue vaccination budget, 2009
Date: Wed 29 Oct 2008
Source: EU press release Midday Express [edited]
<http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/vassiliou/speeches/bluetongue.pdf>


The European Commission today [29 Oct 2008] announced its intention
to propose in early 2009 additional funding of approximately 100
million Euros [USD 129 million] in order to co-finance the
administration of vaccines to control bluetongue disease in 2009.

Subject to the assessment of actual needs and absorption capacity,
this commitment, made in an amending letter to the 2009 budget
adopted today [29 Oct 2008], would raise the total amount likely to
be allocated to assist vaccination efforts in 2009 up to 160 million
Euros [USD 206 million]. Prior to today's decision, the commission
had already proposed in the preliminary draft budget 2009 to allocate
60 million Euros [USD 77 million] to co-finance the purchase of
vaccines and surveillance of the insects which carry the disease. The
Commission's total funding during the period 2008-2009 is expected to
exceed EUR 300 million [USD 386 million].

European Commissioner for Health Androulla Vassiliou said:
"Bluetongue has been causing serious concern to farmers and member
state authorities. It now affects large parts of the EU. Extensive
vaccination will contain the disease and reduce its prevalence and
its effects. I am pleased that we have been able to make this
political commitment today. The total funding, which is expected to
exceed 300 million Euros [USD 386 million], indicates the
commission's strong determination to decisively support member state
efforts to combat bluetongue."

The amending letter to the 2009 budget is now being forwarded to the
European Parliament and the Council. The agreement of both
institutions will be necessary in order to release the funds. The
additional funding will assist member states by financing up to 50
percent of the costs incurred by them in administering the bluetongue
vaccine.

[The expressed frustration of the UK farmers, who are requested to
refrain voluntarily from imports which are allowed according to EU
existing regulations, is understandable. Those regulations date back
to the pre-BTV era, when the whole of Europe was regarded BTV-free.
The introduction of BTV-1-infected animals into the Netherlands, UK
(and, apparently, Belgium) is not surprising under such conditions:
it is rather surprising that such cases are limited, reportedly, to
these countries. Subscribers are invited to view the updated (19 Nov
2008) EU map of BTV restriction zones. BTV-8 areas (red, azure and
brown) cover the vast area between Andalusia in south Spain up to
Denmark, southwest Sweden and the entire UK in the north. BTV-1,
which began its spread from north Africa into Spain in July 2007, has
already reached Brittany in northwest France: the introductions of
BTV-1 infected animals into "free" countries has not been recorded on
the map since "circulation of the virus has not been demonstrated"
(UK and Netherlands). The (yellow) BTV-6 area covering the whole of
the Netherlands and adjacent western parts of Germany is a recent
unwelcome addition to the complex situation reflected by not less
than 10 different types of BTV zones on the map; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.

The over-wintering capacity of bluetongue in Europe has been clearly
demonstrated during 2 winters; an enhanced vaccination effort is
required before the next bluetongue season, which is expected to
commence in the early summer of 2009. While Spain will continue its
trivalent vaccination (BTV-1,4,8), other west and north European
countries will have to apply, most probably, a bivalent vaccination
(BTV-1,8). If BTV-6 is confirmed to be spreading, its addition may
have to be considered.

On 21 Nov 2007, the EU Health & Consumer Protection DG held a meeting
in Brussels with 8 vaccine producers, addressing the availability of
vaccines against bluetongue. According to the report (EU document
D1/MCG/mb(07)D/412950), inactivated vaccines against BTV serotypes 1,
2, 4, and 8 should be currently available. A table with their
respective producers is available in the report; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/Short%20report%20%20BT%20vaccine%20producers%2021-11-07.pdf>.
