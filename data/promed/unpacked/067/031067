Rapid risk assessment on recent influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[References omitted; available at the source URL]

Understanding of the virus:

1. Human infections with influenza A(H5N1) 2.3.4.4b viruses
Since the beginning of 2020, detections in humans of influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have been reported to WHO from the following countries [additional cases may have been reported but for which the A(H5) clade was determined not to be 2.3.4.4b or where clade information is unavailable. - Mod.AS].

China (one case), Spain (2 cases), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (one case), the United States of America (USA) (one case), and Viet Nam (one case). All 4 human cases reported in Europe and North America were asymptomatic or mild, with only fatigue reported for the case detected in the USA. The case detected in China resulted in a fatality while the case in Viet Nam had severe symptoms but recovered. All human cases had exposure to infected poultry either through participation in response activities to poultry outbreaks or direct exposure to infected poultry in backyard holdings or live bird markets.

Virus sequences from these human cases, where available, did not show markers for mammalian adaptation nor for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (such as oseltamivir) or endonuclease inhibitors (such as baloxavir).

Based on the available information for A(H5), although based on limited seroprevalence information available on other A(H5) virus subtypes and clades, human population immunity against the A(H5) clade 2.3.4.4b virus haemagglutinin is expected to be minimal.

2. Infections in animals
Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, especially those in clade 2.3.4.4b, continue to diversify genetically and spread geographically. From 2021 to 2022, Europe and North America have observed their largest and most extended epidemic of avian influenza with unusual persistence of the virus in wild bird populations. A broader range of wild bird species continue to be infected globally, which has significant ecological consequences and has caused mass die-offs in some species. Additionally, continuous infection in wild and migratory birds has led to multiple separate incursions in domestic species. These circumstances have led to increased opportunities to generate multiple genotypes with varied clinical signs. Some of the recent viruses have caused severe infections with neurological signs in mammals [https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2711.211281].

There have been limited reports of transmission between mammals despite the increase in mammalian infections.

Affected mammals include badger, black bear, bobcat, coyote, dolphin, ferret, fisher cat, fox, lynx, mink (mink-to-mink in Spanish farm), opossum, otter, pig, polecat, porpoise, raccoon, raccoon dogs, seal (seal-to-seal in USA), and skunk.

Regular monitoring and screening of viral sequences found few sequences with markers of mammalian adaptation. These mutations likely occurred after transmission to the mammalian host and do not seem to transmit onwards.

Continuous monitoring is warranted to understand if these changes continue to occur or accumulate over time.

Available A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus sequences from avian and mammalian hosts indicate that markers associated with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase or endonuclease inhibitors are rare.

From published animal transmission studies, transmission between ferrets did not occur; however, some genotypes resulted in severe disease in infected ferrets.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza is raging on farms and facilities across the country this season. Since the end of October [2022], both the number of cases and the number of slaughtered cases have increased at a record high, and it was also confirmed for the 1st time in 5 prefectures where there had been no cases of infection at poultry farms. The national government has begun emergency disinfection on a nationwide scale, but local governments responsible for slaughtering large numbers of chickens are screaming that they are "beyond the scope of what they can handle," and concerns are spreading among poultry farmers.

"[The culling] is out of the hands of local governments alone. I would like to ask you to consider revising the way of thinking so far." On the 21st of this month, Governor Kazuhiko Oigawa of Ibaraki Prefecture, which boasts the highest egg production in Japan, appealed to Minister of Agriculture Nomura at the minister's office of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Kasumigaseki, Tokyo.

In Ibaraki Prefecture, on 4 Nov 2022, an outbreak of bird flu occurred at a poultry farm in Kasumigaura City. It took 19 days to kill, bury, incinerate, and disinfect 1.03 million egg-laying hens. The mobilization of prefectural officials (5350 in total), including those from departments unrelated to livestock farming, and the Self-Defense Forces (1100 in total) dispatched to disaster areas were not enough. also recruited [?].

Governor Oigawa has told Minister of Agriculture Nomura to oblige large-scale farms to secure workers in advance and prepare lime for disinfection and protective clothing at their own expense, in consideration of poultry farms with more than 500 000 chickens. He requested that these should be included in the national guidelines.

At the press conference after the cabinet meeting on the 27th [Dec 2022], Agriculture Minister Nomura said, "Now is the real time, so we must respond with a sense of urgency."

This season, at farms and facilities in Japan, infections were confirmed for the 1st time in Okayama Prefecture and Hokkaido on 28 Oct [2022]. On 30 Dec [2022], new infections were found in Saitama and Hiroshima prefectures, bringing the total number of cases in 22 prefectures to 51 as of the same day. Of these, 5 prefectures -- Yamagata, Fukushima, Tottori, Nagasaki, and Okinawa -- are the 1st cases to be reported. A total of 7.72 million birds nationwide are subject to culling. Both the number of outbreaks (52 cases in 18 prefectures) and culling (9.87 million birds) are likely to surpass the record highs between November 2020 and March 2021.

In Aomori Prefecture, 1.39 million egg-laying hens raised at a poultry farm in Misawa City were culled over the course of 2 weeks from the 15th of this month [December 2022]. This is the highest number ever for a single location. Ken Sasaki, chairman of the prefectural poultry farming association in Hachinohe, said, "We don't know when and where it will occur, so we have to rely on God in the end."

Bird flu spreads when migratory birds carrying the virus migrate south from their nesting grounds in Siberia, Russia, to overwinter. Wild birds are infected with the virus and introduce it into poultry farms. Therefore, in Japan, the season for outbreaks is from late autumn to spring. However, in Europe outbreaks continued throughout the summer [of 2022], albeit infrequently, and the 'off-season' has disappeared. French farms have confirmed 1487 infections in just over a year since October last year [2021].

Hiroki Takakuwa, professor of veterinary microbiology at Kyoto Sangyo University, said, "This season, infected wild birds were found as early as late September in Japan. Migratory birds spread the virus to various parts of the country much earlier than usual."

This autumn, Kyoto Prefecture drained water from 65 reservoirs and installed nets to prevent wild birds from approaching. There is an analysis by the Agriculture and Food Research Organization (Ibaraki Prefecture) that there is a high risk of infection at poultry farms within about 100 m [328 ft] of ponds and watersides such as rivers.

According to JA Zennoh Egg (Tokyo), the wholesale price of chicken eggs has been above average since this spring due to the impact of soaring mixed feed prices due to the invasion of Ukraine. This month's [December 2022's] average was 284 yen [USD 2.15] per kg [2.2 lb] for M size (Tokyo area), the highest monthly average since 1993, when wholesale prices were published. In addition to the peak demand for Christmas and New Year holidays, "the bird flu definitely pushed up prices," industry insiders said.

The price rise is expected to come to a halt after the New Year, when demand will settle down, but an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said, "It is necessary to carefully monitor trends, considering the infection situation."

According to Zen-Noh Egg, the expiration date printed on egg packs is "the period during which the eggs can be eaten raw." If you keep it in the refrigerator, you can heat it up and eat it for a few days even after the expiration date. It is said that quality deterioration is less likely to progress if the sharp side of the shell is placed downward.

Outbreaks of avian influenza were found at farms in Be'er Tuvia, southern Israel [25 000 broiler breeding stock], and Magal, central Israel [20 000 turkeys], the Agriculture Ministry announced on Tue [3 Jan 2023].

About 25 000 turkeys are housed in Magal and about 25 000 chickens in the Be'er Tuvia farm. All were infected with the H5N1 strain of the virus.

All coops within 10 km [6.2 mi] of the outbreaks were placed on lockdown.

The Agriculture Ministry advised anyone who owns birds or poultry to keep the birds kept inside buildings and to prevent them from going outside in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

The Agriculture Ministry stressed that it is still safe to purchase poultry and eggs. They should be cooked to completion before consumption.

The outbreaks are the 5th and 6th detected in Israel this season.

Late December 2022, Israeli officials reported to the World Organization for Animal Health that a Dunlin bird, found dead [in central Israel], was infected with the same H5N1 strain of the virus identified in another wild bird at the Hula Lake in northern Israel [on 29] Nov 2022.

The 1st outbreak of the season, in November 2022, was reported at a turkey slaughterhouse, in animals transported from Kibbutz Shluhot in northern Israel.

[During the winter 2021/2022], a large outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza swept through Israel. For the 1st time, the virus caused mass mortality among wild birds, killing some 8000 cranes in the Hula Lake area [north-east Israel] and leading to the death and culling of about a million farmed poultry, in 20 hotspots across the country.

The new cases in Israel come amid an ongoing outbreak in North America and Europe that started in 2021 and has been described as "the largest-ever" outbreak on both continents.

[According to a report issued by the State Veterinary Services on 29 Dec 2022, the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic started (date of diagnosis) on 21 Nov 2022 on a turkey fattening farm; until 28 Dec 2022, 6 additional outbreaks have been identified and culled: 4 turkey fattening farms (49 500 culled) and 2 broiler farms (198 000 culled). The said and additional information, including maps presenting the outbreaks' locations and the sites where 2 infected wild birds have been found, are available at https://bit.ly/3Qk0Zdk (in Hebrew).

The new event on a broiler breeding farm is cause for additional concern. Such farms maintain a most severe biosecurity regime, expected to provide protection. - Mod.AS

Following a fresh outbreak of the deadly bird flu virus at a farm in west Denmark, 50 000 chickens will have to be culled, the country's Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries said in a press release on Monday [2 Jan 2023].

"The flock is infected with the deadly and highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus. As a result, we will cull the entire herd of 50 000 chickens in the coming days, both to alleviate the birds' suffering and to prevent the spread of infection," Lotte Brink, head of section at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA), said.

The presence of the virus was first observed on New Year's Eve, when several dead chickens were found at a farm near the town of Orum in Hedensted Municipality, about 177 km [110 mi] west of Denmark's capital Copenhagen.

All the infected chickens are expected to be killed and removed by the DVFA and the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), followed by a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the entire farm.

On Monday [2 Jan 2023], the DVFA also started to put in place a 10 km [6.2 mi] restricted zone around the farm, making it illegal to remove eggs or poultry without a permit.

According to the DVFA, the restrictions, which will affect more than 450 000 birds in the wider area, will be lifted, at the earliest, 30 days after the last infected birds are culled and the property is disinfected.

This is the 4th and largest bird flu outbreak to occur in Denmark since October [2022], according to the ministry.

Czech authorities are preparing to destroy up to 220 000 hens on a poultry farm in the west of the country after bird flu was discovered there last week, in the biggest outbreak to date.

Bird flu was reported last Friday [30 Dec 2022] at the farm located 150 km (90 miles) west from Prague, which can house up to 750 000 chickens, after an increase of deaths in one of 3 halls there.

The Czech Republic's State Veterinary Administration (SVS) said on Tuesday [3 Jan 2023] that since checks revealed the infection only in one of the halls, the majority of the flock could be spared.

"The whole (population of the) hall will have to be culled," said Petr Majer, SVS spokesman.

Avian influenza has been detected again in a turkey farm in the Cloppenburg district. The virus with the pathogen H5N1 was confirmed by the responsible Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), as the district announced on Sunday [1 Jan 2023].

The stock of 14 500 turkeys will be killed on Sunday [1 Jan 2023] in an animal-friendly manner. The area around the epidemic in the municipality of Garrel with a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] will be defined as the protection zone, it said.

Avian influenza is an infectious disease that mainly affects waterfowl and other birds.

The epidemic is particularly rampant in the winter months from the end of October to April and is therefore closely related to bird migration. In the past few weeks, there have already been several outbreaks in companies in Lower Saxony.

South Korea has confirmed a new case of avian influenza at a duck farm in a southern region, local officials said Sunday [1 Jan 2023].

The highly pathogenic avian influenza strain of H5N1 was found at the farm located in Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, according to the officials.

The new case brought the total bird flu infections confirmed in the province this winter to 4.

About 15 000 ducks have been culled at the farm and those located nearby. Local authorities have enforced restrictions on vehicles moving in and out of the affected area for 24 hours as part of preventive measures.

[According to WOAH's most recent periodic update of avian influenza, covering the period 11 Nov - 1 Dec 2022, the current HPAI epidemic season continues in an increasing rate, mainly in Europe and also in the Americas and Asia. Many of the countries in these regions are experiencing a larger number of outbreaks compared to last year's [2022's] wave at the same time. Outbreaks are also spreading further to South America countries. The predominant subtype noticed in the current epidemic season is still subtype H5N1. "Based on the HPAI seasonal pattern, the number of outbreaks in animals is expected to raise in the coming months." This forecast, published early December 2022, seems to have been, unfortunately, accurate, as apparent from the above reports, in particular, the Japanese one.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) recommended that countries maintain their surveillance efforts and biosecurity measures at farm level and continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species. High-quality information is key to support early detection and rapid response to potential threats to both animal and public health. - Mod.AS]
