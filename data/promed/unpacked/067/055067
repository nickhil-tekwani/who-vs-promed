A massive plague epidemic could hit eastern Congo DR after an alarming
spike in infections in recent weeks, a German medical charity warned on
Thu, 24 Aug 2006.
There have been 1400 cases so far in 2006, 600 of them in June and July,
said Alfred Kinzelbach, regional coordinator for aid agency Malteser
International. That compares with 800 cases for the whole of 2005.
Health workers are particularly concerned about a sudden increase in
extremely contagious pneumonic plague. Most of the cases are bubonic
plague, which is spread by infected rat fleas, but pneumonic plague, an
airborne disease, can transmit between humans.
"If you have 2 cases of pneumonic plague then perhaps the whole village
will get it, so it spreads much quicker than the bubonic plague,"
Kinzelbach told AlertNet in an interview. "People can die within 24 hours
so you have to treat it quickly."
Around 10 percent of people who catch the plague are dying -- double the
rate in 2005, he said.
The outbreak is near Lake Albert in northeast Ituri district, where
militias are still fighting 3 years after the end of Congo's 6-year war,
the world's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

[This area has had a problem with plague, bubonic and pneumonic, for a
number of years. As noted, it is the pneumonic form that fans an epidemic
since it relatively easily spreads from person (or animal) to person,
whereas the bubonic form itself does not. Plague pneumonia occurs in a
secondary form related to bacteremic spread for the bubonic form or in its
primary form due to person-to-person spread.
The first signs of pneumonic plague are fever, headache, weakness, and
rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough,
and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The pneumonia progresses for 2 to 4
days and may cause respiratory failure and shock. Without early treatment,
patients may die. To reduce the chance of death, antibiotics must be given
within 24 hours of first symptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the
tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic
plague. Antibiotic treatment for 7 days will protect people who have had
direct, close contact with infected patients. Wearing a close-fitting
surgical mask also protects against infection.
