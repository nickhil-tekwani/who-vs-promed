[1] Congo DR: Nurse's death confirmed

The 1st death of a new Ebola outbreak has been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization said it was preparing for the "worst case scenario."

The Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola outbreak has killed a nurse, according to the Health Ministry.

The nurse died overnight at a hospital in nearby Ikoko Impenge, where 4 new suspected cases of Ebola have been reported, Health Minister Oly Ilunga said at a news conference. Seven people with a hemorrhagic fever, including 2 confirmed cases of Ebola, lay in hospital late [Thu 10 May 2018], he added.

The patients could have links to a police officer in Bikoro who died after exhibiting symptoms of hemorrhagic fever in December [2017], National Institute of Biological and Bacterial Research director Jean Jacques Muyembe said. The officer's mother and 10 others then showed similar symptoms. Muyembe said officials would likely contain the outbreak.

A total of 17 people have died from hemorrhagic fever in recent weeks, Ilunga said, and doctors are treating 3 more nurses for the symptoms. Officials must test 9 patients for Ebola, just one virus responsible for such symptoms. Doctors have traveled to Bikoro to trace contacts, identify the epicenter and all affected villages, and provide resources.

The World Health Organization said on [Fri 11 May 2018] it was preparing for the worst case scenario in the latest Ebola outbreak, including for the disease spreading to a major town.

WHO Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response Peter Salama told a regular UN briefing in Geneva that the health agency had alerted the 9 neighboring countries but currently regarded the risk of regional spread as "moderate."

[It is particularly sad when health care workers are infected and even more when they die from nosocomial infection. They should be equipped with personal protection in countries where virulent diseases like Ebola always present a threat. It is hoped they will be among the 1st to be vaccinated with the V920 vaccine.] - Mod.LK

A passenger travelling from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) en-route to Kenya has been isolated at Uganda's Entebbe International Airport, as Ebola tests are carried out.

Sarah Opendi, Uganda's minister of state in charge of general duties, told Xinhua by telephone on [Sat 12 May 2018] that although the male passenger has not developed other Ebola signs, he has got a fever and high temperature.

"He is now in an isolation ward at Entebbe hospital. Blood samples have been taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute," Opendi said. She said available information shows that the passenger lost his wife 3 weeks ago, although the cause of death is not yet known. Opendi said medical officers at the airport are screening all passengers coming into the country especially those from neighboring DRC. ...-more

[Because of the nonspecific symptoms of Ebola virus disease, particularly early in the course of the disease, it often can be confused with other more common infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningococcemia, and other bacterial infections (for example, pneumonia). Gastrointestinal symptoms may develop after about 5 days leading to severe watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/preparing/clinicians.html)

It is of concern that the wife of this patient died recently. If her death was due to Ebola virus disease, one wonders whether the virus has been circulating for some time without recognition of potential cases. It often takes a cluster of cases for a disease to become noticed.] - Mod.LK

WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is on his way to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to assess the needs of the response 1st-hand. We are preparing for all scenarios," the UN health agency said in a statement.

The outbreak in the region northeast of Kinshasa near the border with the Republic of Congo has so far killed 18 people around the town of Bikoro in Equateur province, according to the WHO.

A report from the provincial council of ministers, seen by AFP, said there were "3 suspected cases" in the region's capital Mbandaka, which has 700 000 inhabitants....-more

WHO's head of emergency response Peter Salama said [Fri 11 May 2018]..."We are about to go to Bikoro after this stop at (regional capital) Mbandaka where we began the deployment of mobile labs to start analyses" of suspect cases," Eugene Kabambi, leading the WHO communications team in DR Congo, told AFP [Sat 12 May 2018], adding his team hoped to obtain results swiftly.

[Rapid testing is critical in control efforts, allowing contacts to be quickly identified, and with deployment of the vaccine, they can be vaccinated, and carefully followed for signs of disease.

According to STAT News [Sun 13 May 2018, https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/13/ebola-vaccination-program-could-begin-this-week-in-the-drc/], "the WHO director general and Dr. Peter Salama, his deputy-director general for emergency preparedness and response, flew to the DRC on [Fri 11 May 2018] for meetings with government officials. On [Sun 13 May 2018], they traveled to Bikoro, the epicenter of the outbreak, to view operations and meet with response teams and local leaders.

Tedros said multiple response partners are already on the ground at Bikoro, including Doctors Without Borders, which takes the lead on treating people with Ebola, and the International Federation of the Red Cross, which takes the lead on safe burial practices."] - Mod.LK

[4] West Nile: border alert

Health officials in West Nile have issued an alert following the outbreak of Ebola outbreak in neighboring DR Congo that has killed 17 people.

The officials said there should be screening of those crossing from DR Congo to Uganda [See ProMED Ebola update (04): Nigeria, Kenya, Congo DR (ET), WHO 20180510.5791247 for screening in Nigeria and Kenya] but the porous borders with numerous illegal entry points pose a danger to the local communities.

The Acting Hospital Director Arua Regional Referral Hospital, Dr Alex Adaku, said an infection, prevention and emergency response committee has been formed to handle any emergency cases.

"It is true we are worried because a case of Ebola is not simple to manage and we need to intensify community surveillance and we are already on continuous professional education so that the staff are aware of such emerging threats," Dr Adaku said.

On [Thu 26 Apr 2018], samples from a patient who died at Arua Regional Referral Hospital after presenting signs related to the Hemorrhagic Ebola fever was declared negative by the Uganda Virus Research Institute.

The death of the 10-year-old boy, a Congolese had created anxiety in the health officials and the patients in the hospital.

Congolese mainly depend on goods and services like health, trade in Uganda and with the Pilgrimage to Namugongo, creates a fertile ground for spreading infections if the immigration relaxes on screening at the designated border points like Vurra, Odramacaku in Arua, Goli in Nebbi, Kolokoto in Panyimur in Pakwach and Padea in Zombo districts.

[While control of borders is theoretically a strong preventative measure, it is nearly impossible in most countries. Borders that are man-made are by nature porous since they are not natural. Furthermore, Bikoro's link to major waterways connects it to a number of large cities. To the north there is Bangui (population 800 000), the capital of the Central African Republic. To the south is the DRC capital, Kinshasa (population 11.5 million), as well as Brazzaville (population 1.9 million), the capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo. The WHO has put 9 neighboring countries on high alert.

See above regarding non-specific symptoms, making symptomatic diagnosis difficult until late in the disease process. This highlights the need for a rapid point of care assay.] - Mod.LK

[5] V920 [rVSV ZEBOV] vaccine deployment
Date: Sun 13 May 2018
Source: STAT [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/13/ebola-vaccination-program-could-begin-this-week-in-the-drc/


A campaign to vaccinate people at risk of developing Ebola in the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could begin by the end of this week, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said [Sun 13 May 2018].

Tedros said the government of the DRC has formally asked to use an experimental vaccine being developed by Merck [rVSV]. The WHO has a stockpile of 4300 doses of the vaccine in Geneva; Merck has given its permission for the vaccine to be used in this outbreak.

"Everything is ready for the vaccine. They want it," Tedros told STAT in an interview from Kinshasa.

The equipment needed to keep the vaccine at sub-zero temperatures -- the so-called cold chain -- was arriving in the DRC on [Sun 13 May 2018] today, and would be set up in the next couple of days, he said. By [Wed 16 May 2018] or [Thu 17 May 2018], the vaccines in Geneva will be sent to the DRC, said Tedros, who goes by his 1st name.

After that, vaccination of health care workers and people who have been in contact with those who have contracted Ebola will begin. "That's our plan. And so far, things are going as planned," he said.

The WHO said on [Sat 12 May 2018] that the case estimate is up to 39 -- 2 confirmed, 20 probable cases, and 17 suspected cases. At least 18 people have died. Three health care workers are believed to have been infected, one of whom has died.

The plan is to employ a ring vaccination approach, vaccinating anyone who has been in contact with a case to prevent continuing spread of the virus. Contact tracing efforts are already underway. To date, 382 contacts have been identified, Tedros said...

Tedros said the DRC government has provided all the needed documentation to trigger use of the Merck vaccine, including an import permit.

As the vaccine -- provisionally called V920 -- is not yet licensed, the government had to agree to deploy it under a compassionate use protocol. At this stage, it can also only be used in the context of a clinical trial -- plans for which are already in the works.

[The Merck vaccine won a speedy review by regulators. See https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/07/25/merck-ebola-vaccines/, 2016: The US Food and Drug Administration granted what is known as a breakthrough therapy designation for the Merck vaccine, a status reserved for medicines designed to treat a serious or life-threatening illness. At the same time, the European Medicines Agency granted the vaccine Prime status, which refers to a treatment targeting an unmet medical need.

A total of 3 major studies were led by public health officials in different African countries. The World Health Organization led one study in Guinea, while the US National Institutes of Health led another in Sierra Leone and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headed yet another study in Liberia.

The Merck vaccine, referred to as both rVSV ZEBOV and V920, demonstrated the ability to cut the risk of infection in people.

It is hoped the vaccine will be effective in staunching the spread of Ebola virus in this current outbreak.] - Mod.LK
