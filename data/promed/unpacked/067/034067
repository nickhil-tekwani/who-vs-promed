[According to the latest OIE Annual Report from Kazakhstan (2017), Newcastle disease was reported as absent since June 2013.

"Newcastle disease is a viral disease of birds caused by avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1). For official control purposes, this disease is currently defined as the most severe form of the illness, which is caused only by certain viral strains. Many less virulent strains of APMV-1 also circulate among domesticated and wild birds. These viruses usually cause much milder clinical signs or infect birds asymptomatically. However, they can sometimes evolve to become the highly virulent strains that cause Newcastle disease.

"Velogenic APMV-1 viruses are endemic among poultry in much of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and some countries in Central and South America. Virulent strains are maintained in wild cormorants in the US and Canada, but commercial poultry are free of velogenic isolates. Lentogenic isolates occur in poultry and wild birds throughout the world." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/newcastle_disease.pdf. - Mod.CRD
