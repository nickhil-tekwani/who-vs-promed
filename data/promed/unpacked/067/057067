Rabies Case in Merhavya
-----------------------
The Health Ministry announced on Monday [27 Dec 2010] that a stray
black Labrador retriever that went astray in the community of
Merhavya, near Afula, last Thursday [23 Dec 2010] was found to be
infected with rabies.

The Ministry says that anyone who came in contact with the animal in
the area or has animals that might have come in contact with it and
were bitten, to urgently contact the Afula health office, their
nearest health office, or nearest hospital emergency room.

[A detailed description of the above case ("Rabies Event No. 52 during
2010") was included in the circular (in Hebrew) distributed on 27 Dec
2010 by Israel's Field Veterinary Services. Such circulars follow each
rabies case in Israel (see also item [2], below). The following is the
circular's summarised translation:

"The current case involved the 22nd dog found rabid during 2010, which
was a 2nd case in the village "Moshav Merhavya", Jezreel Valley during
this year. The previous case there involved, similarly, an adult stray
dog, found on 21 Sep 2010 (case No 36).

The current dog entered the village and stayed in the farm's yard,
near the dairy cattle shed. It did not show clear nervous signs but
"looked unwell" (some lameness, reddened, swollen eyes, could not
swallow nor drink) hence arousing the suspicion and compassion of the
farmer who summoned the sanitarian of the Jezreel Valley Regional
Council. No bitings were recorded. The dog was captured and introduced
into the regional rabies quarantine/observation kennels. About 48
hours later, the dog was euthanised by the regional veterinarian in
view of its deteriorating condition, and sent to the Kimron Veterinary
Institute, Beit-Dagan, for testing. Rabies diagnosis was established
by immunofluorescence. - Mod.AS]

Rabies event No 53, 2010
------------------------
This event relates to the 23rd rabid dog and the 53rd rabies event
since the beginning of 2010. It took place in the village Dovev, Upper
Galilee, about 7 km north of Mount Meron, adjacent to the Lebanese
border [map at <http://healthmap.org/r/0kVp>.].

The event involved a 2- to 3-year unvaccinated mongrel watchdog on a
tie-out cable alongside a sheep pen.

According to the preliminary inquiry, during the night of 24 Dec 2010
the owner heard the dog howling. He went out, equipped with a club,
and when approaching the dog was bitten on his leg. "Overreacting" he
beat the dog on his head with the club; the dog was severely wounded
and died the next day, 25 Dec 2010, in spite of attempts to treat him.
Fortunately, when hearing about the incident 2 days later, the
regional municipality's veterinarian decided to send the dog's head to
the KVI for testing, where rabies was confirmed by immunofluorescence.

An investigation has been launched by the District Veterinary Officer
to clarify epidemiological and legal aspects of the event [according
to Israeli legislation, this dog should have been vaccinated at least
twice before the above age. - Mod.AS]

[During 2010, 53 lab-confirmed rabies cases in animals were reported
in Israel. This included 23 dogs, 3 cats, 9 cattle, 2 sheep, 2 goats,
12 jackals, 1 wolf and 1 fox. An additional case in a wolf was
reported in the West Bank.

The total figure for 2009 was 58, of which 32 dogs and 10 jackals.
During earlier years, the figures were significantly lower.

The epidemiology of rabies has undergone a striking change since 2009,
namely a significant increase in dog-mediated rabies in north-east
Israel. The implementation of fox-targeted oral vaccination programme
(ORV), starting during the late 1990's, has almost eliminated
fox-mediated rabies, which had been predominant for decades. The
recent deterioration, affecting NE Israel where stray dogs and jackals
have become the predominant rabies vectors, can be explained by the
results of investigations carried out by the KVI during 2004-2007.

Rabies virus isolates from foxes and dogs were found to differ in
their molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate
lineages (see reference below). The transition from fox-mediated to
dog-mediated rabies, combined with the high prevalence of canine
rabies (also called "urban rabies") in Syria and Jordan and with
lamentably interrupted control upon the stray dog population in
Israel, is of great concern to public health because of the close
contact between dogs and the human population. Jackals, unlike foxes,
seem to be susceptible to the same virus lineage as dogs.

Syria, Jordan, and other countries in the Middle East, are long known
to be infected by dog-mediated rabies, and do not apply oral
vaccination.

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region
lacking efficient control systems is liable to difficulties. This was
predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating the vital need for
coordinated regional effort.
