Guangxi taking steps to ward off bird flu
-----------------------------------------
South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is taking measures to ward
off bird flu, as the epidemic expands to the border between China and Viet
Nam, the Ministry of Agriculture said. Bilateral trade along the 1020 km
border between Guangxi and Viet Nam has grown in recent years.
Half of Viet Nam's provinces and cities have reported bird flu cases during
the past month [February 2005], and more than 1.2 million poultry have been
slaughtered, according to the ministry. 12 of the 18 people in Viet Nam
confirmed to have been infected with the disease have died.
Although there have been no reported outbreaks in Guangxi, the regional
government has spared no effort to prevent them, the report quoted
provincial animal epidemic official Ren Biqiang as saying. The autonomous
region suspended poultry imports from Viet Nam on 6 Jan 2005 and has closed
the market for poultry trade in the border area, said the report.
Strict quarantine and disinfection measures for people, vehicles and
materials crossing the border are being carried out. Meanwhile, at the 3
day Second FAO/OIE Regional Meeting on Avian Influenza Control, held in Ho
Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, experts concluded that the H5N1 bird flu virus
will not be eliminated in the near future, and the risk of human infection
will continue, according to Xinhua News Agency.
The meeting was organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization [FAO] and the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] in
collaboration with the World Health Organization [WHO] and the Vietnamese
Government. At the closed-door meeting, which concluded on Friday [25 Feb
2005], the experts warned that the "risk of the virus acquiring
characteristics for effective human to human transmission and further
global spread is likely to increase." Therefore, they said, it is essential
to control the disease at the source to prevent the occurrence of H5N1
infections in humans.
The Li Ka Shing Foundation of Hong Kong announced on Friday [25 Feb 2005]
in Hong Kong that it would donate EUR 3 million (USD 3.96 million) to
support the fight against avian flu.

FAO/OIE 2nd regional meeting on avian influenza control in animals in Asia:
conclusions
-----------------------------------------------
The 3 day meeting was organized by the FAO and the OIE in collaboration
with the WHO and the Vietnamese government. Over 140 delegates from 28
countries and regions as well as international organizations attended the
meeting. The delegates have reached a number of conclusions on the spread
of the disease:
- prevention and controlling of the percent [? - Mod.SH] avian influenza
are now at a critical time and further joint efforts are needed in the battle.
- progress has been made in the early detection of and rapid response to
the disease a year after the avian influenza crisis.
- the virus is still circulating among poultry, ducks and wildlife in Asia
and continues to pose a serious threat to human health and animals.
- waterfowl: they agreed that one of the new features of current waves of
avian influenza in several Asian countries compared with previous ones is
the role of ducks, which are a reservoir of infection.
- live poultry markets: The breeding of poultry and other animals on the
same small plot of land, the long-time existence of live fowl markets and
the poor biosecurity in poultry production and slaughter are also
contributing to the disease's spread.
- management: the link between farming systems and the spread of the virus,
especially the proximity between farmed chickens and ducks in many backyard
households as well as the movement and marketing of live animals, also
contribute to the spread of the disease.
- transmission: several strategies recommended by the meeting to minimize
the risk of virus transmission between species, and to therefore protect
humans, include segregation in farm settings of chickens, ducks, and other
animals, such as pigs, and a reduction in contact between these animals and
humans.
- vaccination: with the success of vaccination in preventing and
controlling the disease in the past year in several countries and regions,
the meeting agreed that vaccines can be a strong weapon in the fight
against the disease in poultry, and the possibility of vaccinating ducks
should be explored. But further study is needed on the conditions in which
vaccines can be delivered with minimum risk to human health.
- financial support: realizing that the battle against bird flu needs joint
efforts among the world community, the meeting called for international
cooperation and financial support to urgently strengthen animal health
services and laboratories to improve virus detection and its ultimate
eradication.
- international organizations: the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) agreed to further coordinate their
activities and programs in leading the world to fight against the disease.
