The National Institute of Public Health has investigated a national outbreak with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis infection. So far, 13 confirmed cases of infection have been found over 3 years (2019-2021), and the last time in a sample taken in September 2021. The samples are completely genome-sequenced and show the same genotype. The same genotype of _S._ Enteritidis has also been found in a sample from a snake that the Veterinary Institute has analyzed.

Those who have snakes, or other reptiles as a hobby or pet, should take extra precautions and always wash their hands after handling and feeding the animals to avoid getting sick with salmonellosis. The National Institute of Public Health has so far interviewed 12 of the 13 people who were infected with _Salmonella_, and 8 of these have had either direct or indirect contact with snakes, while 4 of them have not had contact with snakes or reptiles. Epidemiological investigations and whole genome sequencing have confirmed the connection between the _Salmonella_ outbreak in humans and contact with reptiles, says senior adviser Heidi Lange at the National Institute of Public Health.

The outbreak in Norway is caused by the same _S._ Enteritidis bacterium found in an outbreak from the UK linked to _Salmonella_-infected mice and rats used as feed for reptiles. The outbreak in the UK stretches from several years back in time to the present day and includes close to 850 people, most of whom kept reptiles as pets: The outbreak in the UK emphasizes that one should also pay attention to the fact that the feed for reptiles (for example, rodents such as frozen mice) can be contagious.

In Norway, [the National Institute of Public Health] and Norwegian Food Safety Authority are further investigating which feed reptile owners have used and which supplier the feed comes from. Freezing does not kill _Salmonella_, so handling raw or frozen and thawed pet foods, such as mice or rats, will pose a risk of salmonellosis if the animals are already carriers of _Salmonella_. Companies that sell feed in Norway are responsible for ensuring safe feed, and there is a requirement for the absence of _Salmonella_ in the feed.

[This outbreak is related to serotype Enteritidis, thought to be transmitted to the reptiles from feeder rodents. ProMED has previously reported cases of _S._ Typhimurium in the USA and Canada linked to feeder rodents. Previously, an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections associated with exposure to rodents sold as food for pet reptiles and amphibians (that is, feeder rodents) was reported in MMWR from the USA in 2012 (see ProMED archive no. 20120419.1107037). This outbreak strain also was implicated in a 2009 outbreak in the UK and a 2010 outbreak in the USA, both linked to frozen feeder rodents from a single USA supplier, resulting in recalls.

Independent of feeder rodents, snakes and other reptiles can carry salmonellae. - Mod.LL
