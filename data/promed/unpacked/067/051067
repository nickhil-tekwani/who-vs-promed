[1] Pfizer vaccine safe and effective in children
Date: Mon 20 Sep 2021

A lower dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine -- one-3rd the amount given to adults and teens -- is safe and triggered a robust immune response in children as young as 5 years old, the drug companies announced in a news release Monday morning.

The finding, eagerly anticipated by many parents and pediatricians, is a crucial step toward the 2-shot coronavirus vaccine regimen becoming available for younger school-aged children, perhaps close to Halloween.

The companies still must prepare and submit the data to the Food and Drug Administration, a process they expect to complete by the end of September [2021]. Then, the data -- not yet published or peer reviewed -- will be scrutinized by regulators to ascertain that the vaccine is safe and effective. That could take weeks, or up to a month.

Sharon Nachman, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Stony Brook Medicine in New York, said a vaccine for children would be a "huge, huge step forward" and that she is "cautiously optimistic" about Monday's [20 Sep 2021] announcement.

"As most physicians are, I'm very cautious when it comes to the health of children," Nachman said. "I think it will be critical to have the data presented to a group of experts who are unbiased and have no conflicts of interest to take a look at it."

Regulators have made clear they are working as fast as possible, but also need to ensure the vaccine meets the highest standards -- especially because a rare, but concerning vaccine side effect of heart muscle inflammation has been identified, most frequently in the younger males eligible for the vaccines. An FDA analysis estimated that among 16- to 17- year old males, the risk was close to one in 5000.

"You need to do these kind of studies, and it's going to be important to vaccinate children," said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He called the results -- that the vaccine triggered a robust immune response in children -- somewhat predictable, but important.

With the school year in full swing and cases soaring among children, pediatricians have been inundated with requests to bend the rules and give children a shot now. The new data seems likely to intensify the pressure, even though the existing vaccine is triple the dose tested in the trial. Younger children's immune systems are not the same as adults, and the companies tested and found a much smaller dose was safe and effective.

"No one should really be freelancing -- they should wait for the appropriate approval and recommendations to decide how best to manage their own children's circumstances," said William C. Gruber, Pfizer's senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, who explained that younger children tend to have more "exuberant" immune responses than older people, both to this vaccine and others.

"Nature has equipped us, particularly when we are young, to respond very well to an assortment of things we will encounter in nature -- and we will use vaccines to accelerate that process and really improve on nature," Gruber said.

Detailed data from the study in school-aged children was not immediately released [Mon 20 Sep 2021].

"It's frustrating that we're in an age of science by press release. Until we look at the data, I can't comment on this, other than to say: We need a vaccine for children," said Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who serves on the expert committee that advises the FDA.

The step forward for a children's vaccine may deepen the rift between families eager for the vaccine and parents who are hesitant. Hospitalizations among children have increased in the delta surge, but children have been far less likely to develop severe illness and death than older people throughout the pandemic, leading to a perception among some that the disease is not harmful to them.

Among 12- to 17-year-olds eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech shot since May [2021], only about half have received at least one dose, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. More than 5 million cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have been reported among children and teens, causing 20 000 hospitalizations and 460 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Many families and schools have been navigating disruptive quarantines and at times divisive policies on use of masks.

"We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory approval, especially as we track the spread of the delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children," Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said in a statement. "Since July [2021], pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240% in the U.S. -- underscoring the public health need for vaccination."

In July [2021], the FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna to increase the size of their children's trials to ensure the safety database was robust. There were nearly 2300 children between ages 5 and 11 in Pfizer's trial, 2-thirds of whom received the vaccine. The rest received saltwater shots.

The trial showed that children who received the vaccine had equivalent immune responses to teens and young adults who were protected, according to the companies. Two shots of a 10 microgram dose, spaced 3 weeks apart, were well-tolerated, with side effects similar to young adults.

Gruber said there appeared to be less fever and fewer chills among younger children than in a comparison group of 16- to 25-year-olds, increasing the companies' confidence they had found the right dose. There were no cases of myocarditis in the trial, but because it is a rare event, it may only show up in monitoring as the vaccine is used in larger numbers.

Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking emergency use authorization as they continue to accumulate data to support an application for full approval in children. Data on children younger than 5 is expected by the end of the year [2021]. Moderna is also conducting a trial with children as young as 6 months.

"We have school-aged children, and they do have masks and they're able to follow rules," Nachman said. "Little kids in day care have more trouble following rules."

[The announced results of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine safety and efficacy in children are not yet accompanied by substantial data, but if true are a very encouraging development. In addition to the benefit of protecting the health of individual children, widespread vaccination of children will also have the obvious societal benefit of reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since children represent a large proportion of the as-yet unvaccinated population.

As the article mentions, rare cases of myocarditis have been observed in teenagers receiving the full-dose mRNA vaccines, and more cases will likely be reported following widespread pediatric vaccination. However, these potential rare cases of myocarditis should be balanced against the potential reduction of cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition that can affect not only the heart but many other organs as well [See ProMED posts 20210901.8638460 and 20210730.8557829].

The rollout of this and other COVID vaccines for children will introduce a new wrinkle in various school attendance policies, including the prospect of mandatory vaccination. One might think that mandatory vaccination policies would be more readily applied by private non-denominational schools than by public schools. But in fact all 50 states in the U.S.A. have public school entry requirements for vaccinations, although many states do allow exemptions for religious or personal beliefs (with California being a notable exception since 2015). On the face of it, there is no obvious reason why COVID vaccines could not eventually be added to the schedule of other "routine" pediatric vaccines. But as with other state and national COVID policies, controversy and conflict are sure to follow and take up newspaper space.

As an example of what other countries are doing about vaccinating children against COVID, on 16 Sep 2021 Cuba became one of the 1st countries in the world to begin vaccinating young children (as young as 2 years old), using domestically produced vaccines.

[2] Vaccine diplomacy

At a virtual summit on [Wed 22 Sep 2021], while the annual United Nations General Assembly meeting is underway, President Biden will urge other vaccine-producing countries to balance their domestic needs with a renewed focus on manufacturing and distributing doses to poor nations in desperate need of them.

The push, which White House officials say seeks to inject urgency into vaccine diplomacy, will test Mr. Biden's doctrine of furthering American interests by building global coalitions. COVAX, the United Nations-backed vaccine program, is so far behind schedule that not even 10% of the population in poor nations is fully vaccinated, experts said. And the landscape is even more challenging now than when COVAX was created in April 2020.

Some nations in Asia have imposed tariffs and other trade restrictions on COVID-19 vaccines, slowing their delivery. India, home to the world's largest vaccine maker, banned coronavirus vaccine exports. And an FDA panel on [Fri 17 Sep 2021] recommended Pfizer booster shots for those over 65 or at high risk of severe COVID-19, meaning that vaccine doses that could have gone to low and lower-middle income countries would remain in the United States.

Officials said [Wed 22 Sep 2021] summit would be the largest gathering of heads of state to address the coronavirus crisis. It aims to encourage pharmaceutical makers, philanthropists and nongovernmental organizations to work together toward vaccinating 70% of the world's population by the time the U.N. General Assembly meets in [September 2022], according to a draft document the White House sent to the summit participants.

Experts estimate that 11 billion doses are necessary to achieve widespread global immunity. The United States has pledged to donate more than 600 million -- more than any other nation -- and the Biden administration has taken steps to expand vaccine manufacturing in the United States, India and South Africa. The 27-nation European Union aims to export 700 million doses by the end of the year [2021].

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including the USA (32 731), India (30 809), UK (29 479), Turkey (26 398), Russia (20 174), Philippines (19 201), Malaysia (14 954), Thailand (13 576), Iran (15 975), Mexico (11 711), and Vietnam (10 040) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There appears to be the customary weekend drop in the number of reported cases. A global total of 5334 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 17 Sep 2021 to late 18 Sep 2021). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 3.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 0.01% increase in daily reported cases and 18% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approx. 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 228.93 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.70 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
