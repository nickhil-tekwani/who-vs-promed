Foot-and-Mouth Disease Alert in Colombia Due to Outbreak in Venezuela
--------------------------------------------------
The Venezuelan Autonomous Service of Plant and Animal Health (SASA)
confirmed 6 foci of type A foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the states of
Merida and Zulia, which prompted the Colombian Institute of Plant and
Animal Health (ICA) to issue an alert to cattle farmers in the states of La
Guajira, Cesar, and Norte de Santander.
Given the situation and the serious risk to the current status of that
region of Colombia as free of FMD with vaccination, ICA urged the community
to abstain from trading in live cattle and products derived from them near
the border with Venezuela.
The organization indicated that, according to resolution No. 3763 of 23 Dec
2002, the import of animals susceptible to the virus and products derived
from them from the states of Zulia and Merida is banned; non-compliance
with this restriction could result in serious health problems.
Alvaro Abisambra, director of ICA, explained that the measure bans for a
period of 3 months the entry into Colombia of cattle, sheep, swine, and
other susceptible species and their by-products originating from those
Venezuelan states where the virus has been identified.
Abisambra noted that the north coast of Colombia was declared free of FMD
in May 2000 and, to date, that status has been maintained thanks to the
high level of vaccination and cooperative efforts of ICA and the cattle
farmers.
The FMD virus is rapidly transmitted by contact between infected and
healthy animals. It can spread through the air and even be carried in
tires, shoes, and clothes.
