[The current tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saud Arabia is 818 cases including 352 deaths (case fatality rate 43.0 percent).

The newly reported fatality -- a 58-year-old Saudi male from Taif was most likely the individual reported as a newly confirmed case on 22 Nov 2014 at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. A history of animal exposure was listed as under investigation, and he did not have a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in either the healthcare environment or in the community.

I was unable to find further information on the newly reported recovered 43-year-old expat male from Sakaka/Aljawf, checking all reported cases from the end of April 2012 through the present time. There was a 34-year-old expat male from Sakaka/AlJawf newly confirmed on 28 Nov 2014 but he was listed as having a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. It is possible that this individual (the 43-year-old expat male) was originally hospitalized outside of AlJawf and reported from elsewhere, or perhaps was one of the cases that was retrospectively confirmed on 18 Sep 2014. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.
