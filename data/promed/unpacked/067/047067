South America

Argentina (national). 11 Dec 2015. The Argentina Ministry of Health advises residents who travel to Brazil to avoid acquiring a Zika virus infection and then returning to Argentina with the virus. http://www.primerafuente.com.ar/noticias/62446/alertan-argentinos-viajen-brasil-peligroso-virus [in Spanish]

[With the upcoming Christmas-New Year season, there will be considerable travel within and between countries in the Americas, where Zika virus is transmitted currently, and those localities where mosquito vector populations are abundant, but where the virus has not yet arrived. It will not be surprising to see Zika virus appearing in new locations over the coming days and weeks.

[2] Americas overview
Date: Tue 15 Dec 2015

Brazil has reported 1761 cases of babies born with unusually small brains, or microcephaly, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Tue 15 Dec 2015], as a mosquitoborne disease linked to the condition spread across Latin America.

Brazilian health authorities said last month there was a link between the mosquitoborne Zika virus and a surge in babies born with microcephaly, which can cause developmental and intellectual difficulties and limit intelligence and muscle coordination for life.

But WHO stated that the cause of the microencephaly outbreak in Brazil had yet to be determined.

As of 5 Dec [2015], the statement said that 19 children had died out of the 1761 suspected cases distributed across 422 municipalities in Brazil.

On 7 Dec [2015], Brazil's Ministry of Health revised the definition of microcephaly to include babies with a head circumference of less than 32 cm [12.6 in], instead of 33 cm [13 in] previously. Babies in that category will be closely monitored, WHO said.

Indigenous circulation of the virus has been detected in the Americas since February 2014, when Chile confirmed the 1st non-imported transmission of the disease on Easter Island.

Zika virus has also been confirmed this year [2015] in Panama, Venezuela, El Salvador, Mexico, Suriname, Colombia, Guatemala, and Paraguay. It is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, also known to transmit the yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.

"Because the _Aedes_ species mosquitoes that spread Zika virus are found throughout the world, it is likely that outbreaks will spread to new countries," the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says on its Zika webpage. "Zika virus is not currently found in the United States. However, cases of Zika have been reported in returning travelers."

Between 3-12 days after being bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, 3 out of 4 people come down with symptoms including mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, headaches, and joint pain.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions due to the Zika outbreaks.

Zika is also found in Africa and South East Asia. There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent or treat it, and travelers are advised to protect themselves by avoiding mosquito bites.

[Interestingly, authorities in French Polynesia have also reported a recent uptick in brain defects and lesions in fetuses and newborns that correspond to Zika virus outbreaks. Although none of the mothers demonstrated symptoms of Zika virus infection, test results showed that 4 of them might have been carrying it, according to PAHO (http://www.livescience.com/53091-what-is-zika-virus.html).

The USA CDC cautions travelers to those localities where Zika virus is transmitted that mosquito bites should be avoided and experts advise everyone to wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts and use insect repellant that includes DEET, Picaridin, IR3535 or lemon eucalyptus oil. It is also recommended that bed nets be used if staying outdoors or at campsites (http://bioprepwatch.com/stories/510652583-cdc-issues-travel-notices-for-zika-virus-in-central-south-america). - Mod.TY]

[3] Netherlands ex Suriname
Date: Thu 17 Dec 2015
From: Abraham Goorhuis <a.goorhuis@amc.nl> [edited]


Following up on the case of Zika virus infection that we reported on 13 Dec 2015 (see archive no 20151213.3858300), we report a 2nd case of confirmed Zika virus infection in a 40 year old female patient, who had also visited Suriname, from 5 Nov-5 Dec 2015. She had only been in Paramaribo. On the return flight to the Netherlands, she developed complaints: red skin rash, arthralgias, and a painful skin upon touch. On physical examination, she was not ill, with a maculopapular rash on her trunk and extremities. Blood haematology was normal, except for atypical lymphocytes in the differential. Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam), on a serum sample taken on 9 Dec 2015 (the 5th day of illness). She recovered quickly.

Following up on the previous 2 cases with confirmed Zika virus infection imported from Suriname, we diagnosed a 3rd patient (a 54 year old and otherwise healthy male) with a Zika virus infection, who had also visited Suriname (Paramaribo, Domburg, and Commewijne province), from 24 Nov-2 Dec 2015. He developed complaints on [2 Dec 2015] and presented at the emergency department of our hospital on 4 Dec 2015 with fever, arthralgias, muscle aches, and a palpable rash in the neck and on the upper arms, that had progressed to the trunk and lower extremities at the 1st day of follow-up at our outpatient clinic 3 days later, on 7 Dec 2015. The only laboratory abnormalities were a slight leucopenia (3.9 x 10e9/l), with atypical lymphocytes in the differential. The clinical diagnosis of Zika virus infection was confirmed by PCR (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam), on a sample taken on 10 Dec 2015 (9th day of illness). His clinical condition is currently improving. This is the 3rd confirmed case of imported Zika virus infection in one week in returned travelers from Suriname.

[These are additional cases that illustrate the relative speed with which viruses, via viremic patients, can travel around the world, with illness developing far from the locality where the infection was acquired. Fortunately, with the patients arriving in the Netherlands during the onset of winter, with no vector mosquitoes present, there is no chance of ongoing transmission.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Goorhuis and colleagues for submitting these case reports.

It was not surprising that Zika virus arrived in Suriname, since 2 other countries in northern South America -- adjacent Brazil and somewhat more distant Colombia and Venezuela -- have reported ongoing cases. Transmission of the virus is continuing there.

Maps of Suriname in northeastern South America can be accessed at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/southamerica/map-of-Surinam.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3886435,37.

It will be interesting to see if cases of microcephaly occur when pregnant women are infected with Zika virus during their 1st trimester of pregnancy in the other countries that are experiencing Zika virus outbreaks. One hopes that pre-natal healthcare providers are aware of what is going on in Brazil, and that an effective surveillance system with adequate laboratory support is in place. Surveillance and reporting for occurrence of Guillain-Barre syndrome cases following Zika virus infections is important as well. - Mod.TY]
