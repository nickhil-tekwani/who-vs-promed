30 people infected by chikungunya in Perak, Malaysia
----------------------------------------------------
Chikungunya, a rare mosquitoborne disease, has struck a village in Perak,
and 30 cases have been detected by the Health Department since 2 weeks ago.
Communicable disease control director Datuk Dr Ramlee Rahmat said the
Health Ministry's laboratory tests on blood samples taken from 30 villagers
in Panchut, Pantai Remis confirmed that they had contracted chikungunya, a
viral disease which is not life-threatening.
Chikungunya is an urban disease resembling dengue and is a relatively rare
form of viral fever caused by an alphavirus that is spread by mosquito
bites from the _Aedes_ mosquito. The name chikungunya is derived from the
Swahili phrase that can be translated as "that which bends up," referring
to the stooped posture that develops as a result of the arthritic symptoms
of the disease.
"This is the 1st time that we have detected a chikungunya outbreak in this
country since 1999," Dr Ramlee said when contacted on Saturday [1 Apr
2006]. The last known outbreak in Malaysia was in 1999, when 27 people were
infected in Port Klang, Selangor. Chikungunya was 1st described in
Tanzania, Africa in 1952.
Dr Ramlee said the Health Ministry was alerted to the possible outbreak 2
weeks ago, after a general practitioner (GP) in the area told the Health
Department about 30 people who were found to have symptoms like those of
chikungunya infection, such as fever, rashes, arthritis affecting multiple
joints, as well as headache. "Following that, we went down and conducted a
thorough check [in which] we took blood samples from the villagers and sent
them [to] the laboratory [for] tests. After several tests, it was confirmed
that they had chikungunya," he said.
He said the ministry believed the outbreak had occurred much earlier, as
some of the villagers had been found to have similar symptoms but in
smaller numbers. "Following the confirmation of the tests, we have taken
action such as fogging, cleaning, as well as providing health education to
the people in the affected villages," Dr Ramlee said.

started at the beginning of 2005, is actually more serious than expected.
