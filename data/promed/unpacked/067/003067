vaccine-induced alloreactive antibodies? Vaccine (2011),

Abstract

Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new emerging disease observed
since 2007 in Germany and neighbouring countries. The syndrome affects
newborn calves and is characterized by pancytopenia, severe bleeding
and high lethality.

So far, a causative role of infectious or toxic agents has been ruled
out. Instead, the syndrome is induced after ingestion of colostrum,
the 1st milk that supplies the calf with maternal antibodies. In
analogy to similar diseases in humans, it has, therefore, been
postulated that BNP is caused by alloreactive, maternal antibodies.
There is a striking association between BNP and a previous vaccination
of the respective dams with a particular vaccine against bovine virus
diarrhoea (BVD). This association has led to a suspension of the
marketing authorisation for the vaccine by the European Commission.

The current study investigates the role of this vaccine in the
pathogenesis of BNP. By flow cytometry, we were able to demonstrate
that sera of BNP dams (dams that gave birth to a BNP calf) harbour
alloreactive antibodies binding to surface antigens on bovine
leukocytes. A significantly weaker alloreactivity was observed with
sera of non-BNP dams that have been vaccinated with the same vaccine
but delivered healthy calves. No binding was seen with
non-BVD-vaccinated control cows and animals that were vaccinated with
other inactivated BVD vaccines so far not associated with BNP. The
binding is functionally relevant, because opsonization of bovine
leukocytes with alloantibodies led to an elevated cytophagocytosis by
bovine macrophages.

To test whether the vaccine induces alloreactive antibodies, 2
strategies were employed: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with a panel of
commercially available BVD-vaccines. Only the incriminated vaccine
induced antibodies binding surface antigens on bovine leukocytes.
Additionally, 2 calves were repeatedly vaccinated with the suspected
vaccine, and the development of alloreactivity was monitored.

In relation to the number of booster immunisations an increase of
alloreactive antibodies could be observed. Finally, by affinity
purification, we were able to directly demonstrate that BNP associated
alloantibodies cross react with the bovine kidney cell line used for
vaccine production. Together, this provides strong evidence that this
particular BVD vaccine has the potential to induce BNP associated
alloantibodies.

[Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP, popularly named "bleeding calf
disease," also neonatal haemorrhagic diathesis), was initially noticed
in early 2007 as a disease of unclear aetiology affecting calves under
4 weeks of age, characterised by thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and
multiple unexplained haemorrhages. Cases were reported in several
European countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain
(England, Wales and Scotland), Netherlands, Italy and Ireland.

In early June 2010, Pfizer Animal Health (PAH) decided to voluntarily
stop further sales of PregSure BVD (inactivated, adjuvanted) vaccine,
pending further investigations into the BNP syndrome in calves. This
was done in view of accumulating circumstantial evidence on the
possible connection between the 2, though at that time, a causal
relationship between them was not established (see archived post 20100607.1896).

On 16 Jul 2010, the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for
Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the marketing authorisations for
PregSure BVD and associated names "should be suspended until
scientific evidence is available to demonstrate that the
administration of the vaccine to dams according to authorised
conditions of use does not lead to an increased risk of bovine
neonatal pancytopenia or that risk mitigation measures ensuring the
safe use of the product can be implemented." In addition, the CVMP
recommended that all batches of the product be recalled at wholesale
level (see archived post 20100719.2425). It seems that the German
investigation team has now succeeded in confirming the suspicions and
justifying the withdrawal of the vaccine. As reported in the paper, in
Germany, where the highest number of BNP cases have been recorded so
far, the incidence of BNP after PregSureBVD immunization has been
estimated to be not higher than 0.3 percent and on farms affected by
BNP usually not more than 5-10 percent of the dams actually induce
BNP.

In the discussion chapter of the paper, the authors conclude that
their data provide strong evidence that repeated vaccination with
PregSureBVD is involved in the induction of BNP-associated
alloantibodies. Yet, there are still a number of issues that need to
be addressed, comprising the role of the adjuvant, the identity of
alloantigens, and the difference between alloreactive BNP and non-BNP
dams, which has to be elucidated. They indicate that ongoing efforts
are aiming to resolve these open questions. - Mod.AS]
