RIYADH: The Saudi authorities have increased their level of alert after
reports of Rift Valley Fever which has killed 21 people in Jizan and
affected 51 others spreading to neighboring areas. Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Oqail,
director of health in Najran, disclosed yesterday that an RVF case was
discovered in the southern border city. In Qunfuda, 6 Yemenis were
affected by the killer virus, press reports said.
Meanwhile, Badr ibn Abdul Aziz Al-Rabica, director of health in the Riyadh
region, said no RVF cases had been found in the central region. "The state
of alert in the Riyadh area has been heightened to protect against the
spread of RVF" the official SPA news agency quoted Rabica as saying. Health
officials have checked 2649 passengers coming by road from the southern
region, he said. They also checked 741 passengers who arrived at Riyadh
airport from Jizan, Bisha and Najran.
Meanwhile, a Saudi pharmacist in Jizan, claimed yesterday that he had sent
a letter to the agriculture minister 2 years ago informing him about the
smuggling of sheep infected by various diseases into the Kingdom. He also
had mentioned in the letter that a number of sheep, cows and camels had
died due to various diseases. He had also warned against the possibility of
RVF spreading in the Kingdom through sheep, Al-Madinah newspaper reported.

With the number of people infected by Rift Valley Fever in the southern
border city of Jizan growing daily there are now also reports of a malaria
outbreak in the neighboring town of Qunfuda.
Abdul Raheem em Aqeel, the director of health [in Jizan, said 2 more
people had died of the fever [which one? Shamsudeen on Wednesday while 6
people in Humaira and Qamari villages had also contracted the disease [we
presume they are referring to cases of RVF here.
A local student collapsed Wednesday in front of his school after showing
various RVF symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting forcing the school's
authorities to evacuate all students for a medical check-up. Although
schools were reopened in the city after a few days break, about 70 percent
of students and teachers have not attended classes, scared away by the
potentially fatal RVF virus.
So far about 20 people have died and more than 60 have been affected by the
disease [RVF since it was first detected in the region 2 weeks ago. The
ministries of Health and Agriculture, with the support of other government
agencies have stepped up a campaign to prevent the spread of the disease.
More teams have been sent to Jizan to spray insecticides against mosquitoes
which carry the virus from infected animals to humans.
Health Minister Dr. Osama Shubokshi has said there is no medicine against
the disease [RVF. So,only preventive measures such as killing mosquitoes
and affected animals are the solution. The Health Ministry has pointed out
that cases in Jizan hospitals are not serious as patients in Jizan were
just showing influenza-like symptoms.
Southern hospitals have received, however,a number of cases similar to RVF,
but, after laboratory tests doctors have confirmed the illness as malaria.
A hospital in Aredah governorate Wednesday received 6 cases of malaria.
Jizan people are exposed to malaria for about two months every year. Last
year 1,300 people were affected by the disease. Seasonal rain time
contributed to the spread of both RVF and malaria in the region as
mosquitoes carrying the virus [and malaria parasites have flourished in
the stagnant rain waters.
RVF has also hit neighboring Yemen where about 77 people have reportedly
been killed by the disease. The director of schools in Jizan told Okaz
newspaper that only 30 percent of students and teachers were attending
classes and hoped that things would improve by next week. The Arabic daily
pointed out that 80 percent of the Kingdom's sheep imports passed
by Jizan, a significant factor in the spread of the disease throughout the
region.
Sudanese exporters also expressed fear yesterday that they would suffer
"big losses" from Saudi Arabia's ban on livestock imports from African
countries. Sudan's Livestock Exporters Association was assessing the Saudi
decision. "This surprise decision by Saudi Arabia banning Sudanese
livestock exports will cause big losses for Sudanese exporters,"
Association Chairman Siddeiq Haidub was yesterday quoted by the independent
Al-Ayam daily as saying.
Meanwhile, Sameer Lingawi, the director of health in Jeddah, told
Al-Madinah newspaper that no RVF cases had been reported in the Red Sea
port city. The Health Ministry has distributed an urgent circular among all
health directorates in the Kingdom to report potential RVF cases in other
parts of the country as soon as they are detected. Medical sources also
said RVF was spreading to other villages in Jizan, like Bani Malik and
Madhaya.

RIYADH: Saudi Health Ministry official confirmed yesterday that Rift Valley
Fever, the killer virus that has hit the southern border city of Jizan, has
not spread to any other regions in the Kingdom. Dr. Badr ibn Abdul Aziz
Al-Rabiea, director of health in the Riyadh region, said his department has
taken all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Speaking to reporters, he said the measures were taken due to the
possibility of spread [of the [viral disease from neighboring areas.
Medical teams have been deployed at the entrances of Riyadh to spray
insecticides on all planes and cars coming from [the south and check the
health condition of passengers. Special teams have been assigned to kill
mosquitoes and inspect sheep market, slaughterhouses and restaurants.
Hospitals and health centers have been urged to inform about any suspected
RVF cases.
In Amman, meanwhile, Jordanian Interior Minister Awad Khleifat yesterday
announced the launch of a prevention campaign against any outbreak of West
Nile and Rift Valley fevers, which struck neighboring Israel and Saudi
Arabia, respectively. The official Petra news agency which carried the
announcement also quoted Health Minister Tareq Suheimat as saying that
Jordan was totally free of both killer diseases [WNV and RVF. About 77
people have been reported to have died of RVF in Yemen.
Rift Valley Fever affects domestic animals and can be transmitted to humans
by mosquitoes. Symptoms include hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and eye
problems.
Medical teams have been spraying insecticides in coastal of Al-Hadida in
Yemen to combat Rift Valley Fever. Dr. I Mahyoub Al-Faqih, in charge of a
special operation room tasked with fighting the deadly epidemic, said in a
statement to KUNA yesterday that a helicopter, dispatched by Saudi Arabia,
was expected to arrive in coming hours to be used to spray infected spots.
A number of experts from Egypt [there was a major outbreak of RVF in Egypt
in 1978 and again in 1993. A summary of the 1993 outbreak can be found in
the WHO document, WHO/CDS/VPH/93.128 - Mod.MPP and the WHO are also due to
arrive to take part in the campaign.

[According to the CDC Traveler's Health Section, while malaria risk is low
in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, in Saudi Arabia, there is risk in all areas in
the western provinces, except in the high altitude areas of Asir Province
(Yemen border), and the urban areas of Jeddah, Mecca, Medina and Taif. In
Yemen, there is risk in all areas except Aden and the airport perimeter and
in Sana'a. As both malaria and RVF can present with a flu-like illness, it
is not surprising to find malaria cases at this time of year as it is one
of the rainy seasons (April-May and August-September). Nevertheless, the
possibility of co-infection does exist so the presence of malaria parasites
does not preclude a simultaneous infection with RVF. Presumably testing
for RVF is ongoing for all suspected cases presenting to the health sector.
Likewise, peripheral blood smears for malaria parasites should also be
performed as the area is known to have malaria risk, and ongoing
transmission at present has been documented. - Mod.MPP
