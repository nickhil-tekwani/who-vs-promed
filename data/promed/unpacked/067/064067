From: Roger Vancil <rdvancil@smtpgate.dphe.state.co.us>

I was a bit confused by the following statement: "Informed sources also
confirmed the Kisumu Municipal Council was discharging up to 50 milligrams
of bicarbonate oxygen demand (BOD) instead of the stipulated maximum of 50
BOD."
Can someone briefly educate me and explain what bicarbonate oxygen demand
(BOD) is? The only BOD that I am familiar with in regard to water quality
is biochemical oxygen demand. Thanks.

[Roger has asked a good question. I am familiar with Biochemical oxygen
demand but not bicarbonate oxygen demand. I perhaps incorrectly believed it
a misprint. However, I would appreciate an answer if some one can tell us.
