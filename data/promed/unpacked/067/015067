Vietnam has detected bird flu on 3 farms near the Chinese border, the 2nd
such finding in the past few days, an animal health official said on
Saturday [8 Apr 2006].
Health workers slaughtered 157 chickens and ducks after farmers said 30
birds died on 19 Mar 2006 on 3 farms in Cao Bang province, said Dang Quang
Binh, head of the provincial Animal Health Department.
"We sent samples for testing and on 25 Mar 2006 the results showed H5 was
found in poultry samples from the 3 farms," Binh told Reuters by telephone
from Cao Bang, 270 km (167 miles) north of Hanoi.

He was referring to the H5 subtype avian flu virus.
No further tests will likely be done to confirm if the strain was H5N1,
which has killed 42 people in Vietnam since late 2003. Vietnam usually
tests for the N component of the strain when a sample comes from a
suspected human case.
With poultry, the finding of H5 is enough to carry out preventive measures
such as slaughter and disinfection of birds. The H5N1 strain has killed or
led to the culling of millions of poultry in Vietnam but there have not
been any human cases since November 2005.
On Thursday, officials said the H5 subtype virus was found in samples from
chickens smuggled from China and seized in Lang Son province, next to Cao
Bang, marking the first published finding of bird flu in poultry in Vietnam
since December [2005]. Binh said the latest infection was in Trung Khanh
district, an area afflicted by bird flu in 2005. Cao Bang province would
vaccinate poultry against bird flu later this month, he said.
Vietnam vaccinated 240 million ducks and chickens in 2005 as part of a
series of measures to fight bird flu, which has killed at least 109 people
worldwide since the H5N1 virus re-emerged in Asia in 2003 and has since
spread to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
This week Vietnam stepped up border-control measures to prevent a
resurgence of bird flu, but officials said the efforts did not always
succeed because northern Vietnamese were involved in the lucrative illegal
trade of smuggling chickens from China.
They can sell the birds in Vietnam at up to 10 times their buying price but
in the process run the risk of re-introducing bird flu.

[A laboratory confirmation of these observations, preferably including full
typing of the causative agent, is expected. According to Vietnam's last
follow-up report to the OIE (No 17, sent on 23 Feb 2006), no cases in
avians have been recorded in Vietnam between 23 Jan and 23 Feb 2006.
Hopefully, all affected animals have been susceptible, unvaccinated birds.
If vaccinated birds have been affected as well, this will become a cause
for concern, requiring further investigations. - Mod.AS]

[2] Croatia (Zagreb), swan

Croatia confirmed Friday night [7 Apr 2006] the first bird flu case in the
capital, Zagreb, after a dead swan found there tested positive for the H5
strain of bird flu virus.
The dead swan was found on the shores of the Sava River in southeast Zagreb
last weekend, said Mladen Pavic, spokesman for the Croatian Agriculture,
Forestry and Water Management Ministry.
[map at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/croatia.pdf>].
Tests confirmed that the dead bird had contracted the H5 type of bird flu
virus, but test findings as to whether it was the lethal H5N1 strain would
be released on Sunday or Monday, reports from Zagreb quoted him as saying.
Quarantine officers found no other birds after combing the area within a
radius of 3 km of the locale, Pavic said, adding that they would continue
to monitor the situation there closely.
Croatia, which lies under one of the main flight paths for migratory birds,
reported its first bird flu case in October 2005 when H5N1 was found in 6
wild swans in the eastern part of the country.
In late February 2006, the disease struck the country's southern coastal
region, where 2 dead swans were tested positive for H5N1.
Croatian authorities immediately adopted a series of precautionary measures
to curb the spread of the disease, including ordering farmers to keep their
poultry indoors to try to prevent them from contracting the virus from wild
birds.

[A useful update (including map) of the European AI situation is available
at the European Commission's Disasters web-site
<http://disasters.jrc.it/AvianFlu/index.asp?europe=true>.
Cases in wild birds are continuously been recorded in Europe. Denmark
reported on 7 Apr 2006 the confirmation of 3 additional cases in wild
birds: 2 common buzzards (_Buteo buteo_) and one whooper swan (_Cygnus
cygnus_), in 3 separate locations.
No case in domestic poultry has been recorded in Denmark, which is
officially free of HPAI. The meticulous surveillance in Denmark and the
transparency expressed in the maintenance of a user-friendly, mapped
web-site which is updated on nearly a real-time basis, is indeed exemplary.
All cases detected so far (since 14 Mar 2006] are described in detail.

[3] Situation assessment, EU

Scotland: Scottish executive announced that tests carried out at Weybridge
confirmed the dead Mute swan from Cellardyke had H5N1. The swan was not
thought to be migratory, and a community of the birds frequent a wide area.
As a result, Chief veterinary officer Chris Milne said a 2500-sq km area to
the east of the M90 motorway was now a "wild bird risk area" and urged
poultry owners to bring their birds inside. 14 other birds are being
tested, as the Scottish National Party urged for testing to be speeded up
because it took a week for confirmation at Cellardyke. 2 dead swans have
also been found in Antrim, Ulster [See comment below].
Germany: Authorities have ordered a cull of all domestic birds in the
immediate area of the infected farm at Wernsdorf. 16 000 turkey, geese and
ducks were culled Thursday 6 Apr 2006.
Another 30 000 birds will be slaughtered in 90 farms in a 3-km exclusion
zone around the farm. The virus has been found to be a dangerous Asian
strain and the EU has banned poultry exports within 13 km.
Egypt: A 16-year-old girl from the northern governorate of Menufiyya has
sadly died of bird flu, announced the ministry of health. She was admitted
to Eshmon Hospital only late Wednesday after falling ill raising backyard
poultry. A program to promote better awareness of the disease is planned in
rural areas.
Burkina Faso: Burkina Faso has started to cull poultry in the area where
birds have died from H5N1 bird flu. However, there was still a delay of
one month to get test results from the farm in question. As a result it is
feared the disease is spreading without control.
Nigeria: H5N1 has been found in backyard poultry and at a commercial farm
in the Nigerian city of Lagos, home to about 13 million people, health
officials said on Thursday. This is potentially a dangerous situation in
this densely populated city where most families keep backyard poultry. A
grant of USD 500 000 has been made from the African Development bank to
support the Nigerian government's effort to combat spread of the disease.
Russia: A significant number of dead wild ducks have been found in the
River Ikortes in the Voronezh region south west of Moscow, according to the
region's chief sanitary officer. Samples have been taken for tests.

[On Saturday,8 Apr 2006, media sources announced that the 16 additional
tested birds, from Scotland and Ulster, have not been confirmed infected.
In view of the (remote) possibility that pets might have come in contact
with the dead swan in Cellardyke, and following the confirmed infection in
a German cat, the following Policy Brief of the British Veterinary
Association (BVA) on Avian Influenza in Cats and other Mammals, issued 6
Apr 2006, might be of interest.
