[3] Netherlands, Brazil: meat packing plants

Source: US News & World Report, Reuters report [edited]
https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-05-25/number-of-coronavirus-cases-at-dutch-meatpacking-plant-jumps-to-147


The number of people diagnosed with the coronavirus [COVID-19] at a Dutch pork processing plant near the German border has jumped to 147 since it was closed last week and workers asked to go into quarantine. The Vion plant in Groenlo, located east of Arnhem and west of the northern German city of Muenster, employs 657 people, many of them German. Health authorities ordered it shut and the workers quarantined after 45 infections were detected on [20 May 2020]

A total of 79 German workers and 68 Dutch workers at the plant have now tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

"The size of such a group of people with positive tests is very worrying," said Ton Heerts of the regional security agency VNOG. "Townships involved will try to answer questions from residents and support companies locally as much as possible." Regional health authorities are conducting an extensive track and trace program to see who infected workers may have been in contact with, Heerts said.

Coronavirus outbreaks have also hit meatpacking and abattoir workers in adjacent northwestern Germany.

Nationwide, the Netherlands has reported 45 236 cases of COVID-19 infections and 5822 deaths, according to the latest Reuters tally.

Hundreds of meatpacking workers at a single BRF SA plant in southern Brazil have tested positive for the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], the company said on Monday [25 May 2020]), amid global concerns about the pandemic disrupting food supplies. Brazilian meatpacker BRF said in a statement that nearly 340 people, or 6.6 per cent of workers, at its Concordia plant in Santa Catarina state had tested positive for the virus. The workers have been pre-emptively suspended from work based on the positive results from rapid testing and will now be submitted to slower but more accurate molecular diagnostic testing, BRF said.

The company said it has tested all of the 5132 workers at its Concordia facility, which processes poultry and pork, with 93 per cent of workers who tested negative returning to work on Monday [25 May 2020]. All BRF plants in the country remain open, a spokeswoman said.

BRF is one of many food concerns in Brazil that, in a bid to remain in operation, have signed commitments with labour prosecutors aimed at increasing worker protections at meat-packing sites. The testing at Concordia, however, was imposed by a local health authority order, according to the statement.

Brazilian companies including BRF and rival JBS SA have been facing outbreaks at their facilities, which in some cases forced plant closures pending introduction of more strict measures to fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Privately-owned Aurora, one of the biggest food companies in Brazil, signed an agreement with labor prosecutors on Friday [22 May 2020] that requires routine testing of employees and other additional protections. The labour prosecutors said Aurora's commitment will help more than 26 000 workers at 16 plants, according to a statement.

Meat packing plants have been hit fairly hard in a number of countries as the "assembly lines" are such that do not permit social distancing and the wearing of masks is difficult for the duration of a shift. Workers have been considered as essential workers but if they stay home they aren't paid. ProMED has posted on the USA situation with plants affected in 18 different states (COVID-19 update (204): global, meat plant outbreaks, WHO 20200523.7370321). - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing, mentioned that "over 400 hospitals in 35 countries are actively recruiting patients and nearly 3500 patients have been enrolled from 17 countries" as part of the Solidarity Trial which was established to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four drugs and drug combinations against COVID-19. (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---25-may-2020).

- The WHO Regional Office for Europe along with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said that they will continue to repurpose their influenza surveillance systems to also detect the COVID-19 virus (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/news/news/2020/5/20192020-influenza-season-repurposing-surveillance-systems-for-covid-19).

- Facing an unprecedented global demand for essential COVID-19 medical supplies, WHO is working with partners to help secure supplies to assist the most vulnerable countries. This is explored in today's 'subject in focus' [COVID-19 Supply Chain Systems, available at the source URL above]
