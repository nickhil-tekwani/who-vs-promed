The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated on Mon 29 Jan 2007 that initial
tests on samples from 14 Nigerians, including three people who died, showed
they were not victims of bird flu. In Geneva, a WHO official said all 14
samples had tested negative for the H5 strain of influenza but positive for
another type. Samples from the 14 have been sent to London for a 2nd check,
the U.N. agency said.
A Nigerian official gave a different account, saying he was awaiting the
outcome of tests at a laboratory in the capital Abuja. Samples have been
taken from three people who died of unknown causes and 11 people who came
into contact with them.
The H5N1 bird flu virus remains primarily an animal disease but can kill
people who have close contact with infected birds. It has killed 163 [164
as of 29 Jan 2007] people around the globe since 2003 and experts fear it
could spark a pandemic in which millions could die if it mutates into a
form that passes easily from person to person.
The samples include ones from a mother and daughter who died in Lagos and
from a woman who died in remote eastern Taraba state after suffering
flu-like symptoms. Abdulsalam Nasidi, in charge of efforts to prevent bird
flu from spreading to humans in Nigeria, said samples from the 3 people who
died had tested positive for [seasonal?] flu which is very common at this
time of year due to the seasonal harmattan wind. "The tests will show if it
was common [seasonal] flu or bird flu," Nasidi said.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, was the 1st on the continent to
detect bird flu a year ago. The virus has spread to 17 of the 36 states but
no human case has been confirmed so far. Experts warn surveillance in
Nigeria may not be completely effective because of poor health services.
Many Nigerians die young of a variety of diseases and few families can
afford the luxury of a doctor to determine the cause of death. Nigeria is
one of 3 countries regarded by experts as the weakest areas in the global
attempt to stem infections among birds. The disease was first discovered in
the northern state of Kaduna a year ago and despite measures such as
culling, quarantine and a transport ban on live birds it spread quickly
across the country. Millions of Nigerians keep live poultry in their
backyards and in the absence of refrigerators in most households, birds are
transported and sold live and killed just before eating.
