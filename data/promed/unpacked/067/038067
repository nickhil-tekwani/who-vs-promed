In its [31 Oct 2019], Situation Report, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 7 new vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV)-affected premises: 5 confirmed positive and 2 suspected. Affected states include:
Colorado: 3 new confirmed positive (1 in Eagle County and 2 in Garfield County) and 1 new suspect (Fremont County);
Nebraska: 1 new confirmed positive in Garden County, which is a newly infected county; and
Utah: 1 new confirmed positive in Duchesne County

Since its last Situation Report on [23 Oct 2019], 29 previously VSV-infected or suspect premises have been released from quarantine:
Colorado: 5;
Texas: 1, in Collin County;
Utah: 1, in Carbon County; and
Wyoming: 22.

In 2019, 7 states have been confirmed with a total of 1138 VSV-infected or suspect premises: Colorado (690), Kansas (1), Nebraska (26), New Mexico (76), Oklahoma (1), Texas (172), Utah (24), and Wyoming (148).

In those states, 1087 previously infected or suspect premises have been released from quarantine. All quarantined premises have been released in Oklahoma since [7 Aug 2019], New Mexico since [5 Sep 2019], and Texas since [31 Oct 2019]. Quarantines for VSV extend for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.

Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV) has been confirmed in the following Colorado counties: Adams, Alamosa, Arapahoe, Archuleta, Boulder, Broomfield, Chaffee, Clear Creek, Conejos, Delta, Dolores, Douglas, Eagle, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Grand, Gunnison, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Las Animas, Mesa, Mineral, Moffat, Montezuma, Montrose, Morgan, Ouray, Park, Pitkin, Pueblo, Rio Blanco, San Miguel, Summit, Teller, and Weld.

A new bovine case, the 4th in Colorado this year [2019], has been confirmed in Garfield County on a cow that was moved from summer grazing two weeks ago.

Currently, 5 quarantines remain in Fremont, Garfield, and Pitkin counties. The total count of premises under quarantine for VSV by county is updated regularly on the CDA VSV website at https://www.colorado.gov/aganimals/vesicular-stomatitis-virus-vsv.

Although the majority of quarantines have been released, many horse and livestock movements are still impacted by VSV import requirements in other states. Many states have very stringent import requirements; for example, animals within 10 miles of a VSV quarantined premises in the previous 30, 60, or 90 days may not enter their state. Accredited veterinarians must ensure horses and livestock meet the import requirements of destination states. Veterinarians can contact the State Veterinarian's Office with questions regarding health certificates.

The 1st case of VSV in Colorado was reported on [3 Jul 2019] in Weld County by a field veterinarian from the State Veterinarian's Office at the Colorado Department of Agriculture. An incursion of VSV-infected insect vectors is the likely source of infection. There are no USDA approved vaccines for VSV.

Please see the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services website to read the current situation report for all confirmed cases in the U.S.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle but occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas and alpacas will show clinical signs. The transmission process of VSV is not completely understood, but includes insect vectors such as black flies, sand flies and biting midges.

The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days. Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, ears, teats, and coronary bands. Often excessive salivation is the 1st sign of disease, along with a reluctance to eat or drink. Lameness and weight loss may follow.

Humans may become infected when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. To avoid human exposure, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.

Tips for livestock owners:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools or health care equipment from other herds.

Colorado veterinarians and livestock owners should contact the state of destination when moving livestock interstate to ensure that all import requirements are met. Contact information for all state veterinarian offices is listed here.

Colorado fairs, livestock exhibitions, and rodeos may institute new entry requirements based on the extent and severity of the current VS outbreak. Certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs or health certificates) issued within 2 to 5 days prior to an event can be beneficial in reducing risks. Be sure to stay informed of any new livestock event requirements. See the Vesicular Stomatitis Guidelines for Shows and Fairs at

Any vesicular disease of livestock is reportable to the State Veterinarian's Office in Colorado - to report call (303) 869-9130. If after hours, the voice message will indicate which staff veterinarian is on call.

In its [14 Nov 2019] Situation Report, the United States Department of Agriculture USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed one new positive premise for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in a horse.

The confirmed positive premise is located in Platte County, Wyoming. Since the last Situation Report, issued [7 Nov 2019], officials have released 12 previously VSV-infected or -suspect premises in Wyoming from quarantine.

Since then, officials have also released from quarantine one previously VSV-infected premises in Garden County, Nebraska, and one previously VSV-infected premise in Quinta County, Utah.

The USDA places confirmed positive and suspect premises under quarantine for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises.

VSV 101
Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[These outbreaks continue to smolder on, unfortunately for a long time. This is wearing on producers, and state and federal personnel who work these cases. It is painful for the victims (equines or bovines). Surely all involved look forward to some winter weather to kill the insect transmitters of this disease. - Mod.TG
