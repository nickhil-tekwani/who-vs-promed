[The New Humanitarian (abridged, edited)]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/08/02/ebola-preparations-tested-cases-rise-congo-s-main-eastern-city
[Byline: Pamela Tulizo]

Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo's densely populated eastern city of Goma rose from 1 to 5 this week [week of Mon 29 Jul 2019], raising fears of a wider outbreak of the deadly virus that has already cost more than 1800 lives in the past 12 months.

Key to containing the spread will be tracing and vaccinating everyone known to have come into contact with the 5 people infected, and then the contacts of those contacts. A ministry of health presentation seen by The New Humanitarian lists 538 cumulative contacts traced in Goma.

Kate White, emergency medical manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres, said ongoing efforts to engage Goma communities in the response and to improve awareness of the disease, its signs, and its symptoms needs to be "scaled up" quickly.

"The problem is that Goma is massive, and the level of preparedness is not always there," she said.

Interviews with multiple Goma residents -- many of whom were unaware or refused to accept there were new Ebola cases in the city -- suggest more outreach work is necessary.

"We need to see a person with Ebola before we can confirm it is here," [E], a motor taxi driver, told TNH.

Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, has a population of roughly 2 million people and is a major transit hub with an international airport and a porous border with Rwanda. Roughly 15 000 people cross between the 2 countries every day, including local traders and travellers en route to Rwanda's capital city, Kigali.

The rising cases here have left aid workers and local residents questioning whether the sprawling lakeside city is prepared for a wider outbreak. Just 54 beds -- 30 of those confirmed today [Fri 2 Aug 2019] -- are currently available for Ebola patients, and the general population has varying levels of awareness about the virus and how to prevent it from spreading.

- Sat 3 Aug 2019. Unidentified cases
[DW, abridged, edited]
https://m.dw.com/en/ebola-half-of-cases-going-undetected/a-49875078

An estimated half of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are going unidentified, the country's new Ebola response coordinator, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, has told reporters.

"If we continue on that basis, this epidemic could last 2 or 3 years," Muyembe said at a Friday [2 Aug 2019] news conference in Goma, a city located on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda. He added that the current goal is to bring the detection rate to 80% by strengthening surveillance.

The remarks came a day after Congolese authorities raced to contain the Ebola epidemic after a gold miner with a large family contaminated several people in Goma before dying of the hemorrhagic fever. Muyembe said the man's wife and one-year-old daughter had tested positive for the disease but were doing well in treatment.

This was the 4th case confirmed in Goma, a city more than 350 km [218 mi] south of where the outbreak was 1st detected. Health experts fear that an accelerated number of cases in Goma could lead to an outbreak of the disease in neighboring Rwanda

[2] Summary
- Fri 2 Aug 2019. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease outbreak news, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-august-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks, with an average of 85 cases per week (range 79-91 cases per week) in the past 6 weeks (Figure 1). There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

On 30 Jul [2019], a confirmed EVD case was reported in Nyiragongo Health Zone on the outskirts of Goma city. The case worked as a miner in Ituri province and travelled down through several outbreak hotspots, where he likely acquired the disease. Currently, there is no indication that the case had links to the to the 1st case identified in Goma on 14 Jul [2019] (see the 18 Jul 2019 Disease Outbreak News).

In the 21 days from 11-31 Jul 2019, 71 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 260 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (52%, n=135) and Mandima (16%, n=41). Most (68%, n=28) of the cases reported in Mandima Health Zone came from Some Health Area, which has in turn seeded cases to the nearby city of Mambasa in recent weeks. The response in Some Health Area was challenging for several weeks due to tension between local communities and Ebola response teams. However, the situation has improved following dialogues with community leaders to understand the community's perspective and to define common ground for collaboration. Biena Health Zone recently cleared 21 days since their last reported case. However, hotspots continue to be the source of cases in other areas through the movement of suspected and confirmed cases and their contacts, and high risks remain for the virus to be reintroduced to these areas, requiring teams to remain fully resourced and vigilant.

As of 31 Jul 2019, a total of 2713 EVD cases were reported, including 2619 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1823 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1527) were female, and 29% (773) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to increase among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 149 (5% of all confirmed and probable cases). 1 Aug 2019 marked one year since the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the Ebola outbreak. UN partners reaffirmed our collective commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and called for solidarity to end the outbreak.

- Fri 2 Aug 2019. Ebola reports show more health workers infected
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/ebola-reports-show-more-health-workers-infected
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Yesterday [Thu 1 Aug 2019] the Democratic of the Congo (DRC) resumed publishing daily reports on the country's ongoing Ebola outbreak, adding more details about the response in Goma and noting that 149 health workers have now been infected with the deadly virus.

The disruption in daily reports came as the Ebola outbreak response leadership shifted from former minister of health, Oly Ilunga, MD, to a technical group appointed by the president's office. As before, the daily reports are published under the banner of the DRC's health ministry.
Steady stream of health-worker infections continues

The 149 infections in the latest report is 9 more health workers than the 140 reported on 23 Jul [2019], the last date of daily updates until they resumed on 1 Aug [2019]. The latest healthcare workers include a case in Mambasa (non-vaccinated), Vuhovi (vaccinated), and Beni (vaccinated). Health workers represent 5% of Ebola cases in this outbreak, and 41 have died from their infections.

Today [Fri 2 Aug 2019], the DRC will likely confirm 11 more cases, raising the outbreak total to 2724, according to the online dashboard maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of yesterday [Thu 1 Aug 2019], there were 1823 deaths and 423 suspected cases under investigation.

The daily report issued yesterday [Thu 1 Aug 2019] also said that 151 case contacts have been tracked in Goma, as the city has now seen 4 confirmed cases of Ebola. Of the 151 contacts, 118 have already been vaccinated. In total, 181 389 people have been vaccinated during this outbreak.

Three of the 4 cases are in one family and represent the 1st local transmission of Ebola in Goma, a city of 2 million that borders Rwanda.

Today [Fri 2 Aug 2019] the WHO published its weekly report on the outbreak and said transmission levels remain steady, at about 85 cases per week for the last 6 weeks. In reference to the 4 cases in Goma, the WHO recognized the city's swift response and said secondary cases were to be expected as the man diagnosed earlier this week was "ill and in the community for several days before presenting to a health facility."
The WHO also said that continued "minor" security events throughout the outbreak region show continued community distrust towards response workers.

"While the overall security situation in the last 21 days was generally calm and bore no significant impact on the response operations, it remained unstable and concerning, with repeated sightings and activities of non-state armed groups within the area of operations," the WHO said. "Threats on response personnel and assets continued to be recorded, indicating a possible level of prevailing community reticence by some sectors, groups, or individuals."

Since the outbreak began one year ago, only Merck's unlicensed VSV-ZEBOV has been used in ring vaccination campaigns. But today [Fri 2 Aug 2019], Uganda confirmed it will launch a trial of the Janssen Pharmaceuticals vaccine.

The trial is expected to involve up to 800 people and is supported by Doctors without Borders and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Associated Press reports. The trial will last 2 years and measure the length of vaccine protection.

In July [2019], Uganda saw 3 cross-over cases of Ebola from the DRC but has prevented local transmission.

The Janssen vaccine has shown promise in both animal and human trials.

[3] Response
- Fri 2 Jul 2019. Surveillance system
[Radio Okapi (edited)]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/08/02/actualite/sante/beni-david-gressly-appelle-la-revision-du-systeme-de-surveillance-pour

The UN coordinator for the emergency response to the Ebola outbreak, David Gressly, has called for a review of the surveillance system and the organization of field interventions to stop the epidemic. He proposed this path of solution, Thu 1 Aug 2019, from the rural municipality of Mangina, in the territory of Beni where a mass was celebrated on the occasion of year one of the declaration of the epidemic of Ebola in North Kivu and Ituri. The 1st case of Ebola virus was detected in Mangina on 1 Aug 2018.

"[It takes] the organization of interventions in the field, surveillance everywhere. This is very important if we really want to contain this epidemic. All [surveillance] systems must be reviewed because there are too many cases of Ebola through unknown contacts. It's a bad sign.

With that, we have to find out why we have all these unknown contacts. If we can do that, I think we can quickly stop the epidemic; otherwise it can continue for a long time," Gressly said.

He also thinks that we must stop all interference that slow down the fight against Ebola.

"It was a big problem here in Beni last year with the ADF attacks that were preventing the riposte. Strikes sometimes make interactions, so we must find ways to avoid all these interactions. Whenever there are interactions, the virus multiplies several times," he said.

For Mr Gressly, there are always risk areas for which the monitoring system is not up to par.

"It will allow the virus to enter to multiply without being detected, and it will be a problem, so we must anticipate the virus," he said.

Fri 2 Aug 2019. Uganda launching new experimental Ebola vaccine trial
[The Scientist, edited]
https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/uganda-launching-largest-experimental-ebola-vaccine-trial-66229
[Byline: Nicoletta Lanese]

Researchers in Uganda are set to introduce a 2nd experimental Ebola vaccine to the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus has claimed more than 1800 lives in the past year. The trial, supported by Doctors without Borders and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be the largest yet conducted with this vaccine.

Over the course of the outbreak, about 180 000 people have received an experimental vaccine produced by Merck Pharmaceuticals. Although effective, the vaccine could not overcome impediments to virus containment in the country due to violence and resistance to healthcare interventions from communities that hadn't experienced the disease. The new vaccine, produced by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, has been tested in about 6000 people, mostly African.

"It's one of those vaccines that have shown a lot of promise in animal studies but also in other trials that have been conducted," says Pontiano Kaleebu, a Ugandan researcher leading the trial, in an interview with the Associated Press. The researchers are starting their study following the recent resignation of DRC health minister Oly Ilunga, who opposed introducing a 2nd vaccine in the country.

"I think there's still a risk of this being like the West Africa outbreak," says Ebola researcher Daniel Bausch in an interview with NPR. "Given the limited amount of vaccine that's available and the really concerning epi curves [rise in cases] we've seen over the last few weeks, I think we should be prepared for a long outbreak that will still go on for many months or years."

[Note: Only adults who are not pregnant will be allowed in this clinical trial. Are there experimental animal studies providing evidence the vaccine is not safe for children and pregnant women?

Note that the Merck vaccine "was not made available to pregnant and breastfeeding women due to a lack of evidence about its effects on mothers and infants," despite pregnant women facing mortality rates of up to 93% from Ebola, compared to an average of 50% in the general population.

According to DRC's Ministry of Health, almost 1000 pregnant and breastfeeding women registered as contacts of Ebola patients but could not be vaccinated.

But it still had to get past DRC's National Ethics Committee, which requested modifications to the protocol. Those modifications included that pregnant women in their 1st trimester be excluded from vaccination, according to Professor Steve Ahuka, head of virology at DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research, which helps to develop national vaccination protocol.

The amendments were made and approved by the committee on 2 Jun 2019. The 1st pregnant women finally received the vaccine on 13 Jun 2019, 10 months after the outbreak started.

While data is limited, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said 1/3 of Ebola cases in the current outbreak have been women of reproductive age, that 53 of them reported being pregnant, and an additional 24 were breastfeeding.

Yet pregnant women have never been prioritized in clinical trials, according to research by David Schwartz, a professor of pathology and author of "Pregnant in the Time of Ebola."

"It can be difficult to assure the safety to the mother and developing embryo and fetus of drugs and vaccines, and thus caution has traditionally guided their administration during pregnancy," Schwartz wrote in a paper on the topic.

But public health experts including Schwartz maintain that a risk-benefit analysis in the case of Ebola falls in favor of vaccination.

Sat 3 Aug 2019. Inactivated rabies virus-based Ebola vaccine preserved by vaporization is heat-stable and immunogenic against Ebola and protects against rabies challenge.
[J Infect Dis, edited]
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374568

Citation: Kurup D, et al.: Inactivated Rabies Virus-Based Ebola Vaccine Preserved by Vaporization Is Heat-Stable and Immunogenic Against Ebola and Protects Against Rabies Challenge. J Infect Dis. 2019 Aug 3. pii: jiz332. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiz332. [Epub ahead of print]

Abstract

Background:
Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly lethal member of the Filoviridae family associated with human hemorrhagic disease. Despite being a sporadic disease, it caused a large outbreak in 2014-2016 in West Africa and another outbreak recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Several vaccine candidates are currently in preclinical and clinical studies, but none are stable without cold chain storage.

Methods:
We used preservation by vaporization (PBV), a novel processing technology to heat-stabilize FiloRab1 (inactivated rabies-based Ebola vaccine), a candidate Ebola vaccine, and stored the vials at temperatures ranging from 4-50 deg C [39-122 deg F] for 10 days to 12 months. We immunized Syrian hamsters with the best long-term stable FiloRab1 PBV vaccines and challenged them with rabies virus (RABV).

Results:
Syrian hamsters immunized with FiloRab1 PBV-processed vaccines stored at temperatures of 4 deg C [39 deg F] and 37 deg C [99 deg F] for 6 months, and at 50 deg C [122 deg F] for 2 weeks, seroconverted against both RABV-G and EBOV-GP. Notably, all of the FiloRab1 PBV vaccines proved to be 100% effective in a RABV challenge model.

Conclusions:
We successfully demonstrated that the FiloRab1 PBV vaccines are stable and efficacious for up to 6 months when stored at temperatures ranging from 4-37 deg C [39-99 deg F] and for up to 2 weeks at 50 deg C [122 def F].
