Declaring victory over bird flu disease, Delaware and Maryland officials
said on Friday they will allow poultry industries in their states to resume
transporting and selling live birds.
State officials said the restrictions will be lifted on Mon 13 Apr 2004, a
month after the last finding of avian flu in the mid-Atlantic region.
"Barring any change of events over the weekend, on Monday, I will lift
all of the restrictions in Maryland that have been in place for the past
month," said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Lewis Riley in a statement.
Delaware was the first of 5 states to discover bird flu last winter.
Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas have also reported
cases.
U.S. animal health officials have been successful in containing the
outbreaks with many infected states only reporting one case of the
disease.
"We can take this action because all flocks on the Delmarva Peninsula
destined for market have ... tested negative for avian influenza," said
Delaware's Agriculture Secretary Michael Scuse, referring to the
Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia region. The so-called Delmarva
region in 2003 produced 3.21 billion pounds of broilers, about 10
percent of annual U.S. chicken output.
On Thursday [1 Apr 2004], Texas state officials declared its bird flu
outbreak over. State officials said they were now focusing their efforts
on convincing countries to reopen their borders. About 50 countries
have banned some or all U.S. poultry due to bird flu. The European
Union this week said it would regionalize its ban to cover only poultry
from Texas.
U.S. state officials warned farmers to continue to closely monitor their
chickens for signs of illness. "While Monday may signal a sense of
normalcy, we should not let down our guard," Riley said.
