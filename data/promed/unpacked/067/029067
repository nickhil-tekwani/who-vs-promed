One man died after being infected with anthrax [_Bacillus anthracis_ and 6
members of his family are believed to have contracted the disease after it
killed dozens of livestock in a Danube Delta village, a health official
said Wednesday.
"So far there is one confirmed death from anthrax, a farmer who ate
contaminated pork," said Marian Avram, chief sanitary - veterinary
inspector of the Tulcea county. Avram said nine people suspected of anthrax
infection had been rushed to hospital in Tulcea, the main Danube Delta port
town, 260 km (160 miles) east of Bucharest.
He said the epidemic was declared 2 weeks ago when the Danube Delta, like
the rest of Romania, was hit by the worst drought in a century.
Local authorities have declared a quarantine in Mahmudia and Murighiol, 2
small downstream ports with a total population of 16 000, and closed access
to the Delta in those areas.
"Containment of the disease would be difficult, as the villagers of
Mahmudia keep some 900 horses and 450 cattle in a half- domesticated
condition on [the Danube reefs, and do not report them to authorities to
avoid taxation," said veterinarian Marian Avram, of Tulcea county health
authorities. Already 70 head of cattle, horses and pigs have died of
anthrax, Avram said.
Veterinary inspectors found that the man who died had slaughtered a pig and
[eaten the meat together with his family, in spite of the ban ordered by
authorities on the consumption of animal products at Mahmudia, about 150
miles northeast of Bucharest. Another man is suspected to have contracted
the disease because he handled the skin of a horse he found dead on the
reefs in the
Danube River delta, Avram said.
In a previous case of anthrax 3 months ago, a hospital in the eastern city
of Buzau treated 6 people who ate an infected lamb. No one died.
Last year, an outbreak of anthrax killed four cattle in northeast Romania.

[Thank you, all. The variation in numbers hospitalized must await
clarification. Drought is not just an absence of rain but also indicative
of high heat-stress, which can affect the immunogenesis of livestock.
Grazing livestock are forced to graze lower lying areas were anthrax spores
may have collected and in grazing acquire soil & spores. Subsequent cases
would come from eating contaminated bloody (salty) soil around dead
animals. Pigs are normally fairly resistant and this animal may well have
become infected by feeding on a carcass or as a result of eating the
intestines of a butchered sick animal.
The best control process is to vaccinate stock promptly and to ensure that
all carcasses, and contaminated soil, is burnt. Burying can result in
long-term contaminated grave sites.
On another but parallel subject it is being claimed that the current series
of anthrax reports are part of some hoax activity in support of a PR
campaign for human vaccination and AVIP. I would point out that ProMED-mail
has been reporting human and animal anthrax from the beginning 5-6 years
ago; secondly, we are in the northern hemisphere "anthrax season -- July to
September -- and therefore outbreak reports are not unusual; thirdly,
thanks in part to ProMED-mail, disease reporting has increased worldwide so
we have more news reports to utilise; fourthly, livestock anthrax is rarely
reported by such sources unless there are human cases - which
epidemiologically puts the cart before the horse -- the working ratios are
ten to twenty cattle deaths for each human cutaneous case, 200 human
cutaneous cases per reported gastroenteric case, and in Africa about 64
infected animals are butchered, cooked and eaten for each outbreak of
gastroenteric anthrax with the better the cook, the greater the risk of
disease. And lastly that the Chinese, Japanese, and Russian news agencies
should be in some cabal with AVIP boggles the mind. This particular thread
is cut. Discussion on it will not be entertained. - MHJ
