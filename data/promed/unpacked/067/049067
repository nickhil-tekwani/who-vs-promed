The Western NSW [New South Wales] Local Health District (WNSWLHD) has issued a reminder about the effects of Q fever on farmers, and the importance of getting vaccinated. WNSWLHD Manager of Communicable Diseases and Immunisation, Ms. Susan Turcato, is strongly urging farmers and people who work with livestock to get vaccinated against Q fever to guard against being unable to work due to prolonged illness.

"Q fever is a bacterial infection carried by animals - such as cows, sheep and goats - and can lead to chronic lethargy that may last for several months," says Ms. Turcato.

There have been 51 confirmed cases of Q Fever reported in the WNSWLHD so far in 2020.

A single dose vaccine is recommended for people who work in high-risk occupations, as well as for people aged 15 years and over who could be exposed to Q fever. "The risk of ongoing health issues, such as chronic fatigue, can really hit individuals and families hard and affect their ability to work. With all the pressure on farmers and livestock handlers with the recent drought and the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing we want is for them to be needlessly drained of energy for months on end after being struck down by Q fever," says Ms. Turcato.

People become infected when they breathe in dust particles contaminated by infected animal secretions, which can lead to high fevers and chills, sweating, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and extreme fatigue. Ms. Turcato urged anyone who might be at risk to consult a GP who can screen for Q fever and vaccinate them, if needed. "We want people to proactively talk to their doctor about Q fever."

Ms. Turcato said many of the behaviours adopted during COVID-19 can help keep people safe. "Vigilant hand washing, protective masks, protective clothing and removing clothes worn for chores outside before entering the family home are behaviours to be reinforced because they can protect those who cannot be vaccinated."

The NSW Government is investing around AUD1 million between 2018 and 2022 to help protect farmers and other people in rural areas who work with animals from Q fever. For more information on Q fever, click here [https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/diseases/Pages/qfever.aspx].

[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may develop chronic infection, including endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), chronic hepatitis, chronic vascular infections (especially in patients with vascular grafts or arterial aneurysms), osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and chronic pulmonary infections. Chronic Q fever is rare, occurring in less than 5% of persons with acute infection, occurring within a few months to decades after the initial symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage and chronic infection. Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

In Australia, people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms. Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).

Acute Q fever is treated with doxycycline in non-pregnant people for 2-3 weeks. Because early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). People who have chronic Q fever usually must take a combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for endocarditis or vascular infection for at least 18 months.

Western New South Wales Local Health District covers around 250 000 square km, with a population of 270 775 residents (2011), 11.1% of which identify as being of Aboriginal or Torres Islander descent (https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/lhd/pages/wnswlhd.aspx).
