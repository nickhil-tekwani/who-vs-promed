Fusarium: range of species on maize more diverse than expected
--------------------------------------------------------------
Fusarium fungi lead to reduced yield and contamination of grain crops
with mycotoxins causing serious losses. Particularly affected is
maize. The plants can be contaminated with several harmful substances,
which are not degraded during silage. In addition, some species of
_Fusarium_ remaining in the field in maize residue can infect grain
crops in the following year.

Scientists from the Swiss Agroscope Reckenholz-Taenikon Research
Station (ART) set out to identify measures to reduce _Fusarium_
infections and the production of mycotoxins in maize. The species
range on stems and seeds of the main maize varieties in northern,
western, and southern Switzerland was investigated. On one of the
sites the contents of the toxins deoxynivalenol (DON), zerealenone
(ZON), and fumonisins (FUM) was also measured.

It was found that the range of _Fusarium_ species on maize is much
more diverse than on wheat. In total 16 different species were
recorded, with 3 to 5 species being predominant depending on location
and part of the plant. As with wheat, species composition and toxin
contamination were also dependent on the weather during the growing
season. With the limited data available, it is not yet possible to
make a definitive statement about varietal susceptibility and
effective measures against the fungal infections.

[Several species of fungi originally classified in the genus
_Fusarium_ are causing a number of head blight, stalk rot, seedling
root rot, and ear and stalk rot diseases in grain crops such as maize,
wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Pathogens affecting these hosts may be
different phylogenetic species or strains, which are often limited to
particular regions of the world. While some of the pathogens have now
been re-classified into different genera (for example _Gibberella_),
the common names of the associated diseases have mostly retained the
term 'fusarium.'

These fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues. During
moist weather, spores of the fungi are windblown or splashed onto the
heads of cereal crops. Stress conditions and lesions caused by other
fungi or insects are known to increase susceptibility of host plants
to fusarium diseases. Disease management generally includes timely
fungicide applications and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.

Fusarium diseases can cause yield losses of up to 45 percent in small
grain crops and also reduce the grade of harvested grain. They may
also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins, which can seriously
affect livestock. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected
because of toxin levels. For any given host species, only certain
fungal strains produce toxins. In maize, several fusarium fungi may be
responsible for ear rots and mycotoxin production. The survey reported
above provides important information on the epidemiology of fusarium
diseases.
