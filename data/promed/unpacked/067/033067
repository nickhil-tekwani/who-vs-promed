An elk herd near the Battlefords [Saskatchewan] is under quarantine
due to an outbreak of chronic wasting disease [CWD].

Dr Alex McIsaac, a disease control specialist with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency [CFIA], says an investigation is underway to
determine which animals came in contact with the infected elk. "Which
animals on this farm were in contact? We identify them. Then we sit
down with the producer and talk about compensation for the animals
that will have to be destroyed," McIsaac said.

McIsaac says the "large" herd is likely more than 200 animals strong.
He doesn't know an exact number because the herd is "kept in a more
natural setting" and many of the animals are still in the trees and bushes.

The case of chronic wasting disease was confirmed on [16 Apr 2010].
Results of the investigation are expected to be known in 2 to 3 weeks.
