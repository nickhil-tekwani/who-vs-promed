A _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to horse meat from Romania sickened 25 people in France in the past year, according to a new report. Eleven cases were men and 14 were women. They ranged from 2 to 90 years of age, and the median age was 68 years old.

In September 2019, the regional unit of Sante Publique France in the Hauts-de-France region was alerted to a spike in _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans notifications in Nord and Pas-de-Calais during the first 2 weeks of August 2019, found by the National Reference Center for _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _Shigella_ at Institut Pasteur. The 25 salmonellosis cases, belonging to the same genomic cluster, were identified from 4-26 Aug 2019. Nine people needed hospital treatment, and 2 had severe complications but none died.

A total of 20 people were interviewed. Results of a food survey revealed consumption of chilled raw or undercooked minced (ground) horse meat by 18 of 20 cases questioned in the days before onset of symptoms. No other food was eaten by all those interviewed. Of the 2 people who did not eat horse meat, one person was infected with a strain having genetic characteristics slightly different from the other cases and the other was sick after eating a Bolognese pizza in a restaurant.

Consumption of horse meat has decreased significantly in France in recent decades, but most of those who eat it live in Hauts-de-France. Horse meat is mainly imported from Italy, Romania, Poland, the USA or South America despite some domestic production.

Symptoms lasted for 2 to 21 days with a mean duration of 10 days, and the mean length of hospital stay was 8 days, ranging from 3 to 21 days.

The investigation identified a common Belgian wholesaler, supplied by a slaughterhouse and a meat-cutting workshop in Romania. Batches of implicated horse meat were also distributed to Austria, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and Viet Nam. At the European level, none of the 14 countries that replied to the French alert about the increase in _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans cases observed any recent increase in infections belonging to the same genomic cluster as the French cases.

The fact that most purchases were made in markets made it easier to identify the buying dates and time of consumption. Four distributors obtained carcasses or pieces of horse meat from the same wholesaler of fresh meat in Belgium.

Dates of purchases cited by those sick and analysis of purchase orders and invoices provided by the distributors made it possible to link the dates of purchase to the raw materials used and with several batches of horse meat from a slaughterhouse and cutting workshop in Romania.

Controls were carried out in the places of purchase or vehicles cited by those ill, and analyses were done on equipment and pieces of meat available at the time of inspections but different from batches sold during the outbreak. _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans was not found in the meat tested. It was not possible to confirm the hypotheses by finding strains of _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans in meat consumed by cases due to the absence of leftovers from implicated lots. The exact origin of the contamination of the meat suspected of causing the outbreak has not been found.

The outbreak was the 4th due to consumption of horse meat documented in recent years. The others in 2003, 2006 and 2010 involved _Salmonella_ Newport, _Salmonella_ Meleagridis and _Salmonella_ Typhimurium.

In 2018, a _Salmonella_ Enteritidis outbreak in France was suspected to be caused by chilled horse meat from Belgium, processed in Romania, with raw material from Hungary. Austria, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland were also part of this alert.

In France, _Salmonella_ Bovismorbificans is rarely isolated from humans with fewer than 50 cases identified, respectively, in 2016 and 2017.

Officials said prevention of foodborne infections requires a change in risky eating habits. It involves informing vulnerable people about the risks of consuming raw or undercooked ground meat in which contamination will not be destroyed if there is insufficient cooking.

[Although not an often thought of source of salmonellosis, equines can certainly be on the menu of zoonoses for this pathogen as shown by the following report:

Jay-Russell MT, Madigan JE, Bengson Y, et al: _Salmonella_ Oranienburg isolated from horses, wild turkeys and an edible home garden fertilized with raw horse manure. Zoonoses Public Health. 2014; 61:64-71. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/zph.12043

Abstract
--------
In July 2010, a horse from a rural farm (Farm A) in coastal Northern California was diagnosed with _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infection following referral to a veterinary hospital for colic surgery. Environmental sampling to identify potential sources and persistence of _Salmonella_ on the farm was conducted from August 2010 to March 2011. _Salmonella_ was cultured using standard enrichment and selective plating. Pure colonies were confirmed by biochemical analysis, serotyped and compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. A total of 204 clinical and environmental samples at Farm A were analyzed, and _Salmonella_ spp. were isolated from 6 of 8 (75%) horses, an asymptomatic pet dog, 2 of 7 (28.6%) water samples from horse troughs, 9 of 20 (45%) manure storage pile composites, 16 of 71 (22.5%) wild turkey feces and 4 of 39 (10.3%) soil samples from the family's edible home garden. Well water and garden vegetable samples and horse fecal samples from a neighboring ranch were negative. _S._ Oranienburg with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the horse clinical strain was found in all positive sample types on Farm A. The investigation illustrates the potential for widespread dissemination of _Salmonella_ in a farm environment following equine infections. We speculate that a recent surge in the wild turkey population on the property could have introduced _S._ Oranienburg into the herd, although we cannot rule out the possibility wild turkeys were exposed on the farm or to other potential sources of _Salmonella_. Findings from the investigation indicated that raw horse manure applied as fertilizer was the most likely source of garden soil contamination. Viable _S._ Oranienburg persisted in garden soil for an estimated 210 days, which exceeds the 120-day standard between application and harvest currently required by the National Organic Program. The study underscores the need to educate the public about potential food safety hazards associated with using raw animal manure to fertilize edible home gardens.
