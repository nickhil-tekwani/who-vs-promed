The number of cases of presumed salmonella infections has now tripled, as more than 60 people have been identified with gastrointestinal illness in connection with Supermercado Los Corrales grocery store, according to the Kenosha County Division of Health.

Salmonella, with a matching DNA fingerprint, has been found in 2 cases, with testing ongoing. While the source of the outbreak is still under investigation, the grocery store is the focus of the probe."We're investigating, so we are really trying to give the state the most accurate numbers, but it is still so fluid at this point," said Gwynn Perry-Brye, clinical services director for the Kenosha County Division of Health.

One Kenosha resident said her son-in-law and 3 year old grandson started getting stomach problems on 11 May 2015 after buying pre-cooked carnitas and rice at the store on Mother's Day. The rest of the family didn't have any of the suspected pork. "They eventually went to the emergency room," she said. "My daughter was taking care of both of them and kept her 2 older girls away." The family's leftover food and stool samples were taken for testing.

The meat and food preparation area of Supermercado Los Corrales is temporarily closed while the investigation is ongoing, but the remainder of the establishment is open and unaffected by the investigation.
