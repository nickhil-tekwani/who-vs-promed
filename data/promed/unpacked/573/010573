In Heilbronn District, in northern Baden-Württemberg, Germany, it is reported that 5 men and women have contracted legionnaires' disease and 2 have died. The patients came from Obersulm, Ellhofen, Weinsberg, and Löwenstein, health officials announced. Most of them are middle-aged and older men. The 2 deceased men had a previous illness and were 49 and 81 years old.

Health authorities are feverishly looking for the source of the contamination.

Experts from the Heilbronn health department are not assuming that contaminated drinking water is the cause of the infections. The sick lived in different places, there are several water suppliers. "The surrounding sewage treatment plants were also sampled," said a spokeswoman for the dpa [Deutsche Presse-Agentur] office. "We assume that the cause can be found in an evaporative cooling system." The health department fears that there may be more cases.

[The 5 patients with legionnaires' disease live in 4 different small towns (Weinsberg, Ellhofen, Obersulm, and Lowenstein) in the Heilbronn District, along a route southeast of the city of Heilbronn in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. Lowenstein is the furthest (about 25km/15.5 mi) from Heilbronn. A map showing the location of these towns can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Heilbronn,+Germany/.

At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or an outbreak with a common source. The investigation into finding a common source for these 5 people is proceeding, but genotyping the clinical isolates would help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation of the 5 cases.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of _Legionella_ bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249). - Mod.ML
