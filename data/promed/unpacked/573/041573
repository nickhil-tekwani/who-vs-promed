The General Hospital in Tijuana was in a state of alert after an outbreak
was reported by the gynecology-obstetrics ward. Military personnel took
control of the situation and stated that at least 7 children had died. This
is denied by the health authorities.
The subdirector of the hospital, Jaime Fernandez, confirmed that one baby
had died and 5 more were isolated due to infection... The bacterium,
_Enterobacter cloacae_, was the causative agent.
The authorities became aware of the outbreak on Friday, 20 Aug 1998. The
4th floor of the building has been disinfected and officials believe that
the bacteria will not spread any further and there is no risk to the public.

[_Enterobacter cloacae_ is found among normal flora of the human intestinal
tract, in soil, dairy products and water. It is an opportunist that causes
urinary tract infections, nosocomial infections of compromised patients,
and has distinguished itself as responsible for large-scale outbreaks of
septicemia caused by contaminated intravenous devices. A puzzling aspect
of the outbreak reported above is the role of the military in the response.
I wouldn't think that uniformed personnel with automatic rifles would
accomplish much in the way of infection control. - Mod.ES]
