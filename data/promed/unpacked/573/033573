Brazil: 2nd Foot-and-Mouth Outbreak Updated
-------------------------------------------
SAO PAULO, Brazil Â­ On Thursday authorities in Brazil confirmed a second
outbreak of the highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.
The confirmation came one day after the government began vaccinating the
state's entire herd of 13 million to cattle prevent the disease from
spreading.
Rio Grande do Sul's agriculture secretary, Jose Hermetto Hoffmann, said the
disease was detected in 7 animals at a ranch in Alegrete, 715 miles
southwest of Sao Paulo. The ranch is just 90 miles from Santana do
Livramento, where 11 cows with the virus were discovered over the weekend.
Because of the outbreak and vaccination campaign, Chile, Israel, Saudi
Arabia, and Britain have stopped importing beef from Rio Grande do Sul,
Moraes said. The state accounts for almost 10 percent of Brazil's herd of
160 million head of cattle, one of the world's largest. The state is
responsible for about 8 percent of the country's beef exports. In 2000, the
country exported 340 000 tons of beef.
