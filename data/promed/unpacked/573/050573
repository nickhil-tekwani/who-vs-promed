Some significant portion of these diarrheas will be due to people
trying to conserve water by not washing their hands, re-using
unwashed plates and utensils, not flushing toilets, possibly even
using toilet tank water for food preparation. People in high-rise
apartments live above the siphon line and would lose their running
water even if, as in Toronto, there was a gravity-feed reserve in an
elevated reservoir. In New York, the number of people above the
siphon line must be significant.
There was also an increase in moderate-risk behaviour such as:
swimming at beaches posted for high-coliform contamination because of
the closure of municipal pools during the blackout; congregating at
bistros whose refrigeration and sanitation was compromised by the
power failure; consumption of food bought at deep discount from
stores whose refrigeration had failed.
I haven't seen the statistics from Toronto hospitals. Anecdotes
indicate a higher-than-normal incidence of gastrointestinal diseases
in the commuter population.
Technology induces a complacency towards the harsher aspects of
nature, a complacency that is difficult to shake when environmental
conditions dramatically change.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Baker for his thoughtful comments. The lack of
electricity can wreak havoc on a variety of fronts outside the
enteric one. As one example, an orthopedist colleague of mine told
me that he admitted an unfortunate woman who thought she was lighting
a candle during the blackout only to discover that she had lit an
M-80 (a large piece of explosive fireworks) instead, blowing off part
of her hand. - Mod.LL]
