Nine human deaths from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJDnv), an
incurable illness that causes holes in the brain, were confirmed during the
last 3 months of 1998, according to a report in _The Lancet_, a British
medical journal. Previously there had been no more than 5 deaths in any
three-month period.
The CJDnv has been linked to a disease in cattle known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. An epidemic of the cattle disease
led the European Union to impose a global ban on the export of British
beef, but most of those restrictions were lifted last year.
The report from the National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit,
based in Edinburgh, Scotland, said the number of deaths during the quarter
in 1998 was unusual, but it was unclear whether the increase was due to
chance or would continue.
Since 1995 when the human form BSE was first recognized, 39 Britons have
died from the disease. The Department of Health reported 15 people died of
CJDnv in 1998, compared with 10 in each of the previous two years. One
death was confirmed in January this year.
>From the beginning of 1995 through September 1998, the number of deaths
reported each quarter year stayed relatively constant, said Dr. Simon
Cousens, a scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
who is helping track the disease. Dr. Cousens stated it is possible doctors
have simply gotten better at diagnosing CJDnv. The increase could also be a
statistical fluke.
Two years ago, British scientists projected as few as 75 and as many as
80,000 deaths in 20 years from CJDnv, depending on the incubation period
and how the infection is passed from animals to humans. Neither has been
determined.
The epidemic in animals began in 1986 when the brain disease BSE began
killing cattle in Britain. Infected animals developed spongy areas in their
brains, suffered personality changes began staggering in circles -- hence
the term, mad cow disease. By the beginning of this year, 173,718 cows had
been diagnosed with the disease while more than four million animals had
been destroyed in an effort to eliminate the infection.
Initially Government officials assured the public that people could not get
the disease from eating infected cattle. But when young people began to
develop CJD -- a disease almost exclusively found in people over age 50 --
scientists began to worry.
Two years ago researchers demonstated the brains of infected cows and the
brains of _young_ people dying from CJD have identical characteristics. The
human form of BSE was then named CJDnv. Older victims develop a form called
spontaneous CJD.
Last year, Dr. John Collinge, a leading CJD expert at Imperial College in
London, discovered that the tonsils of CJDnv victims carry an infectious
particle, called a prion, that seems to be responsible for the disease.
The infectious prions are found throughout nervous and lymphatic tissue,
including tonsils, and may incubate for years before causing overt signs of
disease. Thus medical facilities throughout Britain are now testing for
infectious prions in tissue samples saved from thousands of tonsillectomies
in the last decade.
It is another method to gauge the spread of mad cow disease in humans. In a
separate finding, Dr. Collinge and his colleagues reported today in the
journal _Science_ that they can observe normal prions turning into abnormal
or infectious prions in a test tube, which he said in a telephone interview
may eventually help scientists block the accumulation of abnormal prions in
the brain.

[Since there are tests that can be performed prior to the patients death,
why are the patients that have been diagnosed as being "prion positive" not
being counted in the statistics? Why are the statistics only updated after
the patient has died? - Mod.TG
