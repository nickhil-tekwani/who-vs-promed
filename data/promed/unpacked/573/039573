WHO to investigate hepatitis vaccine deaths in Viet Nam
-------------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has suspended the use of a hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by
global leader LG group (the Republic of Korea), after 3 newborn babies
suddenly died following administration of the vaccine. The Health Ministry
has immediately halted the use of the vaccine nationwide while they
ascertain the causes of the infants' deaths. Since the vaccine is
distributed through the World Health Organization (WHO) channels, the
agency is embarrassed and says it will investigate the deaths.
Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver.
The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong
infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure,
and death.
Hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent hepatitis B
virus infection. Dr Do Si Hien, chairman of Viet Nam's National Vaccination
Programme, said that between 23 Apr and 7 May [2007], a total of 4 infants
went into shock after being given the vaccine. According to statistics,
usually only one case of hepatitis B vaccine shock is found for every one
million people vaccinated against the disease, he added.
According to Hien, children under 12 months of age have been vaccinated
against hepatitis B under the national vaccination programme since 1997,
with the programme expanding to all regions of the country by 2003. With
close to 1.5 million children being vaccinated annually, hepatitis B
vaccine has been used on millions of Vietnamese children to date. Hien
urged parents to remain calm, saying that these were extremely unusual
cases that related to only 2 batches of Hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by LG.
WHO said it supports, as a precautionary measure, the nationwide temporary
suspension of the drug produced by South Korea's LG Life Sciences and
distributed in Viet Nam through a UN [United Nations] system. The global
health body has also "recommended the temporary [suspension of
distribution] and use of specific lots of the Euvax B vaccine produced by
LG because of these recent reports," said WHO spokesperson Dida Connor.
Drugs from the same lots had been shipped to 24 countries, but no other
adverse reactions had been reported to date from any of them, she said. WHO
will send a team of international experts to Viet Nam as early as this week
[14-18 May 2007] to investigate the cases, said Connor. "WHO, UNICEF and
the government are taking this very seriously," she said. "We're making all
efforts to ensure a full, prompt investigation. "This doesn't mean that we
have any information that is conclusive about the potential cause of this
at this stage. WHO will send out further advice pending the outcome of this
investigation." Connor said the LG vaccine had been used for some years and
that WHO had received no reports of deaths or serious reactions from any
other countries.

[Hepatitis B vaccine is an inherently safe vaccine for both children and
aduls. (For instance, in China the aim is to administer hepatitis B vaccine
to all infants within 24 hours of birth). Only rarely is there any serious
allergic reaction to hepatitis B vaccine. The recombinant vaccines that are
licensed for use in the United States and elsewhere are synthesized by
_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (common bakers' yeast), into which a plasmid
containing the gene for HBsAg has been inserted. Purified HBsAg is obtained
by lysing the yeast cells and separating HBsAg from the yeast components by
biochemical and biophysical techniques. Persons allergic to yeast should
not be vaccinated with vaccines derived by this methodology.
The fatal incidents in Viet Nam are more likely to be attributable to
defective individual vaccine vials rather than a systematic deficiency of
an entire vaccine batch. The outcome of the investigation of this incident
is awaited with much interest. - Mod.CP]
