[Delayed reporting permits a country to avoid being placed on the list of
infected areas, since if more than 2 incubation periods for the disease
have elapsed since the last report, it is no longer considered infected.
This practice is not helpful to global public health. Countries would
perform a service by notifying promptly, as required by the WHO
International Health Regulations, and also by reporting the name of the
country or countries from which their cases were imported - Mod.JW]
