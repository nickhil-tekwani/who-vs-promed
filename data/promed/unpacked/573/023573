Red Tide Toxin Levels Reach Record Levels In Maine
-------------------------------
Toxin levels in some shellfish tested in Maine have reached record highs,
as the red tide maintains its grip.
The red tide outbreak is also reaching into waters where it has never
appeared before.
Marine experts say a number of gulls and ducks have been dying along the
Maine coast -- possibly from eating tainted clams and mussels.
The worst red tide in decades struck New England from Maine to Cape Cod
this month after a series of nor'easters in May drove the algae toward
shore from offshore waters.
Darcie Couture with the Maine Department of Marine Resources says the cold
and damp weather over the past several days favors the continued growth of
the algae bloom.
Earlier this week, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney announced that
shellfishermen would be eligible for low-interest loans through the Small
Business Administration.
