To expand on my comment in the previous post:
Anthrax is not a disease that occurs all over India, but largely in certain
regions where it occurs hyperendemically. Therefore the most cost effective
response is a proactive vaccination programme, not a fire-engine reactive
policy, especially as this is a very cheap vaccine. They are ignoring this
disease in the severely affected areas for whatever local reasons and poverty
is not their major problem -- marginal farmers will in fact pay for such
programmes, if they are efficient. The reason I keep hitting on this subject
again and again and again is because we have a global readership and it has
to be emphasized to all, not just those in India, that reactive programmes
are very expensive.

"Treated in time" means with antibiotics. Ruminants respond very well to
antibiotics and especially long-acting doses. One can literally pull moribund
cows back from the grave.
