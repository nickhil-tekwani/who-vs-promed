H5N1 bird flu found in dead wild bird in Germany
-----------------------------------------------------
The Thuringian health ministry said a black-necked grebe found dead
in Kelbra near Erfurt was infected with the H5N1 strain of aviation
influenza, which is potentially lethal to humans.
A 3 km [1.86 miles] security cordon has been installed around the
site where the bird was found. Poultry must remain confined within
that area and cats and dogs must be kept on leashes.
This brings the number of dead wild birds found to be carrying the
virus in Germany to 13 since last week [24-30 Jun 2007].

France suspects H5N1 bird flu virus in swans
--------------------------------------------
A total of 3 swans found dead in eastern France may have been killed
by the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, the French Agriculture Ministry
said on Tuesday [3 Jul 2007].
"The 1st results show a suspicion of bird flu. These tests are in the
process of being confirmed at the reference laboratory of the French
food safety agency AFSSA (...) to determine whether it was the highly
pathogenic H5N1 strain," the ministry said in a statement. It had
already put protection measures in place in the surrounding area and
the results of the tests were expected by Thursday [5 Jul 2007], it
said.
France, Europe's biggest poultry producer, had increased its
precautions against bird flu in June [2007], saying the risk of the
disease hitting the country had gone up after it was found in a
number of wild birds in Germany. The disease was also found in the
Czech Republic last month [June 2007].
Last year [2006], some 13 European Union member states had confirmed
cases of bird flu: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Britain,
the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, France and
Hungary.
In France the virus was found in more than 60 wild birds and at a
farm with 11 000 turkeys. It had not been detected in the country
since April 2006.
More than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year, in
most cases involving wild birds such as swans.
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed nearly 200 people out of over 300
known cases, according to the World Health Organisation. None of the
victims were from Europe.

[If the suspected swans (species?!) in France are confirmed as
H5N1-infected, it will be interesting to obtain sequence data of the
isolates (and the one from the German black-necked grebe; confirmed?)
and compare them to the recent findings in wild birds in Germany and
the Czech Republic. The 2 isolates obtained from infected mute swans
from Nuremberg and Frohburg, Germany, and an isolate from an infected
turkey farm in the Czech Republic, have been found, during the week
of 24-30 Jun 2007, to be closely related by the reference labs in
Germany and Britain (see details in 20070701.2104).
(In posting 20070629.2090, item 1 included a report of the German
news agency DPA, citing the spokesperson for the Friedrich Loeffler
animal health institute (FLI) as saying: "an analysis of the viral
DNA showed a 99.2 percent match between the Czech outbreak and the
virus in dead swans in the German city of Nuremberg. Both samples
were also very similar to viral DNA collected in Kuwait and sequenced
in Weybridge, Britain." The said statement was also included in the
commentary to posting 20070701.2104. We are grateful to Barbara
Spraktes-Wilkins (Pandemic Influenza Coordinator, Ventura County
Public Health, Oxnard, CA) for rightly reminding that influenza
viruses are RNA viruses. Possibly, the German statement referred to
the cDNA, for the sequencing process, by RNA reverse-transcribing).
A map, showing the European regions found infected by H5N1 in wild
birds from 1 Jan to 28 Jun 2007, is available at:
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_maps_wb_2007.jpg>.
The map does not include (yet) the mute swan found H5N1-infected in
South Moravia (the Czech Republic), as officially reported to the OIE
on 29 Jun 2007. - Mod.AS].
