A naturally occurring marine toxin is suspected in the deaths of more
than 20 dolphins having washed ashore in Southern California since
late February 2002.
Scientists collected the carcasses of 3 common dolphins from Southern
California beaches, bringing to 22 the number of the marine mammals
found dead or dying in Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties.
"Whatever is getting them is not taking weeks; it's taking days or
hours," said John Heyning, deputy director of research and
collections, and curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum of
Los Angeles County.
The stranding is the largest in Southern California since 1994, when
more than 70 dolphins washed ashore during a 3-month period, said Joe
Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Long Beach. The cause of those deaths was never determined.
This time, scientists suspect a toxin called domoic acid may be the
culprit. The potent toxin has never been identified as being deadly to
dolphins, although it has been implicated in the deaths of other
marine mammals, including humpback and blue whales. In 1998, it killed
more than 400 sea lions off the California coast.
Domoic acid is produced by naturally occurring blooms of single-celled
organisms of the genus _Pseudonitzschia_. The toxin is concentrated in
filter-feeding animals, such as anchovies and sardines, which are in
turn eaten by dolphins and other mammals.
Also, the toxin causes a human illness, amnesic shellfish poisoning,
which can be deadly. On Friday, several of the dead dolphins were
taken by truck to a warehouse south of downtown Los Angeles, where
scientists were to perform necropsies to determine how the animals
died. Tissue samples were to be sent to a laboratory for further
analysis to determine whether domoic acid is the cause.
