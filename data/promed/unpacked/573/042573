Mystery bacteria found in NZ linked to potato disease in US
-----------------------------------------------------------
A plant disease scare in tomatoes, which triggered biosecurity bans
on New Zealand potatoes, tomatoes, and capsicums, has now been linked
to a disease in American potato crops. And the potato disease, known
as "zebra chip," has now been discovered in an Auckland spud crop,
NZPA (New Zealand Press Association) has been told.

The disease-causing bacterium disrupted New Zealand exports last
month [June 2008] when agriculture authorities revealed its discovery
in 3 Auckland commercial hothouses in January [2008]. The
announcement by NZ scientists that it was a previously unrecorded
species of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter spooked some key export
customers, as it is related to huanglongbing disease -- also known as
citrus greening.

But now the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has told
growers that DNA tests developed in New Zealand show that the
bacterium is in Texan potato crops, and is probably the cause of
"zebra chip" disease which has been hitting American crops for years.
"The Liberibacter detected in the USA is the same species as that
detected in NZ," a MAF spokeswoman told NZPA.

Zebra chip converts part of the starch in a potato to soluble sugar,
and when the potato is cooked, causes zebra-like stripes and breaks
up the chip. Spread by potato psyllids -- scientifically known as
_Bactericera cockerelli_ -- the disease is thought to have been
introduced to the US 15 years ago from Central America. The insect
also turned up in New Zealand -- found in an Auckland greenhouse in
2006 -- and has since dispersed as far south as Nelson. Zebra chip is
a serious problem in regions such as Texas, particularly on varieties
used for manufacture of french fries.

MAF said it had provided American researchers with genetic markers
for the bacteria and 2 laboratories detected it in Texas in potatoes
showing zebra chip symptoms. The US has not reported the bacteria
causing problems in tomatoes. The identification means that trade
officials re-negotiating access for NZ fruit and vegetables to
overseas markets are no longer dealing with an unknown disease --
they have been able to tell customer countries that the bacteria is
probably the cause of zebra chip.

MAF said that after the announcement that the mystery bacterium was
likely being spread by potato psyllids, it was first told of zebra
chip symptoms in domestic potato crops. Symptoms resembling zebra
chip showed up in potatoes harvested from a breeding trial in South
Auckland in May [2008]. "These potato tubers tested positive for
Liberibacter and was our 1st report of such in potatoes in NZ," the
MAF spokeswoman said. American experts said that controlling the
potato psyllids and planting seed potatoes certified free of zebra
chip can reduce the spread.

[This is a very exciting discovery linking 2 unsolved disease problems.

The new species of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter has been found to affect
growth, quality, and yield of tomato and capsicum crops in New
Zealand. Symptoms have been detected in both leaves and fruit and may
vary across varieties and growing conditions. The tomato (or potato)
psyllid _Paratrioza (Bactericera) cockerelli_ was suspected to be a
vector of the new Liberibacter species in NZ.

Zebra chip (ZC) has been both economically and scientifically
important in the US. A stolbur-like phytoplasma was reported as the
primary cause of ZC in some areas, but to have only a minor role in
others. Generally, symptoms are not a reliable means of diagnosis of
plant pathogens. Similar diseases can be caused by different
organisms; there may be co-infections or disease syndromes involving
additional factors. ZC was suspected to have the potential of being
linked to a new pathogen, and it has now been shown that the new
Liberibacter can be associated with ZC symptoms.

The occurrence of this new pathogen in 2 such distinct areas would
suggest that it may be present in other regions of the world as well.
Its discovery is particularly significant because only a few members
of _Ca._ Liberibacter have been characterised so far. The genus
includes the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB),
which is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops in
different parts of the world. HLB is transmitted by citrus psyllids,
which feed only on citrus species. In contrast, tomato psyllids have
a rather wide host range including species in 20 plant families, and
this can be expected to impact on the epidemiology and importance of
the new pathogen.
