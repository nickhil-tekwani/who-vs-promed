The Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Berks County said Friday [8 Apr 2022] a cat impounded in St. Lawrence Borough by ARL's Department of Animal Protection tested positive for rabies. They (ARL) also received another call alerting about a cat showing potential signs of rabies near Jacksonwald Avenue in St. Lawrence. Officers are in the area to contain the cat, ARL said.

The 1st cat with the confirmed case, a black medium-sized short hair female, was captured near Parkview Road after a resident called reporting he was attacked by the cat. "We immediately responded to the resident's call and secured the cat," said Corporal Savannah Baller from the ARL's Department of Animal Protection. "At the moment, we know this cat scratched a resident's leg, who was already notified and received proper treatment. If anyone else was bitten or scratched by an animal in this area, they should seek medical attention immediately."

According to the CDC, rabies is a neurological virus infecting the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death in 99.9% of human cases if left untreated. Although 90% of reported cases of rabies in animals occur in wildlife -- mainly skunks, raccoons, bats, coyotes, and foxes -- the virus can be transmitted to dogs, cats, and cattle that have not received vaccination. [The virus can affect any mammal, more than these listed. - Mod.TG]

"Residents reported the 1st cat was part of a significantly sized cat colony in the area, so we activated our protocols and started trapping the cats to get them examined, neutered and vaccinated immediately to slow and stop the virus from spreading," said Alexis Pagoulatos, ARL's CEO. "St. Lawrence has been proactive by securing a full-service Animal Control contract with us, and all our departments are mobilized and working tirelessly on getting this serious situation under control. Residents will see ARL staff and representatives in the area spreading the news and humanely trapping cats for examination and TNR [trap, neuter, release/return] likely for several weeks as we strategically target this problem."

Common signs of rabies in animals include general sickness, problems swallowing, excessive drool or saliva, an animal who bites at everything, an animal who appears tamer than you would expect, an animal who is having trouble moving or may be paralyzed, or a bat on the ground, according to the CDC.

For humans who have been exposed to rabies, the incubation period could last for weeks to months and may vary based on how far the exposure location is from the brain. Common symptoms of rabies in humans include discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia, according to the CDC.

ARL said residents should be vigilant for other animals in the area possibly exhibiting signs of rabies. They also warned not to leave pets outside unsupervised. "If you suspect an animal is infected with rabies, please immediately call the animal control provider of your municipality or your local police department and do not approach the animal by any means," Baller said.

The ARL will be having a free pet vaccination clinic for the residents of St. Lawrence on 12 Apr 2022 and 21 Apr 2022 from 4 PM to 7 PM at St. Lawrence's Borough Hall. During the event, pets will receive rabies and other protective vaccinations and microchips. This free event is possible thanks to a grant by Petco Love and Tina Saracino's State Farm Agency.

"Currently, TNR (trap-neuter-return) programs are the most effective way of protecting community cat populations and thus protecting the people within our community from rabies exposure," said Dr. Jason Banning, Veterinary Lead at the ARL. "TNR stabilizes colony populations, reducing the chance of a colony member coming into contact with a rabid animal, and, in addition, every cat through the ARL's TNR program also receives a rabies vaccine, which further reduces the risk of contracting rabies when exposed."

Banning said owners should keep their pet's rabies vaccine up to date and keep them away from unknown animals, especially wildlife. If an owner suspects their pet was bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, Banning advised they call animal control or their local police department to capture the animal and seek immediate veterinary care.

[2] Virginia ex Tennessee: anteater, moved to different zoos, 13 human exposures
Date: Thu 14 Apr 2022
Source: Stat News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2022/04/14/anteater-zoo-transfer-rabies-exposure/


The transport of an anteater from one zoo to another (zoo) may have exposed more than a dozen people to rabies, researchers said Thursday [14 Apr 2022], serving as a warning such transfers can expand what are considered "rabies zones."

Thirteen people had to undergo rabies treatment for possible exposure, and no human cases were ultimately reported, according to the report, published Thursday [14 Apr 2022] in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Rabies, which is almost universally fatal if untreated, is sometimes underestimated as a threat, recent research suggests. A CDC report from earlier this year [2022] described the cases of 3 people who died from rabies contracted from bats, all whom could have survived had they sought or accepted post-exposure care.

Available treatments work very well when given early. Typically, 3 people or fewer die from rabies in the United States each year.

The new report, by researchers from the CDC and in Tennessee, describes what happened when a South American collared anteater -- also known as a tamandua -- was moved in May 2021 from a zoo in Virginia to one in Washington County, Tenn.

The month after the anteater arrived in Tennessee, it started showing signs of lethargy and wasn't eating. It kept getting sicker, but veterinarians didn't consider the possibility of rabies in part because it had never previously been identified in the species. The anteater was euthanized on 6 Jul 2021.

It was only 6 weeks later the death investigation found the animal could have died from rabies, which additional tests confirmed. The investigation had not been expedited because rabies had not been suspected.

State health authorities were then notified, and set out to identify people who were possibly exposed, from people who were around the anteater 2 weeks before it started showing signs to those who worked on the necropsy. Ultimately, they recommended treatment for 13 people, 7 of whom came into contact or may have had contact with the animal's tongue and saliva. (These animals don't have teeth, so there was no risk of bites.) The other 6 were involved with removing the animal's brain during the necropsy. All 13 people agreed to receive the treatment, and no human cases were reported.

[3] North Carolina: skunk, dog, human exposure

Davidson County's Health Department is advising caution following the 4th confirmed rabies bite in as many months. Earlier in the month [April 2022], the Health Department responded to a call about an animal bite. According to reports, an infected skunk found its way into an enclosure and bit 2 domestic dogs. The owner of the dogs killed the skunk. The incident occurred around the Hedrick Grove area, near US Highway 64 E.

The owner of the dogs kept them current on their rabies vaccination. Instead of euthanizing, both dogs received rabies boosts and are currently being held under a 45-day quarantine. The owner is also receiving ongoing treatment. [This implies the owner was bitten or scratched by the skunk or possibly had skunk salvia in an eye or a cut. - Mod.TG]

According to the Health Department's report, wildlife, namely skunks, foxes, and raccoons, are most active this time of year, the between weeks separating winter and spring. "Humans must also proceed with caution," advises Davidson County's Health Department. "Never touch a dead wild animal with your bare hands." Should contact occur, you are advised to not wait before seeking medical help.

Pet owners should also be vigilant. The health department warns that owners of pets must keep their animals up-to-date with their rabies vaccinations. Pet owners should also have access to a veterinarian in the case there is contact between pets and affected wildlife. Veterinarians may need to give pets a booster shot.

[4] Minas Gerais: vampire bat, human case
Date: Thu 21 Apr 2022

https://playcrazygame.com/2022/04/21/health-department-confirms-2nd-case-of-human-rabies-in-minas-this-month/


The Minas Gerais State Health Department (SES-MG) reported this Wednesday [20 Apr 2022] a laboratory test showed a positive result for human rabies in a 12-year-old girl from the Maxacali indigenous reserve, admitted to the Hospital John Paul II, in Belo Horizonte. It is the 2nd case of death from the disease this month [April 2022] alone, close to completing 10 years after the record of the last death in the state.

The girl was admitted to the hospital at dawn on 5 Apr 2022 with several symptoms, after being bitten by a hematophagous bat (human rabies transmitter, regarded as vampire bat) in Pradinho village, in the municipality of Bertópolis, in Vale do Mucuri.

According to SES-MG, the indigenous girl was confirmed for human rabies through an examination in a reference laboratory this Tuesday [19 Apr 2022], when the Day of the Indian is celebrated. Also, according to the folder, on 13 Apr 2022, "the patient had clinical worsening and was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU), where she remains hospitalized and follows the human rabies treatment protocol."

The 1st case recorded this month was a boy, also 12 years old, from the Maxacali indigenous reserve in Bertópolis, who died on 4 Apr 2022. He had been hospitalized the day before, at the Emergency Care Unit (UPA) of Teófilo Otoni (Vale do Mucuri), after being bitten by a vampire bat.

The State Department of Health also reported that a 3rd case is being investigated. This is another 5-year-old girl who died in the indigenous community of Pradinho on 17 Apr 2022, when the suspected case was reported.

"Although the individual did not show clinical symptoms of rabies or signs of a bat bite or scratch, it was decided to investigate the death as such due to the geographical proximity of the occurrences and the habits of the community, following the sanitary protocols of prevention and disease control", explained SES-MG. "Samples have been collected and sent for laboratory examination and the result is awaited," added the folder.

The last case of human rabies in Minas was recorded in June 2012, of a man who died in the municipality of Rio Casca (Zona da Mata), after being bitten by a vampire bat.

The Secretary of State for Health reiterated as soon as it was notified of the 1st suspected case of human rabies in Bertópolis, "immediate and continuous measures to prevent and control rabies in the locality" were adopted. One of them was the notification and investigation of the 2 suspected cases, as well as immediate communication to the Ministry of Health.

"Epidemiological surveillance was also reinforced in the location where the suspected cases (now confirmed) occurred, with an active search for people who may have had the same risk situation as the suspected cases; and then with the referral to prophylactic medical care in the location."

Another measure was the availability of 100 doses of animal rabies vaccine for vaccination of dogs and cats in the region, according to the estimated animal population. "Vaccination is being carried out by the agents of endemic diseases of the Municipal Health Department of Bertópolis since 6 Apr 2022, to immunize dogs and cats and, and help to prevent and control the disease", informs SES-MG.

In addition, "health education actions are developed in the region with the aim of alerting people about the disease and its forms of transmission, as well as measures to prevent and control rabies".

[There are some outstanding notations in this rabies report. We rarely hear of an anteater acquiring rabies, or 13 laboratory individuals taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against rabies. Those working in diagnostic laboratories and most state labs are required to have preventative rabies vaccination.

We are saddened to learn of deaths in Brazil from the hematophagous bat, which is often a vampire bat and a transmitter of rabies.

Regardless of the country you live in, or travel too, being aware of bats is paramount to survival. Bats can bite a person in their sleep and never awaken the individual. Check the rooms you use to make sure screens are on the windows. Also, if you are not familiar with the room, check closets and behind heavy pieces of furniture and chimneys for bats. If you find bats in the dwelling, it is not wise to remain there.

Any time an animal is not following what is normal for the animal, it should trigger an alert in you. Rabies can make normally aggressive animals appear shy and reserved, or a normal animal seem aggressive. While we have compassion for frightened animals, we need be extremely cautious and aware of the possibility of rabies.

Build a barrier between yourself and rabies by vaccinating your animals according to the recommendations of your veterinarian. Keep your pets up to date on their vaccinations, as they could be bitten by a rabid animal, and being up to date on their rabies vaccination could help keep them safe and alive as well. Losing our pets to this disease because of our carelessness of not keeping a pet's vaccination up to date can be a hard dose of reality I hope you do not have to experience. - Mod.TG
