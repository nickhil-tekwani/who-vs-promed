Mr John Dasar, the Chairman, Poultry Farmers Association of Nigeria (PAN) in the [Plateau] state, announced at a sensitisation workshop on bio-security on Thursday [7 May 2015]:

"Between January 2015 and now, more than 160 farms were affected by this dreaded disease and were quarantined, with 153 of them completely shut down."

"No fewer than 400 000 birds were culled. Poultry business has sustained many families in Plateau."

"The attitude of some farmers was not good, as many of them took measures that were not friendly, and so helping to spread the disease to farms of even close friends,'' he said.

Dasar appealed to the state government to look into the plights of poultry farmers by helping to proffer workable solution to the menace.

[Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Nigeria, reportedly early January 2015, a total number of 55 outbreaks in poultry have been reported to the OIE, of which 14 were in the south and 41 in the north-centre (Kano, Plateau and Bauchi states). The most recent follow-up report was submitted on 2 Mar 2015; according to the OIE data, the epizootic is considered, as of 9 May 2015, "continuing" in Nigeria and has spread to Burkina Faso and Niger (see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/o5tmqu6 - click on the West African cluster, zoom in). - Mod.AS
