Cholera has been confirmed in a few cases from among 40-50 cases seen daily of severe gastrointestinal illness presenting to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Diseases Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu. This is believed to have been from drinking untreated contaminated water in heavily populated ares of Kuleshwor and Kalimati in Kathmandu. Cholera is known to exist in Kathmandu and cases do occur every year usually in the month of August, and epidemics have occurred from time to time in Western Nepal and in Kathmandu in 2012. A study conducted by Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) along with STIDH (unpublished data) a few years ago among 600 cases showed that the number-one cause of acute diarrhea in Nepali adults seen at STIDH was _Vibrio cholerae_ followed by campylobacter. Contrary to this, in the foreigner population studied at CIWEC in conjunction with AFRIMS (2012-2014), the number-1 cause of acute diarrhea was campylobacter and no cases of cholera have been found.

Drinking contaminated water is responsible for these cholera cases, and although public health messages of drinking boiled water or water treated with chlorine or Iodine have been circulated via different news channels, the messages do not get to the population that need it the most. There is a severe shortage of municipal water supply in Kathmandu, and people buy water brought by trucks from different vendors and different sources. Much of the public believes that this is safe drinking water and this may be responsible for cholera cases in Kathmandu. Bottled mineral water, particularly the 1-liter bottles and 2-liter jars of established brand names, seem safe for drinking but this is expensive for most people.

There has been fear of cholera epidemic in the earthquake-affected population, who have been living in temporary shelters in crowded conditions in Kathmandu and elsewhere in the 14 earthquake-affected districts. Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) has implemented oral cholera vaccine preventatively in a remote area of Nuwakot district from their leftover stock from prior use per Dr Baburam Marasini. There are no further plans for cholera vaccine to be introduced to any other areas. Focus has been on implementation of Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH) programs in these areas.
