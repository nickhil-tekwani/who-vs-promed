The places mentioned in the digest are in the state of Orissa. The district
called Koraput is bordering the State of Andhrapradesh. These interstate
borders have these problems due to movement of cattle by tribals who do not
get their cattle vaccinated.
Tribals in these areas eat the meat of dead carcasses and become affected.
Summer days witness these episodes, as the soil temperature and other
conditions are optimal for sporulation. In the last 4-5 years these news
[reports] have come up in summer and pre-monsoon days.

With reference to the above posting in ProMED mail, I would like to draw
your attention that the place mentioned in the the report is not in Tamil
Nadu but in Orissa, which is an eastern state of India. Tamil Nadu is in
the South of India.
[Below] is a news item covering the anthrax cases mentioned in the report
which shows that the cases are occurring in Orissa. Another point to note:
attacks by Maoist rebels are not common in Tamil Nadu State.

Anthrax toll rises to 3
---------------------------
The anthrax death toll in this district [Koraput] has risen to 3 with the
death of a 55-year-old resident of Charagaon village in Semiliguda block
yesterday. 15 persons from the same village are still suffering from the
disease. At least 5 persons from Sakiguda in the same block were reportedly
suffering from the disease.
On his return from the affected areas, Koraputï¿½s sub-divisional veterinary
officer Mr SK Takiri said that those affected had eaten rotten beef
carrying anthrax germs. He and his colleagues have destroyed a quintal [a
hundredweight, 100 000 grams or about 220 pounds] of infected beef by
burning it. At least 21 cattle have also been affected. Even though the
process of immunisation has begun, it might be difficult to control the
outbreak, as the villagers were resisting the move to destroy the meat
preserved in almost all the houses.
When contacted, CMOH Dr KH Reddy said he was unaware of the death. Many of
the affected were already being treated with high doses of antibiotics such
as ciprofloxacin and penicillin.
Given that the disease spreads through air, he advised anyone venturing
into the area to take sufficient precautionary measures such as the use of
masks and gloves. Earlier this month [June 2005] 2 persons had succumbed to
the disease in Bandhugaon block.

[From what the Statesman journalist wrote, it would appear that Dr Reddy
believes that the disease is naturally airborne. It is not and is very
rarely contagious, if ever. - Mod.MHJ]

I am a medical microbiologist working with my mentor, Dr. M.K.Lalitha, at
Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. I saw
your message regarding the ongoing problem of human and animal anthrax in
certain parts of India.
In fact I did mention the real problem of human anthrax, especially among
the Indian villages where people tend to handle dead animals (sheep, goats,
or cattle) either to bury or sacrifice the sick animal before its death and
distribute the meat for consumption. The people are not aware of this
dreaded disease, and once they[find out about it], the fear is there for a
period of time, but they tend to forget and carry on with their routine
until they face another attack.
Hence it should be the combined work of preventive medicine, the veterinary
department, health officials, and experts on anthrax, to give adequate
importance to the region affected with anthrax.
When I was working in the Government Medical College, I used to give
educational lectures for both the public as well as clinicians who come
across such patients in their day-to-day practice.
I do believe the veterinary departments are visiting villages where
outbreaks have occurred to vaccinate the livestock.
Let's hope things will change for good.

[A further 2 readers in Tamil Nadu wrote in to point out my geographic
ignorance but also stated categorically that anthrax does not occur in
Tamil Nadu. This claim puzzles me, because the Indian National Survey for
1989-94 had southern India and Tamil Nadu with the highest incidences for
the disease. A companion document for 1991-1996 had it occurring in Tamil
Nadu each year in cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats in sometimes
spectacular numbers.
In 1996 Drs Lalitha & Kumar published a paper in The Lancet --August 24,
348 (9026): 553-554 -- describing the human situation, including some 29
patients with anthrax meningitis with an unfortunately high lethality. A
longer version can be found in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,
1996, 14:63-67, with maps showing where cases have been seen in the state,
including a spot-map of human and animal cases in the North Arcot Ambedkar
district. Latterly, Sastry et al published a paper in 2003 based on some 27
patients seen at the Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore entitled
"Identification of _Bacillus anthracis_ by a simple protective
antigen-specific mAb dot-ELISA" -- Journal of Medical Microbiology, 52:
47-49 -- so I think we can unfortunately assume that the disease continues
both in humans and the rural livestock in Tamil Nadu, much as before. -
