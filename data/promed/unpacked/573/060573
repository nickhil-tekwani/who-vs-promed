More than 6000 people throughout the country are suffering from sleeping
sickness [trypanosomiasis. The Angolan Social Solidarity and Development
Foundation is concerned about the situation and plans to hold a meeting to
mobilize financial and material support to fight the disease.
[We have recently had a case of treatment-resistant relapsing
sleeping sickness in an Angolan immigrant here in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. Does anyone know of any studies of the vector capability of
Brazilian insects (Reduviid bugs or blood-sucking Diptera) for
African trypanosomiasis? - Mod.JW
