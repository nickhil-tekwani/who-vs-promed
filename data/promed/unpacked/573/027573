As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may
change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
discarded after further investigation and follow up.

[C] Update 82 - Change in travel recommendations for Taiwan
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_17/en/> 17 June
WHO has today removed Taiwan, Province of China from its list of areas to
which travellers are advised to avoid all but essential travel. The move
follows vast improvements in case detection, infection control, and the
tracing and follow up of contacts that led to a steep drop in the daily
number of new cases.

"The SARS crisis in Taiwan has been taken very seriously at all levels,"
said Dr Cathy Roth, a WHO virologist who was in Taiwan in May to assess the
need for a strengthened response. "SARS stimulated vast and very rapid
improvements in the health infrastructure, especially in the areas of
hospital infection control procedures, systems for data collection and
reporting, mobilization of the public, and coordination of all agencies
contributing to the outbreak response. We hope these improvements are
permanent."

WHO recommends that all areas which have experienced local transmission of
SARS maintain a high level of vigilance, as a single imported case or lapse
in infection control can re-ignite an outbreak.

The decision to lift a travel advisory notice is based on consideration of
several criteria, including the number of active cases, the number of new
cases being reported daily, patterns of local transmission, and evidence
that cases are no longer being exported elsewhere. The adequacy of
surveillance measures, including screening for new cases and tracing and
follow up of contacts, is also considered. Together, these factors help
determine whether travellers, as well as local residents, are at risk of
acquiring infection outside confined settings, such as the health care
environment.

Taiwan, which has experienced the third largest outbreak on record,
initially had only a few imported cases, all clearly linked together in
chains of person to person transmission. Following lapses in infection
control practices in a hospital, the outbreak escalated dramatically, with
as many as 70 new cases per day being reported in mid-May. The large number
of new cases reported daily was also partly due to a large backlog of cases
pending investigation.

WHO continues to recommend that people planning to travel to Beijing, China
consider postponing all but essential travel. No other travel-related
recommendations are in place.

WHO global conference on SARS 17/18 June 2003, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
This conference has just concluded. Complete texts of many of the talks can
be found at <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june_2003/materials/en/>.
Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, director general of WHO, closed the meeting with
the following remarks: "It is only with hindsight that we can more clearly
see what has happened. That is certainly the case with SARS. When many of
us were caught up in the frantic day-to-day business of managing a growing
epidemic, few had time either to stop or think. Today and yesterday, for
the first time for some of us, we have all had an opportunity to reflect on
what we have achieved and on the lessons we can learn. We now know so much
about SARS and yet we also know how much knowledge is still lacking. We
have also learnt vital lessons to be better prepared for the next emerging
disease - and we know there will be one. Our capacity to respond and to
cooperate should be more advanced and better tested."

Update 83 ­ One hundred days into the outbreak
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_18/en/> June 18 [edited]
Tomorrow will mark the 100th day since WHO first alerted the world, on 12
March, to the SARS threat. From the 55 cases recognized on that day,
alarmingly concentrated in hospitals in Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Singapore,
the outbreak exploded within a month to cause some 3000 cases and more than
100 deaths in 20 countries on all continents. By that time, too, the public
face of SARS had come to be symbolized by a mask ­- an appropriate image
for a disease still shrouded in mystery. Although the causative agent was
conclusively identified on 17 April, the disease had no vaccine, no
effective treatment, an overall case fatality of 15 per cent, and many
unexplained features. As the coming weeks would reveal, SARS was also full
of surprises.

SARS was carried out of southern China, where the first cases are now known
to have occurred in late November 2002, by an infected medical doctor who
spent a single night on the 9th floor of a Hong Kong hotel in late
February. He infected at least 16 other persons staying on or visiting the
same floor. From this single event, which is still not fully understood in
terms of the dynamics of transmission, SARS spread internationally.

The number of cases passed 4000 on 23 April and then rapidly soared to 5000
on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May, when cases were reported
from 30 countries. During the peak of the global outbreak, near the start
of May, more than 200 new cases were being reported each day. Detection of
new infections subsequently slowed, passing 8000 on 22 May. During June,
the number of new cases has gradually dwindled to the present daily
handful. WHO is confident that all countries that have experienced
outbreaks are disclosing cases fully and promptly ­- SARS is too big a
disease to hide for long. The global outbreak, at least in this initial
phase, is clearly coming under control.

The reduced number of cases is not a "natural phenomenon" that can be
attributed to a change in the virulence or infectivity of the SARS virus,
as often happens with new diseases that quickly "burn out". Instead, the
dramatic reduction in the number of SARS cases is the result of monumental
efforts on the part of governments and health care staff, supported by a
well-informed and cooperative public.

SARS is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to strike a
globalized society. As such, its history to date illustrates the favorable
conditions, both for the devastating spread of a new disease and solidarity
in its containment, that have come to characterize a closely
interconnected, interdependent, and highly mobile world. On the negative
side, the volume of international air travel allowed SARS to spread quickly
around the world, the close interdependence of economies and markets
amplified the economic impact of SARS considerably, and instantaneous
electronic communications elevated public concern ­- often to the point of
panic -­ and further added to the social and economic disruption caused by
SARS.

Just as Ebola came to symbolize the fear inspired by a new disease, SARS
has vividly depicted a truism of the infectious disease situation in a
globalized world: an outbreak anywhere places every country at risk. The
containment of SARS ­ or any other epidemic-prone disease ­ requires
unprecedented solidarity and makes such an effort a matter of self-interest
for every nation.

On the positive side, the power of electronic communications allowed the
establishment of "virtual" networks of researchers, epidemiologists, and
clinicians, who set aside competition and collaborated around the clock to
identify the SARS causative agent, sequence its genome, define clinical
features, and investigate modes of transmission in record time. The worlds
electronic interconnectedness also contributed to the effectiveness of the
first global alerts to SARS. The initial 12 March alert, followed three
days later by a stronger and more specific warning, provided a clear line
of demarcation in the early history of SARS. Areas with cases prior to the
alert experienced the most devastating outbreaks. These occurred in Hong
Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and China. Prior to 12 March, in all these
cases, hospital staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and was
spreading in health care settings, took no precautions to protect
themselves as they fought to save the lives of patients. SARS spread
rapidly in these hospitals, and then spilled over into the wider community,
resulting in the exportation of cases elsewhere.

With the notable exception of Taiwan, all other areas experiencing imported
cases after the alerts were able to prevent further transmission altogether
or hold the number of additional cases to a very small number. Most
observers attribute this success to the high level of awareness and
preparedness that followed the alerts, greatly aided by responsible
reporting in the media.

Key weapon: the thermometer
One of the most important lessons learned to date is the decisive power of
high-level political commitment to contain an outbreak even when
sophisticated control tools are lacking. SARS has been brought close to
defeat by the diligent and unrelenting application ­- on a monumental scale
­- of centuries-old control measures: isolation, contact tracing and follow
up, quarantine, and travel restrictions. Other successful measures include
the designation of SARS-dedicated hospitals to minimize the risk of spread
to other hospitals, mass media campaigns to educate the public and
encourage prompt reporting of symptoms, and the establishment of fever
clinics to relieve pressure on emergency rooms, which have also been the
setting for many new infections. Screening at airports and other border
points and, through fever checks, throughout selected population groups has
also been effective.

Viet Nam broke the chain of transmission on 28 April, as did the
Philippines on 20 May, and Singapore on 31 May. Recommendations to postpone
all but essential travel have been removed for all areas except Beijing, China.

In reaching these landmarks in the containment of SARS, the most severely
affected countries and areas have identified and rapidly corrected
long-standing weaknesses in their health systems in ways that will mean
permanent improvements for the management of all diseases. In addition,
systems of data collection and reporting, and new patterns of openly and
frankly communicating information to the public will hold the world in good
stead when the next new disease emerges and the next influenza pandemic
breaks out.

Continued surveillance and vigilance needed for a year
SARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience, most recently with the
resurgence of cases in Toronto. As underscored by researchers at this
weeks meeting in Kuala Lumpur
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june_2003/materials/en/>, SARS has
features that can thwart even the best preparedness plans and slip past
even the highest levels of awareness and suspicion. Under the right
conditions, which remain poorly understood, single highly infectious people
have been known to set off trains of transmission that have led, in the
worst cases, to almost 100 additional infections. In Singapore, 5 patients
accounted for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.

Another significant problem occurs when SARS symptoms are masked by other
diseases. Many surprising clusters of cases have been fanned by such
patients, as they do not arouse suspicion, are not isolated or managed
according to strict procedures of infection control, have no restrictions
on visitors, and are frequently transferred to other hospitals for further
treatment or tests.

Although SARS is clearly coming under control, the need for continued
vigilance is now greater than ever. The world still has a chance to
interrupt the chain of person to person transmission everywhere. However,
because of the many unanswered scientific questions, particularly
concerning the origins of the virus and the contribution of environmental
contamination to overall transmission, WHO sees a need for at least a full
year of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established
endemicity and to ensure that no cases have spread, undetected, to
countries with poor surveillance and reporting systems. If the disease has
not become endemic, the next big hurdles will concern the questions of a
possible animal reservoir and possible seasonal recurrence. Scientists
cannot rule out the possibility that the SARS virus hides somewhere in
nature, as the Ebola virus does, only to return when conditions are once
again ripe for the efficient spread of infection to its new human host.

Finally, as underscored in todays conference sessions, the development of
a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test must be given high priority.
Pending the availability of such a test, and for a while yet to come, every
case of atypical pneumonia has the potential to arouse suspicion and spark
a panic. Any hospital-based cluster of febrile patients with respiratory
symptoms will need extensive investigation. And any person with a fever or
cough could be barred from international travel.

As long as a single case of SARS exists or is suspected anywhere in the
world, and as long as fundamental questions about the origins of the virus
remain unanswered, all countries need to remain on guard.
