From: Ross <rupshur@idirect.com>

I would like to propose a correction. The message headers are wrong.
Vozrozdhenye island is not in Russia but in Karakalpakstan, (an autonomous
republic within the republic of Uzbekistan), and in Kazakhstan.
I also have the following question on the content. The NY Times journalist
suggests that anthrax may be spread by rodents and other animals living on
the island. Does anybody have an idea of the risk of anthrax infection for
the population living close to the Aral Sea? We must bear in mind that
indeed the former island now seems to be connected to the main land due to
drying of the sea.

[As to the asserted risk involved with "spread". This is of uncertain risk
until it can be quantified. Firstly, the area is essentially unpopulated
thanks to the regional loss of fishing, shipping, and pollution of the
cotton growing areas with salt; the adjoining areas of Uzbekistan and
western Kazakhstan are of very low population density. So even if spores
were blowing on the wind there are few if any there to sample them.
Secondly, the area is subject to high UV light levels and wide day-night
temperature fluctuations, which will negatively impact the viability and
survival of any spores on the surface or within a few centimetres of the
surface.
Thirdly, that "anthrax may be spread by rodents and other animals living on
the island" is nonsense. On the other hand the buried tonnage of improperly
treated pathogens was large. At this time there are no reports of
associated animal or human cases downwind. While there might be a
potential, the reality is unknown in spite of journalistic assertions. MHJ
[I am most grateful for Martin's comments with regard to anthrax. Mr.
Upshur, if indeed the geography was incorrect, then I appreciate your
assistance. - MOD.TG
