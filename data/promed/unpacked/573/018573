[Since Wed 13 Oct 2004, there have been no extensions of range in any
species. As of Wed 13 Oct 2004, the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador,
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Yukon
Territory, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have not reported confirmed
cases of West Nile virus in 2004. Since only one additional West Nile
virus-positive mosquito pool has been reported since Wed 7 Oct 2004, it is
likely that the West Nile virus transmission season is drawing to a close
with the onset of colder weather. - Mod.CP]

Study Finds West Nile Costs Will Steadily Rise
----------------------------------------------
Using figures from Louisiana's 2002 experience with the West Nile virus,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus cost $20.1
million in patient treatments and public health response expenses and
almost $140 million nationwide.
But the authors of a study published this month warn that those estimates
are conservative and costs will probably rise once long-term expenses of
treating patients are factored in. The national estimate -- unlike the
Louisiana figure -- does not include costs of mosquito control, because it
varies so much from location to location.
This mosquito-borne form of encephalitis infected at least 329 people in
Louisiana in 2002, including 24 who died. Nationwide, the 2002 epidemic
resulted in 4156 people infected and 284 deaths, many in the Midwest. The
study concluded that the cost of the disease "will likely remain
substantially greater" than the cost of all previous mosquito-borne
diseases that have appeared in this country.
In Louisiana, 80 to 100 cases a year of West Nile virus infection are
expected to be severe enough to require medical treatment "every year from
now on," said state epidemiologist Raoult Ratard, one of the study's
authors. "There are no new drug treatments," Ratard said. "And a lot of the
cost is for the real serious cases in intensive care units. We expect that
10 percent of those will die and 10 percent will have serious consequences
that last many years."
West Nile has symptoms that range from those normally associated with a
mild case of influenza to the disorientation, coma, paralysis or death
associated with severe infections of the brain and spinal cord. However,
fewer than 1 in 150 fall victim to the worst effects of the disease, and 80
percent who are infected experience no symptoms.
The report was published in the October 2004 edition of "Emerging
Infectious Diseases", a peer-reviewed online publication of the Centers for
Disease Control. The report's authors collected information from more than
150 Louisiana patients, their doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and others
covering a 6-month period from August 2002 through February 2003 to develop
a snapshot of the cost of the new disease, said Martin Meltzer, one of the
report's authors and a senior health economist in the center's Office of
Surveillance.

Louisiana: West Nile Virus Infection Deaths Now Total 7 (as in 2003)
--------------------------------------------------
3 people have died of West Nile virus since mid-August 2004, and a 4th
death was reclassified, bringing the number of 2004 deaths from the
mosquito-borne disease to last year's total, 7, the state health department
said on Wed 20 Oct 2004. The deaths included an 85-year-old East Baton
Rouge man who died on Friday and 2 people who died on 23 Sep 2004: a
63-year-old Evangeline Parish man and a 78-year-old Rapides Parish
woman. 3 cases reported earlier as St. Louis encephalitis, one of them
fatal, were reclassified as West Nile virus infection. With the
reclassification, there are no known cases of St. Louis encephalitis this year.
The Department of Health and Hospitals said 11 new West Nile cases have
been reported since 22 Sep 2004, bringing the total to 89. They included 4
in East Baton Rouge Parish, 3 in Bossier Parish and one in Caddo Parish. At
this time last year, 93 people had been diagnosed with West Nile virus
infection and 5 had died from the infection. "We really didn't know from
year to year what's going to happen. We are learning right now," said Dr.
Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist. Louisiana hasn't shown the pattern
found in many other states, he said. "In many states, after a year or 2
things calm down. I think now we have the first year very high, then the
next 2 years the same. We have to see what's going to happen next year."
66 of this year's 89 West Nile cases involved encephalitis or meningitis,
which can be fatal. 19 are of the mild West Nile fever rather than
encephalitis or meningitis. The virus also was found in 4 people who had no
symptoms. East Baton Rouge Parish now has a total of 24, Livingston Parish
remained at 9, Caddo Parish 16, and Bossier Parish 9.
2 other parishes in northwest Louisiana and 2 next to Baton Rouge had one
case each. 41 of the people who had the virus are home, 35 hospitalized (9
of them in intensive care) and 6 are in rehabilitation centers.
The state ended 2003 with 121 West Nile cases and 7 deaths, as well as 7
St. Louis encephalitis cases with one death, and a single non-fatal case of
Eastern equine encephalitis. There were 330 West Nile cases and 25 deaths
in 2002.

Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Thu 14 Oct 2004
---------------------------------------------------
[The following updated figures have been extracted from the Resumen
Epidemiologico file accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus
Activity in Mexico.
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls>
- Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 14 Oct 2004, the cumulative total of human tests has been
increased by 16 since Thu 30 Sep 2004 and no additional seropositive
individuals have been detected: i.e. in total 226 individuals resident in
25 of the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection; 225 were seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in
the state of Sonora exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile virus -
Mexico (Sonora) 20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 14 Oct 2004, a total of 2992 (an increase of 121 since 30 Sep
2004) horses now from all 32 states had been tested for evidence of West
Nile virus infection. Of these animals 2215 (an increase of 112) were
seronegative and 777 (an increase of 9) were seropositive. All the
seropositive animals were asymptomatic.
Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 14 Oct 2004, the number of birds tested has increased
dramatically since 30 Sep 2004; i.e. in total 4833 (up 4095) birds from 7
of the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection. Of these birds 4660 (up 3975) were seronegative and 171 (up 120)
were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic), and one case in the
state of Sonora and one case in the state of Baja California exhibited
signs of disease. (Initially both birds appear to have been assigned to the
state of Sonora). The seropositive birds were detected in the states of
Baja California, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro, Sonora and Yucatan.
Most of the test results since 30 Sep 2004 have been reported from the
state of Yucatan; i.e., 4092 birds tested, 3994 birds seronegative, 120
birds seropositive and no fatalities.
[Sonora state, where the single human case and one of the 2 avian cases
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA.
The results from Mexico differ significantly from those reported from the
USA and Canada in that there is no mortality other than the 2 birds in a
border state. The reason for this is unclear; possibilities are differences
in test criteria or occurrence of cross-protection as a result of
increasing exposure to infection by other arboviruses infection - Mod.CP]
