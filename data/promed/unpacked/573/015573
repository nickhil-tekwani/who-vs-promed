[Norway's follow-up report no 1 on this outbreak, notifying 2
rabies-positive cases in reindeer, was submitted to the OIE on 23 Sep
2011. It included the following commentaries:
1. Affected population: wild reindeers (_Rangifer tarandus_). There is
a population of wild reindeers on Svalbard. On 19 Sep 2011, 2 animals
with clinical signs (paresis and opistotonus) were culled. Biological
material for further examination was sent to the Norwegian Veterinary
Institute (Oslo).

2. Epidemiological comments: control measures according to the
contingency plan of Svalbard are carried out: establishing protection
and surveillance zones, information to the public, extraordinary leash
law, killing of foxes, observation of signs in dogs and regulation of
keeping dogs to prevent contact with foxes.
Preliminary result of virus sequencing in fox reported in the
immediate notification on 16 Sep 2011: genotype 1, serotype 1
There are reasons to believe that the outbreaks are connected.

The follow-up report, including an interactive map, is available at
