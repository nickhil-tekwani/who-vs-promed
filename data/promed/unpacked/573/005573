Belgium Reports 2 New Suspected Bird Flu Cases
------------------------------------------------
2 new suspected cases of the highly contagious bird flu disease [highly
pathogenic avian influenza -- HPAI] have been discovered in Belgian farms
near the Dutch border, a spokesman for the national food safety agency said
on Sunday.
The disease has spilled over into Belgium from the neighbouring
Netherlands, where some 11 million birds have been slaughtered since late
February 2003 in an effort to control it.
"We strongly suspect 2 new cases of bird flu in Belgium," Pascal Houbaert,
spokesman for the food safety agency AFSCA told Reuters, adding that all
poultry within a 3-km radius of the affected farms would be slaughtered.
This could amount to 270 000 birds on top of the 250 000 Belgium has
already slaughtered after a first case was discovered in the eastern region
of Limburg on Wed 16 Apr 2003.
The new suspected Belgian cases were in Kinrooi, also in Limburg and in an
area closely monitored by food safety authorities.
Houbaert said that following the sudden death of a Dutch veterinarian
[infected with HPAI; see ref 20030419.0959], the Belgian authorities have
recommended that all those coming into contact with the animals take
antiviral medicines.
Belgium has banned exports of live chickens and eggs and stopped transport
of all poultry and poultry products within the country. The European
Commission has enforced the ban [throughout the] European Union until 25
Apr 2003.
