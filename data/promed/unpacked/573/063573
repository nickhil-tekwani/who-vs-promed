Mass poisoning of 50 schoolchildren - Yakutsk (Russia)
-------------------------------------------------
About 50 children got poisoning in the Yakutsk city of Aldan. According to
the Ministry of Emergency situations, patients first started to be admitted
to Aldan hospital on Tuesday afternoon. All of the children admitted were
from school number 2. The age of children varies between 7-12. Children
complained of nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and dizziness. During the day,
47 children were seen, 20 of them hospitalized.
Because 2 of the children were in especially serious condition, they were
transferred to the National Medical center. Physicians were not able to
give a complete diagnosis.
Municipal education chief of the Aldan region, Sergey Kuznezov, organized a
committee to investigate and help prevent further epidemics at school number 2.
Representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Internal Affairs,
Prosecution Office, Public Health Department, Education Administration, and
the State Surveillance Center are members of the committee.
The school canteen and chemistry lab rooms were carefully investigated; so
far nothing suspicious has been identified..

[This article does not even give a clue as to the suspected source of the
poisoning. But hospitalizations imply something serious. Further
information is needed before clear conclusions can be drawn - Mod.NR]
