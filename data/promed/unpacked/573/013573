According to the information of the Main Veterinary Inspectorate in the Lubuskie Voivodeship, 8 new cases of ASF have been confirmed. The extent of the disease has shifted westward, currently, the virus is located about 40 km [about 25 mi] from the German border.

On the map published by the Chief Veterinary Inspectorate, information appeared yesterday [Mon 2 Dec 2019] about the recent ASF cases in the Lubuskie Voivodeship. Thus, information about the occurrence of plague in the Zielona Gora poviat [county] is confirmed. However, the situation is more serious than previously expected. In addition to one case confirmed in the city itself, the disease also occurred in the municipalities of Zielona Gora, Sulechow, Swidnica, and Nowogrod Bobrzanski. 2 cases of the disease were also confirmed in the Nowa Sol commune in the Nowosolski poviat.

Thus, the distance separating the range of ASF from the border with Germany has significantly decreased. At present, it is about 40 km [about 25 mi].

A reminder: the occurrence of African swine fever in western Poland was confirmed less than 3 weeks ago. Since then, about 20 cases of the disease have been detected in this part of the country in Lubuskie Province, and one case in Dolnoslaskie Province.

[For the location of Nowogrod Bobrzanski, less than 40 km/25 mi from the German border, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/2Pa4T25uyXaU4LEv8; Zielona Gora can be seen on the map some 26 km/16 mi to its north-east.

The new cluster of ASF in western Poland's wild boar population was discovered when a wild boar, reportedly killed in a traffic accident on 4 Nov 2019, about 85 km (about 53 mi) east of the German border, was eventually found infected when tests were completed 10 days later. The distance of the accident site, in Lubuskie Voivodeship (province), from the most western location of previous ASF cases in eastern/central Poland's wild boar, exceeded 300 km (186 mi). This event may have started at least a week previous to the detection of the 1st case.

Poland submitted to the OIE an immediate notification of the said 1st case on 15 Nov 2019; a follow-up report is anticipated.

The density of wild boars in western Poland has been debated recently in the local press; farmers, particularly, have claimed that the figures are higher than those published.

No cases in domestic pigs have been recorded in western Poland. - Mod.AS
