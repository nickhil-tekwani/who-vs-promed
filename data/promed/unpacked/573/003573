Seven people have been sent to hospital in Zimbabwe with potentially
lethal anthrax poisoning following an outbreak of the animal-borne
disease in a private game park north of the capital, reports said on
Sat 20 Oct 2007. The 7 have been admitted to hospital in the northern
town of Concession, said the state-controlled Herald newspaper.

The outbreak of anthrax -- which is normally caught by humans if they
eat the meat of infected cattle -- occurred at Manzou Game Park in
Mazowe, said the paper.

There are sporadic outbreaks of anthrax in Zimbabwe. Last December
[2006], 3 people died in Goromonzi district, east of the capital,
from anthrax, which they were suspected to have caught after either
eating or handling infected meat.

["Poisoning" suggests gastro-enteric anthrax, but, knowing the
inaccuracies implicit in newspaper reports, it could be either
cutaneous or both. This disease is now widespread in Zimbabwe and
enzootic. It has long been a disease of nature parks in Africa
because of the problems inherent in controlling it in wildlife. That
it is on a private park might exclude the possibility that it was
initially in cattle brought without permission into the park by
neighboring villagers, a constant problem in national parks
throughout East Africa. Clarification is being sought from contacts
in country. - Mod.MHJ]
