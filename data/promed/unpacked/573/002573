Suspected cases from Seychelles test negative for plague
--------------------------------------------------------
Samples from patients in Seychelles suspected to be ill with pneumonic plague tested negative at a WHO partner laboratory in Paris, France on Tue 17 Oct 2017. The 10 samples were shipped by the Seychelles Ministry of Health and WHO to the collaborating centre for Yersinia at the Institut Pasteur to confirm the status of several suspected and one probable case -- a 34-year-old Seychelles national who had returned from Madagascar with plague-like symptoms.

WHO is working with the Seychelles health authorities to reduce the risk of plague spreading from neighbouring Madagascar, which faces an unprecedented outbreak that has killed more than 70 people since August 2017. No plague cases have been confirmed in the Seychelles.

Alongside support for laboratory testing, WHO has deployed experts and medical supplies to the 115-island country. WHO is also providing guidance for the tracing and treatment of contacts of people who are suspected to have been infected.

"We are working with health authorities to reduce the risk of the spread of plague in the Seychelles by improving surveillance and preparedness," said Dr Ibrahima Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergencies Director for the Africa region.

WHO is advising the Government of Seychelles on the implementation of public health measures that are in line with the WHO International Health Regulations, such as enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts.

WHO currently assesses the risk of spread of plague in the Seychelles to be low.

[It appears that none of the suspected case samples as well as the samples from the probable case have been found to be positive for _Yersinia pestis_ in WHO testing. It is likely that the diagnostic test employed utilizes a monoclonal antibody against the bacterial F1 antigen:

"Abstract
---------
Background: Plague is often fatal without prompt and appropriate treatment. It affects mainly poor and remote populations. Late diagnosis is one of the major causes of human death and spread of the disease, since it limits the effectiveness of control measures. We aimed to develop and assess a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for plague.

Methods: We developed a test that used monoclonal antibodies to the F1 antigen of _Yersinia pestis_. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed with a range of bacterial cultures and clinical samples, and compared with findings from available ELISA and bacteriological tests for plague. Samples from patients thought to have plague were tested with the RDT in the laboratory and by health workers in 26 pilot sites in Madagascar.

Findings: The RDT detected concentrations of F1 antigen as low as 0.5 ng/mL in up to 15 min, and had a shelf life of 21 days at 60 deg C [140 deg F]. Its sensitivity and specificity were both 100 percent. RDT detected 41.6 percent and 31 percent more positive clinical specimens than did bacteriological methods and ELISA, respectively. The agreement rate between tests done at remote centres and in the laboratory was 89.8 percent. With the combination of bacteriological methods and F1 ELISA as reference standard, the positive and negative predictive values of the RDT were 90.6 percent and 86.7 percent, respectively.

Interpretation: Our RDT is a specific, sensitive, and reliable test that can easily be done by health workers at the patient's bedside, for the rapid diagnosis of pneumonic and bubonic plague. This test will be of key importance for the control of plague in endemic countries."
