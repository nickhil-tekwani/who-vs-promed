Bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] has claimed 3
lives in Cambodia this month [February 2011], with a mother and her
11-month-old son becoming the latest victims of the virus, officials
said Wednesday [23 Feb 2011].

The 19-year-old woman died on 12 Feb 2011 while her baby died 5 days
later, the Cambodian health ministry and the World Health Organization
said in a joint statement. Tests confirmed both had contracted H5N1
avian influenza.

Earlier this month [February 2011] Cambodia reported its 1st bird flu
fatality in nearly a year when a 5-year-old girl in the capital [Phnom
Penh] died from the virus.

The new victims, from northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, were
admitted to hospital with high fever and coughing days after "eating
sick poultry'' while visiting relatives in southeastern Prey Veng
province, the statement said.

It said the H5N1 avian influenza strain has killed more than 300
people worldwide since 2003. In Cambodia, the disease has claimed 11
lives.

[The total number of confirmed human cases of avian A/(H5N1)
influenza virus in Cambodia is now 13 cases with 11 fatal outcomes,
giving a very high CFR (case fatality rate) for avian influenza in
this country. As elsewhere exposure to diseased poultry has been a
common feature.
