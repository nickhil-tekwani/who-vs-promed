More than 100 sheep have died in Southland in one of the worst outbreaks of salmonella in more than a decade. At least 40 farms in Gore and Tapanui have been affected, and local vets are worried that the disease could spread to farmers.

VetSouth vet Donna Hamilton says the strand of salmonella -- _Salmonella hindmarsh_ -- hasn't been seen in the area for more than a decade. "I've been working here for 10 years, and it's over 10 years since we've had an outbreak like this," she says.

It is hoped the outbreak, which began in January 2013, but is now more widespread, will die down in the coming months as winter begins.

"Sheep actually can harbour the bacteria in their intestinal system normally, so the bacteria is always about, but it's not always causing disease," Ms Hamilton says. "It's a stress factor normally that triggers the disease."

She is warning farmers to be careful as they work with the sick animals. "Hygiene is especially important when dealing with sick stock because people can become infected themselves," she says. "[Farmers] need to be strict on hygiene and hand washing."

Southland Federated Farmers' meat and fibre chairman Andrew Robinson says the outbreak has been extremely difficult for farmers. "It's particularly devastating financially and physiologically; nobody likes losing livestock; it's just seriously frustrating when it happens," he says. "There's a certain mortality rate involved, and then there's the sub-clinical effect as well; as they get ill, it takes them quite a while to recover."

Mr Robinson suspects the bacteria originated from waterfowl, as birds are the most common carriers of the disease. "We get the ability to wash our lettuce before we eat it, but the sheep don't get the ability to wash the grass that these birds have defecated on," he says.

There is no way to tell how far the disease would spread from this point, he says, but farmers are doing what they can to contain it. However, birds are more mobile at this time of year, as the duck shooting season gets underway, further complicating the situation.

_Salmonella hindmarsh_ is a bacterium that can inflame the intestines of animals, spreading through the blood and killing quickly. It spreads from animal to animal through excrement and can survive in grass, soil and water.

[Sheep affected with salmonella often have a death rate of approximately 1-2 percent but that can reach up to 5 percent. Apart from the deaths, salmonellosis can play havoc with normal management, especially close to mating time.

Affected sheep become very depressed, develop severe diarrheoa, and usually die within a few days.

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and history and is confirmed by autopsy and culture of intestinal contents.

Outbreaks can be dramatic with a high death rate in a short time. But many outbreaks tend to be innocuous with "the odd ewe dying" until numbers get large enough for the farmer to become concerned.

Prevention is best achieved by vaccination. Vaccination in the face of the outbreak will most likely reduce losses, whether the ewes have been sensitized or not. It is very easy to put vaccinating off because of the cost and the need for gathering the animals, which poses a risk of spreading the disease. Cost is around NZD 80-100 [USD 65-81] per ewe. If ewes are worth NZD 150 each [USD 121], vaccination needs to save 2 percent of the ewes.
