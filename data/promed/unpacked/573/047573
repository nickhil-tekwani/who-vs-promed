Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection Vectors

Epidemiological comments: RVF is not a controlled disease but only a
notifiable disease in South Africa. The State Veterinary Services
give support by giving information and advice to farmers. The State
Veterinary Services will supply some vaccines to upcoming farmers and
support vaccination campaigns in non commercial domestic animals.
Private owners are responsible for the vaccination of commercial
domestic animals. Farmers are advised not to move their animals while
the event is ongoing and to adhere to good biosecurity practices.

Control measures: Measures applied No vaccination
No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied No other measures

Future Reporting- The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports
will be submitted.

[This reports summarizes 53 outbreaks in the week after our previous
report posted on our East African Regional list - ProMED-EAFR Rift
Valley fever, animal - South Africa: OIE 20100504.207118 . The
outbreaks cover a wide geographic range of the country including the
Free State, Northern Cape Province, Eastern Cape Province, Western
Cape Province and now the North West Province, which means there are
reports from 5 of the 9 provinces in the country.

To summarize the current status of the outbreaks this week: Sheep
have been mainly infected with 1190 cases and 895 deaths. Other
species including cattle, goats, buffaloes, camilidaes, and wild
animals have been affected to a much lesser degree. The latest
figures from the human side of the zoonotic bridge include 186 human
cases with 18 deaths, an approximate 10 percent case fatality rate.
Although an effective vaccine for animals is available, there appears
to be only very passive efforts to control the disease in the animal
population.

Given the influx of visitors for the upcoming FIFA World Cup set to
begin in just under a month, the strategy of allowing a zoonotic
disease to run its course in animals seems very risky indeed. The
disease can be transmitted by mosquitoes although it usually is not,
being most commonly transmitted by exposure to infected animal
tissues. Of the 186 human cases to date, how many are veterinarians,
slaughterhouse workers and/or farmers, and how many fall outside the
traditional high risk groups? It would seem, given the stakes, that
an extra insurance, really the best and most reliable insurance
whenever a zoonotic disease is involved, should be taken out by
eradicating this zoonotic disease in animals.

For further information on RVF in animals and the current South
African attempts to control it, we are repeating the moderator
comments from the previous ProMED-EAFR posting Rift Valley fever,
animal - South Africa: OIE 20100504.207118. - Mods.PC/FE]

[Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an arthropod borne viral disease that
occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and Arabic Peninsula. The
disease is caused by a RNA virus that has been classified in the
family of Bunyaviridae and genus Phlebovirus. RVF outbreak normally
occurs following exceptionally heavy rainfall preceded by a drought.
The disease was reported in Free State Province in February 2010 and
since then, two other Provinces (Northern and Eastern Cape) have
reported the disease. This area is different from the previous
outbreaks in the country.

In 2008, the outbreaks were much smaller in scale and in a different
location. There were 31 total outbreaks between January and June,
2008 with 14 in Mpumalanga, 5 in Limpopo, 6 in Guateng and 6 in North
West Province. These areas are adjacent to Swaziland, which also had
two outbreaks around the same time. In 1999, the outbreaks occurred
in near the Kruger National Park, not terribly far away from some of
the outbreaks in Limpopo and Mpumalanga in 2008. The current
outbreaks are to the South and West previous outbreaks in the Free
State, Northern Cape and Western Cape Provinces.

The following is extracted from an excellent, firsthand account of
the outbreak in 1999 kindly sent in to ProMED-mail by the
distinguished South African virologist, Bob Swanepol. I also
recommend the second posting in the series, with particular attention
to the moderator comments by Charlie Calisher. What follows is a
Swanepol's summary of outbreaks going back to the 1970s:

RVF occurs in the country at irregular intervals of many years when
particularly heavy rains favour the occurrence of population
explosions of the floodwater-breeding aedine mosquito vectors of the
virus. The last big outbreaks occurred on the inland plateau during
the heavy rains of 1974-76, and a small outbreak on the coast of
northern KwaZulu-Natal Province in 1981 -- since when the disease has
not been diagnosed in South Africa.

We provide you this historical background to make a point. The
current outbreak is unprecedented in its impact in animals, with 79
new outbreaks in the first report and 93 in the second update in this
report . It appears as if the disease is running rampant in South
Africa and is totally uncontrolled. RVF took its 12 human victim
recently and yet there is apparently no effective efforts to control
the disease in animals.

Rift Valley Fever classically starts in animals and spreads to
people. Most human cases arise through exposure to infected animal
tissues at slaughter or through veterinary activities. However,
infection through mosquito bites cannot be completely ruled out. So
far in these outbreaks it appears high risk individuals working with
animals are those getting the infection.

Not only does the disease start in animals, it also must be
controlled there to keep people safe. By the magnitude of the
outbreaks reported here, it would seem South Africa is in an
unprecedented situation. Even though RVF is not a "controlled
disease" in South Africa, only being notifiable and only meriting
information and advice from the State Veterinary Services, it is
becoming increasingly obvious that such tactics are not getting the
job done. It is understandable that standing, effective animal
disease control programs might not be in place when there can be gaps
of a decade or more in between outbreaks. This is the nature of
emerging disease but this is exactly why Joshua Lederberg, a true
leader in the EID field indicated that "against the adaptability of
microbes, all we have is our wits."

Even though both attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been shown
to work, it appears as if the disease is not being controlled by the
current animal disease control paradigm of information, support and
advice to farmers. Furthermore the number of human cases keeps
rising, having increased by 23 in the six day period between our last
two ProMED-mail reports to a total of 143 human cases with 9 deaths.
Again, the best method of control is for the disease to be nipped in
the bud at its animal source and if current measures don't allow for
effective control then innovation should be seriously considered.
Particularly given that the eyes of world will soon be squarely
focused on South Africa with the upcoming FIFA World Cup soccer
finals to begin in mid June, just some 40 days from now. - Mods.PC/FE]
