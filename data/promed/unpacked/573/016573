[These 3 outbreaks, reportedly affecting 7 separate holdings in 3
locations, all in the vicinity of Hebron, were suspected upon clinical
signs followed by serological tests. The serological (c-ELISA) tests were
confirmed by the regional laboratory in 42 out of 46 samples received.

Sampling of entire blood or organs from the affected bovines could have
allowed virus isolation and its serotyping. The positive serology can also
indicate old infections; most cattle within Israel and the Palestinian
Autonomy undergo seroconversion against one or more of the circulating
regional BTV serotypes during the BT season. Until 2006, these infections,
in bovines, were subclinical (with rare exceptions).

Hebron is located in the southern part of the West Bank (map included in
the notification above), in the same region where 3 outbreaks of BTV-24
have been identified earlier this year (2009) in Israeli farms: 2 dairy
cattle farms (Kalya and Almog, just north of the Dead Sea, about 45 km [28
mi] north east of Hebron), and one sheep farm (En Hazeva, about 70 km [44
mi] south east of Hebron).

Three orbiviruses which affect cattle, causing BT-like symptoms, have been
identified in Israel for the 1st time since 2006: EHD-7 in late summer/fall
of 2006, throughout the country; BTV-8 in November 2008, in northern
Israel; and BTV-24, in November 2008 and again in March-April 2009, in the
south. BTV-8 and BTV-24 are also serious sheep pathogens, with BTV-24
demonstrating, at least in one case, exceptionally high pathogenicity in
susceptible sheep.

Serotyping of the current cases, if performed, may provide supportive
evidence for the diagnosis, particularly if BTV-8 or BTV-24 were
identified. Based upon the clinical signs and positive serology, these
outbreaks are regarded "suspected". - Mod.AS
