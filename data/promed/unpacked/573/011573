The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that Harare has recorded the
highest number of confirmed measles cases since the outbreak started
more than a year ago, accounting for nearly a quarter of all reported
cases [i.e. about 3000].

According to the latest joint epidemiological report published by the
WHO and Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health, Harare has recorded 154
confirmed cases of measles against 673 cases that had been reported
by early October 2010.

Only Zvishavane [Midlands province] has recorded a higher number of
measles incidents [?], with 29 cases being reported between September
2009 and last month [October 2010].

The capital accounted for 42 out of the 76 suspected cases reported
during the week ending 10 Oct 2010, the latest period for which
[figures are] available.

"11 975 suspected cases and 631 deaths of measles were reported in
all the provinces of Zimbabwe (since the outbreak started last year
[2009])," the report said.

The United Nations said last month [October 2010] that Zimbabwe's
measles outbreak was claiming 5 lives a week despite a nationwide
immunisation campaign carried out in June [2010] that targeted more
than 5 million children.

[Harare, the capital city and administrative centre of Zimbabwe, has
an estimated population of 1 600 000, with 2 800 000 people in its
metropolitan area (2006 census). The total population of the country
is approximately 11 600 000 (2006 census).

The figures in this press report are somewhat confusing, but the
vaccination campaign in late June 2010 does not appear to have
diminished the transmission of measles, at least in the capital city.
