Health officials in Caloocan City have recorded a 100-percent
increase in dengue cases in the 1st 5 months of 2008, compared to the
same period last year [2007].

Radio dzBB's Bernie Morales reported that city health officer Claire
Clemente said they recorded 630 cases from 1 Jan-29 May [2008]. Of
the 630 cases, 5 died. Clemente said most of the dengue victims were males.

She said the city government is now stepping up its information
campaign against dengue, now that the rainy season is approaching.

Health authorities consider dengue a year-round threat, and have
advised the public to keep their surroundings dry and clean to
prevent dengue-carrying mosquitoes from breeding

Bago, Silay, and Talisay had the most number of dengue cases from
January-June [2008], a report submitted by Provincial Health officer
Luisa Efren to the Office of the Governor stated.

The report noted an uncommon rise in dengue cases in Bago City with
56 cases, Silay City with 55, and Talisay City with 52 recorded cases.

The 221 cases were collated from various hospitals in the cities and
municipalities of Negros Occidental, except Bacolod City.

Silay's dengue cases surged to 94 percent, considering it only had 3
cases for the same period last year [2007]. Talisay noted an 82
percent hike while Bago had a 46 percent increase.

Last year [2007], Victorias City topped the list of dengue-afflicted
areas with 56 cases. For the 1st 6 months of 2008, it recorded 21 or
a 60 percent reduction.

Bago noted 30 cases last year [2007] while Hinoba-an had 17,
including one fatality. This year [2008], Hinoba-an has 2 dengue cases.

Other areas with recorded dengue cases include La Carlota City (17),
Valladolid (5), Binalbagan (3), and Moises Padilla (1). [In 2007]
these areas had no dengue case.

The city of Sagay, meanwhile, recorded 26 cases this year [2008],
Manapla 20, San Carlos 16, Cadiz 16, Pontevedra 15, Hinigaran 14,
Kabankalan 14, Escalante 11, and EB Magalona 10 cases.

Except for Cadiz and Kabankalan, these areas noted a 50 percent hike
in the number of cases compared to last year [2007].

Himamaylan, on the other hand, has had 8 cases (from 2 last year
[2007]), Pulupandan 6 (3 cases last year), Calatrava 5 (2 cases last
year), Isabela 4 (2 cases last year), and La Castellana 4 (2 cases last year).

The Provincial Health Office has reiterated compliance to the "4S" in
dengue prevention: search and destroy mosquito-breeding places, safe
protection measures, seek early treatment, and saying no to
indiscriminate fogging.

Cases of dengue fever in the Jakarta Capital again increased over the
last 2 months. From April to May 2008, some 1000 additional cases
were reported.

The public relations official of the Health Service of Jakarta, Tini
Suryani, said on Friday afternoon (13 Jun 2008) that during April
there were at least 3741 cases and 3 of them died. In May, 4774 cases
were recorded with 4 deaths, indicating an increase of 1031 dengue
cases in Jakarta. For the month of June (up to 11 Jun [2008]) the
number of dengue cases in the Jakarta area reached 1164.

A member of the local government commission to control dengue, Achmad
Husein Alaydrus, questioned the eradication program of the
mosquito-breeding sites that has been carried out up until now. He
said the program must be reviewed again. It is not impossible that
implementation in the field has been inappropriate so that the dengue
case numbers in Jakarta have not declined.

Communities must be actively involved in eliminating
mosquito-breeding sites. The eradication of the mosquito-breeding
areas will not be successful if control activities are only carried
out every Friday, and not carried out together in the 5 Jakarta territories.

According to the Jakarta Regional Government, the eradication
programs of mosquito breeding-sites are carried out for 30 minutes
every Friday. This means that every Friday all office complexes must
allow 30 minutes in order to carry out the elimination of
mosquito-breeding sites in order to prevent dengue fever. This
pattern in fact was carried out in Cuba and was successful.

[This level of community participation can be essential in reducing
dengue virus vector mosquito populations. The experience in Cuba
indicated that this control approach can be successful but difficult
to maintain. Cuba apparently did not maintain that level of community
effort and suffered a reemergence of _Aedes aegypti_ populations with
a resulting serious dengue epidemic in 2007. A community-based
cleanup campaign was reimplemented there.

During the period January-May 2008, 260 residents of South Kalimantan
Province were afflicted by dengue fever, including 6 who died.

"We continued to carry out the step-by-step control in anticipation
and in order to be able to press forward against the increase of the
number of sufferers all over the area including 13 cities/regencies,"
said the South Kalimantan Health official, Rosihan Adhani.

The number of recorded South Kalimantan residents who contracted
dengue in 2007 was 1000 people spread over 13 cities/regencies in
South Kalimantan. Of these, 6 died.

Government officials continue to push residents to clean up
mosquito-breeding sites and trash in order to control the vector
mosquito. Other control efforts continue to be carried out by
counselling about the signs of early dengue fever illness, to be able
to detect [infection] early so that [these early cases] could be
treated quickly, both through the community health centres and in the
hospitals in order to avoid death, said Rosihan Adhani.

The country is experiencing an outbreak of dengue fever, with almost
600 cases since January [2008], according to a humanitarian
organization. Health authorities agree the mosquito-borne disease has
witnessed a recent surge. It has left one dead so far this year [2008].

The Department of Public Health (DPH) has said it encourages members
of the public to control mosquito-breeding spots, and will issue a
warning if infections continue to rise through the monsoon season.

Rising trend
------------
The Maldivian Red Crescent Association, a fledgling NGO affiliated to
the International Committee of the Red Crescent, has published a
Worldcue travel alert this week on the dengue increase. [Worldcue is
a global protection system that employs advanced mapping,
notification, and intelligence capabilities to make emergency and
crisis response more efficient and effective. - CopyEd.MJ]

Noting the rising number of cases in the Maldives, along with the
rising rate of chikungunya, a similar infectious disease, the alert
warns travellers and locals to "avoid exposure to mosquitoes."

A total of 581 cases were reported from the start of this year [2008]
to 17 May, according to DPH figures, with 62 of these considered
serious. DPH director Geela Ali told Minivan News cases have
increased since mid-February [2008]. "The rising trend has been
because the rain patterns facilitate breeding," she said, adding:
"Congestion in Male, and people going out and back into the country,
make it easier for the disease to spread."

But, Geela added, the number of infections is still below that of
2006, when 6 died from the illness. Last year [2007] numbers were
low, with only 1667 cases.

There have also been 263 cases of chikungunya [infection] this year
[2008]. They have been spread over 10 atolls, but two-thirds were in
the 2 islands of Alif Dhaal Maamigili and Alif Dhaal Fenfushi.

The majority of dengue cases were reported in Male, with 393 treated
at the capital's Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH). But Geela
says not all patients were living in Male, as the number also
reflected those travelling to the capital for diagnosis.

As one of the world's most overcrowded cities, Male is vulnerable to
the disease, which is spread by a particular type of mosquito.

Managing director of Male's ADK hospital Mohamed Affal told Minivan
News dengue fever usually increases in the rainy season, but is often
especially prevalent in Male due to construction work. "There are
difficulties in construction sites, especially those left for long
periods of time, to be reached by authorities (for treatment). The
pockets of water give very good conditions for (mosquito) breeding," he said.

There were over 200 construction sites in Male last year [2007], and
the figure is increasing. DPH director-general Fathimath Rasheeda
says the department has inspected streets and construction sites in
Male, Hulhumale, and Villingilli, and treated some areas.

The department also encourages members of the public to help control
mosquito-breeding spots by draining water containers and destroying
discarded containers and items of rubbish. [passage omitted]

that there was a delay in providing the information resulting from
the examination, and affirmed that there have been no other deaths
under investigation that were suspected to be due to the disease
[dengue]. In 2007, 7875 classical dengue cases were confirmed in the

Manoel Novaes Hospital, in Itabuna.

Up to the present, there have been 6 [dengue-related] deaths in the
state and, with the new victims the number increases to 4 suspected
cases that await the results of tests for evidence [of dengue virus infection].

of Health of Itabuna, Jose Roberto Goes, this year [2008], 904 dengue
cases have been reported in the city. Of this total, there were only
189 with laboratory test results with confirmation of 29 cases. The 2
deaths created a climate of fear in the municipality. Starting on
Monday [16 Jun 2008] the Municipal Secretariat of Health of Itabuna
will make available an area in the Annex to Hospital Sao Lucas in
order to attend to patients with suspected dengue.

Despite the measure, the secretary Jesuino Oliveira says that the
municipality does not face an alarming situation. He warns, however,
that it is necessary that the population help combat the mosquito. "I
do not see an outbreak concern, but it is important that the
population becomes aware of the need for necessary care, " Jesuino
Oliveira stressed.

The latest index of [_Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquito] infestation in
the municipality is from April 2008, when it reached 7.67 percent.
The municipal secretariat should provide the data for the month of
May next week [week of 22 Jun 2008].
