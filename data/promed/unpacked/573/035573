The Council of Agriculture has imposed a 4-day ban on killing chickens, ducks and geese in a bid to prevent the spread of the avian flu among poultry; more than half a million birds have been culled due to infections.

Taiwan announced on 23 Jan 2015 a ban on the killing of chickens, ducks and geese at the nation's 100 slaughterhouses for a 2nd time starting this weekend as an avian influenza outbreak continues to affect more farms.

Focus Taiwan reports that Chen Bao-ji, the head of the Council of Agriculture, said that the ban will last 4 days this time, unlike last time's 2 days, starting at noon on Sat 24 Jan 2015 and continue until noon on 28 Jan 2015.

During this period, there will be no killing at the slaughterhouses, which will undergo an across-the-board disinfection. Sales of poultry in 4 wholesale markets in Taipei, Taichung and Fengshan and Gangshan in Kaohsiung will also be suspended.

The COA's Department of Animal Husbandry said that during this period, chickens, ducks and geese that were previously slaughtered and refrigerated will be sold, adding that the amount in storage was enough to meet the demand.

The COA 1st confirmed the infection of avian flu at a chicken farm in southern Taiwan's Pingtung county on 9 Jan 2015. It then announced a ban on killing geese and ducks at slaughterhouses for 2 days until noon on 14 Jan 2015 and took other measures, such as inspecting poultry farms and ordering disinfection routines. However, the number of farms and poultry affected continued to rise after the ban.

As of 6:00 pm on 22 Jan 2015, the COA has confirmed that 370 fowl farms in 8 cities and counties in Taiwan have been infected with various strains of avian flu virus, including a new type of H5N2, as well as H5N8 and H5N3 that had not been found in Taiwan before.

According to Focus Taiwan, more than half a million poultry have been culled at affected farms as the government tries to stem the spread of the virus

Another type of bird flu has hit the lone turkey farm in [Kerala] state here. Over 160 birds in the farm died since Sunday [18 Jan 2015], and the disease has been identified as influenza type A.

However, the district officer of the Animal Husbandry Department here [Kollam], Chandraprasad, said that humans would not be infected by the strain. "Though the disease is common in farms, the treatment is not very effective. Besides, it can spread among birds rapidly," Chandraprasad said.

The officials of the department will meet on Thu [22 Jan 2015] to decide on an action plan, including culling. As a precaution, visitors and sales of poultry have been banned. The dead birds have been scientifically burnt inside the farm itself. The farm in Kureepuzha has around 8000 turkeys. The incident was noticed on Sunday [18 Jan 2015] when many birds showed weakness. The samples sent to the government labs in Tiruvalla and Thiruvananthapuram confirmed the disease.

The recent spread of the more dangerous H5N1 spared the district, while the neighbouring districts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha incurred heavy poultry losses.
