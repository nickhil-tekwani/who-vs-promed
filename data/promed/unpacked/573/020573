China is not the only Asia country to have a problem with the illegal
use of formaldehyde as a food preservative. For example, in
Indonesia, the most serious examples are reportedly in street vendors
or food intended for local consumption rather than in food intend for
export. News stories have reported on the use of formaldehyde to
prolong the fresh appearance of fish. Apparently, it even keeps the
eye of fish appearing "clear and fresh." Other news reports speak of
using formaldehyde on chicken carcasses and in tofu.

Regarding the moderator's comment: "However, they should be followed,
as cancer is often associated with formaldehyde exposure," this may
be premature.

While formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen (as classified by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC), it is a
multi-mechanism carcinogen, with a correspondingly complex
dose-response model.

Before recommending that a nation with limited economic resources
initiate health monitoring for an extremely small exposed population
(with the consequent very low probability of detecting any real
effects), it would be prudent 1st to establish (quantitatively) the
likely exposure and to use the available tools to predict the
corresponding excess risk. Only in the case that the predicted excess
risk is sufficiently high that there is a reasonable likelihood of
detection in this population would it be sensible to initiate a
multi-year monitoring program.

[Dr. Young's comment regarding dose is appropriate. However, we don't
know how high the level of formaldehyde was or whether lower levels
are in other candies that may represent a longer exposure at a lower
dose. - Mod.TG]
