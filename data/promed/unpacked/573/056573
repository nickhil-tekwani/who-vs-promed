EPIDEMIC HEMORRHAGIC FEVER - CHINA (JIANGSU) (02)

The previous posting (20070113.0179) should be read with some caution
at different points:
(1) If the 2 Chinese cases suffered indeed from "epidemic hemorrhagic
fever", i.e. one of the more than 30 synonyms for hantavirus
infection, the suggestive clinics and history should be confirmed by
serology, particularly a positive ELISA IgM or equivalent.
(2) In China, most infections are due to the prototype Hantaan virus
(HTNV), spread by _Apodemus agrarius_ (striped field mouse), but
almost as often to another related murine serotype, Seoul virus
(SEOV), spread by wild rats _Rattus rattus_ and _R. norvegicus_. The
former infection is mostly rural, and the latter mainly urban, but
considerable overlap exists, particularly in China. HTNV infections
are as a rule more severe than SEOV infections.
Given the fact that both patients developed severe oligo- or anuria,
and at least one (or both?) needed dialysis, a HTNV infection is more
likely, but can only be confirmed by specific confirmation tests,
such as RT-PCR and/or neutralisations tests. Classical serology
suffers from substantial cross-reaction, heightened by the fact that
in early (1980's) literature, including Chinese literature, no real
distinction was made between the 2 infections. Adding to the
confusion is the fact that in Mandarin, the word for "rat" often
means "rodent", as may be the case in the next-to-last line of the
previous ProMED posting.
(3) If the 2 Chinese cases suffered indeed from hantavirus infection,
_a fortiori_ if this was a HTNV infection, then of course no
antibiotic treatment is indicated at all, but the antiviral drug
ribavirin may be life-saving, especially when given intravenously and
early enough in the clinical course. Experience with ribavirin i.v.
was gained mainly on Chinese patients during HTNV outbreaks.
(4) Both patients presented with "upper respiratory tract infection",
and one with chest pain, developing apparently each time well before
the oligo- or anuria, suggesting it had to do not with secondary
fluid overload, but perhaps with primary lung involvement on
admission. This is seen not only in American Sin nombre virus cases,
but in some European Puumala virus cases as well. Details of RX chest
on admission of both Chinese cases would be most interesting, since
to my knowledge there are no published reports of primary lung
involvement in HTNV or SEOV infections.
