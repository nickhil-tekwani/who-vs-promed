AMANTADINE FOR INFLUENZA (5)
============================
In my opinion you should be using rimantidine for prophylaxis and
treatment of influenza, not amantidine, as rimantidine has less
dependence on renal function, and virtually none of the CNS [neurological]
side effects that are so common with amantidine in the major risk group --
the elderly.
