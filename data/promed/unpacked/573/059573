_Salmonella_ sickens up to 50 in Denmark and Sweden; food source suspected
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danish authorities are investigating _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup infections that are related to an outbreak in Sweden. In Denmark, 24 people have fallen sick since late March 2021 while in Sweden, there are 22 confirmed patients since mid-April 2021. An international outbreak investigation is ongoing and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is helping with cross-border coordination.

Between 26 Mar 2021 and 26 Apr 2021, 24 cases of _Salmonella_ Braenderup have been reported to the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark. Those affected live all over the country with 17 women and 7 men aged 1 to 90 years old sick. The median age is 67 years of age. Work is underway to clarify the cause of the outbreak and identify the source of infection, which is suspected to be a widely distributed food. Whole genome sequencing found the strains were sequence type 22 and closely related to each other, meaning a single source is likely.

Earlier in May 2021, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkh√§lsomyndigheten) reported that a _Salmonella_ Braenderup outbreak had affected 14 people in less than 2 weeks in 10 different regions of the country. Sweden now has 22 confirmed cases, 17 females and 5 males, between less than 1 to 91 years old. The median age is 40. Onset of disease ranged from 13 Apr 2021 to 1 May 2021.

The Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and the Public Health Agency of Sweden are involved in the outbreak investigation.
