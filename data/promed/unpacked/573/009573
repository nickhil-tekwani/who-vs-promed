H5N1 prevalence may surpass 10 percent in Egyptian backyard, market poultry
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An Egyptian surveillance study found that while H5N1 avian flu viruses were uncommon on commercial poultry farms, more than 10 percent of backyard and live-market birds harbored the virus, according to a report in the Journal of Virology [see comment]. Throughout 2009 Egyptian and German scientists took tracheal and cloacal swabs from 22 024 farm poultry, of which 23 birds (0.1 percent) were positive by polymerase chain reaction for the H5N1 virus. In comparison, 151 (10.5 percent) of 1435 birds in backyard flocks and 108 (11.4 percent) of 944 birds in live-bird markets were infected. Incidence was highest in spring and summer, particularly in backyard birds. The team also sampled 1297 wild birds of 28 different species in 2009 and 2010 and detected no H5N1. They conclude that backyard flocks may play a key role in maintaining H5N1 in Egyptian poultry, especially in live-bird markets.

[The report above was derived from the abstract of the following paper:
Elham F El-Zoghby, Mona M Aly, Soad A Nasef , Mohamed K Hassan et al: Surveillance on A/H5N1 virus in domestic poultry and wild birds in Egypt. Virology Journal 2013; 10: 203 doi:10.1186/1743-422X-10-203 (http://www.virologyj.com/content/pdf/1743-422X-10-203.pdf).

The following 2 chapters are copied from the paper's original abstract:

"Results
--------
In this surveillance, A/H5N1 was detected from 0.1 percent (n=23) of examined commercial poultry farms, 10.5 percent (n=151) of backyard birds and 11.4 percent (n=108) of LBMs [live bird markets] but no wild bird tested positive for A/H5N1. The virus was detected from domestic poultry year-round with higher incidence in the warmer months of summer and spring particularly in backyard birds. Outbreaks were recorded mostly in Lower Egypt where 95.7 percent (n=22), 68.9 percent (n=104) and 52.8 percent (n=57) of positive commercial farms, backyards and LBMs were detected, respectively. Higher prevalence (56 percent, n=85) was reported in backyards that had mixed chickens and waterfowl together in the same vicinity and LBMs that had waterfowl (76 percent, n=82).

Conclusion
----------
Our findings indicated broad circulation of the endemic A/H5N1 among poultry in 2009 in Egypt. In addition, the epidemiology of A/H5N1 has changed over time with outbreaks occurring in the warmer months of the year. Backyard waterfowl may play a role as a reservoir and/or source of A/H5N1 particularly in LBMs. The virus has been established in poultry in the Nile Delta where major metropolitan areas, dense human population and poultry stocks are concentrated. Continuous surveillance, tracing the source of live birds in the markets and integration of multifaceted strategies and global collaboration are needed to control the spread of the virus in Egypt."

Since 2006 and as of June 2013, Egypt has reported 173 human cases of HPAI H5N1, of which 63 died.

In its annual OIE report for 2012, Egypt reported 12 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry. Mass routine vaccination of poultry was, reportedly, applied. For further statistical data, please refer to the full report at http://tinyurl.com/nsjfxsf.

Confirmed human cases/deaths have, so far, been reported during 2013 from the following 5 countries:
Bangladesh (1/1); Cambodia (11/8); China (2/2); Egypt (4/3); Vietnam (2/1). Though the disease is also considered to be endemic in Indonesia (since 2005 there have been 192 confirmed human cases, of which 160 died), no human cases have been reported there yet during 2013; in 2012, Indonesia reported 9 cases (all died). - Mod.AS
