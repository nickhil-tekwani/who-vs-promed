Wildlife pathologist Melissa Miller and her team, clad in rubber
gloves, hospital scrubs, and big rubber boots, hovered over the
animal, looking for gunshot wounds, shark bites, research tags, any
visible marks. The scientists hoped their examination of the male
California sea otter would reveal what's killing the threatened sea
mammals.
The 4-foot-long, 65-pound adult male was found washed up on the rocks
3 days earlier at Pismo beach, south of San Luis Obispo, and driven
to a laboratory here for a necropsy. Radiographs (X-rays) showed no
trauma, just 2 toes likely broken a while ago in a fight.
Miller took samples from various organs, tissues, and fluids,
carefully labeling them for future reference. Like others whose
carcasses were found quickly, this one's hide was to be prepared for
museums or schools to use in teaching.
Researchers hope that by also looking at the otters' environment they
could help the animals recover and keep a key stretch of the ocean
healthy. California sea otters, with their luxuriously soft pelts,
were hunted to near extinction by the early 20th century, but have
since recovered somewhat, reaching a recent population high of 2377
off the California coast in 1995. Since then, however, their numbers
have at best stagnated, and at worst decreased, along much of their
range, which once extended all along the west coast, and now is
limited to California's central coast. A survey in the fall of 2002
put their numbers at 2202.
The mammals live up to 2 miles offshore, mostly in the forests of
kelp that are home to many species. Despite concerted efforts to
figure out what's killing them, it's not entirely clear. Sharks and
orcas are among their few predators. Fishing nets have killed otters
in the past, and may still, to some extent. Occasionally, one gets
shot. Many of those dying are adults in their prime reproductive
years, from about 3 to 9 years old.
The US. Fish and Wildlife Service, among other agencies, has been
studying the problem intensely. After 16 years of delays and false
starts, the Federal agency this month released a new otter recovery
plan, which blames human activities for the decline in the California
sea otter population. It recommends reducing oil spills, ocean
pollutants, and entanglements with boat motors and fishing gear. It
calls for more research to determine why otters haven't recovered
after being named a threatened species in 1977, and it sets a higher
threshold for when the population can be considered recovered enough
to lose protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act: 3090
animals, up from 2650 set decades ago. The plan says the otter
population would have to reach 8400 animals before the species would
be no longer listed as "depleted" under the Marine Mammal Protection
act.
"They are an important sentinel of what's happening in nearshore
marine health," Miller said. "It could have broader implications for
other Marine Mammals and for us. We eat the same foods; we swim in
the same waters."
And without otters, the marine ecosystem can change significantly.
For example, sea urchins are a favorite otter food, but when otters
are gone, the urchins are unchecked and decimate kelp forests.
Scientists do what they can to understand the playful animals while
they're still alive. They tag some, count them each spring and fall,
and study their eating and resting habits. They also study their
carcasses. Every dead otter found gets some kind of exam, frequently
here at the State Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife
Veterinary Care and Research Center, to try to determine the cause
of death.
The same parts of every examined otter are taken to build a standard
bank of otter parts collected over many years. That gives scientists
something to compare and refer to if they discover a new otter
affliction. They also take photos for teaching purposes. For the most
part, this otter appeared healthy. "If he had a chronic disease, he
hid it well," Miller said.
Miller did, however, find that the otter had very wet lungs, which
led her to conclude he drowned. For the sea-going mammals, drowning
is frequent, but it's often triggered by something else, such as
being hit by a boat.
Infectious disease seems to be one of the biggest culprits in otter
deaths. Disease has always claimed otter lives, but recent research
by Miller has shown that a protozoan parasite, _Toxoplasma gondii_,
typically found on land, is more common in water than previously
recognized and is finding its way into sea otters.
The parasite causes encephalitis that is killing some otters. More
than 60 percent of the dead otters examined are found to have
antibodies to this parasite. Research by veterinarian Christine
Kreuder, who like Miller is affiliated with the University of
California, Davis, shows that a high number are dying of heart
disease, odd for a wildlife population. The heart disease is thought
to be caused by a virus that inflames heart tissue, causing scarring
that leads to heart failure. It can also happen when the immune
system starts attacking itself, which could be triggered by bacteria.
But scientists also think the dead otters they retrieve -- mostly
those that have washed up on shore -- are not representative of the
entire otter population.
"All we really know is what we see washed up on the beach, and we're
suspicious that's biased," said Jim Estes a researcher with the US
Geological Survey. "There's a concern that animals dying from certain
reasons are less likely to be deposited on land."
An example: otters that drown in fishing nets and are discarded may
sink and be eaten by predators. Also, otters that wash up from
roughly Carmel south to Estero Bay can't be recovered, because the
shoreline is too rocky, leaving a 100-mile-long gap in the research
area.
For now, the male on the stainless steel table joins the many otters
whose deaths are a mystery.
