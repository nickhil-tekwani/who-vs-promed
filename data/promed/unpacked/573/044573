MYSTERY DISEASE - HAWAII, USA (6)
=================================
[This is in reply to "Mystery disease - Hawaii (5)", posted 9 March,
promed archive.960311]
Ray Weinstein's assertion that the presence of Ehrlichia equi
in dogs is not supported either by the article I cited in Journal of
Emerging Infectious Diseases (Vol. 2, No. 1) or any other literature is
certainly contradicted within that very article. Under the section titled
Microbiology of Human Granulocytic Ehrlighia and E. equi, the authors state
in part.."Evidence is accumulating to support the premise that a single
Ehrlichia species is the etiologic agent of a granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis
of humans, horses, and dogs." Further along in the paragraph it is stated
that.."naturally occurring canine E. equi infections have been transmitted
to horses that had developed equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and E. equi
has been transmitted experimentally by injecting equine blood into
susceptible dogs." The article also specifes that 16S rDNA sequences of
isolates from naturally infected horses and dogs in borth Sweden as well as
several locations in the U.S. are identical to HGE.
No doubt the authors of this article and/or other more qualified experts
than I can further enlighten us on this topic.
