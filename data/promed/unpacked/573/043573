Fowl typhoid disease, which does not affect humans, has been detected
in northern Belize, according to an official press release issued
today [15 Sep 2011]. The Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA)
has implemented an emergency poultry disease control measure upon
receiving official confirmation from the United States Department of
Agriculture laboratory in Ames, Iowa (an OIE Reference Laboratory)
that poultry specimens have tested positive for fowl typhoid in the
Orange Walk district.

This is not the 1st time that fowl typhoid has been reported in
Belize, as the last outbreak occurred in 1986, when both commercial
and backyard poultry were affected throughout the country. Although
vaccines are available to control the disease, BAHA, along with the
poultry industry, has decided to continue to prohibit vaccination. As
a result, emergency control measures are being taken. Fowl typhoid is
strictly a bird disease affecting mostly chickens and turkeys.

The government's competent authorities have set up a coordinated
incident command structure with the industry to contain the outbreak.
All birds considered infected have been destroyed and buried on site.
Biosecurity has been stepped up at all levels throughout the area
where the outbreak occurred; movement controls are in place, farmers
are being educated about the disease, and BAHA is maintaining an early
warning and response system. Inspection of poultry farms before
slaughter of birds along with heightened inspection and strict
sanitation measures at all poultry establishments are also in place.

Given the effective rapid coordinated response and surveillance
system, it is not expected that fowl typhoid will spread. As a result,
the impact is not anticipated to compare to 1986, when there were
major economic and social effects on a national scale.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[All birds, especially young adults and mature birds, are susceptible
to this acute to chronic disease. The causative agent is _Salmonella
gallinarum_, a rod-shaped bacterium which produces no spore or
capsule.

It is spread by biological vectors and through the egg. The incubation
period is 4-5 days.

Contaminated feed and water and fomites (trucks, workers and equipment
etc), will transmit the organism. Fomites are inanimate objects which
can carry infectious organisms and spread disease. The organism is
species specific (occurs in birds only). Horizontal spread occurs from
bird to bird.

It has been eradicated from most commercial poultry flocks, but is
still common in backyard flocks.

Infected birds have elevated temperature 109-111 F (44-45 C), pale
combs and wattles, shrunken combs, greenish-yellow diarrhea,
depression, and/or anemia.

Laboratory (necropsy, serology, microbial isolation and
identification) monitoring is needed for a definitive diagnosis.
Culture _Salmonella_ and determine antibiotic sensitivity. It
simulates paratyphoid, pullorum, and cholera _E. coli_.

Prevention consists of vector control and a program of testing of
breeders for positive serum and destroying positive breeders.
Prevention usually involves feeding pellets, the use of chlorine in
the water and employing vaccines from non pathogenic _S. gallinarum_.

Treatment consists of Neomycin or sulfaquinoxalin.
