COVID-19 deaths tied to US life expectancy drop
-----------------------------------------------
COVID-19 deaths in 2020 led to the biggest life expectancy drop in the United States since World War II, according to a new report from a federal research group.

In global COVID developments, cases rose for the 4th week in a row, led by the more transmissible BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [6 Jul 2022] in its weekly pandemic update.

Impact from COVID death varied by race
--------------------------------------
The life expectancy drop was detailed in provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Life expectancy declined 1.5 years from 2019 to 2020, from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.3 years in 2020. Life expectancy during that period was the lowest since 2003 and represented the biggest 1-year drop since World War II, when it declined 2.9 years between 1942 and 1943.

COVID deaths contributed 74% to the recent life expectancy decline. Other factors included rises in deaths from accidents or unintentional injuries, part of which included drug overdose deaths, which reached an all-time high in 2020. The CDC said other contributors included homicide, diabetes, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

The team found racial differences in life expectancy declines, with Hispanic Americans, especially males, experiencing the largest decline in 2020. The group typically has longer life expectancy than Black or White Americans.

COVID's role in the life expectancy drop also varied by race. The disease was responsible for 90% of the drop in the Hispanic population, 68% in the White population, and 59% in the Black population.

In another analysis that sized up COVID deaths, a new report from National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers said prior to omicron variant circulation, COVID-19 was the 3rd leading cause of death, only topped by heart disease and cancer.

In other US developments:
• For the week ending [30 Jun 2022], children's COVID-19 cases rose over the previous week, with nearly 76 000 reported, according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The increase comes against the backdrop of a rising proportion of more transmissible BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants and US activity that has been holding steady at an elevated level since late May [2022].
• A new poll from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 54% of Americans feel that their lives are somewhat the same as before the pandemic, with 12% reporting that they feel completely the same, and 34% saying they are not the same.
• The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [6 Jul 2022] said it revised the emergency use authorization for Paxlovid to allow state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe the drug to eligible patients with certain limitations to allow appropriate patient assessment, such as a review of patient health records for kidney or liver problems and all medications the patient is taking.

Global cases, subvariants rise
------------------------------
At a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing today [6 Jul 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said new weekly COVID cases have risen nearly 30% over the past 2 weeks, with 4 of 6 world regions experiencing rises in the last week.

BA.4 and BA.5 are driving waves in Europe and the Americas, he said, adding that countries like India are seeing a new sublineage called BA.2.75, which the WHO is following.

Tedros warned that reduced testing not only obscures the true picture of virus evolution and disease burden, it also means that new treatments aren't given early enough. Other concerns include lack of access to new treatments for low- and middle-income countries, declining protection from vaccines, and growing numbers of people with long COVID from each pandemic wave.

Regarding people suffering from long-term effects, Tedros said, "This obviously impacts individuals and their families but it also puts an extra burden on health systems, the wider economy and society-at-large."

In its weekly situation report, the WHO said cases rose in the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, Europe, and Western Pacific regions, with more than 4.6 million cases reported last week. The 5 countries reporting the most cases included France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Brazil.

Deaths last week declined by 12% but were up in the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia regions.

The proportions of BA.4 and BA.5 continue to increase and are responsible for 37% and 52% of sequenced omicron samples, respectively. The rate of increase for BA.4 is not as high as for BA.5.

Regarding BA.2.75, Soumya Swaminathan, MD, the WHO's chief scientist, said in a Twitter video clip that the subvariant was first identified in India and about 10 other countries and that there are still limited sequences available for analysis. So far, scientists know that it has a few mutations on the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of the virus.

Swaminathan said it's still too early to know if BA.2.75 has immune-evasion properties or produces a more clinically severe illness. "So we have to wait and see and of course we are tracking it," she said, adding that the WHO's technical advisory group on virus evolution is constantly looking at data from around the world.

[2] US: COVID-19-associated deaths
Date: Wed 6 Jul 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/07/1-8-us-deaths-during-pandemic-ascribed-covid-19


1 in 8 US deaths during pandemic ascribed to COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 US deaths from March 2020 to October 2021 and was the 3rd leading cause of death, estimates a study published yesterday [5 Jul 2022] in JAMA Internal Medicine.

National Cancer Institute researchers analyzed national death certificate data and provisional 2021 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data beyond October 2021 were excluded because they were incomplete; thus, the analysis doesn't include deaths from the omicron variant period.

Leading cause of death in middle age
------------------------------------
Over the entire study period, the leading causes of death were heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%). From March to December 2020, 2.88 million people died in the United States, slightly more than the 2.86 million who died from January to October 2021. The number of deaths rose across all age-groups except for those younger than 1 year.

In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the 2 top causes of death in the country, leading to 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, at 350 000 deaths.

Among people aged 55 years and older, deaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 led to the most deaths in both 2020 and 2021. Among those 85 years and older, COVID-19 was the 2nd leading cause of death in 2020, at 110 000 (12.8%) of deaths, while it was the 3rd leading cause in 2021, at 69 000 (8.9%) of deaths.

While COVID-19 was the 4th leading cause of death among Americans 45-54 years old in 2020 (17 000 [10.4%]), it ranked 1st in 2021 (30 000 [16.8%]). In both time spans, accidents were the leading cause of death among people aged 1 to 44 years.

Relative to 2020, in 2021, COVID-19 rose from the 5th (6100 deaths) to the 2nd (13 000) leading cause of death among people 35-44 years old and took the 4th-leading spot among those 25-34 years old (5000) and 15-24 (1100).

Indirect role in increasing deaths from other causes
----------------------------------------------------
"The increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020, perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups," the researchers wrote.

The authors noted that the pandemic may also have increased deaths from other causes, such as heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and accidents.

"Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes," they wrote. "Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups."

Can long COVID lead to death? A new analysis suggests it could
---------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC is beginning to look at death certificates that indicate more than 100 people who died had long COVID. ... Long COVID and the health complications associated with it could lead to death. It's unclear whether the people who died had underlying health issues, whether long COVID was the cause of their deaths or whether it was a contributing factor.

... state and federal health officials work to understand the significance and severity of long COVID, which may affect as many as 30% of people who contract the virus, according to studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Two years into the pandemic, relatively little is known about long COVID's prevalence, how to diagnose it or the best practices for treatment. ... - Mod.LK]
