Two more questions
-------------------
I am concerned with Dr. Calisher's principal presumption [see West Nile
virus surveillance - USA: Questions (03) that "West Nile virus (WNV)
entered the U.S. a year ago". What is the basis for making such a statement
or drawing this conclusion? WNV may have been here for the past 5 or 10
years. Or 20. It may be responsible for a few or many more cases of
undiagnosed encephalitis than we are aware during the past 10 or 20 years.
The fact is that the epidemiological and epizootical information from which
investigators are drawing conclusions has arisen largely since 1999, when,
fortuitously someone tested for WNV in some dead birds. And then only
reluctantly. There are no systematic data before last year of which I am
aware. So, I have some questions of my own.
1. When did WNV emerge in the Western hemisphere?
2. Do we have any retrospective clinical or veterinary material that could
perhaps shed some light?
Perhaps a more systematic look at previously undiagnosed encephalitides or
previously undiagnosed avian mortality along the Eastern seaboard can lend
a bit more perspective. It may have been among us for longer than we know,
merely simmering along. In which case our view of and actions in response
to this emergence would change substantially.
