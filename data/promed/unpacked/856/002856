[OIE Handistatus II shows that Brazil reported between 1 & 20 CSF
outbreaks every year from 1996 (the first year of Handistatus II) through
2001, with no reports in 2002. In 2000 the states of Paraiba & Pernambuco
were involved, and in 2002 more than 70 000 head of swine were
vaccinated. Strange that we have not carried any of those reports on
ProMED. - Mod.JW]
