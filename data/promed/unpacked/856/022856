Headlines
- Technical Advisory Group on Polio Eradication in Afghanistan met on 25-26 Aug 2019 to discuss and propose recommendations on a range of thematic areas in combatting the ongoing wild poliovirus transmission in the region, including: access issues, ban on house-to-house campaigns, optimizing community engagement, and geographic prioritization.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 5 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases;
- Nigeria - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive healthy contact sample;
- Democratic Republic of the Congo - 6 cVDPV2 cases;
- Ghana - 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case has been reported in the past week. There are 13 WPV1 cases reported in 2019. There were 21 WPV1 cases reported in 2018.
- No WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week.

Pakistan
- 5 wild polioviruses type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week: 1 each from Hangu, Bannu, and North Waziristan districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; and, 2 from Hyderabad district, Sindh province. The onsets of paralysis were on [28 Jul 2019, 2 Aug 2019, 21 Jul 2019, 20 Jul 2019, and 5 Aug 2019] respectively. There are 58 WPV1 cases in 2019, and 12 WPV1 cases were reported in 2018.
- No WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week.

Nigeria
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported in the past week. There are 16 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019. There were 34 cVDPV2 cases in 2018.
- 1 cVDPV2-positive healthy contact sample was reported in the past week from Ibaji district, Kogi province. The sample was collected on [24 Jul 2019].

Lake Chad
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018), and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Ghana
- No cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. There is 1 cVDPV2 case in 2019.
- 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was collected from Accra district, Greater Accra Region. The sample was collected on [13 Aug 2019]. Earlier, a cVDPV2 was isolated from an environment sample collected on [11 Jun 2019] from the Northern province. Both the isolates are linked to the Jigawa cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria.
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across West Africa remains high.
- Surveillance is being strengthened in neighbouring Togo, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

[The newly confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic disease in Pakistan were reported earlier (see Poliomyelitis update (70): Pakistan (KP, SD) 20190826.6641139). While there have been no newly confirmed cases reported from Afghanistan this week nor have there been positive environmental samples reported from either Pakistan or Afghanistan, it doesn't mean the virus is not still circulating, just that there aren't new confirmations. This year (2019) is clearly a major year for WPV activity in the remaining endemic areas, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

As for cVDPVs, the number of cases continues to grow with 6 newly confirmed cases, all coming from the DR Congo. That being said, there is now a positive environmental sample in the capital city area of Ghana (previously it was identified in the Northern Province), and Nigeria. Again, the absence of newly confirmed cases in countries that have recently reported activity (either AFP associated cVDPVs or positive environmental samples, or positive samples from asymptomatic individuals) should not categorically be interpreted as interrupted transmission of the cVDPVs.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 19 countries: 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 2 in the Western Pacific.
