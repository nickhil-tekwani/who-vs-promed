Surveys for '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma solani' associated with bois noir disease and for Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma (both EPPO A2 List) were performed in southern Russia. In 2012-2018, more than 600 samples of grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) were tested by molecular analysis. This survey confirmed the presence of '_Ca._ P. solani' in Crimea. The presence of Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma was not detected. However, [its] vector _Scaphoideus titanus_ was detected.

Surveys for '_Ca._ P. mali' (associated with apple proliferation) and '_Ca._ P. pyri' (associated with pear decline; both EPPO A2 List) were conducted in 2016-2018 in central and southern Russia. In total, 372 samples of pear (_Pyrus communis_), 355 of apple (_Malus domestica_), and 130 of quince (_Cydonia oblonga_) were analyzed by molecular tests. One sample tested positive for '_Ca._ P. pyri', detected in a research station. The infected tree was uprooted, and further testing showed that the site was then pest free. All commercial orchards are considered free from both phytoplasmas

[Bois noir (BN) is caused by a phytoplasma belonging to the stolbur taxonomic group (16SrXII-A; type member_Ca._ P. solani 16SrXII). Symptoms include reduced growth; leaf yellowing or discolouration; downward rolling of leaves; and reduced quality and quantity of fruit. The planthopper _Hyalesthes obsoletus_ is considered the most important vector for the stolbur group in parts of Europe. It feeds only occasionally on grapevine and actually prefers herbaceous weeds, which, therefore, are important pathogen reservoirs. Stolbur phytoplasmas, alone or in coinfections, have been reported to affect a range of dicotyledoneous, as well as a few monocot hosts (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. It is caused by _Ca._ P. vitis belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed driven by a northward spread of the vector _Scaphoideus titanus_ due to climate warming.

The causal agents of apple proliferation (AP; _Ca._ P. mali) and pear decline (PD; _Ca._ P. pyri) are members of the 16SrX apple prolif taxonomic group. They cause serious diseases in the respective crops with quantitative as well as qualitative losses in fruit production. _Cacopsylla melanoneura_ has been implicated as a vector. Another member of the group (_Ca._ P. prunorum) causes European stone fruit yellows.

Phytoplasmas can be spread with infected plant material (tissue cultures, grafting) and by planthopper (psyllid) vectors. Disease outbreaks tend to occur in cycles, being favoured by hot, dry conditions, which stimulate vector migration into crops. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include phytosanitation, vector control, removal of pathogen and/or vector reservoirs (volunteer crop plants, weeds), use of certified clean planting/propagation material, as well as resistant crop varieties.
