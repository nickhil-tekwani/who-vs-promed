Bluetongue, Palestinian Autonomous Territories
----------------------------------------------
Information received on 07 Oct 2012 from Dr Khawla Salem Njoum, Director of Epidemiology Department, General Directorate of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Ramallah, Palestinian Autonomous Territories

Summary
Report type: follow-up report No. 1
Date of start of the event: 19 Sep 2012
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 19 Sep 2012
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: Dec 2011
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Bluetongue virus
Serotype: pending
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
Related reports: immediate notification (28 Sep 2012)

New outbreaks (3): [locations indicated on the interactive map at the source URL]

Outbreak 1: Qusra, Nablus, West Bank
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Sep 2012
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 230 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the animals look healthy.

Outbreak 2: Jayous, Morouj Jayous, Qalqilia, West Bank
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Sep 2012
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 675 / 69 / 15 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the animals are located beyond the separation wall, where the area is wet and full of mosquitoes. Its location delays the measures taken by Palestinian Authority, because it needs a permission to enter this area from Israeli side.

Outbreak 3: Akapa, Tulkarim, West Bank
Date of start of the outbreak: 01 Oct 2012
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 330 / 14 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the farms are close to the separation wall and have the same criteria of Qalqilia outbreaks.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 1235 / 84 / 16 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; illegal movement of animals; vectors

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak (s) [see comment]

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Traditionally, local Awassi sheep in Israel and PA are rather resistant to BTV, in difference with the susceptible exotic breeds, primarily European mutton breeds, their crosses, and the Assaf dairy sheep (genetically based upon the local Awassi sheep crossed with East-Friesian dairy sheep). From a reliable source we are informed that the 4 affected sheep flocks in PA are a collection of cross/mix sheep breeds. This may explain the apparently low morbidity of the (unvaccinated) sheep.

According to the notification, vaccination in response to the outbreaks is contemplated. Details on the candidate vaccine, such as its serotype(s) composition, are requested (see commentary to item 2). - Mod.AS]

Pregnant young sheep, typical clinical signs (picture available).

3. Location: Northern district, Wadi Ara, village Kafr Kara.
Mutton-type sheep, typical clinical signs.
830 susceptible ewes, 100 cases. 8 mortalities
400 lambs, 8 cases, no mortality
30 rams, 5 cases, 1 mortality.

[The typical clinical signs observed in the above sheep flocks do not leave much room to doubts about the diagnosis. Laboratory confirmation and particularly serotype identification are anticipated with interest and will be posted when they become available.

The above "Hachaklait" source mentions also a solitary suspected BT case in a 14 month heifer in the southern district (the village Beer Tuvya). The animal showed, among its clinical manifestations, uveitis; the differential diagnosis included malignant cattarhal fever (MCF), IBR, bluetongue virus (BTV), and listeriosis.

According to the findings of surveillance undertaken by the Kimron Veterinary Institute between 1980-1995 in sentinel dairy cattle herds throughout Israel, many young bovines underwent subclinical BTV infection during the summer and fall months. In some farms and years, 50-90 per cent of the animals (tested in June and December) seroconverted. Thus, positive serology or virus identification of non-typical clinical cases in cattle in Israel (and elsewhere in the region), during the BTV season, are not necessarily indicative for a case of clinical bluetongue and should not exclude other etiological factors.

Between 1951 and 2006, 5 BTV serotypes have been identified in Israel/PA: serotypes 2,4,6,10, and 16. Clinical BTV was seen primarily, almost exclusively in sheep. Since 2008, new serotypes have reportedly emerged (5, 8, 15, 24), and cases in cattle, hitherto extremely rare, have appeared.

No BTV vaccine has been applied in Israel and the Palestinian Authority for several years; information on the availability of relevant vaccine(s), on the serotypes to be included, and details of planned vaccination regime (if available) would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
