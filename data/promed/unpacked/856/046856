HEPATITIS A VACCINE: COST

A ProMED-mail post

Hepatitis A - USA (Washington) 980317225257
[As a comment to the posting on hepatitis A in the State of Washington, I
mentioned the cost of vaccinating 400,000 at $75 for each of two doses. -

I would point out that the cost of the vaccine has come down quite
substantially of late. The last I knew the Public Health price for adult
vaccine was between $16-17 per dose.
It is still a lot of money, but given the average cost of a case of
hepatitis A in terms of medical expenses (lost productivity, etc.; it
figures out at around $2500), $35 per person seems reasonable.
Experience has shown here that in generalized (community wide) outbreaks,
we end up seeing the same people as contacts several times. Given the
current cost if IG [immune globulin, it seems cost effective to use vaccine.

[The Larimer County, Colorado, Department of Health tells me that hepatitis
A vaccine is $70 per dose and that IG is $20 per dose. Given this
disparity, I would appreciate it if those of you who know the costs for
hepatitis A vaccine and IG in your area would let me know, directly
<calisher@usa.healthnet.org>. I will assemble the data and post a summary
as soon as possible. - Mod.CHC
