Contingency plan after detecting "kiwi disease" in Chile
--------------------------------------------------------
The disease started in Italy and New Zealand and has now been
detected in O'Higgins and Maule regions in Chile. The Agricultural and
Livestock Service (SAG) reported that a contingency plan has been
drawn up aimed at controlling this disease.

The initiative is the result of the worldwide alert after the
detection of the disease caused by the bacterium _Pseudomonas
syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (PSA), and surveillance activities have
increased in kiwi orchards nationwide.

The affected areas in O'Higgins (1) and Maule (3) regions were
detected during an investigation in December 2010 and January 2011 in
kiwi orchards with suspicious symptoms. SAG will continue to undertake
surveillance activities in order to know the real distribution of PSA
in the country.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids)
caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally
described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain.
Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf
spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate,
fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is
favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are
usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to
occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected
to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including
animal and human activities), and infected planting material. Spread
with infected fruit and/or pollen cannot be excluded until conclusive
data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include
cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread,
use of clean planting material, and resistant crop varieties, but
specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed.
Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Japan, but
resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

A recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting
25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the
emergence of a new strain. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains
have now been identified with some of the outbreak due to the virulent
Italian strain (see links below). This finding has accelerated vine
removal in New Zealand. The strains present in Chile apparently still
remain to be identified.
