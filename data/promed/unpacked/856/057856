Samples from the carcass of a yearling bison heifer on the Flying D
Ranch in Gallatin County has been killed by naturally occurring
anthrax, according to animal health officials with the Montana
Department of Livestock.

Field tests on the dead bison, found Monday [26 Jul 2010] near a
pasture where the disease killed 287 bison 2 years ago, were
confirmed at the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Bozeman.
The pasture has been quarantined, said state veterinarian Dr Martin
Zaluski, and the ranch is monitoring its herd to quickly identify any
additional cases that may occur.

Zaluski said a repeat of outbreak in 2008, which lasted 3 weeks,
isn't likely. "Given the prophylactic measures implemented by the
ranch after the outbreak in 2008, we would not expect to see many
animals affected by the disease." The positive test was not entirely
unexpected, Zaluski said, as anthrax is known to be in the area. Most
of the bison in the 2500-head herd have been vaccinated against the
disease at least once since 2008.

Livestock producers in the immediate area are encouraged to work with
their local veterinarian to learn more about risks, prevention, and
treatment of the disease. Anthrax vaccines are effective and
relatively inexpensive.

"If your area has a history of anthrax, it's not a bad idea to
discuss prevention strategies with your veterinarian," Zaluski said.
"You need to be aware that the disease is there, just lying in the
ground, and that there is no way to predict when it might surface."

[Since this animal killed by wolves was found a 2nd has been found
and tested positive, a vaccinated cow bison, also wolf scavenged. A
3rd dead animal did not have anthrax. The working hypothesis is that
she had a low vaccine titre and was massively exposed by biting flies
feeding on the 1st case. The 2 had died at about the same time,
around 12 Jul 2010. So far surveillance flights have not revealed any
dead elk at the higher altitudes. The fly density is high and filling
the traps. - Mod.MHJ]
