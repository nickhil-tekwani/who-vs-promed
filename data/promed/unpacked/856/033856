England has been hit by an outbreak of norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, with cases tripling above their usual average for summer months. The government also warned, "it is possible that unusual or out of season increases could be seen in the coming months."

Norovirus is highly infectious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea but usually passes in a couple of days. It is easily transmitted through contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include projectile vomiting and diarrhoea and sometimes a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs.

The increase in outbreaks has been mostly in educational settings, particularly in nursery and childcare facilities, with far more incidents reported to Public Health England than would be expected in the summer months. In the last 5 weeks, 154 outbreaks have been reported, compared to an average of 53 outbreaks reported over the same time period in the previous 5 years.

Professor Saheer Gharbia, Deputy Director, National Infection Service, said, "Norovirus, commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, has been at lower levels than normal throughout the pandemic with less opportunity to spread between people in the community, but as restrictions have eased we have seen an increase in cases across all age-groups.

"Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do not return to work or send children to school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. As with COVID-19, handwashing is really important to help stop the spread of this bug, but remember, unlike for COVID-19 alcohol gels do not kill off norovirus so soap and water is best," Prof Gharbia added.

Public Health England has urged people to "stay at home if you are experiencing norovirus symptoms. Do not return to work or send children to school until 48 hours after symptoms have cleared. Also avoid visiting elderly or poorly relatives, particularly if they are in hospital."

[The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.

Norovirus infections can occur at any time of the year but happen most often during the winter months, hence its old name "winter vomiting disease." Norovirus activity can also be localized with increased activity in one area but not in others. Certainly, prominent focal summer activity has been reported in the past with this reference by Guadagnucci Morillo et al (1) as an example. Given the kind of isolation that has occurred related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, winter-time infections with viruses such as norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus seem to be making their mark in the summer, as personal isolation procedures have been, at least temporarily, lifted.

A relatively recent American article reported, when analyzing more than 7000 US norovirus outbreaks over 8 years, the reproduction number was lowest in the summer, peaking in fall and winter:

Abstract
--------
"Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States. We estimated the basic (R0) and effective (Re) reproduction numbers for 7094 norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) during 2009-2017 and used regression models to assess whether transmission varied by outbreak setting. The median R0 was 2.75 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.38-3.65), and median Re was 1.29 (IQR 1.12-1.74). Long-term care and assisted living facilities had an R0 of 3.35 (95% CI 3.26-3.45), but R0 did not differ substantially for outbreaks in other settings, except for outbreaks in schools, colleges, and universities, which had an R0 of 2.92 (95% CI 2.82-3.03). Seasonally, R0 was lowest (3.11 [95% CI 2.97-3.25]) in summer and peaked in fall and winter. Overall, we saw little variability in transmission across different outbreaks settings in the United States."
