[The number of reported cases of Choclo virus infection in Los Santos province continues to increase. The Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. Although not specified in the report above, or previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.

The Rosario Municipal Secretariat of Health confirmed the death of an 11-year-old girl, a case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. The little girl had become infected in her house in the northern district [of the city] and died after 48 hours of hospitalization in the Victor J. Vilela Hospital, where she was sent after 1st visiting the health center. Tests done by CEMAR confirmed the cause of death this Saturday [11 Oct 2014].

This information was confirmed by the Municipal Director of Epidemiology, Analia Chumpitaz, to Rosario3.com. "The girl was admitted to hospital on 8 [Oct 2014] and died mainly of respiratory complications. Blood samples were sent to CEMAR, and this Saturday [11 Oct 2014], [a] hantavirus infection was confirmed as the cause of death. The child was taken into the Vilela hospital with a febrile syndrome compatible with septic shock characterized by respiratory compromise," stated Dr Chumpitaz.

Given this situation, a specialized team from Municipal Epidemiology did a visit to her house to carry out control of the focus [of infection].

Hantavirus[es] [can be] fatal, and there is no vaccine or specific antibiotics, just symptomatic treatment.

It is recommended for people to not leave spaces in their houses where rodents can proliferate because these animals deposit their excrement [contaminated with the virus].

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in Santa Fe province may have been caused by Oran virus infection.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
