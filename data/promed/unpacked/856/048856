Followers of the BSE story may be interested in this paper which proposes
an alternative hypothesis to the 'prion theory'. The authors suggest that
bacteria contain molecular sequences which resemble brain tissue and set up
an autoimmune reaction. An abstract of the paper has just been added to the
CAB ABSTRACTS database and will be available shortly.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: comparison between the 'prion' hypothesis
and the autoimmune theory. Ebringer, A.; Pirt, J.; Wilson, C.; Thorpe, C.;
Tiwana, H.; Cunningham, P.; Ettelaie, C. (Division of Life Sciences,
Infection and Immunity Group and Department of Computing, King's College,
Campden Hill Road, London, UK.) Journal of Nutritional & Environmental
Medicine (1998) 8 (3), 265-276
Another paper by one of the authors proposing the same theory can also be
seen on the database (BSE is an autoimmune disease. The prion infectious
protein fallacy, by J. Pirt & M. W. Pirt).

There is nothing new about this, and it has already been amply aired on
BSE-L.
Following a lecture by Ebringer, reported in The Times around a year ago,
Ebringer and Pirt expounded their hypothesis in their evidence to the BSE
Inquiry on 26 March 1998. More recently, Pirt wrote a letter that was
published in the Society of Chemical Industry's journal, Chemistry and
Industry, on 19 October. It was also posted on BSE-L, by Paddy Apling, on
19 October, and read as follows:-
Prions or bacteria?
The prion theory to account for the cause of BSE and related diseases is
referred to twice in a recent issue (C&I 1998, 714 & 726). This theory of
Prusiner has now been in existence for 16 years. However, it remains highly
controversial. One of its fundamental and unexplained flaws is that prion
protein in a test tube is not infectious.
Two years ago the Ebringer autoimmune diseases group, of which I am a
member, at King's College, London, postulated that BSE could be not an
infectious disease but rather an autoimmune disease in which the body
produces antibodies which react with myelin and destroy the nerve cells.
We started from the observation that injecting a minute amount of pure
myelin A1 protein (0.1?g) (or a synthetic small peptide containing the
epitope) into a rodent causes a spongiform encephalopathy (EAE). This is
indistinguishable clinically and histologically from BSE, The prion
adherents insist, without good reason, that EAE and so-called
'transmissible' BSE must be different. EAE presents no difficulty for the
autoimmune theory.
>From a theoretical study, the Ebringer group found molecular mimicry
between an antigen in bacteria (_Acinetobacter_ sp.) and the EAE epitope in
myelin. We predicted, therefore, that cattle with BSE or patients with CJD
would have elevated levels of antibodies to _Acinetobacter_. This
prediction has been fully confirmed.
Hence we conclude that the BSE epidemic was started by exposure of cattle
to _Acinetobacter_ in meat and bonemeal (MBM) feed supplement, not to
prions. It is not to be ruled out that perhaps the presence of large
quantities of myelin in the MBM could have been indigestible (cattle are
supposed to be herbivores) and resulted in the uptake of myelin antigen
through the intestinal wall with consequent antibody formation.
Unfortunately, the effect of feeding normal brain tissue to cattle has not
been tested. We predict that it would have the same effect as feeding BSE
brain tissue. We have discussed the evidence for the autoimmunity theory at
length in the Phillips BSE Inquiry (Internet, 26 March, day 11). Also the
prion and autoimmunity theories are compared by Ebringer et al (J.
Nutrition Environ. Med., 1998,8,267).
The dispute can be resolved only by further research on the autoimmune
theory. However, the prion lobby is in control of all the government
sources of funds for research on BSE and related diseases, and vested
interests prevail.

**********
I sent a response to Chemistry and Industry, which I also posted on BSE-L,
on 22 October. The letter appeared (in slightly shortened form) in
Chemistry and Industry on 2 November. The version that appeared in Chem and
Ind. was as follows:
Prions or Bacteria?
As I am not in any way connected with any research group having or seeking
funding for research on BSE or other TSEs, perhaps I may be permitted to
comment on S John Pirt's letter (C&E 1998, 826) without fear being labelled
as one of the "vested interests" to which he refers.
It is true that the whole BSE/spongiform encephalopathy scenario is
extremely complicated and difficult to understand. It resembles a large
jigsaw puzzle in which many of the pieces are missing, and in which pieces
that appear to be adjacent parts of the picture sometimes do not seem to
fit exactly. There is a great deal more still to be learned. Having read
the evidence given at the BSE Enquiry, it is still not clear to me how
Ebringer and Pirt's hypothesis can account for the enormous difference in
BSE incidence between the UK and other countries that used MBM in cattle
feed. However, I would support the view that all plausible hypotheses in
this field should be the subject of funded research.
It is also true that the prion hypothesis has not been proved. However, to
the unbiased observer familiar with the accumulated research literature,
particularly over the last few years, the volume of findings supporting or
consistent with the prion hypothesis is far too great to allow of its
dismissal as "highly controversial".
To say that "one of its fundamental flaws is that prion protein in a test
tube is not infectious" is untrue - no-one has demonstrated that to be the
case, and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It is true that,
so far, no-one has demonstrated the infection of an animal by purified
infectious prion protein "from a test-tube"; but the ability of the
abnormal prion protein to convert normal prion protein to the abnormal form
has been demonstrated in vitro.
Raymond and co-workers (Nature,1997, 388, 285-8) carried out in vitro
cell-free conversion reactions with purified and radio-labelled scrapie
and BSE prions and human prions, both met/met homozygous and val/val
homozygous at codon 129 (surprisingly they did not report having included
heterozygous at codon 129 in the experiments). They have shown that there
is a correlation between in vitro conversion efficiencies and known
transmissibilities of BSE, sheep scrapie and CJD. On this basis, they used
the in vitro system to gauge the potential transmissibility of scrapie and
BSE to humans. They found limited conversion of normal human protein to the
abnormal form driven by the abnormal protein associated with both scrapie
and BSE .
The efficiencies of these heterologous conversion reactions were similar
but much lower than those of relevant homologous conversions. Thus the
inherent ability of these infectious agents of BSE and scrapie to affect
humans following equivalent exposure may be finite but similarly low.
Incidentally they reported that the conversion of val/val-129 was threefold
less efficient than of met/met-129, interesting when remembering that, so
far, all nvCJD victims have been met/met-129.
Pirt also stated
"Unfortunately, the effect of feeding normal brain tissue to cattle has not
been tested. We predict that it would have the same effect as feeding BSE
brain tissue."
That is incorrect. Manuelidis and Manuelidis have carried out control
experiments with uninfected brain tissue, and they did not result in TSEs
(Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. USA, 1993, 90(16), 7724-8
