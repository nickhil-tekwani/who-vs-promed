Coos Bay Oyster Co. is recalling oysters over a food poisoning outbreak that has sickened at least 3 people in Oregon. The company, based in Charleston, said it is pulling all of its shucked oysters and in-shell oysters sold to retail stores and wholesalers in Oregon and California.

The shucked oysters were sold in 1/2 gallon, quart, pint and half-pint containers with sell-by dates from 15 Jan 2014 to 17 Feb 2014. The containers carry the Coos Bay Oyster Co. label and are marked raw/ready-to-eat shucked oysters. The oysters in-shell were distributed in red onion sacks, each containing 5 dozen oysters of various sizes. They, too, have the company's label, with harvest dates from December 2013 to January 2014.

The recall follows an outbreak of campylobacteriosis, one of the most common food-borne pathogens. Lab tests confirmed 3 illnesses traced to shucked oysters. All 3 patients were men, 50 to 75 years old, who consumed raw oysters between 15-20 Jan 2014, according to Oregon health officials.

They said those who were sickened purchased the oysters from 2 markets in Lane and Coos counties. The markets were not identified. Two of the patients were hospitalized but are recovering, health officials said.

The bacteria are killed by cooking. But many people prefer raw oysters. Only the shucked oysters have been confirmed to be part of the outbreak, the company said.

Oregon officials, who don't know the source of the contamination, are continuing to investigate.

[Uncooked oysters may be the vehicle for transmission of a variety of enteric infections, especially viral and bacterial. Campylobacteriosis is not, however, a common disease transmitted by the raw shellfish. Shucking the oysters, that is removing them from their shells, introduces the increased possibility of direct human-related contamination. - Mod.LL
