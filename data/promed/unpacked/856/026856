[This HPAI H5N8 outbreak, affecting a large commercial duck farm, is located on Hungary's eastern border, facing Romania. It is Hungary's 2nd outbreak this year (2020); the previous one, earlier this week, was located in the north-west, facing Slovakia (see 20200113.6887610).

Eastern Europe is experiencing an upsurge of H5N8 HPAI outbreaks with 4 countries affected so far (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania). Most of the H5N8 HPAI events involve domestic poultry. Wild birds are likely to be the primary source for at least some of these outbreaks, as it was observed in the past for H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b virus during the 2016/2017 wave.

The last reported H5N8 HPAI outbreaks date back to April 2019 in Bulgaria and no evidence of H5N8 HPAI infection in wild birds or poultry had been reported from the region since.

Countries should share the genetic information collected on H5N8 viruses with the international community to better assess the introduction and spread of the virus throughout Europe. Surveillance for avian influenza in dead or hunted wild birds should be implemented or enhanced during the coming months. - Mod.AS
