The nursing home and assisted-living facility at Brandermill Woods
Retirement Community have been quarantined because of a suspected
respiratory chlamydia outbreak affecting 72 seniors and staff members.
Visitors are strongly urged not to enter either unit, said Mira
Pallotta, executive director of the Chesterfield County retirement
development. Both units are in the same building.
"We're using the word quarantine mainly because we're trying to keep
visitors" from catching and spreading the airborne infection, she
said in a phone interview.
The health care center, with 57 residents, went into an infection
control mode 11 Jul 2006 when 2 people began developing headaches,
nausea, sore throats, malaise, cough, hoarseness and fever. The
Chesterfield County Health Department was called to monitor the
matter, she said.
The bacteria spread last weekend to the assisted-living unit, which
also launched infection-control measures to protect its 52 residents
and staff members. Traffic between the 2 units has been halted.
Doctors are treating the outbreak with an antibacterial drug.
Patients in the nursing unit have improved significantly. The
infection is not generally considered life-threatening unless it is
not treated, Pallotta said. No date is forecast for lifting the
quarantine, however, since new cases were reported on 20 Jul 2006 and
"we're not taking any chances with people," she added.

_Chlamydia_ (now _Chlamydophila_) _pneumoniae_ is an important cause
of lower respiratory infection in both the hospital and outpatient
settings. It is not the same organism that causes genital tract infection.
Results of hospital-based studies have indicated that the organism
accounts for 2-10 per cent of cases of adult community-acquired
pneumonia. The incidence of lower respiratory disease caused by the
organism among a population in Ohio (1) was measured to be 23.8 per
100 000 population on the basis of broad serologic criteria and 7.4
per 100 000 population on the basis of more restrictive criteria.
Although _C. pneumoniae_ is primarily a cause of endemic disease,
outbreaks of respiratory infection have been reported in schools,
nursing homes, and among military recruits and families.
There is continuing interest in a relationship between this organism
and cardiovascular disease, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion.
