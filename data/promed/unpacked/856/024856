In the border village of Marhi Megha, more than 4 confirmed cases of
hepatitis C [virus infection] have been reported within a short span
of time. However, a district epidemiologist officer denied any
confirmed case yet. A team [from the] civil surgeon office is visiting
Marhi Megha on Monday [25 Jul 2011] to verify the claims of
villagers.

Sarpan (council leader) Gursewak Singh of Marhi Megha village,
situated close to Bhikiwind, told The Times of India on Saturday [23
Jul 2011] that: "According [to] my rough estimate, more than 30
percent of the population of my village is suffering from hepatitis
C."

Gursewak, who himself is a hepatitis C patient and is undergoing
treatment, squarely blames the spread of the disease on registered
medical practitioners (RMP) and drug addicts. He said nobody was
willing to get himself examined for fear of expensive treatment.
"People have closed their eyes and prefer taking general medicines
whenever they have any problem," he said.

A farmer and local politician, Kiranbir Singh Mithha, said on
Saturday [23 Jul 2011] that his medical tests confirmed hepatitis C.
He blamed the civil surgeon office for not giving the correct figures
to the public to save their own skins.

"We have decided to hold a private medical camp to get to know the
gravity of the situation. At least 8 village [residents] are taking
expensive treatment, while those who can't afford [the treatment] are
still taking regular medicines." He said a single injection for
treatment of hepatitis C costs Rs 13 500 [USD 300], and they had to
take around 20 such injections, which is not affordable for everyone.
"Three to 4 years ago, the RMPs used to boil the syringe before
injecting. I think that had led to spread of diseases, besides drug
addicts who still use the same syringes out of ignorance," he said.

District epidemiologist officer S J Dhawan said: "We don't have any
single case of confirmed hepatitis C." Many a times, he said, people
confuse simple jaundice with hepatitis C [virus infection], but the
department will hold a survey on Monday [25 Jul 2011].

[Further information about this outbreak is requested to resolve the
conflict of evidence in this press report and to indicate the nature
of the treatment options available locally.

Hepatitis represents a major global health problem, with 170 million
hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers worldwide, and at least 12-13 million
carriers in India. At least 6 distinct HCV genotypes and more than 50
subtypes have been identified. Hepatitis C genotypes are of clinical
significance in indicating drug responsiveness and prognosis of the
patient. Previously, genotype 3 has been reported to predominate in
northern and eastern regions of India. Genotypes 2, 4, 5, and 6 were
detected rarely (Narahari S, Juwle A, Basak S, Saranath D India.
Infect Genet Evol 2009 Jul ;9(4):643-5.).

Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the
treatment of choice, resulting in sustained virologic response
(defined as undetectable HCV RNA in the patient's blood 24 weeks after
the end of treatment) rates of 40-80 percent (up to 50 percent for
patients infected with genotype 1, and up to 80 percent for patients
infected with genotypes 2 or 3). Treatment success rates are now being
improved with the addition of polymerase and protease inhibitors to
standard pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination therapy.

Patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are almost 3 times more likely than
patients with genotype 1 to respond to therapy with alpha interferon
or the combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin. When using
combination therapy, the recommended duration of treatment depends on
the genotype. For patients with genotypes 2 and 3, a 24-week course of
combination treatment is adequate, whereas for patients with genotype
1, a 48-week course is recommended. For further information on
treatment of hepatitis C virus infection see:
