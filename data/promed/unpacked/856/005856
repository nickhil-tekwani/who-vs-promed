[1] Bacterial leaf blight, blast disease - Orissa

Nearly 30 000 hectares of the [rice] crop area have been affected by
pests and bacterial leaf blight disease. [In other areas], incessant
rains and the resultant waterlogging have bred pests and blast
[disease] which have spoiled the paddy saplings.

The farmers had sown paddy seeds in the first week of July 2010 after
continuous rains, and now, at the middle stage of the crop, the
attacks have become widespread in the district [of Nabarangpur,
Orissa]. Especially, the appearance of the pests and blast [disease]
in the paddy fields is a new crisis for the farmers. With the
harvesting season approaching and water yet to recede completely, the
cultivators fear heavy losses.

[2] Tungro virus - Tamil Nadu

The Centre for Plant Protection Studies of the Tamil Nadu
Agricultural University has suggested measures to control paddy
tungro virus disease that has been spotted in Erode and Tiruvallur
districts. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) measures have been
recommended for the outbreaks.

Farmers have been asked to remove affected plants with stunted growth
and yellowing symptoms and to set up light traps to monitor, attract
and kill the adult green leaf hoppers. They have also been told to
control the vector green leaf hopper that transmits the virus by
spraying. It should be ensured that the vegetation on the bunds is
also sprayed.

[Bacterial leaf blight
----------------------
Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_
pv. _oryzae_ with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. Symptoms
include yellowing and drying of leaves, as well as wilting of
seedlings. Blight lesions may elongate over the entire length of the
flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also
affect panicles. Secondary infections by various saprophytic fungi
may contribute to the damage. Field patches with BLB have a whitish,
ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity,
standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is
short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be
short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material and
contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary
pathogen reservoirs. BLB spreads by windblown rain and mechanical
means (including insect activity as in item 1). Disease management
includes phytosanitation, cultural measures and use of resistant crop
varieties.

Outbreaks of BLB were also reported from Punjab earlier in 2010
(ProMED-mail post 20100726.2504).

Rice blast
-----------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ with
potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include
lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem rot, as well as panicle
blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection
die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the
seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed.
More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by
different strains of the fungus, but most strains isolated from rice
can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means (including insect activity as in item 1), water, and
wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural
practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the
fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new
strains with increased virulence.

Tungro
------
Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia.
Yield losses of up to 100 per cent have been reported, and the
disease is spreading in the region. It is a co-infection involving
_Rice tungro bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; genus _Tungrovirus_, family
_Caulimoviridae_) and _Rice tungro spherical virus_ (RTSV; genus
_Waikavirus_, family _Sequiviridae_). More than one genotype of each
virus may exist in the same plant.

Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering,
and reduced grain production. Losses are highest for infections early
in the growth cycle. Tungro is transmitted by several leafhoppers,
but the most efficient vector is the green leafhopper (_Nephotettix
virescens_) mentioned in item 2. RTBV cannot be transmitted unless
RTSV is present. Infectious vector insects can spread the viruses
over long distances. The disease is not seed transmitted.

Disease management includes vector control (on both crops and
adjacent vegetation, as recommended in item 2), cultural practices,
and use of rice varieties resistant to the vectors and/or the
viruses. However, vector adaptation on leafhopper resistant varieties
has been a problem, and a genetically unstable virus population poses
a challenge to achieving durable crop resistance.
