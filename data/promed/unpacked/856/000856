Dead Chinese woman on train to Moscow did not have SARS
-------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese woman who died on the
Blagoveshchensk-Moscow train did not have SARS
(severe acute respiratory syndrome - atypical
pneumonia) or dangerous types of influenza stated
Gennady Onishchenk, Head of the Federal
Supervision Agency for Customer Protection and
Human Welfare of the Russian Federation
(Rospotrebnadzor), on Friday [17 Apr 2009].

"Biopsies of lungs, intestines, and brain of the
deceased woman have shown no evidence of
infection by SARS virus, [influenza] viruses of
the H1, H3 and B flu types, nor the highly
pathogenic H5, H7 and H9 strains [of influenza
virus]," stated the Chief Public Health Physician
the Vesti news television channel. According to
him, tests are still being conducted and data
from other laboratories will be received
[probably] at between 11:00 Â­ 13:00 hrs, Moscow time, on Friday [17 Apr 2009].

The 24-year-old Chinese citizen died suddenly on
Wednesday [15 Apr 2009]. By the decision of local
public health officials, the carriage in which
she was travelling was [disconnected] from the
train at the Zuyevka station [Kirov Region] on
the same day. The train car was sent for
disinfection and the 51 passengers and 2
conductors of the train's [2nd] car were taken to
the local infectious [diseases] hospital.

The Russian Federation Chief Public Health
Physician also said that quarantine measures are
being applied to the passengers of the train's
1st and 3rd cars which were also detached from
the Blagoveshchensk-Moscow train and sent to a
