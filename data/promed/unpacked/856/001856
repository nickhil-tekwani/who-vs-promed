Colorado: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases now total 31 with 15 deaths
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Coloradans have been stricken with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome so far
in 2003, and one of them has died. A 22 year old Adams County man died of
the disease on Fri 11 Jul 2003. He had traveled through several western
states shortly before he became ill, and state health officials do not
believe he was exposed in Adams County. A 26 year old Alamosa County farm
worker tested positive for the disease on 27 May 2003, according to state
health officials. He was admitted to hospital and is recovering. He was the
31st Coloradan to contract hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. 15 (48 per cent)
of the Colorado victims died.
Hantavirus is usually contracted by inhaling virus-contaminated dust from
the feces, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice. Deer mice are found
throughout rural Colorado but are seen less frequently in urban areas.

Deer mouse ecology, climate, and other factors
----------------------------------------------
Deer mice are the prime carriers of the Sin Nombre hantavirus, a deadly
[virus] that exploded into the American consciousness in May 1993, when a
handful of previously healthy young adults in the Four Corners area were
stricken by a respiratory illness that left them gasping for breath. About
half of them -- including a 19 year old Navajo long distance runner -- died
of the mysterious disease, later dubbed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
A decade has passed, and researchers are still trying to determine exactly
how the virus, its rodent hosts, the environment and the climate interact
to cause outbreaks of the disease in humans. Every 6 weeks for the past 9
years, a Colorado State University team has trapped rodents near Durango
and Grand Junction and checked them for antibodies to hantavirus. Similar
studies, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
are under way in New Mexico, Arizona, and Montana. The long term goal is to
predict disease outbreaks and lower the risk to human health.
It's a task that's proved to be more complex than some researchers
anticipated. "We thought we would simply document the underlying
mechanisms, but that was arrogant," said microbiologist [and former
ProMED-mail moderator] Charles Calisher, who heads the Colorado State team.
"This is a very complicated ecological situation." Within weeks of the May
1993 deaths, the newly discovered ailment was linked to a previously
unknown type of hantavirus. Deer mice were quickly identified as the main
carrier, and in November 1993 the Sin Nombre virus was isolated in the
laboratory. By the year's end, 48 Americans had been sickened by hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome; most of them died. 4 of Colorado's 5 hantavirus victims
in 1993 died.
Since then, the respiratory ailment has been reported in 31 states, and
several other North American hantaviruses have been linked to the disease.
More than 330 US cases have been reported since 1993, but the US fatality
rate has dropped to 38 per cent. In Colorado, 31 cases have been reported,
including 2 in 2003. The Colorado death rate is 48 per cent. Hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome is contracted by inhaling contaminated dust containing
bits of feces, urine, or dried saliva from infected deer mice.
During a recent trip to the Fort Lewis trapping site west of Durango, Root
and Calisher donned surgical gowns, latex gloves, plastic face shields, and
battery-powered backpack respirators before handling the deer mice they'd
captured overnight. Both Colorado trapping sites were picked for their
proximity to fatal 1993 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The Fort
Lewis site is 14 miles west of Durango and 5 miles south of the town of
Hesperus. The Molina site is 37 miles east of Grand Junction. The traps are
baited in the evening with cracked corn, rolled oats, and a dab of peanut
butter. In the morning, the researchers measure and weigh the mice, which
typically tip the scales at just under an ounce [25g]. Sex and approximate
age are recorded, a numbered metal tag is clamped to the right ear, a small
tissue sample is sliced from the ear for DNA studies, and blood is drawn to
check for antibodies to the virus.
The 1993 Four Corners outbreak was blamed on a bumper crop of rodents.
Heavy El Nino [ProMED is aware that the second 'n' in 'Nino' should have a
tilde. However, in the interest of allowing those with older computers to
read all characters, we must omit diacritic marks. - CopyEd.PG] rains
produced a plentiful supply of nuts, seeds, insects, and other rodent foods
that spring. The result, at the Fort Lewis trapping site and elsewhere in
the Southwest, was "a plague of rodents," Calisher said. A 31 year old La
Plata County man died on 14 May 1993, and trapping nearby revealed that
about half the deer mice had antibodies to Sin Nombre hantavirus. "There
were many more mice here in '93 than at any time since then," Calisher
said. The rodent numbers dropped after the '93 outbreak and have declined
further during the multi-year drought. Hantavirus infection rates among the
rodents have varied over the past 9 years, but they average about 25 per
cent at the Fort Lewis site and 15 per cent at Molina, Calisher said.
Sometimes the virus vanishes for months at a time -- the Colorado State
researchers haven't captured a hantavirus-positive mouse at the Molina site
since November 2001. "It makes you wonder where the virus is," Calisher
said. Common sense suggests that hantavirus outbreaks are more likely to
occur in the south west after El Ninos, the periodic warmings of the
tropical Pacific Ocean that alter the climate worldwide. The 1993 outbreak
occurred at the tail end of an El Nino event that began in 1990, according
to US Climate Prediction Center records. El Ninos tend to deliver
above-normal precipitation to the south west. More rain means more plants
and insects for the mice to eat. The result is a rodent population boom,
increased contact between mice and humans, and a jump in hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome cases.
"In general that scenario is accurate, but certainly it is an
oversimplification," said CDC medical ecologist Jim Mills, who oversees the
rodent-trapping studies in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Montana. The
1997-98 El Nino was, by some measures, the strongest on record, with major
climatic impacts felt around the world. CDC ecologists predicted that US
hantavirus cases would rise in 1998 and 1999. The number of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome cases jumped from 23 in 1997 to 33 in 1998, then climbed
to 42 the following year.
But in early 2000, the western trapping sites showed declining rodent
numbers and a drop in the infection rate. CDC predicted fewer human
illnesses. Instead, the number of cases rose to 46. "We didn't understand
why we had high numbers of cases in 2000, and we still don't know the
answer," said Mills, chief of the medical ecology unit at CDC's special
pathogens branch. To refine their predictive models, CDC researchers have
teamed up with the US Geological Survey to analyze satellite images of
vegetation at the rodent-trapping sites. Mills said it could take 20 years
to develop a reliable model, and he hopes the trapping studies will
continue that long. Those studies already have helped researchers
understand why the greatest hantavirus risk to humans occurs in the spring
and early summer instead of the fall, when rodent numbers peak. People
clean out cabins, sheds, and barns in the spring, and they can stir up and
inhale aerosolized rodent droppings. That's part of the explanation for the
increased risk.
Most hantavirus-infected deer mice are adult males. The trapping studies
strongly suggest that infected males transmit the virus to other males
while fighting for females, food, or territory. Most of those fights occur
in the spring and early summer breeding season. The virus is delivered in
saliva when one mouse bites another, Mills said. The newly infected mouse
will then start shedding the virus in its urine, feces, and saliva. The
risk to humans is highest during the first 4 to 8 weeks after the mouse
becomes infected, Mills said. Deer mice are the most common and
widest-ranging small mammals in North America. They live throughout Canada
and the continental United States, except for the south east. A mid-1990s
CDC sponsored study in 39 national parks scattered across the country
revealed that about 10 per cent of US deer mice are infected with Sin
Nombre hantavirus, Mills said. Mills said he expects sporadic hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome cases will continue to occur annually in the United
States, with occasional outbreaks -- most likely after prolonged El Ninos.
Since known US hantaviruses are not transmitted from person to person,
raging epidemics aren't in the forecast. "We may never see an outbreak as
large as the one that occurred in 1993. I'm hoping that's the case," he said.
