Examination of carcasses from unusually high mortality
events (die-offs) in wild birds (cumulative total figures since the
beginning of November 2005, updated 20 Apr 2006)
--------------------------------------------------
Number of enquiries received: 5436
Number of incidents with carcasses submitted: 3098
Number of incidents tested for avian influenza: 2898
Number of individual samples tested: 6161
Incidents positive for high pathogenicity avian influenza
virus (HPAI) subtypes H5 or H7: 1
Incidents positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes H5 or H7: 0
Incidents positive for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI)
subtypes other than H5 or H7: 0
Incidents negative for avian influenza virus: 2168
Incidents under test with some sample results to follow: 729
Note: An isolate of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus
(subtype H5N1) was reported on 6 Mar 2006. The sample was taken from
a wild whooper swan found dead in the sea near Fife, Scotland. [The
information under the heading "Avian influenza (bird flu): Latest
situation", published elsewhere in the same web-site, reads: "High
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed on 6 Apr 2006 in a
partially decomposed swan found on the causeway in Cellardyke,
Scotland." - Mod.AS]
The total number of swans tested is 891.
Investigations in England and Wales are carried out by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), in Scotland by the Scottish Agricultural
Colleges Laboratories (SAC) and in Northern Ireland by DARD's
Veterinary Sciences Division laboratory.
Wild bird carcasses may not be received in all incidents in which
enquiries are received; this is because not all incidents fulfill the
requirements for the survey. For instance, further enquiries may
indicate that only one or 2 birds have died or that the mortality
level is not unusual.

(1) Survey of live caught birds to identify the presence of avian
influenza viruses (3343 samples received since the beginning of Nov
2005), and (2) Survey of freshly shot birds to identify the presence
of avian influenza viruses (423 samples received since the beginning
of Nov 2005). Including the species of tested birds to the 3 tables
will be an added value. - Mod.AS]

Pakistani authorities have ordered the slaughter of 15 000 chickens
after a suspected 4th outbreak of the deadly bird flu virus, officials said.
Officials had quarantined a farm and several workers in Tarlai on the
outskirts of the capital Islamabad, said Mohammad Afzal, spokesman
for the Food, Agriculture and Livestock Ministry.
"We got a mortality report last night from a farm at Tarlai and
ordered the culling of 15 000 birds at the farm because of a
suspected outbreak of the H5N1 virus," Afzal said.
The area was sealed off with posters and placards saying "Restricted Area".
"There is very strong clinical evidence and symptoms of H5N1. We can
confirm the outbreak only after laboratory tests but protectively
we have culled all the birds at the farm," he said.
If confirmed, it would become the 2nd case near Islamabad and the 4th
in the country. Pakistan Sunday confirmed an H5N1 outbreak at another
chicken farm near Islamabad.
Its first bird flu cases were confirmed [in March 2006] at 2 chicken
farms in North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan.
[Map: <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/pakistan.pdf>].
Authorities slaughtered 25 000 birds and sealed off the affected
farms in the northwestern market town of Charsadda and the hill
resort of Abbottabad.
No human cases have yet been reported despite a number of scare
stories in the local media and rising apprehension among Pakistanis.
"We are in touch with the health authorities and they have confirmed
to us that there is no human case reported to hospitals so far," Afzal said.

[3] China, Liaoning: wild birds

2 birds living in the wild and found dead in northeast China were
confirmed to be infected with H5N1 bird flu, the official Xinhua news
agency reported on Thursday [20 Apr 2006], citing the Agriculture Ministry.
The Liaoning provincial government has disinfected the region where
the magpie and wild duck were found, Xinhua said, adding that
Liaoning has never had outbreaks of bird flu. [This statement
disagrees with China's official notification of 3 Nov 2005 to the
OIE regarding an outbreak of HPAI H5 in Badahoao, Jinzaou city,
Liaoning Province, where 8940 chickens as well as 20 magpies and
other wild birds reportedly died; see:
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/China%20Follow-up%20report%20No5.pdf>.
The report also indicated that 13.9 million birds were vaccinated in
the Liaoning province with a monovalent, inactivated H5N2 vaccine. - Mod.AS]
The Health Ministry reported a new human infection on Tuesday [18 Apr
2006] in the central province of Hubei, bringing the number of human
infections to 17 in the world's most populous nation, where 11
persons have died.
There have been more than 30 outbreaks in poultry in a dozen
provinces over the past year in China.

[4] FAO/OIE: Susceptibility of animal species

Susceptibility of animal species to the H5N1 Asian strain
Joint statement by the OIE and the FAO
----------------------------------------------
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and FAO confirm that
the animal species playing a role in the transmission and spread of
highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus are essentially domestic
and wild birds.
Although some 50 non-domestic bird species have proved susceptible to
infection with the virus, it would appear from the epidemiological
data currently available that, among the wild birds implicated in the
transboundary spread of the virus, aquatic birds play a major role.
Epidemiological findings and experimental studies have demonstrated
that some mammal species, particularly cats, may be susceptible to
the virus. However, from the data that have accumulated since the
start of the current avian influenza crisis (end of 2003), cats do
not appear to play any discernible role in the transmission of the
virus in the natural setting.
The OIE and the FAO can thus confirm the statement issued by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on 28 Feb 2006 that "there is no
present evidence that domestic cats can play a role in the
transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses".
Nevertheless, in view of the susceptibility of certain individuals of
this species, it is recommended that cats in infected zones and
surveillance zones set up around avian influenza outbreaks be kept indoors.

[Will this statement eventually terminate the debate "villains or
victims"?! Hopefully, efforts of ornithologists, virologists and
epidemiologists will be directed into the required cooperative
research in H5N1 epidemiology, in which both domestic and wild avians
share the roles of victims and vectors (rather than "villains").
The European Commission published on 18 Feb 2006 its Decision
2006/115/EC, concerning certain protection measures in relation to
highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community. The
decision, repealing previous decisions, was included in the Official
Journal L 048 of 18 Feb 2006; available at
<http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_048/l_04820060218en00280034.pdf>.
Article 2 of the above decision deals with the Establishment of
protection and surveillance zones, as follows:
1. The affected Member State shall establish around the area where
the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza
A virus of subtype H5 in wild birds is confirmed and the
neuraminidase type N1 is either suspected or confirmed:
(a) a protection zone with a radius of at least 3 km, and
(b) a surveillance zone with a radius of at least 10 km, including
the protection zone.
2. The establishment of the protection and surveillance zones
referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account of geographical,
administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors relating to
avian influenza, and of monitoring facilities.
3. If the protection or surveillance zones cover the territories of
other Member States, the affected Member State shall collaborate with
the authorities of those Member States to establish the zones.
4. The affected Member State shall notify to the Commission and to
the other Member States the details of any protection and
surveillance zones established under this Article, and shall, as
appropriate, inform the public of the measures taken.
On 12 Apr 2006, the Commission published its decision 2006/277/EC of
7 Apr 2006 amending Decision 2006/115/EC concerning certain
protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza
in wild birds in the Community; available at
<http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_103/l_10320060412en00290032.pdf>.
The amendment prescribes supplementary provisions notably on the
movement of certain birds and of products from poultry and other
birds originating in the zone affected by the disease in wild birds,
the time-table of such restrictions, etc. - Mod.AS]
