Most nerve gas victims still in suffering
A majority of surviving victims of the March 1995 sarin gas attack, for
which members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult stand accused, still suffer from
physical problems as well as post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD, a
police survey released Thursday shows.
It was the first survey by government authorities on the various
after-effects still tormenting victims of the attack, in which 12 people
were killed and thousands others sickened by the deadly nerve gas
released on Tokyo subways during rush hour.
[In fact, approx. 1000 were injured; thousands more flocked to emergency
rooms even though they had not been exposed, out of fear they might have
been somehow contaminated - Mod.JW
The Metropolitan Police Department last year polled about 5300 people
who had reported being affected by the 1995 incident, 1247 of them
responded by August. "Many of the victims apparently were unable to
answer the survey because it was too painful for them to remember the
incident," an MPD official said.
All together, more than 70 percent of the respondents said they still
suffer from some psychological aftereffects, including PTSD and
increased use of alcohol or sleeping pills. PTSD involves psychological
disorders, including nightmares and flashbacks, that plague victims who
experienced serious psychological shock resulting from crime, natural
disasters or accidents.
In a multiple choice survey, 54 percent of the respondents complained
of bodily problems that they believe were caused by the nerve gas
attack, while 56.7 percent cited some sort of psychological problems,
according to the MPD.
As for physical problems, four out of five respondents said they
experienced vision problems just after the incident. About 33
percent said that to this day they tend to have strained eyes, while 26
percent reported that their eyesight has diminished.
While 9.6 percent said they still suffer from headaches, 7.5 percent
complained of heart disorders, the survey showed.
As for psychological after-effects, 18.4 percent said they are paranoid
they might someday suffer a similar incident, 17.5 percent said they get
sudden flashbacks of the scene of the crime and 7.4 percent complained
of suffering from recurring nightmares.
