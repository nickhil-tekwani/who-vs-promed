Malaria mortality increase in Angola
------------------------------------
Malaria has killed 78 people in the Caiundo District. At least 78 people
out of 2293 patients diagnosed with malaria during the 1st quarter of 2004
have died at Caiundo commune, south eastern Kuando-Kubango province. The
figures were released on Thursday by the health director in that locality,
Mr Vicente Cassanga, who added that in the same period about 71 people of
the 692 who were seen at the 6 local health posts died from diarrhea and
vomiting.
The official further stated that from January to March 2004, around 46
people out of 132 diagnosed cases died from acute respiratory diseases.

[Malaria is endemic in Angola, with perennial transmission. The reported
increase in mortality may be due to drug resistance if the national
recommendations include first line treatment with chloroquine, and if
second line drugs like sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) or quinine are
unavailable. Any information on failure rates seen with standard treatment
would be welcome. - Mod.EP]
