Outbreak of Viral Gastroenteritis in Canadian School
----------------------------------------------------
CALGARY: A virus usually found in contaminated food or beverages has swept
through a Cochrane elementary school, affecting 163 children and 16
teachers with vomiting and diarrhea, health officials have concluded.
Virologists at the Provincial Laboratory for Health have deduced that the
virus [belongs to the calicivirus family, but haven't been able to
pinpoint the exact strain. Samples of the virus have been sent to the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. It
could take up to several months for the CDC to identify the culprit.

[Human caliciviruses in the genera "Norwalk-like viruses" and Sapporo-like
viruses" of the family _Caliciviridae_ induce a generally self-limiting
gastroenteritis with symptoms that may include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, fever, and malaise. Identification at the epidemiologic
strain level may be difficult because of the inability to amplify virus in
cultured cells, but there are immunological reagents available to rapidly
assign isolates to the appropriate genus. Norwalk-like viruses are the most
likely to be encountered in North America. - Mod.CP
