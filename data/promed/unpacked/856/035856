[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 313 897 with 82 719 (3.6%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 2 231 178 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 63 447 cases when compared with the data on 17 Apr 2020. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 96.4% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 31.5% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 159 033 deaths have been reported, 154 401 (97.1%) outside mainland China.

The USA is number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19; Spain is number 2; and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey, Russia, Brazil, and Canada have shown a rapid increase in the number of cases. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 18 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours
- WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge has released a statement on the transition to a "new normal" during the COVID-19 pandemic, stressing that it must be guided by public health principles. His statement is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/statements/2020/statement-transition-to-a-new-normal-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-must-be-guided-by-public-health-principles and it complements new guidance on adjusting public health and social measures, available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/critical-preparedness-readiness-and-response-actions-for-covid-19
- Refugees and migrants face the same health risks from COVID-19 as their host populations. WHO has published new guidance, available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/preparedness-prevention-and-control-of-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-for-refugees-and-migrants-in-non-camp-settings, for refugees and migrants to be included in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
-WHO and Global Citizen are joining forces with many of the world's leading musicians, comedians, and humanitarians for the "One World, Together At Home" global special. It will be broadcast/live stream on major social media networks, streaming services, and major television networks worldwide on 18-19 Apr 2020. Further information and local listings are available on the Global Citizen website (https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/one-world-together-at-home-how-to-tune-in/).
- In the "Subject in Focus" below, WHO presents data on COVID-19 cases by age and sex. This data is based on nearly 750 000 WHO case-reporting forms received from 113 countries, territories, and areas

Subject in focus: WHO global case-based surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the notification of COVID-19 cases among travelers from Wuhan, China, in early January [2020], WHO set up a global surveillance system to gather essential information to monitor the epidemic. Beginning on 26 Jan [2020], all members states were requested to immediately report confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 to WHO with a minimal set of information through a standardized case-reporting form (CRF).

As of 13 Apr [2020], a total of 747 546 confirmed cases were documented via case-reporting forms (CRFs) received from 113 countries, territories, and areas across 5 different WHO regions and 3 international conveyances.

The number of cases with a CRF accounts for 44.0% of the confirmed cases reported globally as of 13 Apr [2020] 10 AM. Distribution per region shows that 316 076 (42.3%) of CRFs were reported from the European Region, 415 484 (55.6%) from the Region of the Americas, 10 662 (1.4%) from the Western Pacific Region, 4717 (0.6%) from the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 136 (0.02%) from the South-East Asia Region, and none from the Africa Region.

An additional 471 CRFs have been submitted from international conveyances. It is important to note that of the cases that are documented with CRFs so far, the United States of America, Italy, and Germany account for 74% of all cases in the database. Thus, these data should not be considered representative of all globally confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Distribution by age and sex of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system globally to date
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 716 570 CRFs (95.9%) reported information on age and sex. The sex ratio (male to female) among the confirmed cases is1.03:1, and the median age is 51 (interquartile range, IQR: 36-65) years. For males, the median age is 52 (IQR 37-65) years, and for females 50 (IQR 35-64) years.

The sex ratio varies significantly with age in all ranges except 10-19 years. The largest sex ratios (male to female) are observed amongst the 0-9 year (1.16), 60-69 year (1.27:1), and 70-79 year (1.34:1) age groups. Conversely, the lowest sex ratios (i.e., those showing more females than males) are found in the 20-29 year (0.85:1) and 80 years and over (0.78:1) age groups (Figure 2). When cases reported from the United States, Germany, and Italy are excluded, the overall sex ratio changes to 0.95:1 (more females than males amongst the cases),while there remains an excess of males in the 0-9, 60-69, and 70-79 year age groups (data not shown).

Distribution by age of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO case-based surveillance system over time, from 24 Feb through 13 Apr 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The age distribution has varied with the progression of the epidemic from 24 Feb [2020] (the week in which sufficient CRFs began to be reported) to the present. As shown in Figure 3, the proportions of cases aged 0-19 years and 40-59 years are stable over time, whilst a steady increase is observed in the proportion of cases aged 20-39 years, concurrent with a proportional decrease in the 60-79and 80+ years age groups.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China is stable at 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

Figure 1. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [18 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The African region is also reporting an increasing number of positive cases. - Mod.UBA
