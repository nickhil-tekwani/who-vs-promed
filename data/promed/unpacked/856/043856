Thousands of Chinese chickens were trucked into Hong Kong Saturday, ending
a 6-week ban imposed after an outbreak of influenza that killed six people.
They were met by Hong Kong officials in white coats, gloves, surgical masks
and rubber boots, who drew blood from 13 birds -- part of the
time-consuming new health procedures put in place to ensure that chickens
are flu-free. The 2,000 birds -- the first of 35,000 to arrive Saturday in
Hong Kong -- were delivered to a wholesale market after the blood tests
proved negativeÂ….the stringent new tests will cost Hong Kong $1.92 million
a year.
Dozens of new virus-combating measures include the plastic crates replacing
the wooden ones used before the outbreak that have been deemed unhygienic.
The chickens were also tested and quarantined for five days in mainland
China. Some saw it as symptomatic of wider cleanliness problems,
particularly in bustling food markets that dot the city. The flu also
scared off some tourists, contributing to an 11% decline in arrivals last
year. While many in Hong Kong generally saw the ban as necessary, its
effects were felt particularly over the Chinese New Year at the end of
January because it deprived families of traditional dishes. Some people
were planning dinner parties tonight to celebrate the chickens' return.

[Can someone please let us know what 1-day test is being used to monitor
for this virus? A positive antibody assay would provide only evidence of
past infection, so the test being used, if this report is correct, must be
an antigen detection or a nucleic acid detection assay.
It is safe to assume that ducks are next to be reintroduced to Hong Kong,
making it once again possible to prepare Beijing duck. - Mod.CHC
