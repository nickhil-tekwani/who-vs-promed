The independent Africa Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) for Polio Eradication officially declared on Tuesday [25 Aug 2020] that the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region is free of wild poliovirus. This marks the eradication of the 2nd virus from the face of the continent since smallpox 40 years ago.

"Today is a historic day for Africa. The African Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication is pleased to announce that the Region has successfully met the certification criteria for wild polio eradication, with no cases of the wild poliovirus reported in the Region for 4 years," said Professor Rose Gana Fomban Leke, ARCC chairperson.

The ARCC's decision comes after an exhaustive, decades-long process of documentation and analysis of polio surveillance, immunization and laboratory capacity of the region's 47 member states, which included conducting field verification visits to each country.

In 1996, African heads of state committed to eradicate polio during the 32nd ordinary session of the Organization of African Unity in Yaounde, Cameroon. At the time, polio was paralyzing an estimated 75 000 children annually on the African continent. In the same year [1996], Nelson Mandela, with the support of Rotary International, jumpstarted Africa's commitment to polio eradication with the launch of the Kick Polio Out of Africa campaign. Mandela's call mobilized African nations and leaders across the continent to step up their efforts to reach every child with polio vaccine.

The last case of wild poliovirus in the region was detected in 2016 in Nigeria. Since 1996, polio eradication efforts have prevented up to 1.8 million children from crippling life-long paralysis and saved about 180 000 lives.

"This is a momentous milestone for Africa. Now future generations of African children can live free of wild polio," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "This historic achievement was only possible thanks to the leadership and commitment of governments, communities, global polio eradication partners and philanthropists. I pay special tribute to the frontline health workers and vaccinators, some of whom lost their lives, for this noble cause. However, we must stay vigilant and keep up vaccination rates to avert a resurgence of the wild poliovirus and address the continued threat of the vaccine-derived polio," said Dr Moeti. While the eradication of wild poliovirus from the WHO African Region is a major achievement, 16 countries in the region are currently experiencing cVDPV2 outbreaks, which can occur in under-immunized communities.

"Africa has demonstrated that despite weak health systems, significant logistical and operational challenges across the continent, African countries have collaborated very effectively in eradicating wild poliovirus," said Dr Pascal Mkanda, coordinator of WHO Polio Eradication Programme in the African Region. "With the innovations and expertise that the polio programme has established, I am confident that we can sustain the gains, post-certification, and eliminate cVDPV2," added Dr Mkanda.

"The expertise gained from polio eradication will continue to assist the African region in tackling COVID-19 and other health problems that have plagued the continent for so many years and ultimately move the continent toward universal health coverage. This will be the true legacy of polio eradication in Africa," said Dr Moeti.

Thanks to the dedication of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, polio cases have reduced by 99.9% since 1988, bringing the world closer than ever before to ending polio. The initiative is a public-private global partnership comprising national governments, WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gavi, and a broad range of long-term supporters.

Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission.

Polio usually affects children under 5, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected. Twenty-five years ago, thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus. The disease is now found only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no cure, but the polio vaccine protects children for life.

Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago. The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence, and some health workers were killed in the process.

What is polio and has it now been eradicated in Africa?
Polio is a virus that spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system. Two out of 3 strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday [25 Aug 2020], Africa was declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus. More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio.

Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa, with 177 cases being identified this year [2020]. This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities. WHO has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola.

How did Africa eliminate wild polio?
Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine that has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world. In 1996, poliovirus paralysed more than 75 000 children across the continent -- every country was affected. That year [1996] Nelson Mandela launched the "Kick Polio Out of Africa" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village to village to hand-deliver vaccines. It was backed by a coalition of groups, including Rotary International, which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s. Since 1996, billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus.

What have the challenges been?
The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns. Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio -- in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016. At the time it was a frustrating setback, as the country had made huge progress and had gone 2 years without any cases being identified.

Outside Nigeria, the last place [in Africa] to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014. Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular. More than 2 million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities. Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts.

In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations.

Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year [2004], but the rumours persisted. In 2013, 9 female polio vaccinators were killed in 2 shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano. It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine.

How polio survivors made a difference
Winning the trust of communities has been key. Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign. "Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect you child not to be like us?'"

From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together, they travelled to remote communities to immunise children.

How serious is polio?
Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under 5. Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised.

Could wild polio return?
Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations. This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001. The country remained free from polio for 4 years until 2005, when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country.

WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication. If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly. For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future.

[First, I owe our subscribers an apology for our void in polio coverage. It has been collateral damage related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and I have to assume responsibility for this occurrence.

That said, I am delighted to break the silence with a ray of sunshine -- the declaration of Africa being wild poliovirus (WPV) free. The official announcement from WHO Africa combined with the above BBC report are excellent synopses of the situation in Africa. The overall vaccination coverages of 95% are excellent, but unfortunately there are remaining pockets of lower coverage where the vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) have taken hold, as evidenced by the cited 177 cases this year (2020; there will be an update to follow covering the situation globally). As mentioned, the key will be to not let down the guard on the continent and maintain consistently high vaccination coverages to eliminate those pockets of lower coverages. As long as the WPV is still circulating elsewhere (Pakistan and Afghanistan), the threat of re-introduction into countries with pockets of susceptible communities exists.

There are still areas globally with civil unrest leading to difficult access for vaccinators, combined with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic having compromised vaccination programs in many areas -- we hope now recovering -- so there remains the urgent need to ensure vaccination coverages remain high.

I recommend the map and graphic in the media report at the BBC source URL. A map showing the locations of all polioviruses -- WPVs and cVDPVs (circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses) -- can be found at http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. - Mod.MPP
