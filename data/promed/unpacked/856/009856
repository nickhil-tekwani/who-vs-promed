BLUE TONGUE - KENYA (04)
************************
A ProMED-mail post
[In the cocktail of infectious diseases found in Kenya during the RVF
epidemic, bluetongue (to use the British terminology) was diagnosed in sheep
and and Peter Roeder had commented that he had arranged for Epizootic
Hemorrhagic Disease virus testing. As EHD is a North American disease, I
asked him "why?". Here is his reply. - MHJ]

Pirbright provided the EHD test because I requested it - but, why did I
request it? Now, thereby hangs a tale which relates to "early warning".
Wasn't it Pliny who said "Ex Africa semper aliquid novi"? EMPRES interest in
EHD is primarily in the context of global surveillance for clinical
syndromes which could indicate the presence of rinderpest i.e. differential
diagnosis - an important component of the Global Rinderpest Eradication
Programme - as well as monitoring of emerging diseases in general.
You would be correct in claiming EHD as your own only if you were referring
to Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease of Deer. EHD viruses are widely
distributed throughout the Culicoides equatorial belt with evidence of
widespread infection from virus isolation and serological studies throughout
Africa and Asia. Disease is another matter. You are well aware of the
association between EHD viruses and, primarily, white-tailed deer in the
USA. However, another disease called Ibaraki disease (caused by an EHD virus
of serogroup 2) was first reported in Japan in 1959 causing a
bluetongue-like disease in cattle. A similar disease has occurred in Korea
(Kaeshi disease) and the virus is widespread in the region (Taiwan and
Indonesia for example). Elsewhere, outside the Far East and USA, there has
been little association of EHD viruses with disease.
However, in 1996, South Africa experienced numerous outbreaks of what has
been called erosive stomatis of cattle, which Koos Coetzer and Bob Swanepoel
believe could be associated with [an EHD virus. I understand that an EHD
virus may have been isolated from an animal sample collected during the
current investigations in NE Kenya. This was of course hardly a momentous
event of great significance in itself given the Culicine midge vector
activity in the area. But, combine this with the Gerenuk pathology of
erosive stomatitis and coronitis, suggestive of "bluetongue", and other
suspicious lesions in cattle and one has a scenario meritting investigation.
I must stress that there is no known association between the possible
isolation of EHD virus in Kenya and any observed disease syndrome.
