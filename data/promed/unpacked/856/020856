BLACK POD DISEASE, COCOA - NIGERIA

Black pod disease has hit Nigerian cocoa plantations, raising fears
of a further drop in output already cut by drier-than-normal weather
earlier this year [2007], the main growers' group said on Monday [9 Jul 2007].
Akinwale Ojo, executive secretary of the Cocoa Association of Nigeria
(CAN), said the disease was caused by heavy rainfall and a scarcity
of chemicals to spray infected trees in the southwest cocoa-farming
region. "There is a lot of black pod disease on many farms and this
will affect yield in the long run if the trees are not sprayed," Ojo
told Reuters. "But chemicals are fairly difficult to come by and they
are expensive. That has compounded the problem for many farmers who
can't afford them," Ojo said from Akure, the capital of Nigeria's
main cocoa growing state of Ondo. "We are also worried about the
problem of pests as cocoa mice will begin to attack farms in August,"
Ojo said. Black pod affects 30-40 percent of Nigeria's annual cocoa
output and pests around 25 percent, Ojo said.
Cocoa trees are vulnerable to pests and diseases, which can often be
prevented by chemical treatment but many growers in Nigeria, the
world's 4th biggest producer, cannot afford them in sufficient
quantities. Black pod is a fungal disease that 1st appears as a small
spot on the pod surface and later spreads to the bean itself.
Decades of neglect
------------------
Experts say pods can be infected at any age, but are more exposed in
the 2 months before ripening, when the fungus can easily pass from
the pod husk to the seed coat of the bean.
Nigeria's plantations have suffered from decades of neglect, and many
produce far below capacity because of limited access to chemicals,
loss of skills, and poor maintenance. Many trees are showing signs of ageing.
The April-September [2007] mid crop, which usually comes in at around
50 000-60 000 tonnes, was hit by a long harmattan season and poor
rains in the months before the harvest. Harmattan is a wind that
carries dust and sand from the Sahara. The drought-like conditions
reduced soil moisture for trees and damaged developing pods. Recent
rains came late to help the mid crop, but had raised hopes for a
robust and early start of the October-March [2008] main crop, growers
and buyers said.
But while rain is good for the development of cocoa pods, it also
speeds the spread of diseases by washing fungus from tall trees,
which are difficult to spray, to shorter trees.
Traders and the International Cocoa Organization estimate Nigeria's
cocoa output at around 180 000-220 000 tonnes per year, but the
authorities put the figure much higher at over 400 000 tonnes.
Officials say Nigeria's ambitious cocoa rehabilitation programme
launched in 2005, is yielding the desired results.

[Black pod (also _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal
disease affecting cocoa worldwide. There are 3 species, _P.
palmivora_, _P. megakarya_ ,and a species closely resembling, but
possibly different from, _P. capsici_ , which are mainly found
associated with this disease.
_P. palmivora_ is found worldwide, _P. megakarya_ in several
countries of West Africa, and _P. capsici_ in South America, Central
America, and the West Indies. A 4th species, _P. citrophthora_, has
been identified from cocoa in Bahia, Brazil. It seems more virulent
than _P. palmivora_ or _P. capsici_, but is relatively rare.
The most common species is _P. palmivora_, which can cause losses as
high as 95 percent in very humid climates. However, _P. megakarya_ is
more virulent and faster moving than _P. palmivora_ and, therefore,
more difficult to control. Molecular diagnostic methods are available
to distinguish between the species.
Pods can be infected at any age. The most serious economic loss
arises from infection during the 2 months prior to ripening, which
can totally destroy the pods. Infection of other tissues can also
occur, but usually does not cause severe economic loss. Symptoms
caused by the 4 _Phytophthora_ species vary slightly, but they all
start with a small translucent spot on the pod. The spot
progressively turns darker brown and expands rapidly over the pod.
The fungi are spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris,
water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur
in plantations with epidemics developing from a series of foci. Thus,
disease management is difficult and there appears to be little
advantage in early season control. Trees too tall to be effectively
sprayed or harvested can continue to disperse inoculum from infected
pods high in the canopy. Cultural techniques such as shade reduction,
regular harvesting, and frequent weed control may reduce infection,
but some losses from black pod are almost inevitable in areas of very
high humidity. The availability of host resistance is being investigated.
