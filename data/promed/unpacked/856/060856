Stefane DeLaRocque of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Animal Health
Division tells me that Chinese authorities have told the FAO (United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation) they have isolated a virus from
pigs involved in a mysterious disease outbreak in Gaoyao and Yunfu in
Guangdong, 140 miles (225 km) north west of Hong Kong. According to media
reports, about 3000 pigs have been affected so far, but FAO has no report
more reliable on the extent of the outbreak.
Chinese scientists tell the FAO it is PRRS virus (porcine respiratory and
reproductive syndrome). If that is correct, FAO thinks it may be a new,
more pathogenic mutant. PRRS, which emerged 18 years ago and was initially
called "mystery swine disease," is not usually described as a prominently
hemorrhagic disease. Gross hemorrhage is said to be a main feature of the
current outbreak.
According to DeLaRocque, FAO is currently leaving open the possibility of
other causes. It has not ruled out an avian flu mutant, but the picture as
it is currently known to FAO, does not look consistent with avian flu, and
there have been no recent reported poultry outbreaks of H5N1 in the region.
As of Tuesday [8 May 2007] afternoon, China had not invited FAO
investigators in.

[We are grateful to Richard Knox for providing this information. Porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS] virus is one of the 3 disease
agents mentioned by the Chinese authorities to be involved in "pig high
fever disease" [PHFD]. According to China's notification to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooies; World Animal Health Organization) of 12 Sep
2006 (see ProMED-mail Undiagnosed disease, porcine - China (03): OIE
20060924.2732), PHFD, observed since June 2006, is caused by a mixed
infection of classical swine fever (CSF), PRRS, and porcine circovirus
(PCV-2). Other disease agents have been suspected as well.
While PRRS is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths, piglets
born weak, and respiratory signs in pigs of all ages, acute CSF will show,
in many cases, hemorrhages.
It seems that the diagnostic and investigative efforts deserve to be
enhanced; official information, including exclusion of the involvement of
avian influenza, is anticipated. - Mod.AS

the provincial capital. - CopyEd.MJ]
