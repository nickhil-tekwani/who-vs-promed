On November 29, 1997, Kevin Gillespie wrote [(04) message cited above:
"The Great Plains grasslands in USA [are home for ground squirrels (e.g.,
_Citellus_) and prairie dogs (e.g., _Cynomys_). Are there any equivalents
in Mongolia?"
Yes, the Mongolian marmot is the local equivalent of the North American
prairie dog, which is also known as ground hog and woodchuck. Like its
cousin in the American West, the Mongolian marmot carries plague, which a
few marmot hunters suffer from every year.

According to "Walker's Mammals of the World" Fifth Edition, Volume I (R.<.
Nowak, editor): There is considerable disagreement about the systematics of
Marmota in Eurasia, with some authorities recognizing only three species
and others as many as eight. There are:
_M. camtschatica_: mountains of northeastern Siberia from Lake Baikal to
Kamchatka
_M. bobak_ [also considered as species distinct from _M. bobak_ are _M.
baibacina_ (Central Asia, Sinkiang, and Mongolia); _M. himalayana_
(Himalayan region); and _M. sibirica_ (southern Siberia, Mongolia, northern
China): Poland and Romania to Manchuria and central China (This might be
the one Jack's thinking of.)
_M. caudata_: mountains of central Asia
_M. menzbieri_: Tien Shan Mountains of Uzbekistan and southeastern Kazakhistan
Hibernation burrows may be 5-7 m deep and tunnels 10-70 m long, or even 113
m in the case of _M. camtschatica_. Must be cold there.
