Bluetongue virus in the Netherlands identified as serotype 8 by Institute
for Animal Health
----------------------------------------------
Scientists at the Institute for Animal Health's Pirbright Laboratory have
shown that the bluetongue virus causing disease in the Netherlands is
serotype 8. This serotype has not previously been identified in Europe.
The virus had been sent to IAH Pirbright by the European Commission, as IAH
Pirbright is the European Community Reference Laboratory for bluetongue.
After confirming that the disease in the Netherlands was bluetongue, the
IAH Pirbright scientists worked to identify the serotype of the virus.
Having eliminated that possibility that the virus was one of the 5
serotypes previously detected in southern Europe (types 1, 2, 4, 9, and
16), they developed tests for the other 19 types.
The identification of the serotype was done by PCR tests late on Friday
night (25 Aug). The test involves the gene for protein VP2 of the virus.
VP2 unequivocally specifies the serotype of the virus. The PCR result was
confirmed by sequencing most of genome segment 2 of the virus, on Saturday
(26 Aug).
Professor Philip Mellor, head of the European Community Reference
Laboratory (CRL) for bluetongue said "The isolation of a bluetongue virus
serotype new to the region, by Professor Peter Mertens' group at Pirbright,
within only 8 days of receipt of the first infected sheep material from the
Netherlands, is an astonishing feat." The quick turn-around time was
achieved by using serotype-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reactions (RT-PCRs) followed by sequencing, rather than by virus
neutralisation tests that have been used in the past, and which take 3
times longer to achieve a result.
Typing of the virus is important in tracking where the BTV-8 virus came
from. The results show that the Dutch isolate is NOT descended from vaccine
forms of the bluetongue virus that have been used in many parts of southern
Europe including Bulgaria, Italy, Corsica, Spain, and also in South Africa,
in recent years. The gene sequence data points to an origin in sub-Saharan
Africa.
The initial infected sheep material was received from The Central Institute
for Animal Disease Control, CIDC-Lelystad, Wageningen UR, The Netherlands.
A chronological account of the identification of the Netherlands virus as
being bluetongue serotype 8 can be found by following the link under "new
to this site" on the Institute for Animal Health homepage

Bluetongue: virus serotype 8 identified as cause of recent outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
The European Commission was informed by the Community Reference Laboratory
for Bluetongue in Pirbright (UK) over the weekend that the virus
responsible for the recent bluetongue outbreak in the Netherlands has been
identified, through genetic testing, as being a virus of serotype 8. This
strain of virus has never been reported in Europe before, and the disease
recently detected in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany is now
considered to be of exotic origin. 1st results suggest that the bluetongue
virus serotype 8 is of a sub-Saharan lineage, although the precise origin
is not yet known, nor is the way in which the virus was introduced into
Europe. The Commission has also been informed that the bluetongue virus was
isolated in a cell culture by the National Reference Laboratory for
Bluetongue in Belgium on Friday [25 Aug 2006] afternoon.
An extraordinary meeting of EU laboratory experts is taking place in
Brussels today [28 Aug 2006] to discuss the results of the CRL and those of
other Member States' laboratories that have been deeply involved in the
investigations into the recent bluetongue outbreaks in north western
Europe. The disease control measures currently being applied in the 3
affected member states and in Luxembourg will be adapted as necessary at a
meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health this
afternoon.

[21 of the 24 serotypes of Bluetongue virus (BTV) occur in South Africa;
the 3 which are regarded exotic there are BTV-17, BTV-20, and BTV-21. In
view of the current situation in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany,
where clinical cases have been observed in cattle (generally regarded
unusual), the following recent South African observation is of particular
interest: "Comparable figures to illustrate the exposure of cattle to BTV
do not exist, and cattle are not routinely tested or vaccinated. Naive,
imported animals do experience clinical disease, although bovine isolates
are generally treated with caution. In 1996, however, an exceptionally wet
year, BT in cattle was reported from various parts of the country. Symptoms
of stomatitis, coronitis, lacrimation, salivation, nose and teat sloughs,
and sometimes hemorrhagic diarrhea were recorded. Morbidity and mortality
were low, but a marked drop in milk production was noted. 13 BT and 9
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) isolates were made. Serotypes 2, 3, 6,
and 8 of bovine BTV were involved, while the EHD isolates remain to be
typed. Sheep and cattle serotypes for that specific season did not
correspond, and additional serotypes were obtained from sheep," (extracted
from: GH Gerdes; A South African overview of the virus, vectors,
surveillance and unique features of bluetongue. Veterinaria Italiana 2004;
40(3): 39-42. Available online at
<http://www.te.izs.it/vet_italiana/index.html>).
Figure 1 in the above paper shows the BTV serotypes in sheep and cattle in
South Africa in 1996.
The same paper says that BTV-8 was identified in _Culicoides bolitinos_
catches made near horse stables in 2003, together with serotypes BTV-6 and
BTV-19.
Bluetongue vaccine was developed by South African scientists in the 1940s
to deal with the 15 different virus types prevalent in the country. The
vaccine, including -- among others -- BTV-8, as well as the other serotypes
detected so far in Europe (1,2,4,9,16), is manufactured both for domestic
use and export to European countries where the disease is currently causing
concern. - Mod.AS]
