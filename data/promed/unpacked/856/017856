New figures show that the measles outbreak in the North East is continuing to spread. The latest figures published by Public Health England (PHE) show that since the beginning of September 2012, when the numbers started increasing, 200 confirmed cases and 176 suspected cases of the illness have now been reported. This is an increase of 19 confirmed and 14 suspected cases on the previous week. The majority of cases continue to be reported in the Teesside, County Durham, and Darlington areas.

People aged between 10 and 19 years continue to be most affected, making up 39 per cent of all cases. Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the North East PHE Centre said: "Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. There is no specific treatment* for measles but it can be prevented by the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status they should check with their GP. If you've missed out on MMR in the past it's always possible to catch-up as the vaccine can be given at any age."

The number of cases of measles in Powys have almost doubled in the last week to 41. The Powys Teaching Health Board says the outbreak is concentrated in the north of the county with most cases found in school age children, where the disease can spread easily, but people of all ages can be affected. In Powys 1 in 4 teenagers have not had 2 MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) jabs and therefore are not fully protected against measles. Until now the outbreak had been focused in south west Wales.

Measles is a serious disease that can lead to long term health issues such as eye disorders, deafness , brain damage, and even death. It is very important that everyone is vaccinated against this disease. One dose of the MMR jab will protect 90 percent of children and the recommended 2 doses of MMR jab will provide 99 percent protection against measles. The MMR jab is safe and offers the only protection against measles.

The outbreak is centred around Swansea but has also spread to neighbouring areas. The number of confirmed cases of measles in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 588, according to Public Health Wales. The latest figure shows 47 new cases of the disease since Wednesday [3 Apr 2013]. Health officials have welcomed a rise in vaccinations but estimate 3800 children have still not had MMR jabs. Drop-in clinics are being held at hospitals in the area on Saturday [6 Apr 2013]. Vaccinations will also be held in schools after pupils return from the Easter break.

About 60 people are in hospital in Swansea after contracting measles, some with symptoms of pneumonia and others with dehydration. Numbers coming forward for jabs have increased, with just under 600 in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABM UHB) area receiving the unscheduled MMR vaccine in the past week. That figure does not include children who are vaccinated as normal at ages 13 months and 3 years 4 months.

A spokeswoman for the ABM health board said a programme of vaccinating school children who are known to be unvaccinated in schools will begin after the Easter holidays. She said some vaccinations took place before Easter in schools where there were cases of measles. School vaccinations will initially concentrate on Swansea and will also target comprehensive schools where large numbers of pupils missed out on vaccinations as babies. Schools in the city are due back on 15 Apr 2013. Although the epidemic is centred on Swansea, cases continue to be reported across Wales. The majority are in Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, which as well as Swansea also includes Neath, Port Talbot, and Bridgend; there are also cases in Powys [see part [2] above]and the Hywel Dda Health Board area, which covers Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, and Pembrokeshire.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "We are really pleased to see that 586 people have proactively got the MMR vaccine over the past week, on top of those already scheduled to have it. "Though this is a good start, there are still thousands of children who have not had both doses of the MMR jab and so are still at risk from becoming infected with the potentially fatal measles virus."

Long queues have formed as 4 south Wales hospitals offer free MMR jabs aimed at curbing a measles epidemic. People began waiting at one, Morriston Hospital in Swansea, an hour before the doors opened at 10:00 BST on Saturday [6 Apr 2013]. By early afternoon the local health board said about 800 vaccinations had been administered. The outbreak has affected nearly 600 people so far in south, mid, and west Wales, and sessions are also being held in Neath, Port Talbot and Bridgend. Most of those having a jab are toddlers but a few are in their early teens.

Many of the parents had decided not to vaccinate earlier because of research -- since discredited -- which claimed there was a link between the MMR jab and autism. But this outbreak has clearly changed attitudes across Swansea. Those same parents are now prepared to queue for hours to secure an MMR vaccine for their child. The demand has exceeded doctors' expectations, creating its own problem, and the local health board has had to call on emergency supplies of MMR. Although aimed primarily at children, the vaccinations are available for anyone born after 1970 who has not had measles or been vaccinated.

Public health officials say confirmed measles cases have risen to 588 in the south Wales outbreak, which is centred on Swansea. The latest figure shows 47 new cases of the disease since Wednesday [3 Apr 2013], although this is less than half the increase of the previous week. Before the introduction of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination in 1988, about half a million children caught measles and about 100 died from it each year in the UK [and many others went deaf or blind or had other sequelae]. But concerns over the jab's safety were raised a decade later when surgeon Andrew Wakefield published a since discredited paper in The Lancet suggesting MMR was linked with an increased risk of autism. That paper, and subsequent media coverage, led to immunisation rates plummeting. From a high of 92 percent across the UK in 1995-6, it fell to an average of 80 percent in 2003-4.

For children in England reaching their 2nd birthday it rose to 91.2 percent in 2011-12, but that is still below the World Health Organization target of at least 95 percent. Health officials have had to restock vaccines due to the high level of demand, such as at Morriston. Wales figures for October to December 2012 show 94 percent uptake of the 1st dose of vaccine, with local authority uptake ranging from 87 percent to 97 percent. Uptake of the 2nd dose by 5 years of age increased to 90 percent, from 89 percent in the previous quarter.

Public Health Wales has attributed the slowdown in the spread of the disease to a rise in the number of people being inoculated. But it has warned that 3800 children have still not had both doses of the MMR vaccine. It said just 600 in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area received the jab in the past week. That figure does not include children who are vaccinated as normal at 13 months and 3 years 4 months.

[Parents queuing at hospitals to have their offspring vaccinated against measles virus infection is an unprecedented event in the UK. This is a remarkable development and an indication that all sectors of the population are becoming aware of the advantages of MMR vaccination. If repeated elsewhere, the task of eradicating measles from the UK again becomes a feasible goal. - Mod.CP]

Many cases of measles have been reported, in recent days, in the health zone of Materi-Tuieta-Cobly [Atakora department], suggesting an epidemic in the area.

A fever of 39 to 40 deg C [102.2-104 deg F], a runny nose, dry cough, conjunctivitis, lacrimation [shedding tears], edema [swelling] of the eyelids, puffy eyes, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, are some typical signs of measles exhibited by many children in the health area of Materi-Tuieta-Cobly. The number of children with these signs (of the disease) is increasing, with the situation becoming a full-blown measles epidemic.

It should be noted that measles is a disease caused by a virus of the family _Paramyxoviridae_ and it causes respiratory disease. Measles, a highly contagious viral disease, is the most common eruptive disease accompanied by fever. Its complications can be rapidly fatal to humans.

The head doctor of this health zone, Dr Oke Raimi, is aware of this fact. He has taken immediate measures to contain the disease, including increasing the staff in some facilities to allow for the immediate care of the many cases already recorded, and those that could be coming, without delay, and assured that steps will be taken for the rapid evacuation to the zonal hospital, Saint John of God in Tanguieta, for intensive care of cases suffering complications.

The Gombe State Ministry of Health said on Tuesday [2 Apr 2013] it had recorded 173 suspected cases of measles in 4 local government areas in the last 3 months. The areas are Gombe, Balanga, Dukku, and Nafada.

The State Epidemiologist, Dr Joshua Abubakar, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gombe that out of the cases, 10 were confirmed and currently undergoing treatment. Abubakar said the figure represented cases reported from January [2013] to date. He said when such reports were received, the ministry would immediately conduct immunisation mop-ups in the areas concerned. The epidemiologist attributed the cause to lack of adequate immunisation coverage in the areas. He, however, said that lack of political commitment and will during the immunisation campaign was a major setback. Abubakar, however, commended partners for development such as UNICEF, WHO, and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency for their contributions. He also urged them not to relent in their efforts. "If local government councils would pay their counterpart funds for immunisation frequently, I am sure there would not be a problem," he said.

[Low immunization coverage still comes up as the reason for the escalating number of measles cases countrywide, calling for mop-up campaigns in the immediate term and, subsequently, a review of the country's measles control strategy to address the setbacks and reinforce strong areas of the program.

To date 9 children have been admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Children's Hospital after being clinically diagnosed with measles and other complications like pneumonia. This was stated by PIMS Spokesperson Dr Waseem Khawaja on Thursday [4 Apr 2013].

According to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin -- Disease early warning system (DEWS) and response in Pakistan, 59 cases of measles have been reported in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) so far this year [2013]. According to the WHO, this figure climbs to a staggering 8532 cases across the country, including 218 deaths.

Dr Javed Hayat, head of the infectious diseases section at Holy Family Hospital (HFH), informed The Express Tribune that 7 cases of measles had been reported at the hospital this week [week of 1 Apr 2013]. He said over 160 cases of the disease had been reported at HFH so far this year [2013] with a majority of the victims coming from Rawalpindi. He added that many children who had been vaccinated against the disease were still suffering from it [incompletely vaccinated children can still get it], but said the situation was under control.

DEWS Senior Surveillance Officer Dr Musa Rahim confirmed that 8 cases of measles had been reported in different areas of Islamabad last week including Bhara Kahu, Tarlai, Tarnol, and Sabzi Mandi and Golra Sharif. Rahim said peak incidences of measles usually occurred in March and April and therefore he wasn't overly concerned with the current number of reported cases. He stressed the need to focus on the suburbs of the federal capital, as these areas were most vulnerable to the disease.
