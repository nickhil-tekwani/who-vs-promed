Nipah virus claims one more life
--------------------------------
A teenaged boy died of suspected attack by Nipah virus at Faridpur
Medical College Hospital on Thursday [6 Mar 2008]. According to the
upazila health complex sources, [The upazilas are the lowest level of
administrative government in Bangladesh. - Mod.CP] The 16-year-old
son of a Mangalpur villager started vomiting after he took date juice
on Monday [3 Mar 20088].

Meanwhile, health experts of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease
Control and Research (IEDCR) and ICDDR,B in a study report said that
basic preventive measures like hand washing, not sharing beds or food
and minimising the number of contacts can limit person-to-person
transmission of Nipah virus that still remains a risk. The central
and northwestern part of the country remains at risk for future
outbreaks of Nipah virus especially in January through May, the report warned.

So far in the past weeks, 8 people, including 4 children, have died
and 10 others badly affected in the latest outbreak of the Nipah
virus in Manikganj and Rajbari. The IEDCR confirmed the 1st spell of
the Nipah outbreak on 29 Feb 2008 based on the samples collected from
the bodies of the 3 children of Bishnupur village at Daulatpur
upazila in Manikganj.

Nipah virus, a new member of the 'paramyxovirus' family, was named
after Sungai Nipah, one of the Malaysian villages affected by the
virus. Dr. Chua Kaw Bing from the University of Malaya discovered the
virus in 1999. The IEDCR and ICDDR,B study suggested that when
clinicians see patients with fever and mental status change, they
should inquire if anyone else in their community has experienced a
similar illness in the preceding 2 weeks. Any clustering encephalitis
cases should be immediately reported to the district authority, it
also suggested. The repeated outbreaks of Nipah virus in the country
that result from person to person transmission underscored the
importance of developing strategies to interrupt the transmission of
saliva transmitted viruses, both at home and in hospitals, said the study.

Our Faridpur correspondent said the deceased teenager was 1st
admitted to Rajbari sadar hospital and later shifted to Faridpur
Medical College Hospital as his condition deteriorated. He died at
Faridpur Medical College Hospital on Thursday evening [6 Mar 2008].
Necessary samples from the affected boy have been sent to Dhaka for
determining the exact cause of his death, said local physicians.
Meanwhile, local authorities start a campaign today advising people
to remain alert about Nipah virus.

[This 2nd report from Bangladesh adds little to the preceding report
citing 8 deaths in an outbreak of Nipah virus infection in the
Manikganj and Rajbari districts of west-central Bangladesh (see:
Nipah virus, fatal - Bangladesh: (Dhaka) 20080303.0873). This report
adds one additional (as yet unconfirmed) death to the total.

It may be that the outbreak is being contained by prompt action of
the local health-care authorities and the emphasis being placed
placed on personal hygiene to reduce possibility of person-to-person
transmission, which has been a feature of Nipah virus infection in
Bangladesh. It is implied in the report that unpasteurized date juice
may have been the source of the infection of this new victim.
