Norovirus outbreak in an elementary school -- District of Columbia,
February 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 8 Feb 2007, the District of Columbia Department of Health (DCDOH)
was notified of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in an elementary
school (prekindergarten through 6th grade). The school nurse reported
that 27 students and 2 staff members had become ill during February 4
to 8 with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; because symptoms lasted
less than 48 hours, a viral etiology was suspected. DCDOH recommended
2 preinvestigation interventions, which were implemented the same
evening (8 Feb 2007): 1) more thorough hand washing and 2) bleach
cleaning of all shared environmental surfaces with a diluted (1:50
concentration) household bleach solution. This report summarizes the
subsequent investigation of the outbreak, which suggested that
non-cleaned computer equipment (that is, keyboards and mice) and
person-to-person contact resulted in illness. To decrease disease
transmission during gastroenteritis outbreaks, public health
officials should emphasize good hand washing practices, exclusion of
ill persons, and thorough environmental disinfection, including
fomites [articles] that are shared but not [usually] cleaned.
Epidemiologic investigation
---------------------------
On 9 Feb 2007, DCDOH conducted a site visit and interviewed school
personnel to determine the possible etiology of and risk factors for
illness and to recommend additional control measures. The school had
2 to 3 classes per grade, and one to 3 staff members were assigned to
each class. Although students attended a few classes outside their
classroom each day (such as art or math), they spent the majority
of time in their own classrooms. No outbreaks of gastrointestinal
illness in the community were reported to DCDOH during this period.
A case of gastrointestinal illness was defined as illness in a
student or staff member who reported nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
and who was present at the school any time during 2-18 Feb 2007. A
questionnaire was developed to use in a cohort study of all staff
members and students. Because no food was served at the school other
than lunches that students brought from home and prepackaged snacks
served in prekindergarten classes, foodborne transmission was not
suspected; questions focused on illness onset, symptoms, school
grade, classroom, special classes (such as, art), ill contacts, and
use of certain facilities or equipment (such as library computers)
or participation in certain programs (such as after-school
programs). Questionnaires were sent home by the school principal with
all staff members and students the afternoon of 9 Feb 2007. The
school nurse identified additional cases beginning 9 Feb 2007 by
visiting each classroom daily; she interviewed persons who became ill
during school and interviewed absent ill persons or a family member
by telephone regarding grade, classes, illness onset, and symptoms.
Information regarding ill contacts, facility and equipment use, and
participation in programs was unavailable from the participants
enrolled by the nurse.
Of 314 students and 66 staff members at the school, 207 (66 percent)
students and 59 (89 percent) staff members participated in the DCDOH
investigation, for a total of 266 participants (70 percent). A total
of 225 (85 percent) were identified by using the questionnaire, and
41 (15 percent) were identified by the school nurse interview. Of 266
participants, 103 (39 percent) met the case definition. Among the 103
ill persons, 79 (77 percent) were students and 24 (23 percent) were
staff members. The median age of students was 8 years (range: 3 to 12
years) and of staff members was 41 years (range: 13 to 66 years). A
total of 42 of 77 (55 percent) students and 22 of 24 (92 percent)
staff members were female. Illness onset occurred during 4-17 Feb
2007, with peak incidence on 7 Feb 2007. Reported symptoms included
vomiting (64 percent), nausea (56 percent), and diarrhea (47
percent). Median illness duration was 36 hours (range: 0.2-96
hours). Median length of stay at home after onset of symptoms was one
day (range: 0-4 days).
The attack rate (AR) among respondents was 39 percent overall; ARs
did not differ significantly between students and staff members or
between females and males. [These data are tabulated in the original
text]. Classroom ARs ranged from 18 percent (kindergarten classroom
G) to 71 percent (1st-grade classroom J). Illness was not
significantly associated with grade, location (that is, floor) of
classroom, special classes, or certain facilities or programs. Two
factors were significantly associated with illness in bivariate
analyses (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test): being in 1st-grade
classroom J (AR = 71 percent; relative risk [RR] = 1.9; 95 percent
confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-2.8) and contact with an ill person
(AR = 38 percent; RR = 1.8; CI = 1.2-2.7). Using a multivariable
model, being in classroom J and having an ill contact also were the
only 2 independent and significant risk factors after backward
elimination.
1st-grade classroom J was the only classroom in the school in which
computers were shared among students and staff members. Students in
all other classrooms either had their own computer or shared library
computers. Library computer use was not associated with illness, and
no students in classroom J reported using library computers.
Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Stool-specimen collection kits were provided during the DCDOH site
visit on 9 Feb 2007, and specimens were received from 2 ill persons.
A total of 25 swabs were used to sample environmental surfaces.
Although 9 Feb 2007 was the day after the initial bleach cleaning,
several surfaces had not been cleaned and were visibly soiled.
Sampled surfaces included toilets, faucets, water fountains,
doorknobs, mice and keyboards from 3 computers (each in a different
room), school utensils, and toys. Samples were tested by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for norovirus and
DNA sequencing; stool specimens also were cultured for bacteria.
Laboratory results were available 13 Feb 2007. One (4 percent) of the
25 environmental swabs, from a computer mouse and keyboard in
1st-grade classroom J, was positive for norovirus subtype GII.
Norovirus subtype GII also was identified in both stool specimens.
Noroviruses from the 2 stool specimens and a single environmental
sample were identical by DNA sequencing of region B, the gene
commonly used for genetic classification. Bacterial cultures of stool
specimens and environmental samples were negative.
On 15 Feb 2007, DCDOH recommended the following additional
interventions: 1) clean computer equipment (such as mice and
keyboards) and other shared surfaces that were overlooked during the
8 Feb 2007 cleaning with a 1:50 concentration household bleach
solution, and 2) exclude ill persons from school for at least 72
hours after resolution of illness because of continued fecal shedding
of infectious virus (1). The last person reported with a case of
illness had symptom onset 17 Feb 2007.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Norovirus (family _Caliciviridae_) causes the majority of acute
gastroenteritis outbreaks in the United States (2). Person-to-person
spread through the fecal-oral route, contaminated food and water, and
aerosolized vomitus are known to transmit norovirus; contact with
contaminated environmental surfaces also has been implicated in
transmission (3). Laboratory studies have demonstrated that fingers
contaminated with norovirus can transfer the virus to environmental
surfaces, which can subsequently contaminate clean fingers with
detectable amounts of norovirus (4). Because of shared computer use
in health-care facilities, schools, and workplaces, certain
researchers have suggested that computer equipment might be a route
of bacterial disease transmission (5). A surrogate marker for
norovirus, feline calicivirus, has been shown to persist on computer
mice and keyboards for 8 to 48 hours (6).
This outbreak is the 1st report of norovirus detected on a computer
mouse and keyboard, which highlights the possible role of computer
equipment in disease transmission and the difficulty in identifying
and properly disinfecting all possible environmental sources of
norovirus during outbreaks. The contaminated computer was located in
1st-grade classroom J, the only classroom that was independently
associated with illness and the only classroom in which computers
were shared by students and staff members. No other high-risk modes
of transmission explain the increased attack rate in classroom J; for
example, no food was served, water-fountain samples were negative for
norovirus, and no episodes of vomiting were reported. These factors,
together with previously documented hand-to-fomite and fomite-to-hand
norovirus transmission, suggest that computer contamination might
have played a role in norovirus transmission in classroom J and
possibly elsewhere in the school.
Person-to-person contact also likely played a role in this outbreak.
Contact with an ill person was one of 2 significant risk factors for
illness in bivariate and multivariable analyses. School children
might be at increased risk for person-to-person norovirus
transmission because of close quarters and poor hygiene (7). Because
an ill person is infectious while symptomatic and possibly for 3-14
days or longer after recovery because of continued fecal shedding,
the short exclusion time of ill persons from school (median: one day
after symptom onset) might have facilitated person-to-person
transmission in this outbreak. Student person-to-person contact
during the weekend was reported anecdotally, and onset of new cases
continued after the weekend.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations:
1. because data regarding ill contacts, facilities, and program
participation were unavailable for nurse-interviewed participants,
bivariate and multivariable analyses of these variables were limited
to data from survey respondents.
2. certain uninfected persons might have been misclassified as ill
because of the broad case definition and subjective reporting of
symptoms, which might have resulted in an overestimate of ARs.
3. data were not collected regarding which students in classroom J
used computers; consequently, the risk associated with computer
contact could not be directly assessed.
4. because several fomites were cleaned before sampling and not all
fomites were sampled, the extent of environmental contamination and
the possible transmission role of fomites unrelated to computers
could not be characterized.
Proper washing with soap and water can eliminate norovirus from hands
(4); alcohol-based sanitizers also reduce feline calicivirus on hands
(8). Potentially (but non-visibly) soiled surfaces are best
disinfected with a solution of 1:50 to 1:10 concentration of
household bleach in water (1000-5000 ppm chlorine) by vigorous wiping
for more than 10 seconds (4,9). However, because a 1:10 household
bleach solution is caustic, only corrosion-resistant surfaces should
be cleaned with this concentration. Laptop computer keyboards have
been shown to withstand more than 300 disinfections with 80 ppm
bleach solution without visible deterioration (5). When cleaning
environmental surfaces that are visibly soiled with feces or vomitus,
masks and gloves should be worn, a disposable towel soaked in dilute
detergent should be used to wipe the surface for more than 10
seconds, and a 1:10 household bleach solution should then be applied
for more than one minute (4,9). Disposable towels used to clean
visibly soiled surfaces should be discarded appropriately after use
because they can transfer norovirus to fingers and other surfaces
(4). Although quaternary ammonium compound-based cleaners typically
are not recommended for eliminating norovirus, certain newer
formulations* are effective; alcohol-only cleaners are less effective
(10).

[ProMED-mail now rarely reports norovirus outbreaks in view of their
ubiquity and short duration. However the report above deserves
attention as it documents a new hazard accompanying electronic
communication. It appears to be the 1st report of a norovirus
infected "mouse," and it provides useful information on how to
disinfect norovirus-contaminated keyboards and computer mice. -
