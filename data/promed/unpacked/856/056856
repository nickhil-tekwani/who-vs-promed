The Abu Dhabi emergency and crisis management team announced on [Tue 4 Oct 2016] it detected a number of bird flu-infected quays [quail], reported the United Arab Emirates (UAE) state news agency WAM.

Bird flu, also known as avian influenza or H5N1, is a highly pathogenic virus, and caused substantial outbreaks in domestic poultry in the Middle East and parts of Asia. The 1st human infection was reported in Hong Kong in 1997.

The cases were found in an area in the "Al-Gharbia" western region of the Gulf state.

The emergency and crisis management took the "necessary measures" consistent with international standards and regulations in handing such cases, said the WAM report.

The team said precautionary measures were also taken to ensure continuous monitoring of the cases in coordination with other stakeholders.

Furthermore, the team called on bird and farm owners to contact Abu Dhabi's government call center if they suspect poor health conditions of their birds, in order to learn about the necessary tests their birds need.

The team affirmed that these precautionary measures aim to ensure the safety of bird and farm owners and the community's safety as the H5N1 is fatal to most birds.

[Abu Dhabi is the capital and the 2nd most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (the most populous being Dubai), and also capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the largest of the UAE's 7 emirates.

According to the local media, UAE undertook severe measures to prevent the introduction of HPAI H5N1 since the earliest stages of the global epizootic, namely since 2007 (http://tinyurl.com/jh56chf). The virus was reported at that time from its large eastern neighbor, Saudi Arabia; the virus was suspected to have been introduced there by falcons imported from central Asia. It is assumed that falcons may be subject to imports to the UAE as well. According to UAE's reports to the OIE, updated 2015, HPAI H5N1 is included among the diseases which have never been recorded there. If definitely confirmed, the current case in quails becomes the epizootic's 1st outbreak in any of the 7 emirates; it will be of interest to note its route of introduction. - Mod.AS
