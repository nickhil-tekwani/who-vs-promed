[The outbreak in Riyadh keeps growing. There are now a total of 1162 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, including 498 deaths, reported in Saudi Arabia since June 2012. With respect to the ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV in Riyadh, since the beginning of August 2015 there have been a total 101 newly confirmed cases and 30 fatalities reported.
