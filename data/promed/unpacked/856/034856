In Italy, the 1st human cases of infection with West Nile virus of the season were reported in late July 2015 in the Lombardy region, province of Cremona. [They were traced to] an asymptomatic blood donor. In September 2014, the region had reported cases. On 3 Aug 2015, an additional case was reported in the same region (province of Parma) and 2 other cases were also reported on that date in the province of Reggio Emilia, south of Lombardy [in the region of Emilia-Romagna].

In Romania, in late July 2015, the 1st human cases of West Nile virus infection of the season were diagnosed in County Dojl (south west).

At the level of member states of the European Union, as of 6 Aug 2015, 6 cases have been reported, and 3 cases in a neighboring country (Israel).

Bulgaria was the 1st European country to report human cases of infection with West Nile virus [transmission] season, in the capital Sofia on 23 Jun 2015.

West Nile virus is endemic and epidemic in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, with epidemics regularly reported in summer and autumn.

Over the last 3 years, Romania has reported human cases of infection with West Nile virus (at least 3 indigenous cases in 2014, 1 case in 2013 and 14 cases in 2012). Active surveillance of human and animal cases of West Nile virus has been under way in southern Romania since 1997. There are many factors favorable to the proliferation of mosquitoes (_Culex_ spp):
- high temperatures
- heavy rains from May to September
- favorable natural sites (Danube).

West Nile virus is circulating in Europe in resident and migratory birds, but despite its high virulence in birds (especially crows) and horses, human cases are few. Migratory birds serve as virus reservoirs. Viral transmission is via the bites of _Culex_ spp mosquitoes. [A few days] after biting infected birds, female mosquitoes become capable of transmitting the virus to humans during a blood meal.

In the majority of cases (80 per cent), infection is asymptomatic. Symptomatic forms of the disease are characterized by sudden onset of high fever after 3-6 days of incubation. This fever is accompanied by headaches and back pain, muscle aches, cough, swelling of glands in the neck, and often a rash, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and breathing-related symptoms.

Neurological complications (meningitis, encephalitis) occur in less than 1 per cent of cases. More rarely, other complications (hepatitis, pancreatitis or myocarditis) may appear. Usually the patient recovers spontaneously, sometimes with sequelae, but the viral infection can be fatal, primarily in senior adults.

Travelers are advised to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Observe the usual measures of vector avoidance (protective clothing, mosquito repellents containing DEET on uncovered skin, clothes and mosquito net impregnated with insecticide for naps and at night). People who use sunscreen should apply [repellent] 20 minutes after the sunscreen.

Faced with a sudden onset of fever and joint or muscle pain within 15 days of returning from a trip to Europe, people should consult their doctor quickly.

[The 1st case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Europe this current transmission season occurred in Sofia, Bulgaria on 23 Jun 2015. An increasing number of cases in humans and equine animals can be expected in Europe over the coming 2-3 months. WNV has been present in Europe since the 1950s and is transmitted by mosquitoes. As noted by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control on 26 Jun 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150705.3487531), "Since 2010, when a large outbreak in Greece occurred, and [there was] implementation of close surveillance during the transmission season in 2011, hundreds of autochthonous (locally acquired) West Nile fever cases have been reported in Europe every year (See ECDC infographic on emerging mosquitoborne disease in Europe)."

"In 2011 ECDC started to implement West Nile fever surveillance during the mosquito transmission season in order to inform the blood safety authorities in Europe of areas in the EU and the neighbourhood with West Nile cases; according to EU legislation, blood donors from such areas should be deferred or tested."

Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only practical way for people to avoid WNV infection. Although the above report makes no mention of risk of WNV infections of equine animals, equine cases do occur in Europe, and owners in endemic areas should vaccinate their animals.
