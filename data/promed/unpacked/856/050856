Dioxins, the chemicals at the center of the latest European food scare, are
among the most toxic substances produced by modern industry.
Although there are 210 different dioxins and similar molecules called
furans, only about 17 are toxic. They are produced mainly through
incineration and by chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

"They have a wide range of toxic effects and are carcinogenic." said Ruth
Stringer, a senior research chemist at the Greenpeace research laboratories
at England's Exeter University.
The chemicals, produced when chlorinated substances are burned in the
presence of carbon and oxygen, are released into the environment through
air pollution, chemical waste and soil contamination.
They can be absorbed through the skin or consumed in food. Once in the
system, they can cause damage to cells and increase the risk of cancer.
[How much or the levels of exposure is important. - Mod.TG
A research study of workers exposed to very high doses of a dioxin known as
2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) found they had a 60 percent
greater than average chance of dying from cancer. [Where was this research
or it is in reference to the Seveso, Italy incident? Mod. TG
Nearly 450 people suffered skin injuries after an explosion at a chemical
plant in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 released a cloud of smoke containing dioxin.
Farms in Britain and the Netherlands have previously been shut down because
of dioxin contamination through municipal incineration or hazardous waste
disposal.
Because the molecules are so toxic, they are extremely difficult to detect
in animal feed or foods.
"You need very skilled technicians and sensitive equipment. The standard
turnaround time for dioxin analysis is about a month. Monitoring these
things on a day-to-day basis is not very practical," Stringer said.
"Because it requires such skill, the analysis costs about 750 pounds
($1,200) per sample and that's part of the problem."

[Dioxin analysis is time consuming and is expensive, but a month is way too
long. Most labs that I checked with indicate that 5-10 days is a more
normal and reasonable turnaround time. - Mod.TG
