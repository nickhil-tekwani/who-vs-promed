Traps used to monitor exotic _Aedes_ mosquitoes at ports of Auckland
-----------------------------------------------
In the moderator's comments on the post dated 3 Aug 2005
(20050802.2240) on the finding of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes
albopictus_ in ports of Auckland, I said it would be interesting to
know what mosquito traps were being employed to detect the presence
of these species after control operations had been put into effect.
(Note that in the original post, these 2 species were placed in the
genus _Stegomyia_, according to a recent reclassification of the
aedine genera, but see post 4 May 2005 (20050505.1244) on the
preference of ProMED for retaining _Stegomyia_ as a subgenus, that
is, not elevating it to generic status).
Ms. Sally Gilbert, Chief Technical Officer (Health), and Team Leader
(Environmental Health) of the Ministry of Health
(<sally_gilbert@moh.govt.nz>) has kindly informed ProMED that both
ovitraps and adult traps employing carbon dioxide are being used. We
thank Ms. Gilbert for promptly supplying us with this useful
information.
There are many types of ovitraps, but, basically, they attract
ovipositing mosquitoes, which lay their eggs in the traps, and these,
or the hatched larvae, are identified to species. Adult traps
employing carbon dioxide as an attractant catch host-seeking (that
is, hungry) female mosquitoes.
