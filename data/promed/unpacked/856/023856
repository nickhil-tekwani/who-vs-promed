Influenza Update N 223
--------------------
Summary
------
Globally, influenza activity was low, with the exception of some Pacific Islands.
- In North America, influenza activity began to increase slightly but remained low.
- In Europe overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza detections decreased with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing most influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI).
- In Africa and eastern and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease or remained low, with influenza B predominant in India and Viet Nam.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels except in several Pacific Islands, where ILI activity remained high.
- Overall: Based on FluNet reporting (as of 31 Oct 2014 08:20 UTC), during weeks 41 to 42 (5 Oct 2014 to 18 Oct 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 43 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 31 820 specimens. 1318 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 778 (59 percent) were typed as influenza A and 540 (41 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 46 (11 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 374 (89 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 28 (100 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 0 (0 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.
- Due to changes in data collection platforms, data from the WHO Regional Office for Europe are temporarily not available at the global level. Those data will be uploaded to FluNet and FluID as soon as possible. Information on European influenza activity can be found at http://www.flunewseurope.org/.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------
North America, Europe, Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region

In the countries in the northern hemisphere, overall influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels but began increasing slightly. Influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were predominant.

In Canada, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity has been above the historical average for the last 7 weeks. Influenza detections increased but remained low (2 percent influenza positivity rate), following seasonal trends. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common influenza virus detected, and most detections occurred in patients aged over 65 years.

In the United States of America, ILI activity remained below the national baseline, and the percentage of samples testing positive for influenza continued to increase slightly (5 percent influenza positivity rate) but was within expected levels for this time of year. Since mid-August 2014, 1101 cases of enterovirus D68 have been identified among cases of respiratory illness.

In Mexico, acute respiratory infections (ARI) and influenza activity increased but remained consistent with seasonal patterns.

In Europe, influenza activity was low, and there was no indication that the influenza season had begun. From 25 countries in the European region, one percent of 429 specimens tested positive for influenza.

Eastern Asia
----------
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low.

In northern China, influenza activity was low and mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) virus.

In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

In Mongolia, ILI activity increased with no indication of influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
--------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall in this region, influenza activity was low.

Circulation of influenza B virus was reported from most of the Caribbean and central American countries, such as Costa Rica and Nicaragua. However, in most central American countries, detections of influenza B virus decreased over the recent weeks. In Puerto Rico, ILI activity was moderate, but influenza detections were low. In Cuba, influenza B also predominated among influenza virus detections, and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated hospitalizations decreased and were due mainly to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In Nicaragua, influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype following an earlier wave of influenza B in August 2014.

Tropical countries in South America reported ILI and SARI activity within the expected range for this time of the year. RSV continued to circulate but with decreasing trends. In Colombia, influenza activity continued, with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. In Peru, influenza activity continued to decrease and was dominated by influenza A(H3N2).

In Brazil, activity continued and influenza B was the most commonly detected influenza virus.

Central African tropical region
-----------------------
In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle and western Africa was at low levels. In Madagascar, increasing activity was reported, mainly caused by influenza A(H3N2) and some influenza B viruses.

In most southern Asian and Southeastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

In India and Viet Nam, activity decreased and was predominantly caused by influenza B viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America

In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity had reached inter-seasonal levels.

In South Africa, ILI and SARI activity remained low, with influenza B predominating among positive ILI samples and co-circulating with influenza A(H3N2) virus.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
-------------------------
In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable; an increasing trend was reported in the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Samoa, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna.

The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[Interested readers should access the original text to view the graphical presentation of portions of the above data. Currently, the global pattern of human influenza virus infection remains relatively unchanged. The predominance of respiratory syncytial virus infection in parts of the southern hemisphere is beginning to decline. No unusual strains of human influenza viruses have made an appearance, and available vaccines should remain effective in both hemispheres for the immediate future. - Mod.CP]
