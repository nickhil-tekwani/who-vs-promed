An estimated 500 to 600 ducks and geese have died due to avian cholera near Parma in western Idaho.

The Idaho Department of Fish and Game in a news release [Tue 21 Feb 2017] says the birds were found dead on private land on Feb. 9. [2017].

Officials say tests on 2 Canada geese, 6 mallards, and a red-tailed hawk identified avian cholera as the cause of the deaths.

Experts say avian cholera is caused by a bacterium spread by dead or dying birds, and that dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission among healthy birds.

Officials say the dead birds were buried to prevent scavengers from eating them.

Officials say the nearby Fort Boise Wildlife Management Area is a popular migratory stopover for waterfowl.

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacteria _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear-cut. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitations. Others suggest that absence of rain lead to high concentration of waterfowl leading to unusual high mortality. - Mod.PMB
