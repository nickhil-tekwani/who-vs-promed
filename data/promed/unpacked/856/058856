Beekeepers in Moray and neighbouring areas have been urged to be vigilant for signs of a deadly disease. An outbreak of American foulbrood (AFB), a disease affecting colonies of honeybees, has been found in an apiary in the Tarland area of Aberdeenshire.

This outbreak has been found as part of the Scottish Government's Scotland-wide surveillance programme. The disease was confirmed following laboratory diagnosis by Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA). The AFB infected hive is being destroyed as there is no permitted treatment for the disease in the UK.

There are no risks to public health from AFB and no implications for the quality and safety of honey. The movement of bees and related equipment into or out of the affected apiary are under specific controls. Bee farmers and beekeepers are being urged to be vigilant for signs of the disease, to maintain good husbandry practices and to notify any suspicion of disease to <BeesMailbox@scotland.gsi.gov.uk>.

In order to assist Scottish Government Bee Inspectors to control this and other diseases, beekeepers are urged to register on BeeBase [http://hymenopteragenome.org/beebase/], the national bee database. This will give them access to up-to-date information on the control of AFB and bee related issues.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. _P. larvae_ spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
