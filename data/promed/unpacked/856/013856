Two wild birds were found to be infected with the H5N8 strain of avian influenza this month [May 2022] in Israel, according to an Agriculture Ministry report to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

According to the report, a Eurasian Sparrowhawk was found near Petah Tikva and tested positive in mid-April [2022]. In early May [2022], a White Stork which was found near Ruhama in southern Israel tested positive for the bird flu.

The Agriculture Ministry has not issued a statement about the new cases. No new cases have been reported since, although the report described the event as "ongoing." Before these 2 cases, the last time the H5N8 strain was reported in Israel was April 2021.

The new cases come just months after a large outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza swept through Israel during the winter with the last outbreak reported in February [2022] in northern Israel.

In mid-January [2022], the Agriculture Ministry announced that the bird flu outbreak was under control (https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-692553).

The new infections in Israel come as North America and Europe continue to suffer from one of the worst outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu ever recorded.

[Israel's notification to the OIE (now known as WOAH) about the above 2 cases of HPAI H5N8 in wild birds, is available at https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/h5n8-heb-15-05-22. It includes a map, presenting the locations of the 2 birds. The European Sparowhawk (_Accipiter nisus_) was found in Hamerkaz (Central) district; the "Description of the affected population" was: "This bird was found positive to H5N8, in contrary with the other birds in the last months, which were found with H5N1". The White Stork (_Ciconia ciconia_) was found in Hadarom (Southern) district. During the years 2016-mid 2021, only H5N8 cases have been reported from Israel.

A Final Report of the HPAI H5N1 event during the 2021/2022 winter season has been submitted on 15 May 2022 to the OIE. This report is available with a map at https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/h5n1-15-5-22/he/animals_health_avian-influenza_ofot-bar-h5n1-15-05-22.pdf. This event started (was confirmed) on 30 Nov 2021; the last occurrence of this serotype in Israel has been dated 9 Apr 2022. The epidemiological comments were as follows:

"Several outbreaks in poultry have occurred in Israel in the past few weeks. The hypothesis is that the domestic birds are infected by fomites sourced from wild birds. Israel is a migration route for about 500 million birds twice a year between Africa and Asia". ..."The outbreak in Agmon Hahula affected a large population of cranes with a potential to affect other populations in the natural park as other water birds and wild cats".

The above HPAI H5N1 event involved the death of more than 8000 wild birds, predominantly cranes, and outbreaks in poultry (laying hens, turkeys, and ducks) throughout the country. The feeding of migrating birds, as exercised in the Hula valley, has subsequently been put to study and discussion by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Their conclusions were published by the National Parks and Nature Reserves Authority (PNRA) on 1 Mar 2022. The decision was summarised by the Authority's DG, Raya Soraki, as follows:

"After examining the process of cranes' feeding, there is a consensus that the feeding significantly contributes to the increase in the number of cranes wintering in the Hula Valley and to the duration of the cranes' stay in the valley in particular, and in the entire country at large.

"The Nature and Parks Authority has formulated a recommendation to cancel the feeding scheduled to 28 Feb this year (2022), in order to prevent the crowding of migratory cranes returning from the south with the now wintering population which has stayed in the valley, and to prevent exposure and risk of infection.

"This break will be accompanied by observations and studies of the issue".

The report, titled "For the sake of poultry - stopping feeding cranes, preventing bird flu" is available at https://www.parks.org.il/new/agurim/ (in Hebrew). - Mod.AS
