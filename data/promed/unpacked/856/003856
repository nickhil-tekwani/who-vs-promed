Malcolm Booth, et al. Anthrax infection in drug users. Lancet. 2010;

--------------------------------
Since December 2009, 31 cases of anthrax infection have been confirmed in
heroin users in Scotland, with 11 deaths. All injection routes have been
implicated, but smoking or snorting may also present a significant risk.
Here we highlight salient features to assist other clinicians with
diagnosis and management.

Patients have not presented with classic anthrax (cutaneous, inhalational,
or gastrointestinal) but represent a new pattern, previously described as
injectional. Presentation may vary. Three patients presented with
intracranial or subarachnoid haemorrhage with anthrax bacilli in their
blood. All died rapidly -- that is, in the late stages of disseminated
anthrax. Gastrointestinal symptoms occasionally predominated, probably
reflecting disseminated disease. Most have presented as atypical, but
severe, soft tissue infections, with significant soft-tissue oedema (one
inducing compartment syndrome). Findings differ from classic necrotising
fasciitis or classic cutaneous anthrax, and can present as variants of
cellulitis or abscess.

Patients can present with vague prodromal symptoms or excessive bruising at
the index injection site, which may be difficult to identify. Despite
appearing very unwell, tachycardic, and peripherally shut down, they
maintain an almost normal blood pressure, respiratory function,
oxygenation, and acid-base, and are lucid. Systemic features might
otherwise be non-specific. Haematology and biochemistry are also
non-specific; typically, the white-cell count, C-reactive protein, and
lactate are not grossly abnormal. A decline in platelet count may predict
clinical deterioration, even if remaining within the normal range.
Coagulopathy may develop, with significant bleeding.

In cases of severe soft tissue infection, fluid requirements may exceed 10L
per 24h. Surgical debridement removes the nidus of infection and provides
diagnostic material (Gram stain, culture, and PCR). Characteristic surgical
features include profound capillary bleeding, necrosis of predominantly the
superficial rather than deep fat, oedema not fasciolysis, and the finding
of needle tracks containing necrotic material.

We recommend examining the whole body at least every 12 h. Florid tense
oedema has been characteristic of disease severity and of late progression.
Subsequent distant foci have been noted on other body sites within 48 h of
initial debridement (injection sites with oedema, skin reaction, and
associated masses).

In many cases the illness has been biphasic. After resuscitation and
surgery, the patient may stabilise, or seem to recover, but then decline
24-72 h later. Decline may be rapid, and progress to septic shock requiring
cardiovascular support and mechanical ventilation, and then to renal
failure. Septic shock has been resistant to both inotropic and
vasoconstrictor therapy with adrenaline, noradrenaline and vasopressin.
Large pleural effusions and ascites may develop. These are a reservoir of
anthrax toxin and must be drained. If preterminal deterioration
subsequently occurs, it is rapid and profoundly unresponsive to standard
ventilatory, cardiovascular, and renal support interventions.

[Normally, we only post outbreak reports and related epidemiologic aspects.
But the Scottish clinical experience with these cases will teach us all
much of value, especially as, in this instance, the report is brief. Once
this disease is beyond the early easy stages, it is very hard to treat and
successfully save patients. Readers are encouraged to access the document
itself for the figures and references. If anyone is confused by the
numbers, the present count is 35 cases, not 31. The difference is merely
due to publication delays. - Mod.MHJ]
