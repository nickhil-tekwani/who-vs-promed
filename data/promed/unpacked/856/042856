Michael Gove's pledge to cull thousands of badgers to end the tuberculosis epidemic in England's cattle faces a scientific challenge, from research showing foxes can also carry the disease.

If confirmed, it could make Gove's cull pointless because it is based on the belief that badgers are the only wild animals to infect cattle.

Last month French government scientists published evidence showing foxes could also carry and transmit bovine TB (bTB). "Infection in wild red foxes was found in southern France, where livestock and other wildlife species are infected," said researchers from the French Food and Environment Agency, in a paper in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.

"Our results suggest a possible role of the red fox in the epidemiology of bTB."

[Human and livestock diseases can be difficult to control where infection persists in wildlife populations. Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of the entire _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC), and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans. This makes control by culling very frustrating and inefficient. This case increases the list of potential hosts for _M. bovis_. There is need to pursue further research to unveil the role red foxes might have in the dynamics of _M. bovis_.

Regarding culling badgers as a control method: for over 3 decades, European badgers (_Meles meles_) have been culled by the British government in a series of attempts to limit the spread of _Mycobacterium bovis_, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB), to cattle. Despite these efforts, the incidence of TB in cattle has risen consistently, re-emerging as a primary concern for Britain's cattle industry. Recently, badger culling has attracted controversy because experimental studies have reached contrasting conclusions, with culled areas showing either markedly reduced or increased incidence of TB in cattle. Furthermore, a study showed that culling reduces cattle TB incidence in the areas that are culled, but increases incidence in adjoining areas. However, the detrimental effects of culling detected on neighboring land are initially substantial, but may become less strong on later culls. The impact of badger culling on cattle TB incidence depends critically upon the geographic extent and temporal pattern of culling. This has confused attempts to develop a science-based management policy.

The data available up to date strongly suggest that badger culling is only likely to be beneficial if conducted systematically over large areas, and sustained over several years. Previous analyses have suggested that culling conducted in small, localized areas has overall detrimental effects. Detailed studies should be carried out to determine whether such level of effort would be feasible in the long term, whether the level of disease control achieved would be sufficient to warrant the costs involved, and whether the impact of badger removal would become a conservation and ecosystem health problem. If red foxes emerge as an important new player for bovine TB, culling badgers might become even more controversial. - Mod.PMB
