China's drug watchdog has told the country's 2nd-biggest maker of rabies vaccines to stop production after a snap inspection uncovered evidence of forged data, dealing yet another blow to the scandal-plagued pharmaceutical industry.

The State Drug Administration [CFDA] said inspectors found serious violations of a protocol for drug production involving the Vero-cell rabies vaccine at Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology in Changchun, in the northern province of Jilin.

In a statement on Sunday [22 Jul 2018], the administration said it ordered its Jilin branch to revoke the company's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for medical products certificate, an essential licence for production. The statement said the batch involved in the inspection had not been put on the market, and inspectors from the Jilin drug regulator and the administration were stationed at the company for further investigation. The administration did not give details of the forged data.

Rabies is a deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals and is usually transmitted through a bite. It can also cause pain, headaches, fever, seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. Treatment for exposure to an infected animal involves a series of shots.

Tao Lina, a vaccination specialist at the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said the incident was serious and would undermine the public's already-weakened confidence in vaccines. "The incident is very severe in nature because it has dealt another blow to the public's confidence in domestically produced vaccines," Tao said. "The regulator should punish the company by revoking their production licences and imposing a very hefty fine."

Just 2 years ago, a scandal erupted in China over revelations that about CNY 570 million (USD 85.18 million) of improperly stored or expired vaccines were illegally sold across the country for years.

Changsheng Life Sciences, Changchun Changsheng's Shenzhen-listed parent company, said in a statement on Monday [23 Jul 2018] that the company had voluntarily recalled and sealed all the rabies vaccines that had been sent to disease control centres and hospitals. It also defended its quality by saying "no adverse effects related to the quality of the vaccine have been found from years of adverse effects monitoring."

Changsheng said it had about 23 percent of the market for rabies vaccines and produced about 3.54 million sets of the shots last year. Rival Liaoning Chengda Biotechnology made about 8.4 million.

According to Changchun Changsheng, its vaccine was registered for use in India, Cambodia, and Nigeria by last year, but it was unclear whether any had been exported.

[The need to improve the testing requirements, control, and regulation of veterinary vaccines in China, safeguarding their safety and efficacy, has been raised by ProMED several times throughout the years in relation to several diseases.

Suspected rabies vaccine failures in humans in China have been reported in posts 20170804.5226670 and 20050718.2071. This vaccine is mainly applied for lifesaving, post-exposure application.

China is a high-risk environment for rabies, with human rabies cases 2nd only to India globally. Rabies geographic distribution was discussed in a 2016 review paper (ref 1), covering 55 years of rabies epidemiology in mainland China. The authors stated that rabies still remained a serious public-health problem in China, the east and south regions more seriously affected compared with other regions. Males in rural areas had a higher risk of infection than residents in urban areas. A clear seasonal pattern was observed, with a peak in August.
