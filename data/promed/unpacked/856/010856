A new study comparing excess years of life lost (YLL) during the 1st year of COVID-19 in parts of England and Wales shows that economically deprived areas suffered 3 times as many deaths as affluent regions, and young adults (15-44 years old) were 11 times more likely to die from the virus in poorer parts of the United Kingdom. The study is published in PLOS Medicine (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003904).

Though excess deaths have been used as a metric during the pandemic, the researchers from the University of Manchester said excess YLL accounts for the differences in ages at which people die in different social groups and may be a better measure of how seriously a community has been affected by the pandemic.

The authors used national mortality registers in England and Wales from 27 Dec 2014 until 25 Dec 2020, covering 3 265 937 deaths, to measure YLL attributable to the pandemic.

The authors found an average of 1645 YLL per 100 000 of the population in the most deprived areas, which included London and northwestern England, compared with 916 YYL per 100 000 people in the most affluent parts of the country.

"For all-cause mortality, estimated deaths in the most deprived compared to the most affluent areas were much higher in younger age groups, but similar for those aged 85 or over," the authors wrote.

In a press release, lead author Evangelos Kontopantelis, PhD, said, "The impact of the pandemic, when quantified using years of life lost, was higher than previously thought, on the most deprived areas of England and Wales, widening pre-existing health inequalities" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/942853).

[B] COVID vaccines and myocarditis

While cardiac imaging shows that COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis has a similar pattern as that from other causes, the abnormalities are less severe and result in less functional impairment, suggests a study yesterday [15 Feb 2022] in Radiology (https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.212559).

Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) after vaccination is rare, but some cases have been reported after receipt of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. University of Toronto researchers retrospectively studied the electronic health records of 92 adults diagnosed as having myocarditis with one or more T1 and T2 abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from December 2019 to November 2021.

Among the 92 patients, 22% were diagnosed as having myocarditis within 14 days after COVID-19 vaccination, 11% had myocarditis after COVID-19 illness, and 66% had myocarditis from another cause (non-COVID-19 infection in 31%, autoimmune disorder in 13%, drugs in 10%, hyper-eosinophilic blood disorder in 5%, and other/unknown in 41%).

MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (indicating myocardial injury) in 81% of vaccine-associated myocarditis patients and left ventricular dysfunction in 29%. These patients had higher left ventricular ejection fraction and less extensive LGE after controlling for age, sex, and time between symptom onset and MRI. Septal involvement was less common in this group.

Of patients with vaccine-associated myocarditis, symptom onset occurred after receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in 57% of cases and after Pfizer in 43%. Most cases (81%) occurred after the 2nd dose.

Average age was 31 years in the 1st group, 51 years in the 2nd group, and 44 in the 3rd group. The 1st group had a higher proportion of men (81%) than the other groups.

Fourteen vaccine patients (67%) were hospitalized for a median of 3 days. After a median of 22 days, all patients with vaccine-associated myocarditis were symptom-free and had no adverse events.

In a Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) news release, coauthor Paaladinesh Thavendiranathan, MD, said that patients should not let fear of myocarditis keep them from being vaccinated against COVID-19 (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943505). "The risk of myocarditis seems to be much higher following COVID-19 illness," he said. "However, if patients do experience symptoms -- especially chest pain -- early after COVID-19 vaccination, they should seek medical attention."

[2] Implications of mask relaxation on immunocompromised

Nearly 2 years into a global pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 920 000 people in the United States, the masks are finally coming off. This month [February 2022], 4 blue states (New Jersey, Connecticut, Oregon and Delaware) announced an end to indoor mask mandates, including in schools. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul is still deciding whether she'll lift the mandate in schools but has removed it everywhere else.

While COVID-19 and its attendant variants have made it virtually impossible to declare an end to this public health crisis, the latest news suggests we have reached the point in the fight against COVID where Americans increasingly get to choose their own path.

Over the past 23 months, the word "choice" has been wielded mostly by anti-vaccine advocates. They have repeatedly declared that their choice whether to wear a mask or their decision whether to get a vaccination should take precedence over the health of those around them.

But now it is the vaccinated people who get to choose. After a terrifying spike in cases in early to mid-January [2022], the omicron surge is in dramatic decline. In just over 4 weeks, the number of COVID cases has fallen by close to 80%. Already, in most parts of America, life has largely returned to normal. Kids are in school, restaurants and bars are open, cultural events are a daily occurrence. While office life has yet to approach pre-pandemic levels, that is as much a product of people's changing relationship with work as it is an actual consequence of COVID.

With public health restrictions increasingly being lifted -- or in many states, simply nonexistent -- people can do pretty much everything they were doing pre-COVID, and they can do it maskless.

That doesn't mean America has moved past the pandemic. COVID continues to kill around 2500 people every day. Millions of unvaccinated Americans remain at risk, which means tens, if not hundreds, of thousands more people will likely die needlessly from a preventable illness. But considering that vaccines have been readily available for up to 10 months, it's not clear what else can be done to convince those who seemingly don't want to be convinced. About a quarter of Americans have chosen the freedom to remain unprotected over the allegedly unreasonable suggestion that they shield themselves from a deadly virus.

Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans have made a different choice. The fact is, if you're vaccinated and boosted, your chances of getting seriously ill from COVID are incredibly slim. Your chances of dying are infinitesimally small. For those of us who are not worried about getting sick and feel that the risk of COVID is worth the return to a normal civic and social life, the pandemic has reached a manageable point. We can balance the risks of getting COVID with the desire to return our lives to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy. Already that has been happening, and with the further lifting of public health restrictions, it will only pick up steam. And make no mistake, it is the miraculous COVID vaccines that have made this possible.

If you remain concerned about COVID -- or have a co-morbidity or are immunocompromised -- you can choose to continue avoiding big crowds and to continue keeping your mask on. The same goes for parents with children under 5. Though the data show that kids are at a lesser risk, it's hardly surprising that some parents would want to be extra cautious. Even for all the constant demands to "open everything" (though most everything is already open) there are going to be some Americans who are wary of letting their guard down. It's hard to blame them. After all, in the spring [2021], many thought the pandemic was nearing an end; then came delta. After that wave -- and a decline in cases and deaths -- it seemed that maybe normalcy was around the corner; then came omicron. The pandemic has been a frustrating process of one step forward and 2 steps back.

But what's different now is, for perhaps the 1st time since the pandemic began, we can trod our own path. Americans are being given a clear option to make their own decisions about their health and risk tolerance. These are the kinds of choices that are made practically every day -- and in ways we don't often recognize. When we get in a car on a snowy, icy day or bike on a crowded city street or when we dole out new freedoms and responsibilities to our kids, whether it's allowing them to walk home from school or giving them access to social media platforms on their phone, we engage in a perennial balancing act. COVID will be no different.

COVID is not going away, and it will be a part of our lives for the foreseeable future. How we deal with that reality will define the next stage of COVID. While it doesn't mean the pandemic is over, it does mean we're far closer to its end than its beginning.

[Also read "The millions of people stuck in pandemic limbo. What does society owe immunocompromised people?" by Ed Yong (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-pandemic-immunocompromised-risk-vaccines/622094/). Excerpts from this article in The Atlantic follow:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Close to 3% of US adults take immunosuppressive drugs, either to treat cancers or autoimmune disorders or to stop their body from rejecting transplanted organs or stem cells. That makes at least 7 million immunocompromised people -- a number that's already larger than the populations of 36 states, without even including the millions more who have diseases that also hamper immunity, such as AIDS and at least 450 genetic disorders."

"Many immunocompromised people are now stuck in limbo -- unsure about how safe they really are, even after getting 3 shots and a booster, as the CDC advises. Scientific studies can hint at the average risks across large groups but offer little certainty for individuals."

"All of the [personal protective] measures would protect society as a whole from infectious diseases in general. They would also require some upfront investment in deciding how, exactly, they would work -- should companies be required to offer remote work, when possible, for some duration? What's the threshold for switching on mask requirements? These policies represent added expense and effort for our institutions, but this is the question that the United States now faces: COVID has added burdens to our society; who will bear their weight?"

With the relaxation of mask rules, immunocompromised individuals are no longer afforded the protection they need to be safe. The Atlantic article raises important points regarding the implications of dropping masking on immunocompromised individuals, which includes those who are aging. - Mod.LK]

A global total of 12 019 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Feb 2022 to late 14 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. However, the 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 91 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 49 of the 91 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 20.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 50.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 35.8% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 2.14 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 418.16 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.86 million reported deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
