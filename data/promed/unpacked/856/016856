Just a reminder on plague control. Advice to control rodents should be
accompanied by a recommendation also to control fleas. Killing rodents
liberate infected fleas. So, a campaign against rodents must be followed by
the use of insecticides.

I was concerned with the statement, "Officials urged people who live in
rural areas to take precautions to eliminate rodents that may be spreading
the plague through their fleas". The statement appeared in the recent
posting on plague in Colorado.

Eliminating the rodents, means that the fleas will look for another warm
blooded host. The guidance should be to first control the fleas, and then
get rid of the rodents.
Outdoor flea control for rodent populations is described in "Contingency
Pest Management Pocket Guide, " dated 11 Sept 1989, distributed by the
Armed Forces Pest Management Board.

For outdoor use, Carbaryl (Sevin 5) 5% dust can be applied in animal
burrows (2 oz/burrow), put out in rodent bait stations (0.25lb/4-6 bait
stations), or applied to the ground by dusting (20 lbs/acre). Cypermethrin
(Demon WP) as a residual spray to surfaces of buildings, porches, screens,
window frames, eaves, patios, and refuse dumps can also be used.

For indoor use, Chloripyrifos (Dursban LO or Dursban PRO) can be applied
as a "fine particle broadcast spray" to infested areas. Deltamethrin
(Deltadust) as a indoor "spot" or "crack-and-crevice" treatment can be
used. Can apply outdoors as a residual spray to outside surfaces of
buildings and other areas, such as refuse dumps, where fleas congregate or
have been seen.

As always, I would caution that any use should strictly confirm to the
manufacturers guidance.
