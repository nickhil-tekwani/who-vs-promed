2003/002 Outbreak of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in tomato in Germany
The German NPPO recently informed the EPPO Secretariat that Pepino mosaic
potexvirus (PepMV, EPPO Alert List) was found in tomato fruits in a
glasshouse in Sachsen, during official EU monitoring. The origin of the
infection is not known, but eradication measures have been taken.
This is the fourth record of an outbreak of PepMV in tomato in Germany
since 1999. Eradication measures have been successful up to now in 2 of
these cases. The pest status of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Germany is
declared as follows: Present, only in 2 premises, under protected
cultivation. Transient, actionable, under eradication.

[PepMV is highly contagious and spreads rapidly, hence the difficulties in
managing the disease. Early detection is key to disease management. Spread
is by contaminated tools, clothing, and hands, especially by those who are
pruning tissues. PepMV is stable in dried infected plant material for
several months.
