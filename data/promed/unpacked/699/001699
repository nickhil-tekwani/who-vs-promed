A tomato grower is travelling to Kenya to help deal with a devastating disease that's killing the crop. He hopes what he's learned in his greenhouse in Prince Edward Island [Canada] will help farmers in Kenya.

He [describes] the impact of southern bacterial wilt on his crop. "When you see the 1st symptoms, within 2 weeks, the entire crop is gone. It moves that quickly and it's that devastating. It's not something you lose a few [plants] to, it's something which will take the entire crop and I know how it feels."

He is making the trip with the local development group Farmers Helping Farmers. Coordinator Teresa Mellish said the tomato greenhouses are a big investment for the women her group is working with. "They saw these greenhouses as a way to make money, and they're quite devastated about it," she said. "The tomato is the most valuable vegetable crop that we can grow in these greenhouses." Tomatoes are a staple in the country.

The farmer is taking tomato seeds to grow a resistant variety of tomato that he'll then teach the Kenyan farm women to graft onto their susceptible plants.

[Bacterial wilt (BW; also called southern BW) caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (previously _Pseudomonas s._) is one of the major diseases of tomato and other solanaceous crops (including potato and aubergine). It is most severe in tropical and subtropical areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Symptoms on tomato include wilting of the youngest leaves which may recover temporarily during cooler evenings; eventually the whole plant wilts permanently, roots and lower portion of the stem develop browning of the vascular system, invaded roots may rot, and plants may die.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material, soil, and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas and use of certified clean tomato explants for planting. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen reservoirs, and phytosanitary measures may be used. Grafting susceptible tomato varieties onto rootstocks of resistant aubergine lines is widely practiced in some Asian countries. Tomato varieties with some genetic resistance/tolerance exist, but due to the different strains of the pathogen may not be suitable for all regions. Hopefully the cultivars used in Canada will be effective within the Kenyan pathogen population, but generally breeding programmes to develop resistant varieties suitable for local conditions are needed.

_R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including important crops such as banana, potato, peanut, and a number of vegetables. _R. s._ has been classified into various races and biovars active under different climatic conditions and affecting different hosts.
