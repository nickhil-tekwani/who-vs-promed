Korean officials announced Sun [11 Feb 2018] that 20 additional cases of norovirus have been confirmed, bringing the total to 159 confirmed cases at the Olympics.

The 20 new cases come a day after Olympic organizers expressed confidence the outbreak appeared to be under control. Between Wed 7-Fri 9 Feb 2018, 11 additional norovirus cases were confirmed.

Still, Sung Baik You, spokesman for the Pyeongchang organizing committee (POCOG), expressed confidence that the worst is behind them. Dr. Richard Budgett, the scientific director for the International Olympic Committee, said that Korean government health officials have been aggressive in increasing public awareness about the outbreak.

Norovirus is considered highly contagious and typically includes symptoms of diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting and nausea. It is typically spread by contaminated water and food, though the virus can also be transmitted if people touch dirty surfaces or are in close contact with people already sickened by the disease.

[See ProMED Norovirus - South Korea: (KW) Winter Olympics 20180209.5616795 for discussion of the highly contagious nature of norovirus and the rapid response by S. Korea during this outbreak.

In response to the outbreak, POCOG officials say they have designated a supervisor for each facility to monitor daily cleaning of the apartments where athletes, organizers and media are staying. The South Korean government has also distributed 15 000 bottles of hand sanitizers to help stem the outbreak [reported on 9 Feb 2018 by USA Today at https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/09/norovirus-security-workers-cases-slowing/325735002/].

The Korean CDC Director, Kim Hyun-jun, has said that January and February are known to be the "peak season" for the disease.

Noroviruses are difficult to control. They are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae family. Although hand sanitizers are being distributed en masse, they are not effective against this group of viruses. Jim Gauthier wrote: "It should be noted that norovirus is also resistant to many disinfectants. There should be a label claim for small, non-enveloped virus efficacy such as the ability to kill poliovirus, norovirus or rhinovirus, which will indicate that the disinfectant has been tested against these hard-to-kill viruses. Many 10 minute-contact time wipes will NOT be effective against this virus." [Submitted by Jim Gauthier, MLT, CIC, Senior Clinical Advisor, Infection Prevention http://www.diversey.com/].

The best prevention of norovirus infection is frequent hand washing and sanitary handling of all items that may be ingested.
