In Udmurtia 67 people have become ill with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the 1st 2 months of 2014, which is a 3-fold increase in the number of cases compared with last year [2013].

According to the press service of the Udmurtia Ministry of Health, 67 cases of HFRS were registered in the 1st 2 months of 2014. For the same period last year [2013] there were only 20 cases. Doctors are strongly concerned about this fact because it seems there are too many cases for such an early period of spring in the country.

[Udmurtia is a region known as one of the most active natural foci of HFRS in the world. Of course this is a seasonal increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS ), with about 67 laboratory-confirmed cases of this dangerous disease. Public health physicians are explaining the current peak due to a relatively warm winter and rich food sources of the red-backed vole, which is the main source and spreader of the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever. - Mod.NR

Mod.CP commented, "hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome (HFRS) occurs mainly in Europe and Asia and is characterized by fever and renal failure associated with hemorrhagic manifestations. Hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome is caused by airborne contact with secretions from rodent hosts infected with the group of viruses belonging to the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. In Europe, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is caused by hantaviruses: Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_); Dobrava virus (DOBV), carried by the mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_); and Saaremaa virus (SAAV), carried by the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_) (see ProMED-mail archive no 20131211.2109877)." Although not stated in the above report, the above cases are most likely caused by PUUV, maintained in the bank vole.
