Increased protection measures against Ralstonia introduction in
France
---------
"[...] _Ralstonia_ (formerly _Burkholderia_, itself formerly
_Pseudomonas-) solanacearum, is classified in France as a
quarantine pathogen [as a threat to potato and tomato production].
A decree of 11 Feb 1999 will come into operation on 21 Aug 1999
and will replace a former decree of 28 March 1996. The decree
states that control of this pathogen is mandatory and that 'its
appearance and spread must be avoided.' Moreover, were its
occurrence detected, 'its spread should be avoided and [directed]
towards eradication.' Every suspected occurrence must be
reported to the nearest SRPV [Regional Service for Plant
Protection] or to the DAF [Directorate of Agriculture and Forests] in
the overseas departments. The decree also states that the agents
of the Plant Protection Service "initiate every year systematic
research in order to detect the pathogen on relevant plant material
coming from metropolitan territory and overseas departments, but
also on culture medium, soil and solid refuse coming from firms
involved in industrial transformation or packaging."
--------------
The correspondent who filed this story added a comment, reflecting
a personal opinion which would not necessarily be that of the
employer. It is reproduced as follows:
"From my plant disease epidemiologist's experience and recent
reports of introduction of _Ralstonia_ in other countries, I strongly
doubt that administrative measures will avoid introduction of the
pathogen. Anticipating control measures to restrict it spread is
more of an operational task. However, the increased demand for
use of the so-called and ill-defined 'precaution principle' may also
have triggered the adoption of new control measures."

[According to plant pathologists at the International Potato Center
(CIP), control of bacterial wilt is very difficult because of its wide
host range, its survival in soil, and its biological variation.
Management of the disease depends on an integrated combination
of control measures. These include use of pathogen-free and/or
-suppressive soils, disease-free seed, short crop rotations,
roguing of volunteers (sic), and resistance or tolerance. Chemical
control is not possible at present.
Thanks to Ivan Sache for sending this exerpt from PHYTOMA.
Perhaps this news piece will spawn comments from
phytobacteriologists. - Mod.DH]
