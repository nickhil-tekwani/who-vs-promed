Health officials in France are reporting 4 _Salmonella_ Poona cases in infants whose strains are genetically linked. The babies, 2 months to 10 months in age, were sickened between the end of August 2018 and the end of December 2018. A total of 3 babies were hospitalized for their salmonellosis, and all have been released.

Early investigations reveal a common food source with the 4 infants -- powdered milk of the same brand produced by the same factory in Spain. No other common food or drink has been reported. Investigations are currently being conducted with the Spanish authorities and the manufacturer to define the management measures to be put in place.
