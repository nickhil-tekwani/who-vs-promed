WHO update number 147
---------------------

Summary
-------
-- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere remains low or undetectable, though a recent outbreak of
influenza A(H3N2) in a seniors lodge has been reported in Alberta,
Canada.
-- Significant influenza activity was reported in only a few countries
of the tropical zone including Nicaragua in the Americas, Cameroon in
central Africa, and Cambodia in South East Asia.
-- Transmission in the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere
has returned to intra-seasonal levels, with some persistence of
influenza A(H3N2) in Australia.


Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The influenza season has not yet started in the northern hemisphere
temperate zone, though some activity has been reported in a few areas.
The majority of the countries in this zone reported low or no
influenza activity in recent weeks. In Canada, one
laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3) outbreak was reported in a
seniors lodge in Calgary, Alberta, in week 44. It is the 1st outbreak
due to influenza reported in Canada this season. In Europe, a number
of countries including France, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Czech
Republic, and parts the western Russian Federation have reported

Tropical countries of the Americas
----------------------------------
In the tropical countries of the Americas, generally low levels of
influenza transmission were reported with the exception of Nicaragua
where sharp increases in the numbers of influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 virus
detections began in late September. Most cases reported in the country
were in Managua, where 14 individuals with H1N1pdm infection were
hospitalized. Much smaller numbers of influenza A(H3N2) have also been
detected in the country. Transmission of H3N2 has decreased to low
levels in El Salvador and Honduras after peaking in September.

Sub-Saharan Africa
------------------
In sub-Saharan Africa, influenza transmission has generally remained
low with the exception of Cameroon. In Cameroon, influenza type B
transmission began in June and appears to be declining since peaking
in early September and corresponded to a parallel rise in
influenza-like illness (ILI) cases. Transmission of H1N1pdm, which
began about 6 weeks after type B, appears to be peaking now coincident
with a rise in H3N2 detections. Notably, more than 75 percent of the
ILI cases reported through the sentinel surveillance system in
Cameroon have been children under the age of 5 years.

Tropical Asia
-------------
Influenza transmission in tropical Asia is active in localized areas.
Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic report high level
transmission of a mixture of H1N1pdm and influenza type B (Cambodia)
and H1N1pdm (Lao People's Democratic Republic) in the end of October.
65 percent of ILI cases from sentinel sites in Cambodia tested
positive, primarily of influenza type B (60 percent) and influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09, with a small number of influenza A(H3N2). Viet Nam, in
contrast, has continued to report sustained transmission of H1N1pdm
for most of the year with a slight nadir occurring in June. Other
countries of southern Asia reported small numbers of both H3N2 and
influenza type B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------

In the temperate regions of South America influenza transmission has
declined to intra-seasonal levels and the season appears to be largely
over. Low or no influenza transmission is reported in all countries.

Southern Africa

South Africa experienced a 2nd peak of influenza transmission this
season between late August and late October of influenza virus type B
and A(H3N2), which followed an earlier peak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
This was manifested in the number of patients and virus detection rate
of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI). Transmission of all
influenza viruses has since declined to low levels.

Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific

Influenza activity is now at intra-seasonal levels in Australia and
New Zealand, though low-level transmission of H3N2 appears to be
ongoing in the former.

The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every two weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response
System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member
States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and
quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

Globally influenza transmission remains low or undetectable. Atypical
features were a sharp increase in the numbers of influenza
A(H1N1)pmd09 virus infections beginning in late September in
Nicaragua, and a 2nd peak of influenza transmission in South Africa
between late August and late October involving influenza viruses type
B and A(H3N2), which followed an earlier peak of influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09. - Mod.CP]
