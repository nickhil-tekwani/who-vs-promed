Impact of emergency oral rabies vaccination of foxes in northeastern
Italy, 28 Dec 2009 - 20 Jan 2010: preliminary evaluation
-------------------------------------------
Authors: K Capello, P Mulatti, A Comin et al

1. Abstract
-----------
Fox rabies re-emerged in northeastern Italy in 2008, in an area
bordering Slovenia. In 2009, the infection spread westward to Veneto
region and in 2010 to the provinces of Trento and Bolzano. Aerial
emergency oral fox vaccination [OFV] was implemented in the winter
2009-2010. Since this vaccination was performed at altitudes below
the freezing level, a statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate
its impact. Of the foxes sampled following the vaccination campaign,
77 percent showed a rabies antibody titre of =0.5 IU/ml.

2. Conclusions
--------------
The emergency OFV campaign was carried out during the winter, under
unfavourable weather conditions. In fact, it is not recommended that
vaccination be performed at temperatures below 0 DEGC because frozen
vaccines do not induce a sufficient immune response and the virus
titre may decrease as a result of freezing-thawing cycles. Despite
this and the fact that the size and structure of the fox population
are unknown, the campaign led to satisfactory immune coverage (77
percent) and the reduction of rabies incidence below 1000 m asl. In
the spring of 2010, a 2nd aerial OFV campaign was implemented in a
larger geographical area (i.e., the entire region of Friuli Venezia
Giulia, Trento and Bolzano, and part of the Veneto region). Based on
the results of the present monitoring study, this campaign was
expanded to cover altitudes up to 2300 m asl and ended in mid-June [2010].
