Alberta's chief provincial veterinarian announced yesterday [20 May 2014] that swine delta coronavirus (SDCV) is now a reportable disease in the Canadian province of Alberta. The following was released by Dr Gerald Hauer, chief provincial veterinarian:

Swine delta coronavirus (SDCV) is a new viral disease of pigs that has recently has been found in the United States and Ontario. SDCV is from the same family of viruses as porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and also causes severe diarrhea and death in suckling pigs. Any sudden onset of unusual diarrhea should be investigated immediately by a veterinarian.

Due to the economic harm that it could cause to the pork industry if it spreads to Alberta, effective 20 May 2014, I am declaring SDCV in swine as a reportable disease in the Province of Alberta under the authority of Section 3(b) of the Animal Health Act. As of 20 May 2014, all known or suspect cases of SDCV occurring in Alberta should be reported to the chief provincial veterinarian (CPV) within 24 hours.

Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) cause very similar symptoms to SDCV. Both are reportable in Alberta. The government will respond to PED the same as for SDCV, but does not respond to TGE cases. Lab testing is necessary to confirm the presence of TGE, PED, or SDCV.

Making SDCV a reportable disease will help minimize the risk of the disease becoming established in Alberta. The Alberta response will be guided by the Alberta Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease Control Plan. In accordance with this plan, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development (ARD) will provide support to the industry by:
- testing samples for SDCV at our lab;
- coordinating the Alberta response for the 1st few cases, if SDCV is found in the province;
- communicating with stakeholders;
- working with local veterinarians to provide advice on implementation of biosecurity and disease control measures for affected premises.

Because SDCV, PED, or TGE do not affect food safety, public health, or other types of animals, the plan does not call for ARD quarantining farms or placing movement controls. ARD will not pay compensation for disease control measures or losses associated with the disease. If you would like a copy of the plan or have any questions, please contact the Office of the chief provincial veterinarian at 780-427-3448.

[Making this a reportable disease is probably the 1st step in halting the rampant roaming of this disease. We hope the move proves helpful in controlling the disease and reducing its impact.
