Two students at a school in Ward 7 in N'Djili town have died of a
disease whose symptoms resemble those of acute flaccid paralysis. The
health authorities in the zone confirmed the existence of an
epidemic. The health authority of the DRC moved quickly to block the spread.

Two suspicious deaths in the space of a month in a school with
primary, secondary and vocational [levels] in N'Djili, namely the
Bosembo Professional Institute, have created panic in the ranks of
the school community of this commune [county]. Some [individuals]
point to witchcraft as a probable cause of these deaths.

According to testimony gathered there, the 2 students have shown
similar symptoms: paralysis of upper and lower limbs, urinary
retention, etc. The 3rd case of this disease, not as yet diagnosed,
was hospitalized at the La Grace Medical Center in Ward 7 in N'Djili.

One of the [medical] center staff met at the office of the N'Djili
mayor on last Friday [25 Feb 2011?] to convey information to the
local authority and has certified the presence of an epidemic. It is
probably an epidemic of an advanced form of poliomyelitis, he said.
"We have received these cases. Initially, it was not clear exactly
what had happened. Only after the 2 deaths and the 3rd case have we
confirmed the existence of an outbreak. We asked the students not to
be in contact with the bodies of people who already have the disease.
Unfortunately, overly excited, they all believe that it is
witchcraft. That is why we have alerted the responsible health
officials of the area so that they are aware of this situation and
will alert the national health authorities."

Reached by telephone late yesterday [25 Feb 2011] afternoon, the
director of the N'Djili health zone confirmed the information. "We
are very aware of this epidemic. But it's in a technical file that
I'm limited to give you further explanation. You must see the medical
director of the health zone." That was all [we learned]. As of today,
no one knows exactly what is going on in the N'Djili school, located
within 100 meters from the town hall.

[At present] only 2 students have succumbed to this mysterious
disease. Another is in a hospital. But there are certainly other
students who were in contact with the 3 above [mentioned cases] and
probably could present with symptoms in the coming days. It is,
therefore, urgent to stop [the outbreak] before the situation reaches
alarming proportions.

In N'Djili, one does not yet feel the gravity of the disease that has
struck the town. That is because, to date, everyone has hidden behind
witchcraft as an explanation for these deaths in the Bosembo
Institute Bosembo. However, medical personnel, such as those in the
Grace Medical Center, are convinced that this is an epidemic -- as
yet unidentified -- but similar to acute flaccid paralysis.

Is it [related to] the wild poliovirus [WPV outbreak] or acute
flaccid paralysis that has recently erupted in the DRC town of
Kikwit, Bandundu?

Once eradicated, acute flaccid paralysis [AFP], an advanced form of
polio, had reappeared in Kikwit in December 2010, where it has caused
the deaths of 15 people.

Up through mid-December [2010], 36 cases of acute flaccid paralysis,
including 15 deaths, were already reported in Kikwit, Bandundu
province. The government had organized a campaign response to the epidemic.

But the deaths at the N'Djili Bosembo Institute show that the
epidemic could eventually reach the city of Kinshasa. The high
concentration of population in the communes to the east [of Kinshasa]
should cause us to fear the worst and push the authorities to act urgently.

[One suspects that there will be confirmation of WPV activity in the
above mentioned outbreak in an eastern commune of Kinshasa, given the
above story. In the presence of a high population movement between
the provinces and Kinshasa and given the known circulation of WPV in
Kikwit, Bandundu province, it would not be surprising to have
introduction of the WPV into the capital region.

Three cases of an AFP illness in a school in several weeks is highly
likely to be due to WPV when transmission has been documented in
geographic areas with likely contact of individuals. Unfortunately,
in many countries where transmission of WPV has been interrupted,
vaccination coverages have been suboptimal following the
certification of polio eradication in the countries, in some because
routine vaccination activities do not provide the same level of
coverage the NIDs (National immunization days) did, in others, where
NIDs continued, the level of effort was reduced due to a combination
of reduced financial support as well as reduced motivation both on
the part of the health sector as well as the part of the population
when polio was no longer seen as a threat.

According to the Polio Eradication Website, there were 10 confirmed
cases of WPV-associated disease reported in the past week (as of 24
Feb 2011), of which all were WPV1. Four of the cases had onset of
disease in 2010, and 6 had onset in 2011. The majority of the cases
were from Bandundu, Katanga and Kinshasa. As of 24 Feb 2011, the
number of confirmed cases in 2011 is 7, and the total number of cases
for 2010 is 100. The most recent confirmed case had onset of
paralysis on [20 Jan 2011], a WPV1 from Bandundu.

Of note, there is mention that "discussions are underway to expand
the age-group of upcoming campaigns in Kinshasa, given the fact that
older-age cases have been identified in this area," (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>).

[2] Angola - Kuando Kubango
Date: 19 Feb 2011

An Angolan health official says the country has registered its 1st
polio case of 2011, renewing concern over the resurgence of a disease
once thought to be eliminated.

"It's the 1st case in the country this year [2011], and that creates
a lot of concerns for us," Fernando Cassanga, health services
director for the southeastern province of Kuando Kubango, told state
radio station RNA on Friday [18 Feb 2011].

"We need to reinforce our epidemiological vigilance and teach our
mothers that they need to bring their children to vaccination centres."

Kubango said the victim was a 15-month-old child.

The new infection comes several weeks before Angola launches a
national vaccination drive aimed at reining in the crippling disease,
which the Angolan health minister acknowledged earlier this month
[February 2011] had spread from Angola to neighbouring Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Congo.

According to the World Health Organisation, the DRC has already
registered 7 new polio cases this year [2011] in the provinces of
Bandundu, Katanga and Bas-Congo, all of which border Angola, and in
the capital, Kinshasa.

Congo has not officially registered any new cases in 2011.

After eliminating new polio cases for 3 years in a row, Angola saw a
strain of the virus reappear in 2005, thought to have been carried by
Indian workers employed on rebuilding projects launched after the
country's 27-year civil war ended in 2002.

Last year [2010], Angola registered 32 new polio cases, the DRC 93
and Congo 50, raising concern among anti-polio campaigners, who had
already considered the disease to be eradicated in all 3 countries.

Angola plans to immunise 5.6 million children in a vaccination drive
scheduled to kick off in March [2011].

[The following information from the polio eradication website
summarizes the situation in Angola, and the impact of prior WPV
activity in Angola on other countries in Africa:

"No new cases were reported in the past week [as of 24 Feb 2011]. The
total number of cases for 2011 remains one, and the total number of
cases for 2010 remains 33. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [7 Jan 2011] (WPV1 from Kuando Kubango province).

"Mop-ups will be conducted on [25-27 Feb 2011], in Kuando Kubango,
and other infected and high-risk areas, including Luanda and
Benguela. The activity will be followed by NIDs in March and April
[2011]. These activities are considered particularly crucial, also
with view of minimizing the risk of further international spread. In
2010, virus from Angola spread into the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DR Congo) and the Republic of Congo; the most recent case in
Kuando Kubango is near the border with Namibia and Zambia. It is from
this area that polio spread into Namibia in 2006, causing a deadly
outbreak affecting primarily adults. Authorities in both Namibia and
Zambia have been alerted to this risk, and efforts are ongoing in
both countries to sensitize surveillance and assess population
immunity levels."

[3] Pakistan - FATA
Date: 24 Feb 2011

<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>


Four new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s, from
Federally Administered Tribal Areas -- FATA, Khyber Pakhtoon -- KP,
and Sindh), bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 8. The
number of cases for 2010 remains 144. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [3 Feb 2011] (WPV1 from Khyber, FATA).

The next NIDs are scheduled for [7-9 Mar 2011], followed by SNIDs
[SubNational Immunization Days] April [2011]. Given widespread,
nationwide transmission of wild poliovirus (as underscored by the
recent isolation of polioviruses in environmental samples from
sampling sites across the country), the geographic extent of upcoming
supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) should be reviewed.

Additionally, efforts are continuing to focus on operationalizing the
polio emergency action plan (launched on [24 Jan 2011] by President
Asif Ali Zardari). A critical factor to success is to ensure
sufficient accountability and ownership at the provincial and district-level.

[Recent newswires captured by HealthMap Alerts and submitted to
ProMED by Corr.SB have discussed the observation that the majority of
cases of WPV-associated disease in the past 2 years in Pakistan have
been in the FATA region. (see
<http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=32985&Cat=2>).
According to that newswire, "out of 144 cases of polio in Pakistan in
2010, 74 occurred in Fata alone, with 84 cases of polio in 2009."

According to the above report from the Polio eradication website,
environmental sampling has demonstrated more widespread presence of
the WPV around the country. Hence, it is clear that there is the need
for nationwide efforts in order to interrupt the WPV transmission,
recognizing that while there are significant challenges in those
areas with civil unrest, other areas of the country are still
involved with WPV transmission.
