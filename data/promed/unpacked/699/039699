Countries Warned on Risk of Mad Cow Disease
------------------------------------
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned
countries around the world of the risk of mad cow disease appearing in the
food chain and entering the human population. In a statement in Lagos
through the Information Department of the Embassy of the United States, the
FAO recommended adoption of surveillance and monitoring systems to detect
the disease in cattle herds, meat industries, and animal feed operations.
Alarm about the disease's potential has been largely confined to Western
Europe. Nevertheless, the FAO has issued a warning that all countries that
have imported cattle or meat and bone meal from Western Europe, especially
the UK, during and since the 1980s, can be considered at risk. FAO warned
countries around the world, not just those in Western Europe, to be
concerned about the risk of BSE and nvCJD. It called for action to protect
the human population, as well as the livestock, feed and meat industries.
The UN agency said there was an increasingly grave situation developing in
the European Union, with BSE being identified in cattle in several member
states of the EU which had, until recently, been regarded as free from the
disease. FAO also said that confirmed and suspected cases of nvCJD are
occurring in people outside the UK, in various member states. Much remains
unknown about the disease and the infective agent. "There is currently no
method of diagnosis at early stages of infection and no cure for the
disease, neither in animals nor in humans," the UN agency said.
FAO said it considers "that there is an urgent need to refine the risk
assessment and to extend it to other countries and regions. Countries at
risk should implement effective surveillance for BSE in cattle and controls
on the animal feed and meat industries. At present, this means: laboratory
testing of samples from slaughtered cattle, and correct disposal of fallen
stock and improved processing of offal and by-products".
Within countries, FAO recommended applying the so-called Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Point system (HACCP), which aims at identifying
potential problems and taking corrective measures throughout the food
chain. Some of the issues include the production of animal feed, the raw
materials used, cross-contamination in the feed mill, labeling of
manufactured feeds, the feed transport system, monitoring imported live
animals, slaughtering methods, the rendering industry, and the disposal of
waste materials.
"Strict controls have been implemented in the United Kingdom and are now in
the rest of the EU," FAO said. "Countries outside the EU should adopt
appropriate measures to protect their herds and to ensure the safety of
meat and meat products. Legislation to control the industry and its
effective implementation is required, including capacity building and the
training of operatives and government officials."
FAO advised countries to adopt a precautionary approach. As an immediate
measure, countries that have imported animals and meat products from
BSE-infected trading partners should consider a precautionary ban on the
feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) or, to
reduce the risk of infection even further, to all animals. Attention should
be paid to slaughtering procedures and to the processing and use of offal
and by-product parts, FAO said. The rendering industry should be
scrutinized and appropriate procedures adopted everywhere.

Temporary Closing of Venezuela's Cattle and Beef Trade from Colombia.
-----------------------------------------------
VenezuelaÂ´s Ministry of Commerce and Production decided yesterday [1 Mar
2001 to close its frontier to cattle and beef imports from its neighbor
country Colombia, in an effort to prevent the spread of BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy). For the same reason, the government of Colombia
has recently slaughtered a herd of imported cattle from Europe. There has
no official report of BSE in either Colombia or Venezuela.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has banned imports of beef and livestock from
Thailand and Brazil because of fears about the spread of mad cow disease
[bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, Health Minister Chua Jui Meng
announced on Wednesday [14 Feb 2001. The ban on Thai beef comes after news
from Thailand last week that 2 people were infected with a deadly human
variant of mad cow disease [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or
nvCJD, though the doctor at the source of the reports has since said that
he was misquoted and that the victims suffered from a different brain disease.
Malaysia's move on Brazilian beef products follows similar bans imposed by
the United States, Canada and Mexico on 6 Feb 2001. [There is currently no
evidence that BSE is in Brazil, but if the Canadians ban Brazilian beef
there must be a reason for it, even if not immediately scientifically
obvious. - Mod.MHJ Chua said that the bans were a precautionary measure;
Malaysian health officials had no official confirmation from Thailand that
humans had been infected with the disease.
He said Thailand may have been feeding its livestock with meat and bone
meal derived from cows imported from the European Union, where BSE has
broken out in several countries. He said beef products imported from
Thailand since 10 Feb 2001 and from Brazil since 6 Feb 2001 would be
recalled, and that security along the porous Malaysian-Thai border would be
stepped up to check smuggling of livestock into the country.
Malaysia barred beef and beef products from the EU and Switzerland on 5 Jan
2001. "We will continue with the ban until we get an assurance that there
is no danger to consumers from eating beef and beef products from these
countries," Chua told a news conference.
The latest measures would have minimal effect on the availability of beef
in Malaysia, which imports most of its beef from India, Australia, and New
Zealand, Chua said. Malaysia imported more than 400 million ringgits (US
$105 million) of beef and beef products last year, 193 000 ringgits (US $51
000) of which came from Thailand.

Thai authorities [on 14 Feb 2001 denied reports that 2 Thais had been
diagnosed with the human form of mad-cow disease. They dismissed Malaysia's
ban on Thai beef as a publicity stunt, saying Thailand had never exported
beef to Malaysia.

The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) advising the European Commission on
BSE-related issues has today published a preemptive assessment of the risk
to human health in case BSE were found in sheep under domestic conditions.
The scientists consider that there is currently insufficient information to
draw definite conclusions on the potential risk to the human population.
They have therefore developed 3 scenarios of the potential risk and how to
deal with it. The scientists state there is no evidence to confirm that BSE
is present in sheep and goats, but add that knowledge in this area is very
limited and that the adequate testing methods and monitoring to confirm a
diagnosis are not available. It is therefore necessary to start collecting
the information required for assessing the likely prevalence of BSE in sheep.
BSE has not yet been found in sheep under field conditions. However,
laboratory experiments have demonstrated that BSE can be transmitted to
certain genotypes of sheep and goats. In addition, it is likely that some
specific groups of sheep and goats may have been fed meat-and-bone meal
[MBM that was possibly BSE-contaminated, in particular before the EU-wide
ruminant MBM feed ban of 1994 was effectively implemented by national
authorities. Therefore the SSC reiterates its 1998 opinion that TSE could
have been introduced into parts of the EU sheep and goat population. The
SSC emphasizes the need to start collecting the necessary information for
assessment of possible presence of TSE in sheep in a country or region. The
scientists point to the need for better and more intensive surveillance of
sheep flocks, for developing rapid tests which can distinguish TSE in sheep
from scrapie, for introducing a system of individual identification of
sheep and for certifying the TSE-status of small ruminant flocks.
Feeding practices of sheep vary considerably by flock, country or region,
farming system (intensive or extensive) and farming purpose (meat, milk,
wool). The only testing method currently available to confirm the presence
of BSE in sheep, using bio-assays in mice, takes up to 2 years before
results are obtained. Very few of such tests undertaken have been completed
to date. Clinical signs of BSE might be difficult to distinguish from
scrapie, a disease posing no threat to humans. Scrapie is endemic in the
sheep population of most EU countries. Research to develop better testing
methods is ongoing.
The SSC also examined the latest evidence on the distribution of
(experimentally introduced) BSE infectivity in the body of sheep and goat.
As opposed to cattle, where the infectivity remains mainly concentrated in
specific body tissues such as the brain and the spinal cord, the evidence
points to a more general distribution of BSE infectivity in sheep tissues,
possibly similar to the distribution pattern of scrapie. This would imply
that a more comprehensive list of tissues would have to be eliminated from
the food chain in sheep than in cattle, should it be concluded that BSE in
sheep is likely.
As a precautionary measure, [European Community legislation already
imposes the removal of specific risk materials of sheep and goat from the
food and feed chain in the whole of the EU since October 2000. In case BSE
is confirmed in sheep or goats, strict eradication measures would have to
be applied with the enforcement of the new EP and Council Regulation on the
eradication, prevention and control of Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies expected to come into effect in July 2001.
