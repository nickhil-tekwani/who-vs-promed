Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, Gambia
-----------------------------------------
Information received on 27 Sep 2012 from Dr Kebba Daffeh, CVO, Animal Health and Production Services, Department of Agriculture-Government, Abuko, Gambia

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 03 Aug 2012
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Sep 2012
Report date: 27 Sep 2012
Date submitted to OIE: 27 Sep 2012
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1971
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: _Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC_
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1:
Central River Region, Niamina Dankunku, Niamina Dankunku
Date of start of the outbreak: 03 Aug 2012
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 400/ 18/ 12/ 0/ 0

Affected population: Cattle of different age groups are kept in herds at village level under the traditional production system where they are managed extensively on communal grazing lands. Herds may be individually or jointly owned. No vaccinations against CBPP conducted in the country since 1987.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 400/ 18/ 12/ 0/ 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The last reported case of CBPP in Gambia was in 1971 and since then no outbreaks of the disease have been reported. Vaccination against the disease ceased in 1987. There is an epidemiological surveillance system in place and CBPP is one of the diseases under surveillance. Gambia is completely surrounded by Senegal. However, in the past 2 to 3 years there has been an increase in importation of live animals (cattle) from Mali and Mauritania into Gambia for slaughter. This could pose a real threat for the re-introduction of the disease into the country.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: Quarantine; Screening; Vaccination in response to the outbreak

[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a bacterial epizootic disease of cattle caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC_ (MmmSC; SC = small colonies). CBPP has been known to occur in Europe since the 16th century but it gained a world-wide distribution only during the 2nd half of the 19th century because of increased international trade in live cattle. It was eradicated from many countries by the beginning of the 20th century through stamping-out policies. However the disease persists in many parts of Africa. The situation in Asia is unclear. There have been no reported outbreaks in Europe since 1999. In natural conditions, MmmSC affects only the ruminants of the Bos genus, i.e., mainly bovine and zebu cattle. MmmSC (bovine biotype) has been isolated from buffaloes in Italy (_Bubalus bubalus_), and from sheep and goats in Africa and more recently in Portugal and in India. Among wild animals, one single case has been reported in American buffaloes (_Bison bison_) and none in African buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) or other wild ruminants. Wild animals do not play a role in the epidemiology of the disease.

CBPP is manifested by anorexia [loss of appetite], fever and respiratory signs, such as dyspnoea [difficulty in breathing], polypnoea [panting], cough and nasal discharges. In the case of acute outbreaks under experimental conditions, the mortality rate may be as high as 50 percent in the absence of antibiotic treatment. When an outbreak 1st occurs in an area, the mortality will be high but is often lower in the field following the primary outbreak. Clinical signs are not always evident; subacute or asymptomatic forms occur frequently as the clinical signs in affected animals subside with partial recovery. In this case their lungs show typical encapsulated lesions called 'sequestra.' These animals may be responsible for unnoticed persistence of the infection in a herd or a region and play an important role in the epidemiology of the disease.

Transmission of the disease occurs through direct contact of an infected animal with a naive one. There is no evidence of transmission through fomites as MmmSC does not persist in the environment. In most continents, control strategies are based on the early detection of outbreaks, control of animal movements and a stamping-out policy. In Africa control of the disease is based on vaccination campaigns using attenuated MmmSC strains such as T1/44 or T1sr. Although the use of antibiotics is theoretically prohibited, they are widely applied in the field. The consequences of these antibiotic treatments in terms of clinical efficacy, emergence of resistant strains, and persistence of chronic carriers have not been evaluated yet. However, recent work has shown that antibiotic treatment of cattle may greatly reduce the transmission to healthy contacts but this requires treatment of all affected cattle in a group.

The_M. mycoides_ cluster consists of 6 mycoplasma species or groups of strains, originating from bovines and goats. This cluster can be subdivided into 2 groups, capricolum and mycoides, comprising very closely related species.

References related to the above data, as well as further information on the pathogen, CBPP diagnostic techniques and vaccine requirements, are available in chapter 2.4.9. of OIE's International Terrestrial Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.09_CBPP.pdf.

CBPP is one of the few epizootic animal disease for which the OIE maintains procedures for official status recognition. According to a resolution of OIE's 80th General Session (Paris, May 2012), the following countries are currently officially recognised as CBPP-free: Australia, Botswana, China (People's Republic of), India, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. Information on the CBPP situation in other countries is based upon their own data, as included in their respective annual reports to the OIE.

Senegal, Gambia's neighbor on the north, east and south (map at http://healthmap.org/r/3zrf) reported its last CBPP outbreak in 1977 and is, likely, currently applying precautionary measures to prevent its re-introduction.

Gambia's notification indicates that in the past 2 to 3 years there has been an increase in importation of live animals (cattle) from Mali and Mauritania for slaughter. CBPP is endemic in Mali; in its report for 2011, 4 outbreaks were notified. Mauritania's annual report for 2011 does not include information on CBPP; the disease is not notifiable and the date of its last occurrence is marked as "unknown." 2 MmmSC strains from Mauritania, dated 1977 and 1996, have been studied (Lorenzon et al. Veterinary Microbiology 93 (2003) 319-333). - Mod.AS
