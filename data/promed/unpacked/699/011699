Norway's 1st bluetongue case reported
-------------------------------------
The Norwegian Food Safety Authority says the country's 1st cases of
bluetongue infection have been detected in 2 cattle herds. The bluetongue
virus does not spread between animals but is carried by tiny flies called
midges [culicoides]. It infects cows, sheep, and other ruminants, and its
symptoms vary. The cases were found in routine checks in southern Norway.
The disease was once confined to Mediterranean areas but has been spreading
north since 2006.

The food authority said on Friday that there is no risk to humans, and the
virus is unlikely to spread to other herds due to winter temperatures. An
agency news release says the 2 herds are isolated. The death rate among
infected animals in northern Europe has been about 30 per cent. [This is a
significantly blown-up figure. - Mod.AS]

[Though no further details are available, it may be assumed that the
animals, detected now as infected, are either imported animals or local
animals infected during the previous season -- namely between June and
November 2008, and that the virus involved is BTV-8. This is not a current
outbreak. Exact details are awaited, however, and a detailed notification
to the OIE is anticipated.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has published notifications on the
event on 20 and 21 Feb 2009. According to the maps included in the said
notifications on the Web site of the Norwegian food safety agency, the
affected farms are located at the south western tip of Norway. The maps
show the temporary restriction zones and can be accessed at

The notification includes, among others, the following (machine translated)
comment: "Because of the season, there is no considerable danger of
infection now. However, the agency points out that special precautions
should be undertaken considering hygiene measures during handling and
sampling of animals." - Mod.AS]
