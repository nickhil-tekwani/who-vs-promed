Possible eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 -- worldwide, 2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Olen M Kew, Stephen L Cochi, Hamid S Jafari, Steven GF Wassilak, Eric E Mast, Ousmane M Diop, et al]

In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate polio worldwide. Since then, 4 of the 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions have been certified as polio-free: the Americas in 1994 (1), the Western Pacific Region in 2000 (2), the European Region in 2002 (3), and the South East Asia Region in 2014 (4). Currently, nearly 80 per cent of the world's population lives in areas certified as polio-free. Certification may be considered when greater than or equal to 3 years have passed since the last isolation of wild poliovirus (WPV) in the presence of sensitive, certification-standard surveillance (1-4).* Although regional eradication has been validated in the European Region and the Western Pacific Region, outbreaks resulting from WPV type 1 (WPV1) imported from known endemic areas were detected and controlled in these regions in 2010 and 2011, respectively (5). The last reported case associated with WPV type 2 (WPV2) was in India in 1999, marking global interruption of WPV2 transmission (6). The completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for public health in 2012, and the international spread of WPV1 was declared a public health emergency of international concern in May 2014. The efforts needed to interrupt all indigenous WPV1 transmission are now being focused on the remaining endemic countries: Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. WPV type 3 (WPV3) has not been detected in circulation since [11 Nov 2012]. This report summarizes the evidence of possible global interruption of transmission of WPV3, based on surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance.

Poliovirus surveillance
-----------------------
Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, progress toward eradication has been tracked by detection and investigation of AFP cases and testing of stool specimens for polioviruses by accredited laboratories of the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (7). AFP surveillance has been supplemented by environmental surveillance (i.e., testing of sewage samples) in 25 countries, including Pakistan, since 2009, Nigeria since 2011, and Afghanistan since 2013 (7). Environmental surveillance often can detect evidence of WPV infections even in the absence of AFP cases, which is especially important for detection of WPV3, whose case-to-infection ratio (about one paralytic case in 1000 infections) is about 1/5th that of WPV1 (about one in 200) (8). The quality of AFP surveillance is monitored with performance indicators for detection sensitivity and investigation timeliness (7).

WPV3 cases
----------
No WPV3 cases have been detected globally since November 2012 [figure 1: Reported wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) cases and countries with reported WPV3 cases, by year -- worldwide, 2001-2012, available at source URL]. The latest WPV3 in Asia was isolated from a child aged 1 year in the Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan who had onset of AFP on [18 Apr 2012], and the latest environmental WPV3 isolate in Asia was from a sample collected in Karachi, Pakistan, on [7 Oct 2010]. The latest WPV3 in Africa was isolated from an infant aged 11 months in Yobe, Nigeria, who had onset of paralysis on [10 Nov 2012], and the latest environmental WPV3 isolate in Africa was from a sample collected in Lagos, Nigeria, on [11 Nov 2012]. The number of countries reporting WPV3 cases changed from 5 in 2001, to 12 in 2008, to 7 in 2010, and to 2 in 2012 [figure 1 at source URL]. During 2010-2013, the number of WPV3 isolated globally in stool specimens collected from AFP patients declined from 87 to zero, whereas the number of AFP cases with specimens tested increased from 98 788 in 2010 to 101 701 in 2013.

The genetic diversity of WPV3 isolates has fallen steadily worldwide since 1988. The number of distinct WPV3 genotypes (greater than or equal to 15 per cent nucleotide sequence divergence) detected globally declined from 17 in 1988, to 5 in 2001, to 3 in 2010, and to 2 in 2012 [figure 2: Eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) genotypes -- worldwide, 1986-2012, available at the source URL]. In Pakistan, WPV3 clusters (about 5 per cent nucleotide sequence divergence) within genotypes declined from 4 in 2010, to 1 in 2011, and to 1 in 2012. In Nigeria, the number of WPV3 clusters declined from 9 in 2010, to 6 in 2011, and to 2 in 2012.

Discussion
----------
WPV3 has not been detected since November 2012, suggesting that global WPV3 transmission has been interrupted. In regions and areas where the transmission of all 3 indigenous WPV serotypes has been interrupted, the order of disappearance was 1st WPV2, then WPV3, and then WPV1. The rapidly declining genetic diversity of WPV3 isolates during the last decade is consistent with progress toward eradication and was observed during a period of improving surveillance performance in Pakistan and Nigeria, the 2 countries which harbored the last known WPV3 reservoirs (5,7). The possible interruption of WPV3 transmission is a historic milestone for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and demonstrates that full implementation of the national emergency action plans** in the 3 remaining polio-endemic countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria) will also interrupt WPV1 transmission. If validated, the eradication of WPV3 would mark the 3rd time that transmission of a distinct human pathogen (the others are smallpox virus and WPV2) has been interrupted through immunization. The last isolation of WPV2 occurred 15 years ago from a case with onset in October 1999 (6).

In the pre-vaccine era, WPV3 had a worldwide distribution (figure 2). Although WPV3, for reasons unknown, is less able than WPV1 to spread over wide geographic areas and cause explosive outbreaks, long-range WPV3 exportations and regional outbreaks have occurred (5,9). The substitution of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (types 1 and 3) for monovalent oral poliovirus vaccines and trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (types 1, 2, and 3) in supplementary immunization activities in late 2009 led to the rapid collapse of WPV3 transmission in India the following year [2010], and to the steady decline of WPV3 detection elsewhere (4,5).

Continued sensitive surveillance is needed before the evidence of WPV3 eradication is conclusive, particularly given evidence of remaining limitations of surveillance in Pakistan, Nigeria, and elsewhere (7). The low case-to-infection ratio for WPV3 infections requires higher surveillance sensitivity for detection than that required for WPV1. However, the case-to-infection ratio is lowest for WPV2 (8), and no reappearance has been detected since 1999. High levels of population immunity to poliovirus type 3 should be maintained, both to protect against any residual WPV3 infections and to prevent the emergence and spread of type 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses, a rare event (10).

*The Global Polio Eradication Initiative sets operational targets for countries in regions with current or recent WPV transmission, both nationally and in each province/state, as greater than or equal to 2 cases per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years of nonpolio AFP, and adequate stool specimen collection from greater than or equal to 80 per cent of AFP cases, in which 2 specimens are collected greater than or equal to 24 hours apart, both within 14 days of paralysis onset, shipped on ice or frozen ice packs, and arriving in good condition (without leakage or desiccation) at a WHO-accredited laboratory.

**Emergency action plans have been devised and are revised annually in each endemic country and include all programmatic steps planned to interrupt WPV transmission and respond to outbreaks.

[The absence of identification of wild poliovirus (WPV) type 3 in both human cases as well as in environmental samples for the past 2 years is a ray of optimism for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The objective of the polio eradication initiative is to eradicate all wild polioviruses. According to the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, "Certification of eradication will not be considered until a full 3 years have passed since the last detected and culture confirmed occurrence of a wild poliovirus." The Commission stated the need for surveillance for both cases of acute flaccid paralysis as well as for wild polioviruses, the latter through environmental sampling to document that the WPV is not circulating "silently". (Report of the 1st meeting of the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, Geneva, Switzerland 16-17 Feb 1995 WHO/EPI/GEN/95.6, http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/59821/1/WHO_EPI_GEN_95.6.pdf?ua=1).

As there are 3 wild polioviruses (WPV1, WPV2, and WPV3), all 3 types must meet the criteria for eradication -- 3 years without identification of the WPVs from human cases as well as in silent circulation. The last identification of WPV2 was in India in 1999 -- thus the WPV2 has been eradicated. If another year goes by without identification of WPV3, it will be a tremendous achievement towards the overall eradication initiative, with 2 out of the 3 WPV types meeting eradication criteria.

The obvious caution is that the last identified WPV3 in Pakistan was in a child in the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), an area with civil unrest, and a region where there are areas within that are not accessible for vaccination activities (and potentially surveillance activities) due to security concerns. The possibility that there is silent transmission of the WPV3 in those inaccessible areas is there. - Mod.MPP]

Data in WHO as of 12 Nov 2013 for 2013 data and 11 Nov 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- In Madagascar, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed. The virus was isolated from one case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) with onset of paralysis on [29 Sep 2014], and from 3 healthy contacts. An estimated more than 25 per cent of children remain under-immunized against polio in the country. Madagascar was previously affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in 2001/2002 (resulting in 5 cases) and in 2005 (resulting in 3 cases). Emergency outbreak response is being finalized, with campaigns to be held in December [2014] and January [2015].
- It has been 2 years since the last case due to wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) was reported. WPV3 was last detected globally on [10 Nov 2012], in Yobe, Nigeria. In Asia, the last WPV3 was detected in April 2012, in Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan. All cases due to wild poliovirus in the past 2 years have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). Wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) has not been detected since 1999.

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week in Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 remains 18. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [4 Oct 2014], from Kandahar province.
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. No cases of cVDPV2 have been reported in 2014.
- Given the growing outbreak in neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan is taking protective steps to limit any spread of the virus. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) are scheduled across the south and east of Afghanistan in mid- to late-November [2014] using a combination of bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).

Nigeria
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Nigeria's total case count for 2014 remains 6. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 remains 21. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 Sep 2014], from Katsina state.
- Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) have been held [1-4 Nov 2014] in most areas of northern Nigeria using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV). In some areas of Kano and Yobe states, supplementary immunization activities using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and OPV are also taking place in November [2014], with large-scale SNIDs planned for mid-December [2014] across northern Nigeria.

Pakistan
- One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, from Khyber, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The total number of WPV1 cases in 2014 is now 236, compared to 59 at this time last year. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [20 Oct 2014], from South Waziristan, FATA.
- No cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. This most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis in Khyber Agency, FATA, on [16 Sep 2014]. The country has reported 20 cases of cVDPV2 in 2014.
- Immunization activities are continuing with particular focus on known high-risk areas, in particular the newly opened areas of FATA. At exit and entry points of areas that are inaccessible during polio campaigns, 163 permanent vaccination points are being used to reach internally displaced families as they move in and out of the inaccessible area. Over 700 000 people have been vaccinated in the past few months at transit points and in host communities, including half a million children.

Central Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported this week. In 2014, 10 cases have been reported in central Africa: 5 in Cameroon and 5 in Equatorial Guinea.
- Throughout November [2014], supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are being implemented across central Africa, with campaigns taking place in Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Gabon, Chad, Republic of Congo, Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).
- In Cameroon, activities are planned for early December [2014]. During the most recent campaigns ([31 Oct 2014 to 3 Nov 2014]), key improvements were noted. High levels of political engagement were evident, and preparations had focused on strengthening microplans and ensuring special vaccination teams at check points and border crossings. However, more improvements need to be made on ensuring missed areas are effectively re-visited, and ensure adequate number of vaccination teams for all areas are in place.

Horn of Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week in the Horn of Africa. The most recent case, which had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2014], was from Hobyo district of Mudug province, central Somalia. The total number of cases that have been reported in the Horn of Africa in 2014 is 6: 1 WPV1 in Ethiopia (date of onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014]) and 5 WPV1s in Somalia.
- Following confirmation of 2 cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in South Sudan last week, outbreak response is being finalized in the country. National Immunization Days (NIDs) were already implemented on [4 Nov 2014], with further campaigns planned for December [2014] and January [2015]. The objective is to rapidly stop the cVDPV2 in the infected area, while further boosting immunity to type 1 polio and minimize the risk of re-infection from other parts of the Horn of Africa.
- Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan, and Child Health Days (CHDs) with polio vaccines in Yemen are being held in November [2014].

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has not been detected in environmental samples in Israel or the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent months. The most recent positive sample was collected in southern Israel on [30 Mar2014]. Environmental samples collected since April [2014] have been negative.

Middle East
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Three cases of WPV1 have been reported in the Middle East in 2014 -- 2 in Iraq and 1 in Syria.
- It has been 7 months since the last reported cases of WPV1 in the Middle East. The most recent case reported from Syria had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014], while the most recent case in Iraq occurred in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, with onset of paralysis on [7 Apr 2014].
- Phase 2 of the Middle East Outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region, with focus on further improving the quality of supplementary immunization activities and to increase the reach of campaigns.

West Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in West Africa in 2014. The most recent WPV1 case in the region occurred in Tahoua province, Niger, with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week. The last case of cVDPV2 was reported in Niger on [11 Jul 2013].
- Even as polio programme staff across West Africa support efforts to control the Ebola outbreak affecting the region, efforts are being made in those countries not affected by Ebola to vaccinate children against polio. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, Senegal and Togo starting [31 Oct 2014] and in Guinea Bissau starting on [8 Nov2014]. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) will also take place starting [31 Oct 2014] in Niger and Mali.

[After the optimism resulting from the possible interruption of transmission of WPV3 worldwide, the above global update is a bit disconcerting. Since the last ProMED-mail polio update (regrettably 12 Sep 2014, for which I apologize), an additional 108 cases of polio have been confirmed, all occurring in 2 of the 3 remaining endemic countries -- Pakistan (with 98 cases confirmed since the last update) and Afghanistan (with 10 cases confirmed since the last update). The good news is that the last confirmed case of WPV-associated polio in the 3rd remaining endemic country, Nigeria, had a date of onset of 24 Jul 2014 -- almost 4 months ago.

Other disconcerting news in this week's update relates to the identification of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in Madagascar (cVDPV1) and in South Sudan (cVDPV2) -- both countries without WPV circulation, yet the presence of cVDPV cases serves as an indicator of pockets of susceptibles that should a WPV be introduced into these pockets, the likelihood of transmission resulting in cases of polio remains.

Poliovirus in South Sudan and Madagascar -- 14 Nov 2014
Separate circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses confirmed in South Sudan and Madagascar
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In separate and unrelated events, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) have been confirmed in South Sudan and Madagascar.

South Sudan
-----------
In South Sudan, 2 cases due to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) have been confirmed. The strains were isolated from 2 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in Unity state, with onset of paralysis on [9 Sep 2014 and 12 Sep 2014], respectively. In Unity state, as many as 33 per cent of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus. Both cases are from an internally displaced persons camp in Unity state. Unity state has been affected by civil unrest, leading to population displacements and declining vaccination coverage in most of the areas.

In 2014, South Sudan has been participating in regional Horn of Africa outbreak response, given the risk posed by an ongoing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) outbreak affecting the region (with cases in 2014 in parts of Somalia and Ethiopia). Two National Immunization Days (NIDs) were conducted in April (with trivalent oral polio vaccine -- OPV) and May (with bivalent OPV). In response to confirmation of the cVDPV2, NIDs were held on [4 Nov 2014] with trivalent OPV and further Subnational Immunization Days (SNID) covering the 3 states with civil unrest (Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei) are planned for [2 Dec 2014] and January 2015 with trivalent OPV. The objective is to rapidly stop the cVDPV2 in the internally-displaced persons camp and prevent further spread, while further boosting immunity to type 1 polio and minimize risk of re-infection from other parts of the Horn of Africa.

Madagascar
----------
In Madagascar, cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed after the virus was isolated from 1 case of AFP (onset of paralysis on [29 Sep 2014]) and 3 healthy contacts. The most recent supplementary immunization activities in Madagascar were conducted in December 2011/January 2012. SNIDs are planned for December [2014], with NIDs to be held in January 2015. An estimated more than 25 per cent of children remain under-immunized against poliovirus in the country. Madagascar was previously affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in 2001/2002 (resulting in 5 cases) and in 2005 (resulting in 5 cases). A VDPV was also isolated during a research study among healthy children in Toliara I in 2011. Concerted outbreak response each time rapidly stopped those events. However, repeated emergence of separate cVDPV events underscores the risk of these events occurring in populations which are not fully immunized and of the importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus which can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. Due to the small risk of cVDPVs, use of OPV must be stopped to secure a lasting polio-free world. OPV will be withdrawn in a phased manner, beginning with the removal of type 2-containing OPV. The type 2 component contained in trivalent OPV accounts for 90 per cent of all cVDPV cases.

In South Sudan, given that the cases detected are in an internally displaced persons camp which can be accessed for vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of international spread of the cVDPV2 from South Sudan to be low. However, the risk of international spread would increase if other areas are infected by the cVDPV2. With regard to Madagascar, given the history associated with previous cVDPVs, WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Madagascar to be low.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

[As mentioned above, the existence of cVDPV in a country serves as a surrogate indicator of pockets of susceptible population with suboptimal vaccination coverages. In South Sudan, an estimated 33 per cent of children are inadequately immunized, and in Madagascar an estimated 25 per cent of children are inadequately immunized.

According to the Polio Eradication Initiative statistics, since 2000 there have been a global total of 763 cVDPV cases identified, of which 80 cases (10 per cent) were cVDPV1, 671 (88 per cent) were cases of cVDPV2 and 12 (2 per cent) were cases of cVDPV3.

Epidemic scale: Polio count jumps to 246 with 3 more cases
----------------------------------------------------------
3-day special drive starts in 11 areas declared 'super high-risk'.

3 more polio cases were reported from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on Friday [14 Nov 2014], taking this year's total to 246. According to officials of the health department, 2 infected children belong to Khyber Agency, while 1 child is from South Waziristan Agency. However, the details of the children could not be ascertained till this report was filed. "We have just confirmed 3 new cases from FATA, but their names and ages have not been released as yet," said a health department official, who requested anonymity.

Pakistan is now just 4 polio cases shy of reaching 250. Of the 246, 158 children are from FATA, 49 from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 25 from Sindh, 11 from Balochistan and 3 from Punjab.

[While the official statistics are for 236 cases of WPV-associated polio confirmed in Pakistan as of 11 Nov 2014, it appears as though an additional 10 cases have been confirmed in the 3 days since the official tally was released for this week. The breakdown of locations provided in the media report above has 158 of the 246 cases (64.2 per cent) from the FATA, 49 (19.9 per cent) from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 25 (10.2 per cent) from Sindh, 11 (4.5 per cent) from Balochistan and 3 (1.2 per cent) from Punjab. According to the official figures from the Pakistan End Polio website, of the 236 WPV-associated polio cases this year to date (2014), 152 cases are from the FATA, 48 are from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 23 are from Sindh, 10 are from Balochistan, and 3 are from Punjab. Hence, the 10 additional cases reflected in the above media report include 6 cases in FATA, 1 case in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 2 cases in Sindh, and 1 case in Balochistan (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polio-in-pakistan).

[5] Vaccine resistant strain - Rep. Congo 2010

Researchers identify vaccine-resistant polio strain
---------------------------------------------------
As the world enters the final phase of a global polio eradication effort, French researchers have identified a mutant strain of the virus that is resistant to the polio vaccine. Despite this, an American expert said the war on polio can be won with continued vaccination.

Despite progress toward the goal of wiping polio off the face of the Earth with an aggressive child vaccination campaign, transmission of the paralytic illness continues in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Now, a mutant strain of the virus responsible for a deadly outbreak in the Republic of the Congo in 2010 has been discovered, rendering the polio vaccine less effective.

Scientists at the French organization Institute of Research for Development, or IRD, found the mutant strain. They tested it on 60 blood samples from vaccinated volunteers in Congo and neighboring Gabon. Antibodies raised by the vaccine were found to be ineffective in neutralizing the virus in 15 to 30 per cent of the samples. The findings were published recently in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia [USA], is considered a world renowned expert in the field of infectious diseases and vaccination. He said there is concern the virus may become more virulent. "And there is the theoretical potential of evading the immune system. But I think the bottom line right now is what's said in basically the last sentence of the paper, which said ... mass campaigns using oral polio vaccines stopped the outbreak," he said.

But in some countries, there is violent opposition to those campaigns. Since January [2014], attacks by the Taliban on vaccination teams in Pakistan and Afghanistan have resulted in 235 polio cases, a 15-year high. [The attacks on polio vaccination workers has resulted in geographic areas where vaccination activities are not routinely conducted due to the security concerns for the welfare of the vaccinators. - Mod.MPP] The militants charge the healthcare workers are spies for Washington and the oral polio vaccine makes boys sterile.

Pakistani government officials, saying they don't want to see children paralyzed for life, are vowing to make the country polio-free in 6 months. Orenstein said that's the only way to lessen the threat of a vaccine-resistant strain. "So it to me adds to the urgency of let's just get rid of this virus, and then we won't have to worry about this kind of issue," he said. Orenstein said it's likely polio will be eradicated in Africa by the end of this year [2014], while Pakistan remains the major reservoir. He said stepped-up commitments are needed to vanquish the disease once and for all.

Robustness against serum neutralization of a poliovirus type 1 from a lethal epidemic of poliomyelitis in the Republic of Congo in 2010. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2014 Sep 2;111(35):12889-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1323502111. (abstract available at http://www.pnas.org/content/111/35/12889.abstract).

Abstract
--------
"In 2010, a large outbreak of poliomyelitis with unusual 47 percent lethality occurred in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. Vaccine-mediated immunity against the outbreak virus was never investigated. A wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) isolated from a fatal case (termed PV1-RC2010) showed a previously unknown combination of amino acid exchanges in critical antigenic site 2 (AgS2, VP1 capsid protein positions 221SAAL [-->] 221PADL). These exchanges were also detected in an additional 11 WPV1 strains from fatal cases. PV1-RC2010 escaped neutralization by 3 different mAbs relevant for AgS2. Virus neutralization was tested in sera from fatal cases, who died before supplementary immunization (n = 24), Gabonese recipients of recent oral polio vaccination (n = 12), routinely vaccinated German medical students (n = 34), and German outpatients tested for antipoliovirus immunity (n = 17) on Vero, human rhabdomyosarcoma, and human epidermoid carcinoma 2 cells. Fatal poliomyelitis cases gave laboratory evidence of previous trivalent vaccination. Neutralizing antibody titers against PV1-RC2010 were significantly lower than those against the vaccine strain Sabin-1, 2 genetically distinct WPV1s isolated in 1965 and 2010 and 2 genetically distinct vaccine-derived PV strains. Of German vaccinees tested according to World Health Organization protocols, 15-29 per cent were unprotected according to their neutralization titers (less than 1:8 serum dilution), even though all were protected against Sabin-1. Phylogenetic analysis of the WPV1 outbreak strains suggested a recent introduction of virus progenitors from Asia with formation of separate Angolan and Congolese lineages. Only the latter carried both critical AgS2 mutations. Antigenetically variant PVs may become relevant during the final phase of poliomyelitis eradication in populations with predominantly vaccine-derived immunity. Sustained vaccination coverage and clinical and environmental surveillance will be necessary."

The above mentioned outbreak was associated with a much higher case fatality rate than had been seen -- 47 per cent. At the time of the outbreak, there was speculation that perhaps the high lethality observed was related to a reporting artifact, where only the more serious cases were brought for medical attention, thereby erroneously elevating the observed case fatality rate. A Eurosurveillance report about the outbreak, which detailed studies on the outbreak associated viruses also mentioned a "putative" association with an enterovirus 109 in addition to the WPV1 identified (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (28): Rep of Congo, Asia, Russia 20101126.4272 for the full report). This new PNAS study provides more in-depth analysis of the WPV1 involved, demonstrating there had been mutations in the virus resulting in a more virulent virus with reduced immunologic protection provided by vaccine induced antibodies.

Genetic sequencing of the WPV1 identified it as a virus known to be circulating in Angola at the time (which had originally been imported from India in 2005, then circulated in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo before renewed circulation beginning in 2007 (see Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (07): Angola, Congo DR, Chad, RFI 20070731.2468).

While the documentation of such a WPV is very disconcerting, the fact that transmission of this WPV was interrupted through the accepted vaccination campaigns suggests that the challenges posed by this virus are presently not insurmountable, although the possibility this may change is of concern.
