WHO announces Zimbabwe measles outbreak
---------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday [18 Dec 2009] announced an
outbreak of measles in parts of Zimbabwe, a reminder of the fragile health
and humanitarian situation in this southern African country, which is
striving to emerge from years of economic recession and political turmoil.

"We now have an outbreak of measles in Zimbabwe which has affected more
than 340 cases so far and this is not acceptable to WHO and we are
frustrated, as this is mainly because of people who have denied their
children vaccination," the WHO head in Zimbabwe Custodia Mandlhate told
journalists in Harare.

She said the affected areas included the districts of Bubi, Murambinda,
Makoni, Chipinge, Chirumanzu, Zvishavane and Marondera. The WHO official
said the situation in Makoni in the east of the country was "worrisome",
adding that her team was going to the areas with the intention of
vaccinating children under 5 years to slow down the spread of the disease.

Most of the cases were among members of religious groups that shunned
conventional medical treatment, while the heavy rains currently falling
over the southern African country were also hampering efforts to distribute
drugs and other medicines needed to curb measles.

The disclosure of the latest disease outbreak in Zimbabwe came as the WHO
wrapped up a conference on immunisation in Harare which drew vaccination
experts and health ministers from the region. Opening the conference on
Monday Zimbabwe's health minister Henry Madzorera said the country's health
delivery system was still strained and in need of strengthening to be able
to adequately deal with disease outbreaks after a devastating cholera
epidemic that killed more than 4000 people between August 2008 and July 2009.

[The outbreak is affecting widely dispersed districts, probably reflecting
the distribution of social groups declining vaccination rather than
deficiencies in overall coverage. A map showing the addminstrative regions
