2 youths infected with rare relapsing fever
----------------------------------------------
2 youths visiting Wild Horse Island on Flathead Lake earlier in Jul 2004
have been diagnosed with relapsing fever, a relatively rare infectious
disease caused by the bite of a tick that is carried by rats and mice,
officials said Mon, 26 Jul 2004.
"Until 2002, there was no indication that these soft-bodied ticks existed
in Montana," said Brigid O'Connor, public health nurse with the Lake County
Health Department in an interview.
The cases were diagnosed after the youths, both under 12 years of age, had
left the island and returned home. They both live outside Lake County and
were not further identified. 5 cases of relapsing fever occurred in 2002 on
Wild Horse Island -- the only known cases of the disease in Montana, said
O'Connor.
The 2002 cases were the 1st proof that the soft tick that spreads the fever
is in Montana.
Todd Damrow, epidemiologist for the Montana Communicable Disease and
Control Prevention Bureau, and Tom Schwan, a scientist with the federal
Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, visited the island after the
initial reports and proved the tick species that carries the _Borrelia_
spirochete that causes the disease was on the island.
O'Connor said symptoms of relapsing fever include a high fever, chills,
headaches and muscle ache. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain and rash. Symptoms typically continue for several days, then
disappear. Recurrence occurs a few days afterward, and may occur up to 5 or
6 times unless treated with antimicrobial agents.
The fatality rate for untreated cases is as high as 10 percent. It is
usually not fatal in adults, but can be a danger in pregnancy.
O'Connor said the soft tick that carries the relapsing-fever bacteria is
quite different from the more common wood or deer ticks found throughout
western Montana. Soft ticks prefer taking blood from rodents, but may seek
out other warm-blooded animals, including humans, if rodents are scarce.
Soft ticks feed at night, usually feeding for 15 to 30 minutes [unlike hard
ticks, which feed for much longer periods - Mod.LL], and leaving their
sleeping host quickly. Most people who are bitten by a soft-shell tick
never know it, O'Connor said.
Prevention is the best medicine. If you are sleeping in a cabin or camping
in the mountains, follow these precautions:
- Check your sleeping area for evidence of rodents.
- Avoid sleeping on the floor or on a bed that touches the wall.
- If the dwelling has been unoccupied, change and wash all bedding before use.
- Check to make sure all windows and doors close with a tight seal.
- Keep all food and garbage in tightly sealed containers.
- Clean up any leftover or spilled food.
- Stack wood well away from inhabited areas, and keep the wood off the
ground, to discourage rodents from nesting in the woodpile.
"Although most relapsing cases occur in older, rustic cabins, people have
also been infected in clean, modern homes," O'Connor said.
The disease is not contagious from person to person. Infected soft ticks
can survive for up to 10 years with a few blood meals.

[Wild Horse Island is surrounded by Flathead Lake, the largest body of
fresh water in the West located in west-central Montana. This 2165-acre
island has been a landmark in the Flathead Valley since long before white
men arrived. The island was formed as a huge glacier scooped out what is
now Flathead Lake and slid up and over the more resistant rock that now
makes up Wild Horse Island. The island contains the last remnant of
Montana's native grasslands, the Palouse Prairie.
There is no undisputed evidence of how the island got its name. Legends say
Indians kept their horses on the island to protect them from other tribes'
raids. Several homesteads were established on the island shortly after the
turn of the century and there were several later attempts to establish
permanent resorts there. The island became a state park in 1977.
An article published in the September 2003 issue of Emerging Infectious
Diseases clarifies the mystery surrounding the sickness of 5 people who had
visited a Flathead Lake island cabin in 2002.

The following is a discussion from our posting of the 2002 outbreak
(20030829.2179):
"Relapsing fever is tick-borne in the USA but may also be
louse-borne. Louse-borne disease remains endemic in parts of central and
east Africa and the South American Andes. Although the clinical illnesses
can be quite similar, the tick-borne form is associated with more relapses
(as many as 13, but averaging about 3, as compared with the louse-borne
form, with as many as 5 but usually only one) and a much lower mortality
rate if left untreated (2-5 percent versus as high as 40 percent). In the
USA, a majority of the reported cases are from California and Washington.
As stated in the Emerging Infectious Diseases paper, a 1927 case of
relapsing fever diagnosed in Washington state was thought to have been
acquired in Montana (1), and soft ticks collected in 1936 in southwestern
Montana were found to be able to transmit _B. parkeri_ to mice in the
laboratory (2).
Although various species of _Borrelia_ (at least 15) can transmit
tick-borne disease, it is not entirely clear that in 1936, they could be
readily differentiated. More specific serologic identification is now
possible (3). It is important to note that only one species, _B.
recurrentis_, is associated with the louse-borne form.
Unlike hard ticks such as _Dermacentor_ (one of the vectors for Rocky
Mountain spotted fever) and _Ixodes_ (Lyme disease), _Ornithodoros_ soft
ticks are night feeders, feeding quite quickly (5-20 minutes) and
painlessly. Outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever, like this one, are
often associated with sleeping in cabins.
The diagnosis can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright's
stain of the peripheral blood. Without any concentration of blood, as
shown in the Emerging Infectious Diseases case above, spirochetes can be
seen extracellularly. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism readily
picks up the Wright stain. The relapses appear to be caused by changes in
the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the
manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 3 and 4 are useful.
Louse-borne relapsing fever has been imported into the USA. In 1976, a
case of a woman from Ethiopia was reported from Dayton, Ohio in which the
organism was detected in her blood and in lice. It was claimed to have
been the first case of louse-borne relapsing fever in the USA in the 20th
century (5).
