PARALYSIS (?TOXIC) - SCOTLAND (2)
=================================
[The original query, promed archive.960112, reported a case of
paralytic disease after eating seafood:]
Others will likely have suggested this to you but the illness that
springs to mind is domoic acid ingestion which is associated with
long term neurologic damage, particularly loss of memory, following
ingestion of mussels containing domoic acid from blooms of Nitschia
pungens.
The key references are: N Engl J Med 1990: 322;1775-1780 and N Engl J
Med 1990: 322;1781-86. If this seems to fit, you may want to contact
CDC Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch 404-639-2206. Good luck.
