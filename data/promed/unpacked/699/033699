Rio de Janeiro, Para and Minas Gerais are the regions with the highest incidence in 2019.
Colombia: In 2019, Colombia has reported 308 cases as of 15 Jun 2019, 20 of which are laboratory-confirmed. This follows the same trend as in 2018 when 394 cases were reported for the same period.
El Salvador: El Salvador has reported 204 suspected cases as of 15 Jun 2019, compared with 127 cases for the same period in 2018.

- Virus mutation. 28 Mar 2019. In January 2019, an outbreak of chikungunya virus fever was reported in a rural region near Pointe-Noire, Republic of the Congo. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of this new CHIKV strain demonstrated the presence of the A226V substitution and a surprisingly close relation with _Aedes aegypti_-associated Central Africa chikungunya strains. These results, combined with the preponderance of _Aedes albopictus_ in the outbreak area, suggest a recent vector-host switch facilitated by the emergence and spread of the A226V mutation from a related CHIKV strain previously circulating in _Aedes aegypti_. The proximity of this outbreak to the large city of Pointe-Noire alerts us to a possibly devastating future outbreak in the absence of measures limiting the proliferation of _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes.

[2] Chikungunya virus in the Brazilian Amazon

Abstract
--------
Background: Since its 1st detection in the Caribbean in late 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has affected 51 countries in the Americas. The CHIKV epidemic in the Americas was caused by the CHIKV-Asian genotype. In August 2014, local transmission of the CHIKV-Asian genotype was detected in the Brazilian Amazon region. However, a distinct lineage, the CHIKV-East-Central-South-America (ECSA) genotype, was detected nearly simultaneously in Feira de Santana, Bahia state, northeast Brazil. The genomic diversity and the dynamics of CHIKV in the Brazilian Amazon region remains poorly understood despite its importance to better understand the epidemiological spread and public health impact of CHIKV in the country.

Methodology/principal findings: We report a large CHIKV outbreak (5928 notified cases between August 2014 and August 2018) in Boa Vista municipality, capital city of Roraima state, located in the Brazilian Amazon region. We generated 20 novel CHIKV-ECSA genomes from the Brazilian Amazon region using MinION portable genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that despite an early introduction of the Asian genotype in 2015 in Roraima, the large CHIKV outbreak in 2017 in Boa Vista was caused by an ECSA lineage most likely introduced from northeastern Brazil. Epidemiological analyses suggest a basic reproductive number of R0 of 1.66, which translates in an estimated 39% (95% CI: 36-45) of Roraima's population infected with CHIKV-ECSA. Finally, we find a strong association between Google search activity and the local laboratory-confirmed CHIKV cases in Roraima.

Conclusions/significance: This study highlights the potential of combining traditional surveillance with portable genome sequencing technologies and digital epidemiology to inform public health surveillance in the Amazon region. Our data reveal a large CHIKV-ECSA outbreak in Boa Vista, limited potential for future CHIKV outbreaks, and indicate a replacement of the Asian genotype by the ECSA genotype in the Amazon region.

Author summary: Until the end of 2017, Brazil notified the highest number of infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Americas. We investigated a large CHIKV outbreak in Boa Vista municipality in the Brazilian Amazon region. Rapid portable genome sequencing of 20 novel isolates and subsequent genetic analysis revealed that ECSA lineage was introduced from northeastern Brazil to Roraima around July 2016. Epidemiological analyses suggest a basic reproductive number of R0 of 1.66, which suggests that approximately 39% of Roraima's population was infected with CHIKV-ECSA. Given the dominance of the CHIKV-Asian genotype in the Americas, our data highlight the rapid spread of a less understood and poorly characterized CHIKV-ECSA genotype in Brazil. Investigations on potential associations between public health impact of CHIKV and genetic diversity of circulating strains are warranted to better evaluate its impact in Brazil and beyond.

[The above study illustrates the value of the use of portable genome sequence equipment in epidemiological studies. The replacement of the Asia lineage of CHIKV by the CHIKV-ECSA is interesting. A comparison of vector efficiency in _Aedes aegypti_ of these 2 lineages might provide some insight into a mechanism of selection of the ECSA lineage. - Mod.TY]

Citation: Bletterya M, Bruniera L, Banydeenb R, et al. Management of acute-stage chikungunya disease: contribution of ultrasonographic joint examination. Int J Infect Dis 2019;84:1-4. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.03.031

Highlights
- Diagnosis of chikungunya is based on the recognition of acute febrile joint manifestations.
- This can be difficult for people who are not used to examining joints or recognizing synovitis.
- Joint ultrasound has interest for diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up under treatment of joint diseases.
- As no studies are available, we carried out a systematic study of patients in the acute phase of the disease.
- We describe the aspects in the acute phase and note that not all painful joints are synovitis or effusion sites.

Abstract
--------
Objective: Chikungunya (CHIKV) is an arbovirus that causes acute, debilitating polyarthritis. Its diagnosis can be difficult for clinicians not used to managing joint diseases or detecting synovitis. Joint Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is a simple, non-invasive examination, able to visualize synovitis. Its diagnostic and prognostic value in rheumatoid arthritis is well-established.

Methods: Patients with serologically proven acute arbovirosis were included. Clinical examination and joint count were performed (DAS score). Ultrasound examination was performed by another clinician -- experienced in joint DUS -- who also performed ultrasound joint score. Joints were examined by DUS in B-mode looking for subcutaneous infiltration, effusion, tenosynovitis, erosion and Doppler signal.

Results: In our experience, joint DUS is able to detect effusions in 92.8% of painful joints, with 28.3% of the effusions emitting a high-power Doppler signal. No erosion was observed. Subcutaneous inflammatory infiltration of the ankles (aseptic cellulitis) was found in 28.6% of patients.

Conclusion: Joint DUS is able to detect objective signs responsible for joint pain, which can be useful for practitioners not accustomed to this type of pathology. It also makes possible distinction between articular and periarticular manifestations.

[This report indicates that DUS is a useful tool for evaluating the degree and type of joint involvement in cases of chikungunya virus infection. One wonders if clinics and hospitals located in areas where chikungunya outbreaks occur that are receiving these patients have the equipment necessary to carry out DUS and the experience in interpretation of the results if they do. - Mod.TY]
