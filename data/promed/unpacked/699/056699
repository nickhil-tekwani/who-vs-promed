Steps taken to check RVF recurrence
-------------------------------
Authorities have taken intensive measures to prevent recurrence of
Rift Valley Fever in the Kingdom after reports that the deadly disease
has appeared in neighboring Iraq.
Health Minister Dr. Osama Shubokshi told Arab News that he had
instructed the agency for preventive medicine to closely follow up the
situation. The Kingdom shares a 814-km-long border with its
northeastern neighbor.
The disease has killed 120 people out of a total of 863 infected cases
in the Kingdom since September [2000. It also caused a large number
of animal deaths in southwestern parts of the country.
Abdul Aziz Saad Al-Shathry, undersecretary at the Agriculture
Ministry, said the Kingdom had banned import of cattle from many
countries as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of RVF,
foot-and-mouth disease and Nile fever [sic. The measures helped to
bring the disease under control.
Dr. Omar Hashim, acting director of animal and botanical quarantine at
the ministry, said the Kingdom had not received any official
confirmation from international organizations regarding the RVF
outbreak in Iraq. However, he said quarantine agencies along the
border were closely monitoring the situation and with the support of
border guards would prevent smuggling of infected cattle into the
country. Cattle traders have said cross-border smuggling from Iraq
have gone down considerably due to closer monitoring.
Al-Shathry pointed out that his ministry had inoculated all animals in
Jizan, Tihama Asir, Qunfuda, Laith, Meghwat and Qalwa after the RVF
outbreak in the southern region last September [2000.
Mosquitoes carry the virus from infected animals to humans. In humans
the incubation period is 2-6 days, so the virus replicates swiftly, in
some cases producing no symptoms, in others causing a mild illness
associated with fever and liver abnormalities.

The remarks of Dr Shamsudeen are timely and important.
The sero-converted UN soldiers, stationed in Pelusium (North-Western
Sinai, East of Port-Said) [in 1979 were Swedish, not Swiss. It was
not clear
where they had been exposed.
