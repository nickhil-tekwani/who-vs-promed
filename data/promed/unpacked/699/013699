Epidemiological summary

- There were 19 new suspected cases reported in Epi week 29, 2022 (18- 24 Jul 2022) from 12 states: Ondo (4), Bayelsa (3), Taraba (2), Lagos (2), Rivers (1), Kogi (1), Kano (1), Imo (1), Delta (1), Anambra (1), Akwa Ibom (1), and Abia (1).

- Of 19 suspected cases, there were 15 new confirmed positive cases in Epi week 29, 2022 from 10 states: Ondo (3), Taraba (2), Lagos (2), Bayelsa (2), Rivers (1), Kogi (1), Imo (1), Delta (1), Anambra (1), and Abia (1).

- From 1 Jan - 24 Jul 2022, there have now been 357 suspected cases and 133 confirmed cases (89 male, 44 female) from 26 states: Lagos (17), Adamawa (11), Delta (11), Rivers (10), Bayelsa (10), Ondo (9), Edo (8), Nasarawa (7), Plateau (6), FCT (5), Anambra (5), Taraba (5), Imo (4), Cross River (3), Kwara (3), Borno (3), Oyo (3), Kano (2), Katsina (2), Gombe (2), Kogi (2), Niger (1), Ogun (1), Bauchi (1), Akwa Ibom (1), and Abia (1).

- 3 deaths were recorded from 3 states: Delta (1), Lagos (1), and Ondo (1).

- Overall, since the re-emergence of monkeypox in September 2017 and to 24 Jul 2022, a total of 869 suspected cases have been reported from 35 states in the country.

- Of these 869 suspected cases, there have been 359 (41.3%) confirmed (237 male, 122 female) from 30 states: Rivers (62), Bayelsa (53), Lagos (47), Delta (40), Edo (18), Cross River (17), Imo (12), FCT (11), Adamawa (11), Ondo (9), Nasarawa (9), Oyo (9), Plateau (9), Akwa Ibom (8), Anambra (7), Taraba (5), Enugu (4), Abia (4), Kwara (3), Borno (3), Benue (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Niger (2), Ogun (2), Katsina (2), Gombe (2), Kogi (2), Ebonyi (1), and Bauchi (1).

- In addition, from September 2017 to 24 Jul 2022, a total of 11 deaths have been recorded CFR= 3.0%) in 8 states: Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1), Rivers (1), Ondo (1), and Delta (1).

- The ongoing efforts to strengthen surveillance at national and subnational levels, increased awareness from global news headlines, and our investments in risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) have contributed in part or whole to this observed increase in cases that we have seen this year [2022]. The NCDC will continue to monitor the situation even as we sustain ongoing response efforts.

- Errata: The sitrep for Epiweek 28 wrongly captured the case count for Epiweek 28 as 16 instead of 17, and the total for the year as of Epiweek 28 was captured as 117 cases instead of 118 cases.

Notes on this report
-------------
Data source:

Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions:

Suspected case
- An acute illness with fever greater than 38.3 deg C [100.9 deg F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to 3 days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand

Probable case
- A case that meets the clinical case definition and is not laboratory confirmed but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case

Confirmed case
- A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed

Contact
- Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, i.e., contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in proximity with or without physical contact with a confirmed case)

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[Monkeypox cases continue to increase in Nigeria. There are 15 new cases in epi week 29. The monkeypox virus clearly is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except in the far northeast. The report above does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.1% [11/359] is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

This report or previous ones do not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. As noted earlier, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ (giant pouched rat) and _Graphiurus_ (African dormice). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily.

There is an account of a boy who appeared in a clinic on 22 Sep 2017 who was the 1st case of monkeypox in Nigeria in 38 years. Dr. Ogoina said that over the next few months, he and his colleagues detected more than 20 additional cases at their clinic. The outbreak in Nigeria began to grow rapidly. Cases cropped up in counties not just near this one boy but all over. "Suddenly, we were seeing cases appear across the country," Ogoina says.

The virus seemed to be spreading further and faster than expected. And it wasn't infecting kids, but rather men in their 20s and 30s. "Young, active men were getting monkeypox," Ogoina says. "It was very unusual at that time." These men also didn't fit the typical profile for monkeypox patients. They weren't hunting or handling animals but instead were middle-class men, living in busy, modern cities. Ogoina wondered: "Why isn't it affecting children? Or females? Or the elderly? Why are we seeing only young men, ages 20 to 40?" (In fact, Ogoina and his colleague eventually figured out that the young boy didn't even catch the virus from an animal but rather from a male relative in his household.) And the rashes that affected these patients weren't in the typical places where monkeypox struck. Instead of being on their face and extremities, the blisters occurred around their genitals. "They had very extensive genital lesions. Very, very extensive," Ogoina says.
