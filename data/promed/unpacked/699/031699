Influenza update no 220
-----------------------
Summary
-------
Globally the influenza season was ongoing in the southern hemisphere. Elsewhere influenza activity remained low, except for some tropical countries in the Americas.

- In Europe and North America, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza B was predominant with co-circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
- In Africa (with exception of the southern cone) and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity remained low in most countries with influenza A(H3N2) the main detected virus subtype. Influenza A(H3N2) and B activity continued in south China.
- In the southern hemisphere, the influenza season was ongoing. In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity associated mainly with A(H3N2) viruses decreased. In Australia and New Zealand, the influenza season was ongoing. Australia reported continued high activity associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses. In South Africa the influenza season continued with A(H3N2) predominating.

Based on FluNet reporting (as of 18 Sep 2014 15:50 UTC), during weeks 35 to 36 (24 Aug 2014 to 6 Sep 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 50 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 22 607 specimens. 2675 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2168 (81 percent) were typed as influenza A and 507 (19 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 529 (30.1 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1231 (69.9 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 66 (98.5 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1 (1.5 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America, Europe, Northern Africa, and the Western and Central Asia region
In the countries in the northern hemisphere influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) as the main virus circulating.
In southern China, influenza activity decreased compared to previous weeks. The influenza virus detections reported were mostly influenza A(H3N2) with few influenza B viruses.
In northern China, Japan, Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall in this region, influenza activity was variable. Circulation of influenza B virus was reported from most of the Caribbean and Central American countries, such as Costa Rica and Nicaragua, with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reported in Guatemala, and with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) in the Dominican Republic and Honduras. In Panama, circulation of influenza B has decreased over the recent weeks. In Cuba, the number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) increased with respiratory syncytial virus.

Tropical countries in South America reported influenza-like illness (ILI) and SARI activity within the expected range. RSV continued to circulate but with decreasing trends. The influenza detections increased in most countries in the subregion. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, influenza was the most frequently detected respiratory virus in the last 2 months with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections; the trend has decreased since the middle of August [2014]. In Colombia, influenza activity continued to circulate, with influenza A (H3N2) as the most frequently detected virus. Peru also experienced continuous influenza activity, mainly due to influenza A; however, influenza activity was lower compared to last year.

In Brazil, the percent of specimens positive for influenza virus was lower than at the beginning of August [2014]. Influenza activity was reported mainly in the south-eastern region where influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle, and western Africa was at low levels. Cameroon reported few detections, primarily caused by influenza B virus. Zambia also reported some influenza activity.

Tropical Asia
In most southern Asian and south-eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

In India, Nepal, and Singapore, activity decreased and was mainly due to influenza A(H3N2).

Thailand reported mainly influenza B activity, though influenza activity already peaked in July [2014], and the percentage of samples testing positive for RSV has increased.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America
In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity continued to decrease.

In Argentina and Chile, ILI activity as well as number of influenza detections continued decreasing, with most ILI cases caused by RSV.

In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate remained at high levels compared to previous years, and the proportion of samples testing positive for influenza increased. Among the influenza viruses 91.7 percent were influenza A and 8.3 percent were influenza B.

In Uruguay, influenza activity continued, with influenza A(H3N2) becoming more frequently detected now than RSV.

In South Africa, influenza activity remained high and influenza A(H3N2) was the most detected virus.

Oceania, Melanesia, and Polynesia
In Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand, activity was ongoing. The most frequently detected virus in Australia and New Zealand was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, while influenza H3N2 was dominate in New Caledonia.

In Australia, ILI activity and the notification of laboratory confirmed cases remained high; influenza activity seemed to have peaked in most regions except in the south. In most jurisdictions in Australia influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated, except in New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory where influenza A(H3N2) was most common. The Australian influenza surveillance report assessed the severity of the influenza season as moderate in most jurisdictions, however more severe activity was noted in New South Wales where A(H3N2) was predominant and affecting the older age groups.

In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate remained above the seasonal threshold and slightly above the average epidemic curve. Of 1184 ILI specimens tested since 28 Apr 2014, 427 (36.1 percent) were positive for influenza, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most frequently detected influenza virus. In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend reported in several islands. ILI activity was above the threshold (90 percent of historical values) in Fiji, Micronesia (the Federated States of) , New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks.
The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[The southern hemisphere influenza season is in full swing while there is only sporadic activity in the northern hemisphere. More importantly, the strains in circulation globally remain similar to those previously circulating in the northern hemisphere. The vaccines developed for use during the next northern hemisphere influenza season should be adequate for their purpose. An unusual feature is the predominance of serious respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks in some South American Countries. It is unclear whether this reflects enhanced diagnostic capability or merely different monitoring practices. Avian and animal influenza viruses have not been a major factor during this period. - Mod.CP]
