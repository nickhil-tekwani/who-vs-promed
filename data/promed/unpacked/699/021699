Watercress (_Nasturtium officinale_) is an aquatic dicotyledonous vegetable belonging to the family of Brassicaceae. At the University of Debrecen in eastern Hungary, 30% of 3-month-old plants in aquaponic cultivation showed symptoms such as withering leaves and stems, as well as white cotton-like mycelium. Mycelia samples from infected plants were cultured. All isolates showed similar morphological characteristics. Based on these, the re-isolated pathogen was considered to be _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_.

[_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts in a wide range of taxonomic families worldwide. Its host range includes many brassica, cucurbit, and solanaceous crops. Symptoms may include white fungal growth ('white mould') on aerial plant parts; bleaching and collapse of leaves; stem lesions and rotting; wilting and death of plants.

The pathogen is primarily soil-borne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia for up to 10 years and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. It is thought that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots of alternative plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for crops. For field crops, risk of infection depends on the previous disease history of the area as well as weather conditions. Disease management may include cultural practices, phytosanitary methods, and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soil-borne fungal pathogens.

In the source publication for the story above, molecular confirmation of the pathogen was, surprisingly, not carried out. Molecular methods are now required as part of standard best practice for a definite identification of pathogens, at least as far as species levels are concerned. Molecular confirmation of the pathogen above is therefore still needed.

Aquaponics is a type of hydroponic cultivation system, where waste water from farming fish (or other aquatic animals) supplies nutrients for plants. The plants purify the water which can then be returned to the fish farm in a sustainable circuit. However, especially in the case of a root pathogen like the fungus above, the circulating water is an ideal way for pathogen spread. Eliminating pathogen infections from the system requires major phytosanitary efforts.
