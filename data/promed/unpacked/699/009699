Multiple cases of adenovirus has been reported on college campuses around the state, according to health officials.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is asking students and staff to take care to avoid the respiratory illness.

"Adenovirus infection is easily spread, which is why we tend to see it in places where large groups gather, like college dormitories and classrooms," said State Health Officer Jeanne Ayers. "While symptoms vary, the virus can be especially hard on people with weakened immune systems or who have lung or heart problems."

DHS is currently working with local health departments the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and college and university health services directors to track outbreaks and provide prevention information.

DHS officials say there are a number of ways someone can get adenovirus, including:
- breathing in adenovirus from the air after someone with the infection has sneezed or coughed;
- touching or shaking hands with someone with the virus, then touching your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes;
- touching surfaces like a doorknob, countertop, or phone with the virus on it, then touching your hands to mouth, nose, or eyes;
- having contact with fecal matter;
- having contact with water that has the virus in it, such as in a swimming pool.

Symptoms depend on the type of adenovirus and the part of the body it is affecting. It can bring cold and flu-like symptoms to bronchitis and pneumonia. It can also cause diarrhea and pink eye, and in rare cases, can cause the inflammation of the bladder or severe neurological disease.
The best ways to prevent the spread of adenoviruses are to:
- wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds;
- do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands;
- do not have close contact with people who are sick.

[Adenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illnesses. They can cause cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and pink eye (conjunctivitis). You can get an adenovirus infection at any age. People with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease are more likely than others to get very sick from an adenovirus infection (https://www.cdc.gov/adenovirus/index.html).

Adenoviruses usually cause respiratory illnesses or conjunctivitis, and outbreaks can occur throughout the year. There is no specific time of year when adenovirus infections and outbreaks are more common.

Adenovirus infection is not a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, meaning clinicians are not required to test for or report cases to health departments or CDC. Therefore, many outbreaks of adenovirus likely go either undetected or unreported.

Adenovirus types 3, 4, and 7 are most commonly associated with acute respiratory illness. Adenovirus type 7 has been associated with more severe outcomes than other adenovirus types, particularly in people with weakened immune systems. In the last 10 years, instances of severe illness and death from adenovirus type 7 infection have been reported in the United States.

Adenovirus type 14, which since 2007 has been associated with outbreaks of acute respiratory illness among US military recruits and the general public.

The report above does not mention the actual number of lab-confirmed cases or the adenovirus sub-type detected in these cases. - Mod.UBA
