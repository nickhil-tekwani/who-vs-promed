Analysis and typing of EHDV isolates from Morocco, Algeria and Israel 2006
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. North African epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) 2006:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Samples of an EHDV isolate from the blood of a bovine showing clinical
signs of EHD, near Ahfir in the East of Morocco, were received by the
Community Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue Virus (CRL) at IAH (Institute
for Animal Health) Pirbright, on 20 Oct 2006 (included in the CRL reference
collection as MOR2006/05) [See commentary]. Another EHDV isolate was also
made from a bovine lymph node sent to the CRL at IAH Pirbright, from a cow
showing clinical signs of disease in Medea, Algeria, during August 2006 --
added to the CRL reference collection as ALG2006/02. Both viruses were
confirmed as EHDV using a serogroup specific RT-PCR assay (targeting genome
segment 7, which encodes the main serogroup specific antigen VP7).

cDNA copies of genome segment 2 (encoding the serotype-specific outer
capsid protein VP2) from the Moroccan and Algerian strains were synthesised
and sequenced. The sequences obtained were identical and showed only 3 per
cent variation from the reference strain of EHDV-318, indicating that they
all belong to the same serotype.

Sequence comparisons between segment 2 of 318 and other EHDV types showed a
distant relationship with serotype 6 (the closest other strain) -- although
there is over 40 per cent variation, suggesting that 318 is itself a
distinct serotype and should be regarded as EHDV type 9.

Virus neutralisation tests (VNT) on MOR2006/05 showed high levels of cross
neutralisation with reference antisera previously raised against EHDV 318
(neutralisation of >5 log10) but no detectable neutralisation with antisera
from the other EHDV serotypes (EHDV 1-8). These data confirm that
MOR2006/05 (and ALG2006/02) are the same serotype as 318, and demonstrate
that they are serologically distinct from EHDV 1-8, again indicating their
collective status as EHDV-9.

[The tabled CRL reference EHDV collection, accessible at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/EHDV-isolates.htm>,
includes a previous EHD isolate from Morocco, designated MOR2004/03. This
virus was sampled from cattle in 2004, close to the Algerian border between
Er-Rachidia and Bou Arfa, where 14 clinical cases, including 3 mortalities,
were recorded in cattle that were co-habitant with healthy sheep. According
to the tabled information, its initial typing suggested 318 or type 6.

It seems that the current EHDV strain might have been active in the said
region at least since 2004. - Mod.AS]

2. Israeli isolates of EHDV 2006:
---------------------------------
Nine virus isolates from the blood of cows showing clinical signs of
disease in the Jordan Valley, Israel 2006, and provisionally identified as
EHDV, were received by the CRL at Pirbright. The viruses are stored in the
CRL reference collection as ISR2006/01 to ISR2006/09.

ISR2006/01 was analysed by virus neutralisation test (VNT) and showed a 2.5
Log10 reduction in titre with reference antisera to EHDV-7, but no
significant cross reaction with antisera to other EHDV serotypes (EHDV
1-9). A reduction of >2.0 Log10 indicates homologous serotype in this type
of assay, showing that the Israeli virus is type 7. Further serum
neutralisation tests (SNT) using an Israeli antiserum sample, showed
neutralisation of both EHDV-7 and EHDV-2 at a dilution of 1/320, and were
therefore regarded as inconclusive.

cDNA copies of genome segment 2 from ISR2006/01 were synthesised and
sequenced. The 5' terminal 350 base pairs showed greatest similarity to the
Australian reference strain of EHDV-7 (28 per cent sequence variation). It
is important to note that the levels of variation in Seg-2 between and
within individual EHDV serotypes have not yet been fully explored and
[there] are no established molecular assays (RT-PCR) for EHDV serotype.
However, recent studies of bluetongue genome segment 2 (Maan et al, 2007)
have detected up to 31 per cent variation within a single BTV serotype. The
genetic relationship between ISR2006/05 and EHDV-7 is therefore consistent
with its serological identification as EHDV-7, although the relationship is
quite distant, suggesting that these Israel and Australian viruses belong
[to] different topotypes.

Isolates of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) in the dsRNA virus
collection of IAH, Pirbright are included in a table accessible at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/EHDV-isolates.htm>.
The updated table (accessed 13 Dec 2006) includes 78 EHDV isolates in 9
groups: "untyped" (15), EHD-1 (12), EHD-2 (41), EHD-3 (1), EHD-4 (1), EHD-5
(2), EHD-6 (2), EHD-7 (2) and EHD-8 (2). The "untyped" group includes,
among others, 9 Israeli EHD isolates, forwarded to the IAH during October
2006. The isolate ISR2006/01, serotyped by CRL as REHD-7, was reportedly
sampled on 6 Sep 2006.

The 2 EHD-7 reference strains included in the table are from Australia.
According to the table's data, one of them -- designated AUS1981/05 -- was
sampled from cattle in 1981. The other one, AUS1981/06, was sampled in
Northern Territory/Queensland from sentinel cattle between 1979 and 1982.

Israel has been importing, during several recent years, live cattle from
Australia, mainly for fattening and a lower number for immediate slaughter.
In 2005, the number totalled about 47 500 (including 21 600 for the
Palestinian authority). 2006's figures are of the same magnitude.

Following their unloading at the Red Sea harbour, the imported bovines
intended for the Israeli feedlots are kept, prior to their release to farms
disseminated throughout the country, in 2 import/transit quarantine
stations in southern Israel, namely Eilot and Zofar (respectively 5 and 130
km north of Eilat).

According to Israel's notification to the OIE dated 23 Sep 2006
(<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_77.HTM#Sec8>) the 1st EHD outbreak in
2006 was recorded on 6 Sep 2006 in Zofar; the location can be seen, as a
solitary focus in southern Israel, in the EHD map available at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/19_39_ISR.png>. It would be of interest to
obtain recent EHD-7 strains from Australia and examine their genetic
relationship with the Israeli virus.

Australia's bluetongue-zone map, which -- in broad lines -- covers the
areas where the vector _Culicoides brevitarsis_ is present, may be accessed
at the web-site of Australia's National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP)
(<http://www.namp.com.au/>). In addition to BTV, NAMP includes data related
to 2 other vector-borne, bovine viral diseases: Akabane and Bovine
ephemeral fever. Though EHDV is generally regarded to be present within the
distribution areas of BTV-vectors, this virus does not seem to be mentioned
in NAMP's surveillance. - Mod.AS]
