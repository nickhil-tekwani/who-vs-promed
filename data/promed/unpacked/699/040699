In Ghana, 'rasta' is a virus-like disease of unknown etiology affecting tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_) plants. Symptoms include stunting; epinasty, crumpling, and chlorosis of leaves; and necrosis of leaf veins, petioles and stems.

Leaf samples with rasta symptoms were collected from 17 commercial tomato fields in Ghana in October 2012 and were shown to be infected with _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd -- EPPO A2 List) and _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, TASVd -- formerly EPPO Alert List). PSTVd and TASVd isolates were seed-associated and possibly seed transmitted.

The authors noted that, in Mali, rasta-like symptoms in tomato plants were associated with _Columnea latent viroid_ [CLVd; also genus _Pospiviroid_].

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top disease in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible.

For _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (TASVd; genus _Pospiviroid_), few data are available on its host range. Symptoms in tomato may include stunting, leaf distortion, reduced fruit size, and discolouration. Up to 100 percent incidence with heavy yield losses has been reported.

_Columnea latent viroid_ (CLVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) is considered a significant risk to tomato crops. The severity of infection may vary, but symptoms can be serious and are similar to PSTVd. CLVD can also affect potatoes.

Pospiviroids can be spread with vegetative propagation material (tubers, cuttings, transplants, tissue cultures), pollen, mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact. They have been shown to be seed transmitted in crop and wild Solanaceae. PSTVd in tomato is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending on the host cultivar, and was shown to be present in the embryo and endosperm of tomato seeds (see link below). Thus, with seeds being traded widely, pospiviroids are considered an important international quarantine risk (ProMED-mail posts 20140122.2222560 & 20130321.1597703).

The viroids are exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified viroid free planting material. The presence of pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries (see ProMED-mail posts below) and poses a threat to crops. This highlights the importance of systematic surveys and quarantine measures for these pathogens, even if there are no obvious problems with crops.
