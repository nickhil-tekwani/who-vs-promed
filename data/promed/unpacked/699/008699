TYPHOID FEVER - ALGERIA (2)
===========================
The report states that "the outbreak was caused by sewage water
contaminating the water reservoirs after a sewage pipe had been
damaged during construction work."
What new things were studied in this natural experiment besides
identification of a vehicle? Anything about age specific attack rates in
relation to amount of water drunk, and such things?
