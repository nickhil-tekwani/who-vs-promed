Kala-azar in children at Zam Zam camp, El Fasher in North Darfur
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dozens of children at Zam Zam internally displaced persons camp near EL Fasher in North Darfur are reported to be carrying Kala-azar, a parasitic disease also known as [visceral] leishmaniasis. Health care activists at the camp said they registered 93 cases among children to the Ministry of Health in El Fasher.

The ministry dispatched an investigation team to the camp a week ago. An activist said to Radio Dabanga the team visited one nursery out of 41 nurseries in the area and found 16 cases of the disease. They also visited 2 schools out of 30 and found 120 cases.

Following the assessment visit last week [9-13 Jan 2012] the ministry said it would send a medical team to treat those children with the disease but has until now failed to do so. The activist appealed to the ministry and aid organizations to move quickly and help these children before the situation deteriorates further.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Sudan, and ProMED-mail has reported high prevalences in southern Sudan and eastern Sudan. It is particularly worrying that the present report concerns children, but it is not surprising. Treatment is complicated. A recent study from southern Sudan (Gorski S et al. Visceral leishmaniasis relapse in Southern Sudan (1999-2007): a retrospective study of risk factors and trends. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010;4:e705), found that treatment with 17-day sodium stibogluconate/paromomycin (SSG/PM) combination therapy vs 30-day SSG monotherapy was associated with increased risk of relapse (OR = 2.08 (1.21, 3.58)) but reduced risk of death (OR = 0.27 (0.20, 0.37)).

Control measures include rodent control, the main reservoir, and one study found that impregnated bed nets reduced risk (Ritmeijer K et al. Evaluation of a mass distribution programme for fine-mesh impregnated bednets against visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Sudan. Trop Med Int Health. 2007;12:404-14).
