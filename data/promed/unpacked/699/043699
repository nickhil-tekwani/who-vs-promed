Indonesia: 78th death reported
------------------------------
A 45-year-old Indonesian man from central Java has died of bird flu,
a health ministry official said on Wednesday [30 May 2007]. The man
from Grobogan died on Monday after being hospitalized on 17 May 2007,
Joko Suyono of the ministry's bird flu centre said by telephone. The
Indonesian authorities were still investigating, but the man was
believed to have slaughtered and eaten a sick chicken, while dead
fowl were found near his home, the official said.
The man's death brings the number of confirmed human fatalities in
Indonesia to 78, the highest in the world. Contact with sick fowl is
the most common way humans become infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.
Indonesians keep millions of fowl in their backyards, and attempts to
limit contact with humans are often poorly enforced, while education
campaigns often do not reach more remote areas. For the moment, it
remains largely a disease in birds, but scientists are worried about
the virus's persistence and ability to adapt to new environments and hosts.
