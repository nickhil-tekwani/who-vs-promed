Rabies diagnosed in a 5-year-old boy from the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabies was diagnosed in a 5-year-old boy from the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea. The boy had been bitten in his neck by a stray dog
5 weeks before. He received treatment against tetanus but not rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis.
On 27 Dec 2007, the boy complained of a headache, general pain, and
weakness. The day after, the boy refused to eat and drink, and showed
incoordination. On 19 Dec 2007, the boy was hospitalized in the
Israeli medical center "La Paz" in Bata city, with symptoms of
encephalitis and hydrophobia. Rabies was suspected. On 21 Dec 2007,
cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and a skin biopsy were collected and
sent to the Rabies Laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet
Dagan, Israel. Heminested RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction] detected rabies virus [RNA] in saliva and skin
biopsy. Molecular analysis of the PCR product showed 99 percent
identity with canine rabies virus sequences from this region (Gabon).
Rabies virus isolation in tissue culture and in suckling mice is
ongoing.

[Currently the World Health Organisation (WHO) 'Essential Rabies
Maps' (<http://www.who.int/rabies/rabies_maps/en/index.html>)
contains no information on the incidence of rabies in Equatorial
Guinea. Nonetheless it is likely that rabies is widespread in canids
throughout West Africa in view of the close sequence similarity of
the Equatorial Guinea sequences to the genome of a rabies virus
isolated in the neighboring country of Gabon. The rapid diagnostic
response of the Kimron Institute and wide dissemination of the
information are welcomed.
While little can be done now to aid the patient, the diagnosis should
alert the healthcare authorities in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
to the need for immediate provision of post-exposure prophylaxis for
persons bitten by stray dogs or wild canids, combined where feasible,
with vaccination of domestic and feral dogs.
