A total of 20 hippo carcasses, of the 109 which died of anthrax, have been disposed of since [Fri 13 Oct 2017], spokesperson of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism Romeo Muyunda says. In an interview with Nampa yesterday, Muyunda said 20 of the 109 carcasses were destroyed between [Fri 13 Oct 2017] and [Sat 14 Oct 2017].

The ongoing operation will see officials from the environment ministry and the ministry of agriculture's veterinary department helping each other to clean the river where the hippos died. "There is progress. The carcasses are being burnt, and the remains are buried,'' said Muyunda.

Communities living near the river were warned by minister of Environment and Tourism Pohamba Shifeta last week not to drink the water as it may be contaminated. Muyunda added that the Ministry has not received reports of any cases of people being affected by the anthrax bacteria.

Farmers in the Mukwe constituency were advised last week by the ministry of agriculture to vaccinate their livestock against anthrax as the area might be affected.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by a bacterium. Anthrax affects both wild and domestic herbivores like cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, elephants as well as antelopes. Due to the rapid progression of the disease, most animals which get anthrax die quickly, and may ooze dark blood from most orifices. They also become bloated, and decompose rapidly.

[Their progress is impressive. Burning cattle is hard enough but hippos are heavier and some of these carcasses will have had to be recovered from lakes and will be sodden and decomposing. To efficiently burn a carcass one must make sure that plenty of air can get in under the carcass. A carcass must burn from the bottom up as well as from the top down. Otherwise you get a thick pad of unburnt hide and bones lying on the ground. I have seen such with the maggots still alive and feeding. And thus proof that any spores are still alive. And Namibia does not have coal, so these carcasses are being burned with whatever timber they can find and chop down. All in all, very labour demanding. Keep up the good work! - Mod.MHJ
