According to Ronald Singer, a spokesman for Haiti's health ministry, at least 1529 cases of the chikungunya virus have been confirmed. Of these, about 900 of them were found in the west department, where the capital of Port-au-Prince is located. Another 300 cases were confirmed in north western Haiti, the Associated Press reports. This is up dramatically from the 14 confirmed cases just less than a week ago.

On Sunday [11 May 2014], the Haitian news source, Haiti Libre reported that Dr Marie Raymond Guirlene Charite, the general of the Ministry of Health Directorate, announced that 632 people have officially caught the chikungunya virus in Haiti.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.

CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] notes that there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya. People can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

[The rapid spread of chikungunya virus infections in Haiti is of significant concern, and threatens to become a major outbreak. With the lack of good infrastructure to provide potable water, especially in camps housing people displaced by the earthquake, mosquito vector control will be extraordinarily difficult. ProMED-mail thanks Roland Hubner for sending in similar reports.

Jose Antonio Samra, hospital pediatrician and clinical advisor to the national dengue program, stated that 3 cases of chikungunya fever were registered. [Transmission] is caused by the mosquitoes _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, and symptoms [of the virus infection] are similar to those of dengue.

The cases were confirmed in recent hours by specialists of the Hospital Escuela. The doctor explained that last year [2013], during an analysis of dengue cases, there were "3 people diagnosed [with chikungunya virus infection] by exclusion, that is to say that they were serologically tested and negative for dengue." Later, cross-reactive tests were done for chikungunya disease and 3 people resulted positive," the physician stated.

The specialist in dengue clinical management alerted the population to pay attention to symptoms such as fever, and joint pain and inflammation. Also, he indicated the necessity for the Secretariat of Health to initiate training of medical personnel to know more about the disease.

[This report does not provide enough information to present a convincing case for the occurrence of chikungunya virus infections in Honduras. The date in 2013 when the patients became ill was not given. The 1st known cases in the western hemisphere occurred in St Martin in December 2013. It is also not stated if the infections were acquired locally or elsewhere, and if local, specifically where. This is important information to have, and ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving it. The dengue test "by exclusion" simply indicates that these cases were not dengue virus infections. The details of the cross-reactive tests are not provided either. Establishment of a serological diagnosis of a chikungunya virus infection requires specific tests with that virus or its antigens. That may require sending the samples to a WHO reference laboratory for confirmation. In any event, there is no reported ongoing transmission.

The Florida Department of Health has issued a warning regarding chikungunya fever, a viral mosquitoborne disease that has made its way to the Caribbean from Africa, Asia, and islands in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.

The Department has confirmed 3 Florida cases of the fever from people who have recently traveled to the Caribbean. These include a 30 year old woman in Miami-Dade County, a 29 year old woman from Broward County, and a 44 year old woman in Hillsborough County.

Symptoms of chikungunya usually begin 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and can include fever, headache, muscle pain, rash, joint swelling and severe joint pains, often in the hands and feet.

[These cases were diagnosed in Florida, where the mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_ is present, with the risk of ongoing infection. Fortunately, no additional cases have been reported in these localities. ProMED-mail thanks David Hawman for sending in this report.

The 16 May 2014 edition of The Global Dispatch (http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/tampa-woman-contracts-chikungunya-while-traveling-to-the-dominican-republic-94951/) reported that the 1st case of chikungunya virus infection in Florida this year (2014) was a 44 year old Tampa-area resident who contracted the mosquitoborne viral infection while visiting the Dominican Republic, according to the Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) epidemiologist. The chikungunya virus confirmation testing by PCR methodology was performed by the Bureau of Public Health laboratory in Tampa. The patient has since been released from the hospital after several days' admission. This report was sent in by Roland Hubner.

An independent journalist issued a report (http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/web/Article/Index/53747f643a682e0eb058aaa8#.U3ouJq5Vgxd in Spanish), allegedly from the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, that chikungunya virus infections were occurring in Cuba. This same report indicated that there were cases and deaths due to ebolavirus infection in Cuba. In a follow up report cited above, Dr EA Gonzales officially refuted the report that these viruses were present in Cuba and responsible for human cases.

[Normally, ProMED-mail would not post a report as inaccurate as the one above on chikungunya and ebolaviruses in Cuba. Because it is an example of how inaccurate and irresponsible reporting runs the risk of causing unnecessary public panic, it is included in this week's update. The refutation of the original report by Dr Gonzales is an example of timely presentation of sound, scientifically based information correcting the original misinformation.

Local health officials have confirmed 12 cases of chikungunya virus [infections] locally. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the same mosquitoes, which spread dengue [viruses].

Like dengue, chikungunya is characterized by fever and pain which lasts from 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Other symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and rash. National epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste says cases have been confirmed across the Island.

Jn Baptiste says the majority of cases involved women above the age of 25. Meanwhile, health minister Alvina Reynolds says her Ministry remains committed to tackling the viral illness, by destroying mosquito breeding grounds and expanding its public awareness campaign.

The Ministry of Health has stepped up its vector control drive, but has made it clear that members of the public must do their part to ensure the campaign is successful. Health officials say as there is no vaccine or medication currently available to prevent or cure the infection, control of chikungunya involves measures to eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The chikungunya virus, which causes rashes, fever, and agonizing, sometimes lasting, joint pains, is spreading rapidly in the Caribbean. More than 45 000 suspected and confirmed infections have already been reported. Now that it has arrived in the western hemisphere, the virus will spread as far as the southern United States and Argentina, scientists say, because its main vector, the mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_, is widespread. There are no drugs against chikungunya, but several vaccines are in various stages of development.

[9] Threat for Europe ex Caribbean

[ref: Mansuy JM, Grouteau E, Mengelle C, et al. Chikungunya in the Caribbean -- threat for Europe. Emerg Infect Dis [internet]. 2014; 20(8)]
------------------------------------------------------------------
In Southern France, 2 cases of chikungunya in siblings (an 8 year old girl and a 10 year old boy) were recently identified at the Toulouse University Hospital 2 days after these children had returned to France from the island of Martinique (French West Indies). These children developed acute fever associated with an arthromyalgic syndrome. The children had maculopapular, nonpruriginous rashes on their arms and legs, and endobuccal petechiae. The boy had bilateral knee effusions, and the girl had a measles-like rash that became more extended. Both children also had many mosquito bites that they scratched. They were discharged on the day of their admission. These 2 cases reported in metropolitan France after the patients visited Martinique indicate rapid spread of chikungunya virus.

_Ae. albopictus_ (Asian tiger mosquito) is also an efficient vector of chikungunya virus and is found in many areas, including southern Europe. This mosquito species was responsible for the extensive chikungunya outbreak on La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean and was involved in the first chikungunya outbreak in Italy in 2007. _Ae. albopictus_ became established in a large area (91 150 sq km [35 193 sq mi]) of southern France in 2013, where approximately 13 million persons live.

The presence of an effective vector, its progressive spread, and the outbreak of chikungunya in the Western Hemisphere increase concerns of a chikungunya outbreak in Europe. The greatest challenge is to find a way of interrupting the transmission chain of the virus as soon as possible. This challenge requires an effective policy of informing travelers at risk, early screening based on rapid virologic diagnosis, and effective vector control. Such control measures need an educated population to ensure emptying standing water from flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, pet water dishes, and discarded tires. They also need global antivector measures (eradication of eggs, larvae, and adults of _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes).

[_Ae. albopictus_ is present in many areas of the Mediterranean Basin, including southern France. The risk of viremic individuals who became infected with chikungunya virus in the Caribbean arriving in localities where this vector is present and initiating an outbreak in southern Europe is real.
