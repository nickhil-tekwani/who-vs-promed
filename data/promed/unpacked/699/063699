Yellow fever in Burkina Faso
Two yellow fever cases have been reported in Burkina Faso, one of which has
been confirmed. Both cases occurred in a village in Batie District, Gaoua
Region in the south of the country near the border with Cote d'Ivoire. The
cases were one adult male of 35 years and a 14 year-old boy of the same
family. The adult case had onset on 18 November and died on 24 November
before a blood sample could be taken. The boy had onset on 29 November, was
hospitalized on 4 December and is now improving.
The Centre Muraz in Bobo Dioulasso tested serum from the boy and reported
that it was positive for IgM yellow fever antibody. The Ministry of Health
has a stock of approximately 200,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine, of
which 30,000 have been sent to the region for an emergency vaccination
campaign. Yellow fever was last reported in Burkina Faso ... when a large
outbreak occurred in 1983.
