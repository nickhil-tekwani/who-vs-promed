Lassa fever in Nigeria
----------------------
At the beginning of 2012, WHO was notified by the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria of an outbreak of Lassa fever. As of 22 Mar 2012, 623 suspected cases, including 70 deaths have been recorded from 19 of the 36 States since the beginning of the year. Laboratory analysis undertaken at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua Edo State has confirmed the presence of Lassa virus infection in 108 patients. 3 doctors and 4 nurses were reported to be among the fatalities. This information is provisional and subject to change when laboratory results for Lassa fever in suspected cases become available.

The Federal and State governments are responding to the outbreak by enhancing the disease surveillance for early detection, reinforcing treatment of patients, and conducting awareness campaigns among the affected population. Major challenges are the ongoing security risks in the country limiting access to some areas as well as the limited availability of resources to respond to the escalating outbreak.

WHO does not advise or recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with Nigeria. Travellers returning from affected areas who develop symptoms of fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain should seek medical advice.

People usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to infected rodents belonging to _Mastomys_ [genus]. Person-to-person transmission occurs through direct contact with sick patients in both community and health care settings. Those at greatest risk are persons living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ [rodents] are found. Health care workers are at risk if adequate infection control practices are not maintained.

[A previous ProMED-mail report dated 22 Feb 2012 stated that in the 1st 6 weeks of 2012 there had been 392 cases of Lassa fever and 40 fatalites across the country. The Minister of Health reported at that time that 6 of the dead were health workers (2 doctors and 4 nurses) and that cases have been reported in 12 states: Edo, Nasarawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Taraba, Yobe, Ondo, Rivers, Gombe, Anambra, Delta, and Lagos. Currently the outbreak has spread to at least 19 of the 36 states of Nigeria and the total number cases now exceeds 623 with 70 fatalities.

About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic with the remainder experiencing severe multi-system disease with the virus affecting several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease and the animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta. In the absence of an effective vaccine, rodent control would seem the best option for control of the current outbreak.

Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to excreta of infected _Mastomys_ rodents, and the infection may spread further between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported.

Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. (For further information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html.)
