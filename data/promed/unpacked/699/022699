Foot and mouth disease in Venezuela
-----------------------------------
(date of previous reported outbreak: December 2001). This is a translation
of information received on 21 and 28 Nov 2002 from Dr Nancy Medina de
Lopez, Director of the Autonomous Service of Agricultural Health (SASA),
Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, Caracas.
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in cattle was first detected on
16 Oct 2002 in Presidente Paez Parish, Alberto Adriani municipality (8 deg
39 min N - 71 deg 52 min W). The diagnosis has been made on clinical and
laboratory grounds.
194 cases have been identified among 680 susceptible cattle.
On 24 Oct 2002, 3 epithelium samples were taken from sick animals. They
were delivered to the National Institute of Agricultural Veterinary
Research (Maracay, Aragua State) on 6 Nov 2002. 12 days later, the
laboratory indicates that the results were positive for foot and mouth
disease virus type A.
Control measures include:
- surveillance and epidemiological alert in Aragua state;
- immediate notification of this event to the neighbouring states;
- notification to the state breeder associations;
- quarantine of the affected establishment;
- movement restriction of personnel of the affected establishment;
- biosecurity measures;
- isolation and treatment of sick animals;
- ring vaccination.

[Venezuela has had 4 outbreaks in each of the past 3 years involving
several hundred animals each time. This has also been the case with
neighboring countries such as Ecuador and Colombia. Also, please note that
this outbreak is attributed to a FMD virus type A, while the recent
outbreak in Paraguay was due to an FMD type O virus. - Mod.PC]
