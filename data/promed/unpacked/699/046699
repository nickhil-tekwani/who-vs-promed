Press clipping from The National, a daily PNG paper 7/2/97
The influenza outbreak in Finschhafen, Morobe province, which claimed 30
lives and affected more than 2,000 others, has now been brought under control.
Finschhafen district nursing services director, Paul Warena, said that five
patrol teams had assessed the affected areas of Mongi, Kuat and Burum in the
Pindu sub-district and they confirmed that the outbreak was coming to a halt.
Mr Warena said no further deaths were reported during the time the patrol
teams were out dispersing medical drugs [Such as? -- Mod CHC]. He said the
district health office is currently purchasing additional drugs [Such as? --
Mod CHC] in case the outbreak erupts again.
The outbreak which started in April killed 30 people, both young and old, and
affected over 2,000 people in the stated areas.
Non-availability of medicines [?] had resulted in the high death toll and
even after the required supplies were acquired, they could not be sent to the
affected areas due to transportation problems in the earlier days of the
outbreak.
However, the provincial government and the health authorities had pooled
together the necessary resources to bring the outbreak under control last
week.
