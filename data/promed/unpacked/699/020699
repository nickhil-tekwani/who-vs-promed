Speaking at today's [14 Aug 2020] Government media conference, Dr Ashley Bloomfield said 2 of the new cases are in Tokoroa [South Waikato District, North Island]. Today's figures are made up of 12 confirmed and one probable case. Dr Bloomfield said the 2 cases in Tokoroa tested positive after being followed up as close contacts of a family member who is one of the previously-confirmed Auckland cases.

The 2 new Tokoroa cases were visited by the same previously-confirmed cases that had travelled to a Waikato aged care facility, Kingswood Rest Home -- before showing symptoms the following day. Dr Bloomfield revealed the family member visited in Kingswood has tested negative.

Twelve of the cases have been linked to the Auckland cluster but the 13th -- the latest case found -- is still being investigated. That person is currently in hospital.

The new figures mean New Zealand has 48 active cases and the country's overall confirmed and probable cases moves to 1602. Dr Bloomfield added 38 people linked to the new Auckland cluster, including confirmed cases and household members of those infected have been moved to a quarantine facility.

There was also a record amount of COVID-19 tests processed yesterday -- 15 703 - which takes New Zealand's total to date to 524 414. There were also another 386 000 downloads of the COVID Tracer app in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of registered users to 1 172 800.

B. Source of virus and control measures
Date: Thu 13 Aug 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/asia/new-zealand-coronavirus-lockdown-elimination.html


As the week began, New Zealanders were celebrating 100 days without community spread of the coronavirus, drinking at pubs, packing stadiums, and hugging friends. 2 days later, that suddenly changed: 4 new cases, all related, emerged in Auckland. On Thursday [13 Aug 2020], officials said the cluster had grown to 17, as they struggled to map out how the virus had returned to an isolated island nation championed for its pandemic response.

One theory is that it could have come through cargo. Some of the infected New Zealanders worked at a cold storage warehouse with imported food. Another focus is quarantine facilities for returning travelers, the source of an outbreak tearing through Melbourne, Australia.

A mystery and a few cases -- that's all it took for New Zealand to say goodbye to normalcy. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately announced a new lockdown for Auckland, a city of 1.7 million people, along with a huge testing, contact tracing, and quarantine blitz that aims to quash COVID-19 for the 2nd time.

"Going hard and early is still the best course of action," Ms Ardern said on Thursday [13 Aug 2020] as she had relaunched her daily coronavirus news briefings. "We have a plan." Many other places have faced a similar challenge -- Hong Kong, Australia, and Viet Nam have all confronted new waves after early triumphs. New Zealand, while disappointed by the abrupt resurgence, has reacted with an extraordinary level of urgency and action that it hopes will be a model for how to eliminate a burst of infection and rapidly get on with life.

"We were totally back to hugging, handshaking, restaurants, cinemas -- all the stuff apart from going on holiday overseas," said Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist at the University of Auckland. "What we've had time to do in the meantime is massively ramp up our testing and contact tracing, so this is going to be a real test of how quickly you can stamp it out again." "Everything about the time frame," she added, "has been really compressed."

Ms Ardern 1st heard about a potential positive case at 4 p.m. on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020] while traveling in a van a few hours outside the capital, Wellington, after visiting a factory that makes face masks. At 9:15 p.m., she and Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, appeared at a news conference where they announced the new cases -- all 4 were from the same family; none had recently returned from overseas -- and a lockdown that would start the following day [12 Aug 2020]. "We have come too far to go backwards," Ms Ardern said. "Be strong and be kind. The lockdown was initially set for 3 days. Contact tracing had already begun.

Michael Baker, an epidemiologist who was a leading proponent of New Zealand's forceful efforts to eliminate the virus during its initial outbreak months ago, said he heard about the new cases a few hours before the announcement. Like many others, he immediately started trying to work out what had gone wrong. "The only way a virus can appear in the community in New Zealand is via the borders," he said. "It's been eliminated in New Zealand. There is really no chance it was persisting for the last three months without it being detected." But which border, how and when? No one yet knows.

Dr Bloomfield said on Thursday [13 Aug 2020] that those infected in the new cluster 1st showed symptoms around the end of July [2020], suggesting that the virus had been in the community for at least a week before that. Genetic sequencing found similarities with versions of the virus in Britain and Australia.

To investigate the unproven idea of a spread through cargo, health officials have tested everyone at Americold, the cold storage company where some of the 1st cases appeared, with fast-tracked results identifying a total of 7 workers with the virus. Scientists, aware of how the virus has thrived in cold storage at meatpacking plants in other countries, are also testing surfaces at the company's 2 facilities. If the virus is found to have moved through freight, the consequences could be significant for global trade. It could mean deep cleaning and lengthier wait times between shipment and delivery, along with more monitoring on ships and in ports.

But epidemiologists said such transmission was improbable: human-to-human contact was the most likely source. "90% of cases occur in houses and workplaces," Dr Bloomfield said. The cluster's growth so far points to a path through kitchens and break rooms. One of the new infections reported on Thursday [13 Aug 2020] involved a student related to a person identified on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020]. Another 7 are family members of Americold employees.

All of those newly infected will be placed in government quarantine facilities, in an escalation over containment measures during New Zealand's 1st lockdown in March and April [2020]. New Zealand has apparently learned what not to do from its neighbor and rival Australia, where 800 people who had tested positive in Melbourne were recently found not to be at home during random checks of self-isolation. Australia's missteps have also led New Zealand to focus on quarantine facilities -- in Melbourne, the virus moved from travelers to hotel workers, who then carried it home.

Dr Bloomfield said Thursday [13 Aug 2020] that workers at all 32 quarantine facilities that handle returning travelers would be tested for the virus this week, and once a week after that. Relatives of the workers may also be tested, along with every border official at New Zealand's airports and other ports -- between 6000 and 7000 federal employees. "It will help us avoid any further and inadvertent spread into the community," Dr Bloomfield said.

The lockdown aims to do the same, and it's being strongly enforced. In its 1st day and a half, the authorities stopped 17 000 vehicles at 10 checkpoints. Most were traveling for the right reasons -- for work, food, or care-taking -- and only 312 were turned back for trying to leave Auckland or other violations of the rules.

Dr Baker, the epidemiologist, said that New Zealand's prior success, and the sustained elimination of the virus in other places, such as Taiwan and Fiji, suggested room for optimism. He said the latest outbreak could be small and quickly brought under control. "The government moved incredibly fast and decisively with the lockdown," he said. "If there are any undetected chains of transmission, they will peter out."

[Rapid action on the part of the government, taking advice from public health experts is the appropriate approach to managing the pandemic in a country. The investigation into the source of the introduction of the virus is an important piece of the control effort, to learn how to prevent future introductions. The curious information is the genetic profile of the virus -- similar to those currently circulating in the UK and Australia... suggesting a possible Commonwealth chain of transmission.

The association with the cold storage warehouse may be where enhanced transmission occurred from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected individuals, although there is definite concern re: possible importation of infected products (see section 2 below). More information on the results of these investigations from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

[2] China: contaminated imported foods, RFI
Date: Thu 13 Aug 2020 1:28 PM CEST
Source: NBC News [edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-found-frozen-food-packaging-chinese-cities-n1236574


Over the span of 4 days, 3 Chinese cities have reported detecting coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on imported frozen food, raising fresh concerns contaminated food shipments could lead to new outbreaks.

On Thursday [13 Aug 2020], health officials in the southeastern city of Shenzhen said a surface sample of frozen chicken wings from Brazil has tested positive for the virus. The virus was detected as part of routine screenings being carried out on meat and seafood imports since June [2020] in the wake of an outbreak in Beijing linked to a major wholesale food market.

The Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission said in a statement it traced and tested everyone who may have come into contact with potentially contaminated food products, and all results were negative. "All the citizens should be cautious in buying imported frozen meat products and aquatic products in recent days," the commission warned the city's 12 million residents.

The discovery comes a day after the virus was found on the packaging of the frozen shrimp imported from Ecuador during another routine inspection at a restaurant in the southeast city of Wuhu, health officials there reported.

On Monday [10 Aug 2020], health officials in the port city of Yantai in eastern China said coronavirus was detected on the outer packaging of frozen seafood transported by a foreign ship. It was not clear where the food was imported from.

Last month [July 2020], Chinese health officials have also reported coronavirus presence on imported frozen food packaging in the cities of Dalian, Xiamen, and Pingxiang.

[Reports from the Chinese media on these events include:
1. 13 Aug 2020. Shenzhen, Guangdong http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2020-08-13/doc-iivhvpwy0800151.shtml: Several dates and consignments; one of them involved chicken wings from Brazil. Case 6, on 23 Jul 2020 in Dalian, is different because the contamination was picked up in multiple food and environmental samples from Dalian Kaiyang World Seafood Co, Ltd -- cold warehouse, processing workshop, dormitories, cafeteria.

2.12 Aug 2020. Yantai, Shandong https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1674787275904318715: Country of origin not named but all products sampled onboard a foreign-registered vessel that unloaded in the port of Dalian.

An additional report from Reuters is available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-shenzhen-idUSKCN25902B.

So a key question remains as to whether these contaminated products or packages containing food contain live transmissible virus that was implicated in actual transmission into the receiving country's population. Results of further scientific studies on this would be greatly appreciated. - Mods.MPP/AS]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences.

A key take-away message is that the virus is still circulating globally and relaxing of guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing and large gatherings is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission, - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 13 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- There have been notable achievements made by Azerbaijan in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To further boost its response to the ongoing pandemic, a team of WHO experts has recommended that the country strengthen contact tracing and testing.

- Access to basic handwashing facilities is a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) found that 43% of schools worldwide lacked access to basic handwashing with soap and water in 2019.

- More than 2800 community health workers have been trained in Haiti as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and meetings have been conducted with community leaders to provide them with accurate information about COVID-19. All of these efforts provide much needed support to the Ministry of Health and the country's Multisectoral Pandemic Management Commission of COVID-19.

- There has been a continued commitment to measles and rubella elimination in the WHO European Region, although the COVID-19 pandemic is placing an extraordinary burden on health systems.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 54.7% of the global newly reported and 64.9% of newly reported for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.9 million. The USA reported 36.2% of (54 791), followed by Brazil 34.5% (52 160), Colombia 8.5% (12 830, Argentina 4.7% (7043), Mexico 4.4% (6686), Peru 4.3% (6547), Bolivia 1.1% (1130), and Chile 1.0% (1552).

- The European region reported 9.4% of the global newly reported cases and 7.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 19.4% (5057) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 12.1% (3172), France 9.3% (2429), Ukraine 6.1% (1592), Kazakhstan 5.7% (1489), Israel 0% (0), Germany 5.5% (1445), Romania 5.4% (1415), Turkey 4.6% (1212), UK 3.9% (1009), Poland 2.7% (715), Netherlands 2.5% (654), and Uzbekistan 2.4% (622).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.9% of the global newly reported and 5.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 25.3% (3441) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 18.5% (2510), Saudi Arabia 11.6% (1569), Morocco 11.0% (1499), Pakistan 5.6% (762), Kuwait 5.3% (717), Libya 4.9% (670). Palestinian Authority 3.7% (499), Bahrain 3.4% (460), Qatar 2.2% (292), and Lebanon 2.2% (292). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a relative surge mode.

- The African region reported 2.6% of the global newly reported and 5.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 39.7% (2810) of the newly reported in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 13.6% (961), Kenya 9.6% (679), Algeria 7.0% (495), Nigeria 6.4% (453), Zambia 3.2% (226), Senegal 2.9% (207), Namibia 2.5% (177), and Ghana 2.4% (168).

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.1% of the global newly reported cases and 1.8% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 71.3% (4211) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 15.9% (937), Australia 7.0% (414), China 1.4% (82), and South Korea 0.95% (56). The Philippines, Japan, and Australia continue to have elevated transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 26.3% of the global newly reported cases and 15.5% of globally reported deaths. India reported 92.3% (66 999) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.1% (2995) and Indonesia 2.7% (1942). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Globally the 21 million mark has been crossed in the past 24 hours. With over 1 million new cases confirmed in the past 3 days.

The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (64 142), followed by Brazil (59 147), and USA (55 364) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.7%). There were 1079 deaths reported in the past 24 hours - 16% of the deaths reported in the previous 24 hours... suspect this is due to reporting difficulties.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3841 to 64 142. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, Spain, France, Iran, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Chile, Israel, Ukraine, and Saudi Arabia; their range of reported new cases is 1482 to 3777.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 2.1% (a reversal of previous trends for decreasing case reports, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 13.2%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind! - I feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed; albeit, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new and (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
