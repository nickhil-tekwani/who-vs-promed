Trichinellosis Outbreaks -- North Rhine-Westfalia, Germany, 1998-1999
[aka Trichinosis & trichiniasis -- see Benenson, CCDM 1995 edn.
- Mod.JW
>From November 1998 through January 1999, 52 cases of trichinellosis
were identified by the public health surveillance systems in 11 cities and
districts of the state of North Rhine-Westfalia (NRW), Germany.
In comparison, 0 to 10 cases were reported annually in Germany during
[the decade 1987-1997. This report summarizes the investigation
of these cases, which indicated the existence of 2 simultaneous
outbreaks --1 caused by contaminated ground meat and the other
by a commercially prepared raw smoked sausage.
A case of trichinellosis was defined as a positive serologic test for
_Trichinella_ antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) in a NRW resident after
September 1, 1998. Preliminary investigations indicated 22 of 23
patients from 10 cities and districts in NRW had eaten a specific
brand of raw smoked sausage made by company A; however,
none of 8 case-patients in Mettmann-Langenfeld (ML) had eaten
this product.
Clinical signs of patients and controls that were consistent with
trichinellosis were myalgia, fever and fatigue. Some had histories
of eating ground pork, while others had a history of eating a
ground mixed meat (beef and pork). No patients or controls
from ML reported having eaten raw smoked sausage produced
by company A.
Frozen samples of ground meat bought in early November at
supermarket A were collected from 3 case-families in ML. Larvae
of _Trichinella_ were detected in 1 sample of ground mixed meat.
Supermarket A belongs to a chain of supermarkets with a central
meat distribution station. During the week in which the
contaminated meat was processed, the company had bought pork
from 9 different abattoirs in Germany, Belgium, and the
Netherlands that had received pigs from approximately 40
producers. It was not possible to determine which producer
provided the contaminated meat.
Forty-four cases were identified from 10 cities in NRW, other
than ML. Symptoms included myalgia, fever, headache, diarrhea
and facial edema. Some patients and contols had histories of
eating smoked sausage, and some patients and controls reported
having eaten raw smoked sausage produced by Company A; no
controls reported eating the product. Patients were more likely
than controls to have eaten ground pork mixed ground meat, and
sandwiches with raw ground meat.
Because the usual incubation period of trichinellosis is 8-15 days,
the environmental investigation focused on meat that had been
used for sausage production during the last week of September.
During this week, company A had produced its sausages from
deep frozen pork from Belgium and Germany and from 1650 lbs
(750 kg) of fresh pork neck from Spain. Samples from neither the
meat nor the sausages remained for investigation. Samples from
later production lots were negative for trichinellosis.
The meat from Belgium and Germany had been frozen at 5 F
(-15 C) for at least 20 days. The trichinellosis control certificates
for the fresh pork neck provided by the abattoir in Spain had
control numbers that did not match the control numbers on the
meat. Further investigations are ongoing.
Editors Note:
The findings in this report indicate the existence of 2 outbreaks
of trichinellosis. Because the exact source of the meat from
either outbreak could not be determined, it is unclear whether
the outbreaks were related. The large outbreak from the
smoked sausage could have heightened awareness of
trichinellosis in NRW, which resulted in the identification of
the small outbreak that may have been otherwise unnoticed.
The 52 cases identified in these outbreaks may represent only
a fraction of persons actually infected. The severity of trichinellosis
varies from asymptomatic infection to death; however, only
persons ill enough to seek medical care or their family members
were identified in this investigation. In addition, the approximately
1650 lbs (750 kg) of fresh pork was sufficient to produce an
estimated 10 000-40 000 sausages (W. Lotz, Veterinary
Department, Essen, personal communication, 1999), which
were distributed in at least 10 cities and districts with
approximately 2 million inhabitants. As a result, hundreds
of persons potentially were exposed. Approximately 2% of
controls had symptoms compatible with trichinellosis.
Trichinellosis outbreaks in Europe typically are caused by meat
or meat products distributed locally from a single infected animal
(1-6). In comparison, the smoked sausage outbreak described
in this report was caused by a widely distributed commercial
product made from domestically produced meat and meat
imported from several countries.
The nature of this outbreak reflects a new foodborne outbreak
scenario in which localized outbreaks are replaced by diffuse
outbreaks spread over wide areas (7). These diffuse outbreaks,
which result from low-level contamination of commercial food
products, may not become apparent immediately unless the
pathogen is unusual, such as occurred in this outbreak, or
unless specific surveillance systems are designed to detect
them (7).
In Germany, trichinellosis screening of all pork has been mandatory
since 1937. The extremely low prevalence of Trichinella in pigs
--3 or fewer infected pigs identified among approximately 40 million
pigs slaughtered each year in Germany -- has led to debate about
the need for continued routine testing of all slaughtered pigs. This
outbreak indicates that it may be difficult to maintain a sufficient
sensitivity of screening to prevent all outbreaks under routine
conditions. Screening of meat for _Trichinella_ involves visual
identification of the larvae. The extremely low prevalence of
trichinellosis among pigs may lead to a lack of experience in
identifying positive samples, worker fatigue, and complacency.
Nevertheless, this outbreak demonstrates that modern mass food
production can produce large outbreaks of trichinellosis when
screening is absent or fails.
