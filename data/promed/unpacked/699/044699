I would like to report a possible ergot poisoning in a patient
admitted 20 Feb 2009.

A 24-year-old woman was admitted with areas of necrosis in her thighs
and calves and also gangrene of her labia majora and left forefinger,
middle finger and ring finger. These areas were excised and she has
made a slow but good recovery. Blood results showed a raised WCC
[white cell count] with granulocytosis [raised granulocyte count],
bleeding times were within normal range and her hepatitis screen and
HIV test were negative. There is a lot of Sorghum [millet] grown in
the area and this woman said it was a regular part of her diet.
Previous to this developing she was fit and well with 4 healthy
children. Small vessel vasoconstriction due to ergot poisoning would
explain the symptoms this lady presented in the absence of any other
definitive diagnosis.

[The description of the illness in the above report could be
consistent with a clinical diagnosis of ergot toxicity. While the
"typical" presentation tends to be one of peripheral vasculature
involvement with gangrene/necrosis of digits and distal limbs, the
presentation of a clinical picture with necrotic areas on the thigh
and vulva in addition to the more typical gangrenous lesions on
distal fingertips could well serve as a reminder that not all
patients read the textbooks and present with "typical" findings.

A literature search on ergot poisoning turned up an interesting paper
from 1972 describing the development of collateral vasculature in
those individuals with a more subacute/chronic exposure to ergot, but
radiologic studies demonstrated that vasospasm was documented in
vessels of different sizes, and thereby may well lead to the clinical
findings described in the above case report. (Bagby & Cooper.

It is noteworthy that this year [2009] the rains in East Africa were
delayed. The rains were supposed to have started at the beginning of
March, but this moderator just returned from Kenya, where the 1st
rains began on 29 Mar 2009 while she was there -- almost one month
late. As a result, crop plantings were delayed, the dust level was
high -- conditions that predispose for dispersal of the
ergot-associated fungus.

One wonders whether this is a single isolated case out in the rural
areas of Uganda, or if this is a tip of the iceberg phenomenon, and
there is an outbreak of ergot poisoning in Uganda and possibly
elsewhere in neighboring East African countries, given the climatic
conditions this year. If there is more information from knowledgeable
sources in the region, ProMED would greatly appreciate receiving it.

According to the Church of Uganda Kasiizi website, "The hospital is
situated in south-west Uganda, between Kabale and Rukungiri. It is in
the Kigezi highlands and is about 5300 feet above sea level"

Sorghum ergot caused by the fungus _Claviceps africana_ was 1st
identified in Australia in 1996, and within 6 months had been found
in all sorghum-producing regions in Queensland and New South Wales.
This species is the main cause of sorghum ergot in Africa, Asia and
the Americas.

The disease is readily identified by the honeydew oozing from the
flowers, which is not as sticky as that produced by aphids. The
developing seed is replaced by a fungal growth which eventually
hardens to a creamy-coloured sclerote (ergot). Dry conditions favour
ergot formation. The ergots have been shown to be toxic to cattle,
pigs and chickens. - Mod.DHA

Are livestock in the area dying with toxic symptoms?

The toxic agent belongs to a class of compounds called alkaloids. The
different subclasses of alkaloids cause a variety of clinical signs.
Ergot has several subclasses, those producing neurological signs,
effects on the cardiovascular system and those primarily causing
vasoconstriction.

It is likely the vasoconstriction component that is referred to in
this report. Vasoconstriction is known to affect extremities of the
body, such as noses, toes, fingers and ears. It can result in
gangrene of these extremities, and digits have been known to fall
off. The vasoconstrictive portion of the ergot is not known to affect
highly vascular areas, such as the heart, the lips, the labia major
or regions of the thighs.

Although in some parts of the world sorghum grains are used for human
consumption it is more often products or by-products of sorghum that
are eaten. One has to ask if this person was forced to eat it because
nothing else was available, or if some other agent is responsible for
these clinical signs?

If starvation and food shortage has caused the consumption of
substandard grain products or products meant for animals, then one
has to wonder why this is not being reported more often. Is it that
people are not going to a physician or is because physicians are not
reporting it? Certainly, surgery on the affected areas is not likely
to be cheap, so then we return to the original question of why was
the person consuming infected grain? The situation needs a thorough
epidemiological investigation. - Mod.TG]
