A total of 11 people have been in contact with an anthrax infected cow in the village of Takach, according to Dr Dimitar Kostov, director of RZI-Shumen. The men participated in the slaughter of animals at the end of last week [8 or 9 Jun 2012]. According to Dr Kostov a single case of cutaneous anthrax has been confirmed in a male patient in Shumen hospital. He is currently in a stable condition. The other 10 people were given antibiotics for prevention, with instructions to take them for 8 days.

In Izvurshva village more than 1000 animals have been vaccinated by the Agency for Food Safety. "A private veterinary practitioner failed to inform state authorities about the case in Takach and his detailed explanation has been requested," commented Dr Katya Dimitrova, director of the Food Safety Agency in Shumen. In her words, "When the results of the surveyed meat at the Reference Laboratory in Sofia are available in a few and all will become clear."

Nobody had consumed meat from infected cows in the village of kaolinovskoto Takach. That said, a 40 year old man was placed yesterday in Shumen hospital with suspected anthrax. He had rash lesions on his hands after contact with meat from the slaughtered animal. His condition is good, and is under antibiotic treatment.

The animal was slaughtered on Friday [8 Jun 2012], attended by 11 villagers. The carcass of the infected animal is being rendered. Samples of meat were sent to the national diagnostic laboratory in Sofia. "The results will be known within a few days," said Dr Katya Dimitrova, director of the Food Safety Agency in Shumen.

[There are a number of anomalies in these reports. It usually takes some 3-4 days minimum before any skin lesions develop, and as this animal was probably butchered just before the weekend there would not have been much of a carcass left if identification of the problem followed the clinical onset of the human case. The nature of veterinary involvement before, during, or after slaughter is unclear, but probably minimal from the official comments. They were fortunate to have some bits available to be sent for confirmation in Sofia. I suspect that the human case was diagnosed clinically and not as a result of any laboratory action as the Food Agency officer is still awaiting veterinary laboratory confirmation. Thus why this has been posted as a "suspect" case for the moment.

Anthrax is sporadic in Bulgarian livestock, affecting both cattle, sheep and goats, largely in Ruse and Yambol in north east Bulgaria. To see a map of Bulgaria, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/bulgaria.jpg
