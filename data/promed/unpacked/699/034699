The Taoyuan City Health Bureau has received notifications since late December 2022, that people in Daxi District have been infected with legionnaire's disease. As of 3 Jan 2023, of 12 suspected cases of legionnaire's disease, a total of 11 were confirmed. One case is still under examination, the but initial investigation revealed [cases] have a geographical relationship [with other cases].

The Health Bureau stated that [before this notification of] the 12 suspected cases of legionnaires' disease, they had previously gone to investigate (twice) together with the CDC and conducted sampling tests on the surrounding environment of Daxi and household water [supply]. They continued to expand the sampling and follow-up inspection of water mist facilities in the surrounding environment, [tracking] results and [caring] about the health status of the individuals.

The Health Bureau went to Daxi District again yesterday [2 Jan 2023] to give explanations and health education to the residents, and sent staff to set up a dedicated telephone line at the Daxi District Health Center to facilitate local people's [queries], calling on medical institutions to strengthen TOCC [?] consultation and epidemic situation [reporting]. [After that], health education briefing sessions will be arranged again in the future to strengthen community residents' health education and to prevent misconceptions. In addition, the Environmental Protection Bureau has also completed community environmental disinfection operations.

[Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby on Broad Street who were near, but never entered, the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred during a Pennsylvania legionnaires' convention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

The news article above reports 11 confirmed cases and 1 suspected case of legionnaires' disease, linked by geographic location (Daxi District). We are not given additional information. Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates from the 11 confirmed cases match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Daxi District is located in the southern portion of Taoyuan City, Taiwan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daxi_District). It is about 35 km (21.7 mi) southwest of Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. A map showing the location of the Daxi District can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Daxi+District,+Taoyuan+City,+Taiwan+335.

More information on this cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in Taoyuan City would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
