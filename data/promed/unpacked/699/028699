A total of 280 measles cases was registered in Heihe province of
China since April of this year [2010]. The Amur department of
Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for Protection of Customer
Rights and Human Welfare] advises against crossing the border into
China without adequate measles vaccination.

The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
Blagoveshensk announced that there is no issue of border closure yet.

The government of the Amur region requested information on measles
morbidity from Chinese officials in Heihe soon after the 1st cases of
measles were registered locally. There has been no official reply;
however it was communicated orally that there are no measles cases in
Heihe city, but there are some cases in the region. Rospotrebnadzor
staff report that the Heihe government web-site indicates that 280
measles cases have been recorded in Heihe region.

Russian epidemiologists believe that the H1 subtype present in the
Amur region originates from China, because it has been circulating there.

There have been 54-57 measles cases in the [Amur] region so far, and
48 of them have been laboratory confirmed. 14 000 people have been
vaccinated against measles as a consequence.

[This travel alert should be heeded by travellers of all
nationalities intending to enter China by this route. In 2007 (see
below), an outbreak of measles occurred in the adjacent Primorsky
Krai, which also involved travellers crossing the border from China.

The Amur region [oblast] is a federal subject of Russia about 8000 km
(5000 miles) east of Moscow on the banks of the Amur and Zeya Rivers.
It shares its border with the People's Republic of China in the
south. A map and description of the Amur oblast can be accessed at
