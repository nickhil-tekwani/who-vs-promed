King Fahd hospital in Jeddah was a scene of chaos on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014] after 7 of its medical staff were feared to have contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Al-Madinah reported Wednesday [2 Apr 2014].

An official source said 3 female nurses who were suspected to have contracted the virus were sent to Erfan and Bagedo Hospital, where they were quarantined in separate rooms until the results of the laboratory tests were known.

He said 3 other doctors and an Asian female nurse were also suspected to have fallen victim to the virus after they complained of high fever and breathing difficulties.

The official said vaccines against all epidemics were given to all the hospital's staff.

A source at King Abdulaziz Hospital said the Saudi nurse who contracted the virus days after his wedding was still confined to the ICU.

He said tests on his uncle, who had been accompanying him, had come out negative.

The official said the hospital had distributed masks and gloves among its employees as part of preventive measures it was taking against the virus. "We organized a symposium about the virus that was attended by a large number of doctors and nurses," he said.

Dr. Sami Badawood, director of Jeddah Health Affairs, said a team of consultants and specialists was following up [on the nurse with confirmed infection's] condition and added that he is receiving daily reports about him.

He said the male nurse was the 1st Saudi to fall victim to the virus in Jeddah.

He said the hospital's staff, especially those who interact with patients regularly, were examined and were found to be free from the virus.

[The most recent global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by WHO is 207 cases including 87 deaths (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (22): UAE, WHO 20140401.2373381). This tally does not include the 3 cases reported on the MOH website today (3 Apr 2014) (see part [1] of this update) which will bring the global tally to 210 cases including 87 deaths. .

ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Ziad Memish, Deputy Minister of Public Health of Saudi Arabia for providing information confirming that the 26 year old male reported on the MOH website on 28 Mar 2014 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (21): Saudi Arabia 20140328.2364957), is the same individual as the 26 year old male healthcare worker reported in today's (3 Apr 2014) report on the MOH website. Dr. Memish also mentioned that it is not clear that the case is nosocomial and investigation is ongoing on possible risk factors outside the hospital.

In the above posted media report (see [3] above), there is mention of 7 suspected cases of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare workers in Jeddah. There have been media reports which have turned out to be false alarms. ProMED-mail will continue to report on laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection but recommends caution in assuming that these are cases of MERS-CoV infection until they are confirmed.
