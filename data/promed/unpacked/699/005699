Cluster of listeriosis cases in France
--------------------------------------
A cluster of 8 cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection with the same
serotype and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile has been
identified by the surveillance scheme operated by the Institut de Veille
Sanitaire (National Institute for Health Surveillance) and the National
Listeria Reference Center at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, since 29 May 2002.
The first 2 strains were isolated in week 22 (27 May-2 June), 2 more were
isolated in week 23 (3-9 June), and 4 were isolated in week 24 (10-16
June). Seven of these 8 patients presented with infection of the central
nervous system and 1 with bacteremia; 5 patients had underlying medical
conditions or were being treated with immunosuppressants, and so were at
risk for listeriosis. One of these 5 patients has died. Five of the 8 cases
were from 2 departments (Moselle and Bas-Rhin) in eastern France, and the
others are in 3 different departments [see map of cases on the
Eurosurveillance Weekly website - Mod.MPP].
The coordinating committee for listeria investigations was mobilized to
coordinate investigations, which included the obtaining of food histories
of cases, the analysis of the supply channels of products on sale in shops
where the patients had bought food in order to identify common suppliers,
sampling of foods from these shops and from the patients' refrigerators,
and screening for the epidemic clone among strains isolated from food
products in France since January 2002. German health authorities have been
informed and asked to identify any cases that could possibly be linked to
this outbreak close to the German border.
The main vehicle for transmission has been identified as spreadable
sausage, a ready-to-eat food prepared from raw pork and fat. Among its
collection of strains isolated from foods and food plants, the National
Reference Center identified a strain with the same characteristics as the
outbreak strain. This strain had been isolated from an unopened package of
spreadable sausage produced by a manufacturer in eastern France. Of the 7
patients for whom this information was available, 5 reported having eaten
this type of product.
On 2 Jul 2002, the manufacturer recalled this spreadable sausage product.
On 3 Jul 2002, all pork products from this manufacturer were withdrawn from
the market. These products include different meat products sold under the
brand names Stoeffler, Dulano, and Claude Leger, and specific supermarket
chain brands. All these products bear the establishment number 67-348-02.
On the same day, a notification was sent to all member states of the
European Union through the Rapid Alert System For Food (RASFF). Analysis of
export distribution channels for the products is continuing.
Consumers have been advised to throw away the affected products, or return
them to the point of purchase. Since the risk of developing listeria
infection after eating a contaminated product is very low, people who have
eaten the implicated product have been informed that they do not need any
special medical evaluation or treatment, even if they are in high risk
groups. Nevertheless, people have been advised that if they develop fever
(or fever accompanied by headache) within 2 months of eating the product,
they should consult a doctor, and inform him or her about this exposure.
Case surveillance is continuing. Because of the [potentially - Mod.LL] long
incubation period (between 4 days and as long as 2 months [or more -
Mod.LL]), cases may continue to occur and be reported for several weeks
after a thorough product recall.
The role of food in transmission of listeriosis in humans was established
in the 1980s, when around 1000 new cases were seen in France each year.
Subsequent changes made in agriculture and the food industry have reduced
the annual number of cases to under 300.

[This cluster of listeriosis demonstrates, once again, that (1) sporadic
cases of the disease can be linked to others by aggressive epidemiological
investigations; and (2) the widespread marketing of a prepared food product
is an excellent method of spreading enteric pathogens. - Mod.LL]
