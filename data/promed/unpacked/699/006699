Cibo Specialty Foods, a division of Colavita USA, LLC of Linden, NJ,
is voluntarily recalling the following olive products sold under the
"DAL RACCOLTO" brand. Immediately stop using the product. Testing of
the products in question has revealed that specific products had pH
and water activity that exceed the levels necessary to control
botulism. Therefore, with the knowledge of the FDA, Cibo Specialty
Foods is recalling:
DAL RACCOLTO "Italian Colossal Olives," Lot G062, packed in 4.18 lb. glass jars
DAL RACCOLTO "Natural Cerignola Olives," Lot G062, packed in 4.18 lb.
glass jars
DAL RACCOLTO "Black Cerignola Olives, " Lots G009 & G066, packed in 2.5 kg tins
DAL RACCOLTO "Red Cerignola Olives," Lot G046, packed in 4.18 lb. glass jars
DAL RACCOLTO "Green Cerignola Olives," Lot G062, packed in 4.18 lb. glass jars
DAL RACCOLTO "Baresana Olives," Lot G198, packed in 11 lb. plastic tubs
DAL RACCOLTO "Nocellara Olives," Lots G216 & G217, packed in 11 lb.
plastic tubs
DAL RACCOLTO "Calabrese Olives," Lot G198, packed in 11 lb. plastic tubs
The items are packed in 4.18 lb, 2.5 kg, and 11 lb size containers,
and are sold primarily to the foodservice trade (e.g., restaurants,
restaurant distributors and other foodservice institutions). Any
establishments or individual consumers that may have purchased any of
these products should discard them immediately, even though the
product may appear to be normal. You cannot tell if the product
harbors botulism by sight, taste or smell.
This recall is precautionary; there have been no reported cases of
botulism from these products.
Distribution of these products have been suspended as FDA and the
company continue their investigation.

[This is the 2nd recall of olives this week regarding botulism risk.
Many food product recalls that are botulism-related, as this one is,
involve inadequate preparation conditions that would predispose to
the production of the disease neurotoxin, not necessarily the finding
of the toxin in the food.
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. - Mod.LL]
