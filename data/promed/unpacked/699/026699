_Fusarium proliferatum_ Pathogenic on Onion Bulbs in Washington.
L. J. du Toit and D. A. Inglis, Washington State University-Mount Vernon
REU, 16650 State Route 536, Mount Vernon 98273; and G. Q. Pelter,
Washington State University-Grant Adams Extension Office, P.O. Box 37, 1st
and C Street, Ephrata 98823. Plant Dis. 87:750, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0409-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 31 March 2003.
Isolations from the discolored areas of the dry scales onto water agar and
PDA yielded fungal colonies characteristic of _F. proliferatum_ [Fp] (3).
The isol_Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cepae_ and an unidentified _Fusarium_
species have been reported to cause bulb rot of onion (_Allium cepa_ L.) in
Washington (1).
In August and September 2002, a salmon-pink discoloration was observed on
the outer 3 to 4 layers of dry scales of approximately 20 percent of white
onion bulbs of cv. Cometa F1, in each of two 20-acre fields in the Columbia
Basin of central Washington. Isolations from the discolored areas of the
dry scales onto water agar and PDA yielded fungal colonies characteristic
of Fp. The isolates formed long, V-shaped chains of microconidia on
polyphialides.
Pathogenicity of the isolates of Fp was tested on white onion bulbs
purchased at a local grocery store. The outermost dry scales of each bulb
were removed, and the bulb was inoculated by 1 of 3 methods: (i) a 5 cubic
mm section of the fleshy scales was removed using a scalpel, the wound was
filled with a 3 square mm plug of PDA colonized by Fp, the plug was covered
with the section of scale that had been removed, and the inoculation site
was covered with Parafilm; (ii) the basal plate of the bulb was dipped into
a suspension of 1 million microconidia per ml; or (iii) the basal plate was
dipped into the spore suspension after wounding by inserting a dissecting
needle into the bulb to a depth of 1 cm. A noninoculated bulb provided a
control treatment.
Bulbs were incubated in a moist chamber at 13Â°C and examined for
discoloration of the outer scales and development of bulb rot. After 2
weeks, salmon-pink discoloration of the outer scales was observed at the
inoculation site for both methods of dip inoculation, but not for the plug
inoculation method.
After 3 weeks, water-soaked, tan to golden, shrunken, soft tissue was
observed on the remainder of each dip-inoculated bulb, but symptoms of
basal rot did not develop. Symptoms were similar to those reported in Idaho
for a bulb rot of stored onions caused by Fp (2).
One of the nonwounded inoculated bulbs did not develop a bulb rot, but
pinkish discoloration was observed beneath the outer scales and in the
neck. Fp was reisolated from the inoculated bulb tissues. The discoloration
observed on the white onions raised concern about the potential for
infection to develop into bulb rot in storage. However, thorough curing of
the bulbs immediately upon storage restricted infection to the outer dry
scales.
Similar symptoms were observed at harvest on the bulbs of other white
onions in a cultivar trial located near Quincy, WA, although symptoms were
not observed on yellow or red cultivars in the trial. The same symptoms
were later observed on approximately 70 percent of bulbs harvested from a
32-acre fresh-market crop of the cv. Sterling in the Columbia Basin. These
symptomatic bulbs were rejected for the fresh market.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of infection of onion bulbs by
Fp in Washington, which in 2001, had the third largest acreage on onions in
the United States after California and Oregon (USDA National Agricultural
Statistics Service).

onion. Proper storage and curing can reduce bulb rot incidence and maintain
