67 people are suffering from suspected salmonella poisoning after purchasing questionable kebabs from a food vendor in Kaliningrad, Russia's consumer rights watchdog has said.

Of this number, 64 people are in moderately severe condition, while 3 people have been placed in intensive care, watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said in a statement, Itar-Tass reported on Tue 25 Mar 2014.

The mass poisoning can traced back to the same point of sale in Kaliningrad, where examinations of the outlet have revealed sanitary violations, high microbial contamination, and the presence of _E. coli_ in its food products.

A laboratory study has confirmed the presence of salmonellae in 36 of the known cases, which were 1st reported on 22 Mar 2014.

This is the 2nd such instance of mass food poisoning in Kaliningrad in 2014. In January 2014, 17 people fell ill after eating sushi rolls at a Japanese-Uzbek restaurant, of which 14 were hospitalized with salmonellosis.

[It is probable that the source of the organism in the kebab was undercooked meat, either beef or chicken, but it is possible that contamination occurred after cooking.
