Confirmation that New Zealand wheat has developed resistance to fungicides controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB), or speckled leaf blotch, is another blow for wheat growers.

The Foundation for Arable Research (FAR) confirmed the disease had developed resistance to a fungicide group which had been most effective in controlling it, strobilurins (incl. azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, fluoxastrobin, picoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin). FAR said the disease had been increasing in severity for the past 4 years.

Federated Farmers' David Clark said he had already seen losses of 2 or 3 tonnes a hectare this [2014] season [and] expects [the disease] to spread throughout the industry. He said the industry was struggling to find an alternative fungicide and wheat growers should look hard at growing cultivars that had better resistance to the disease.

Federated Farmers' Colin Hurst said [the] findings were "quite a shock really. We'll obviously focus on some of the newer resistant varieties to keep the yields up."

FAR's Nick Poole said growers were being advised to rethink disease management. "There will have to be greater emphasis on integrated disease management (IDM)." He said the [strobilurin] resistance also highlighted the importance of the new succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides, which were unaffected by strobilurin resistance. The industry would need to protect the activity of fungicides by not exceeding the recommended maximum applications.

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Septoria is considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in the UK and other parts of Europe.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.

Earlier in 2014, septoria developing fungicide resistance was reported for the 1st time in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20140313.2329774). It is not clear whether the 2 occurrences in the region are connected.

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally safe and are used against most major fungal crop diseases. Therefore, pathogen resistance is of major concern to many primary industries worldwide. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides are used to extend the useful life of the compounds.
