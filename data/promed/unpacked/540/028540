Abstract
Background
_Culex (Culex) tritaeniorhynchus_ is an important vector of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) affecting feral pigs, native mammals and humans. The mosquito species is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe, and thought to be absent in Australia.

Methods
In February and May, 2020 the Medical Entomology unit of the Northern Territory (NT) Top End Health Service collected _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ female specimens (n = 19) from the Darwin and Katherine regions. Specimens were preliminarily identified morphologically as the Vishnui subgroup in subgenus _Culex_. Molecular identification was performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcoding, including sequence percentage identity using BLAST and tree-based identification using maximum likelihood analysis in the IQ-TREE software package. Once identified using COI, specimens were reanalysed for diagnostic morphological characters to inform a new taxonomic key to related species from the NT.

Results
Sequence percentage analysis of COI revealed that specimens from the NT shared 99.7% nucleotide identity to a haplotype of _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ from Dili, Timor-Leste. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the NT specimens formed a monophyletic clade with other _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We provide COI barcodes for most NT species from the Vishnui subgroup to aid future identifications, including the first genetic sequences for _Culex (Culex) crinicauda_ and the undescribed species _Culex (Culex) sp. No. 32_ of Marks. Useful diagnostic morphological characters were identified and are presented in a taxonomic key to adult females to separate _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ from other members of the Vishnui subgroup from the NT.

Conclusions
We report the detection of _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ in Australia from the Darwin and Katherine regions of the NT. The vector is likely to be already established in northern Australia, given the wide geographical spread throughout the Top End of the NT. The establishment of _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ in Australia is a concern to health officials as the species is an important vector of JEV and is now the 6th species from the subgenus _Culex_ capable of vectoring JEV in Australia. We suggest that the species must now be continuously monitored during routine mosquito surveillance programmes to determine its current geographical spread and prevent the potential transmission of exotic JEV throughout Australia.

[It is going to be interesting to see how geographically widely _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ becomes established, now that it has become introduced into Australia. The likelihood that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) would be introduced into Australia and become established is an open question. The full article mentions in the discussion, "Recent vector competence testing has shown that possums and the black flying fox _Pteropus alecto_ are potential amplifying hosts for JEV in Australia, compared to those considered to be poor hosts, such as the eastern grey kangaroos, agile wallabies and tammar wallabies [22, 47, 48, 49]. Van den Hurk et al. [3] suggested that flying foxes could play a prominent role in the transmission of JEV into northern Australia, since thousands of individuals migrate to Australia from Torres Strait and New Guinea where the virus is more prevalent. Future vector competency testing should be conducted to assess whether JEV could be spread by other Australian members of the Vishnui subgroup, including _Culex sp. No. 32_ of Marks. It will be interesting as well to see if it begins to transmit other mosquito-born viruses that are endemic there, such as Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses, which are related to JEV. - Mod.TY
