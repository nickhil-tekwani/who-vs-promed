Results of surveillance for infections with Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) of serotype O104:H4 after the large outbreak in Germany, July to December 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Frank C, Milde-Busch A, Werber D]

A large outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) occurred in Germany in 2011 [1-3]. It was caused by a rare serotype O104:H4, positive for a Shiga toxin 2 gene (stx2), negative for stx1 and intimin (eae), [some characteristics of an enteroaggregative pathotype - Mod.LL] and a carrier of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) antibiotic resistance trait [4-6]. More than 20 per cent of the recognized outbreak cases developed the life threatening post-diarrheal sequela of hemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Considering the large number of ensuing outbreak cases of HUS, this was the largest known Shiga toxin-associated outbreak worldwide.

Uncharacteristically for these infections, mostly adults were affected by all disease types (that is, both gastroenteritis only and that complicated by HUS). Consumption of fenugreek sprouted seeds was identified as the most likely source of infection for primary outbreak cases [1]. Particularly later in the outbreak, person-to-person transmission and foodborne outbreaks associated with infected food handlers [7] also took place. Cases also occurred in other countries than Germany, but the majority of such cases, as well as most German cases, were associated with residence or temporary stay in the north of Germany; in France a satellite outbreak occurred in June 2011, also attributed to consumption of fenugreek sprouts [8]. The outbreak peaked on 22 May 2011. After a lapse of 3 weeks without newly diagnosed cases, the outbreak was declared over after 4 Jul 2011.

Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ (STEC, also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ or EHEC) infection is reportable in Germany and is diagnosed predominantly by nonculture tests. In addition, clinical diagnosis of 'enteropathic', that is, post-diarrheal HUS is separately reportable. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national level infectious disease surveillance hub, coordinated an intensified post-outbreak surveillance for additional 'post-outbreak' cases of the infection arising from 5 Jul through 31 Dec 2011. The primary goal of this surveillance was to verify the absence of post-outbreak cases of the infection associated with sprout consumption and to receive early warning of a potential resurgence of the outbreak. Also the study aimed to assess, whether the outbreak strain had managed to establish itself in the German environment, continuing to cause new infections. Results of this post-outbreak surveillance are presented here. We analysed post-outbreak cases ascertained in the German surveillance system for infectious diseases by clinical presentation, period of disease onset and their likely context of exposure.

Methods
-------
Analysis rested on the regular legally-prescribed notification of laboratory-confirmed (at least finding of Stx or stx-gene in the laboratory, serotyping information is optional) cases of EHEC-gastroenteritis, or cases of gastroenteritis with an epidemiological (exposure) connection to a laboratory-confirmed case of EHEC gastroenteritis. In addition, cases of enteropathic HUS are notified separately as clinical entities, optionally supported by laboratory confirmation of EHEC. Cases of HUS are only counted as such (not as EHEC gastroenteritis). Cases notified to local health departments are then passed on electronically via the federal states to the national level database hosted by the RKI [9]. In addition, during the months following the outbreak until year's [2011] end, a small paper questionnaire was filled in addition to the case notification, based on local health departments' interviews with the cases, and sent on to the RKI. The questionnaire focused on food exposures (analysed here was sprout consumption only) and contacts to previously infected persons. Occupational exposures (in a laboratory or a healthcare environment) were related to the RKI spontaneously, whenever health departments considered this the most likely context of exposure.

As completeness of laboratory diagnosis with respect to the outbreak strain varied, cases were grouped by the quality of microbiological evidence of infection with the outbreak strain (serotype O104:H4, stx2 positive, stx1 negative, eae negative, ESBL positive) into 'confirmed', 'probable' and 'possible'. Timewise, as the outbreak was declared over as of 5 Jul 2011, cases considered to be post-outbreak cases were those with disease onset from 5 Jul through 31 Dec 2011, or -- if a date of onset was unknown or the case asymptomatic -- those notified to the local authorities in calendar weeks 29 through 52 of 2011 (data as of 16 Jul 2012).

- Confirmed post-outbreak cases had infections with the chimeric EHEC O104 (serogroup reported) for which microbiological details (regarding stx-type, eae, and ESBL status), if available, were compatible with the outbreak strain, irrespective of clinical presentation (HUS, gastroenteritis without HUS or asymptomatic).
- Probable post-outbreak cases had EHEC-infections without serogroup information, but for which microbiological details (regarding stx-type, eae, and ESBL status), if available, were compatible with the outbreak strain, irrespective of clinical presentation (HUS, gastroenteritis without HUS or asymptomatic), only if they were contact persons to known outbreak cases or confirmed post-outbreak cases.
- Possible post-outbreak cases were other cases of post-diarrhoeal HUS among adults (age greater or equal to 18 years) without known serogroup, but with microbiological details (regarding stx-type, eae, and ESBL status), if available, compatible with an infection with the outbreak strain.

We excluded infections with EHEC O104 where available microbiological details (stx1 positivity, eae positivity, ESBL negativity) argued against infection with the outbreak strain, but briefly describe them below.

Results
-------
We ascertained 33 post-outbreak cases according to the criteria outlined above. Confirmed were 22, consisting of 17 post-outbreak cases of gastroenteritis, but none of HUS, and 5 asymptomatic post-outbreak cases of EHEC O104 infection. In addition, there were 3 symptomatic (2 cases of gastroenteritis only, 1 with HUS) and 4 asymptomatic probable post-outbreak cases. 4 HUS cases among adults were counted as possible post-outbreak cases (Table 1 -- for tables and figures, see source URL above - Mod.LL)

A total of 3 people infected with an EHEC O104 strain were identified and not included in the study because microbiological findings were not compatible with infection with the outbreak strain: 2 infections were with ESBL-negative strains of EHEC O104, and were in part already briefly mentioned elsewhere [10]. These were detected in adult residents of Germany after their return from travel to Turkey. Another case of gastroenteritis was caused by a stx1-only positive EHEC O104 strain in a small child.

The majority of the 33 post-outbreak cases (Table 1, Figure 1) were female (n=20) and adults (n=26); 19 of the 24 symptomatic post-outbreak cases had disease onset from 5 Jul 2011 through 4 Sep 2011 and 5 from 5 Sep 2011 through 6 Nov 2011 -- none occurred thereafter. In terms of geographical distribution, 27 of the 33 post-outbreak cases resided in the 6 German states most affected by the outbreak (Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein). 2/3 of the infections were likely caused by direct or indirect (laboratory workers) contact with recognized outbreak cases (Table 2). For the remainder (1/3) the context of exposure remained unclear. Among them, 7 arose from the most affected states. None of the post-outbreak cases recalled sprout consumption.

Included among the 33 post-outbreak cases were four with secondary (2 staff, 1 fellow patient, 1 relative, who washed the index patient's soiled clothes at home) and two with tertiary infections (household contacts of the aforementioned secondary cases) in a nosocomial cluster associated with a colonoscopy performed on an elderly woman. All had gastroenteritis, but not HUS. The primary patient was an outbreak gastroenteritis case (disease onset in early June 2011), who apparently was still shedding EHEC O104:H4 at the time of the procedure. Also included are 3 independently arising post-outbreak cases of gastroenteritis caused by EHEC O104 in laboratory workers handling stools presumptively containing EHEC O104.

Discussion
----------
The 2011 EHEC O104:H4 outbreak was the most severe documented foodborne outbreak in Germany. It was accompanied by heightened anxiety and put a tremendous strain on the medical care system, especially nephrological treatment capacities [11,12] and on public health resources. In consequence, after the declared end of the outbreak the RKI continued enhanced surveillance in order to quickly discover new flare-ups of the infection.

During the surveillance period, 22 confirmed post-outbreak cases occurred where infection with the outbreak strain was either confirmed or at least likely. In addition 7 probable and four possible post-outbreak cases were notified in Germany. Most of these post-outbreak cases were household contacts to outbreak cases but for some the transmission route remained unclear. None of the post-outbreak cases remembered sprout consumption. Frequency of new post-outbreak cases was highest in the 2 months after the outbreak and then petered out in the autumn, with the last confirmed post-outbreak case patient's disease onset in the first half of October (week 41). The post-outbreak cases identified largely matched outbreak cases in terms of the predominance of adults and the female sex, and in terms of main occurrence in the area most affected by the outbreak [2]. This outcome may at least partially reflect the surveillance, which was likely more intense in the outbreak area and more frequently resulted in extended microbiological examination of outbreak cases' contacts. The data demonstrate the potential of O104 to be secondarily transmitted after long time periods -- with some post-outbreak secondary cases occurring 2 to 3 months after disease onset (and clinical recovery) of the last known potential primary outbreak case. None of the confirmed post-outbreak cases developed HUS, but completeness of microbiological information on adult HUS cases remained problematic, even in the aftermath of the outbreak.

From the reported frequency of clearly outbreak-unrelated infections with isolated stx1-positive EHEC (regardless of serotype) an overall increased testing volume for EHEC especially in the outbreak area, and especially in adults (Figure 2), can be gleamed. Testing frequency returned back to normal levels by the end of 2011 for adults, and even earlier in minors (less than 18 years of age). The capacity to detect infections with the outbreak strain is hampered by the incomplete serotyping of detected EHEC (according to the German national database of mandatorily notifiable infections, 29 per cent of EHEC infections notified in 2012 in Germany were serotyped [9]). In 2012 and 2013, 3 further confirmed infections with EHEC O104 were reported in Germany [9]. In the summer of 2012, an adult woman developed bloody diarrhea 2 days after returning from Turkey -- regrettably the ESBL-status of the infecting EHEC O104-strain was not determined. In 2013 2 diarrheal EHEC cases without travel history (a young boy and an adult woman) were notified as infected with different serotypes (O104:H7, O104:H21).

Importantly, the presented data do not support the notion that the outbreak strain has been able to establish itself in the German environment (which in turn could have been the source of further outbreaks). Just after the outbreak, this scenario had been a concern based on the observation that the outbreak strain can enter a viable but non-culturable state from which it can be resuscitated [13].

Regarding clinical picture, there was no post-outbreak case of HUS among the 17 confirmed symptomatic cases and only one among the 20 symptomatic post-outbreak cases that were either confirmed or probable. This contrasts with a stable proportion of 20 per cent of the symptomatic outbreak cases developing this complication [2]. This finding may suggest a somewhat lower virulence of the outbreak strain in this period -- possibly associated with the predominating non-alimentary uptake route or a weakening of the pathogen by passage. At the same time, many household transmissions, the post-outbreak cases among laboratory personnel and the nosocomial cluster demonstrate prolonged periods, during which secondary infections with the pathogen occurred. This is in line with long periods of shedding of EHEC O104:H4 in outbreak cases, whereby shedding in an isolated case lasted longer than 7 months [14].

Sprout consumption was not recalled as a potential source of infection by any of the post-outbreak cases. Although fenugreek sprouts constitute a notoriously hard-to-remember food item, recall in the post-outbreak period would have been aided by the public announcement that these constituted the most likely source of infection in the outbreak. Also supporting the post-outbreak cases' stated non-consumption of sprouts is that for much of the post-outbreak period raw sprouts would hardly have been available in retail.

The 2 cases infected with non-outbreak related ESBL-negative EHEC O104:H4 strains in 2011 are intriguing, with both patients having likely acquired this infection in Turkey. In September 2011 in France infections with a similar strain were noted in a group of people who had been in Turkey as tourists [10]. Together with the stx1-only positive EHEC O104:H4 strain isolated from a child, these cases demonstrate existing variety among clinically relevant EHEC O104:H4.

A clinical surveillance of HUS has in the past proven very valuable in flagging EHEC-associated disease outbreaks [15] and also gave 1st notice of this outbreak. For diarrhoeal illness, German EHEC surveillance is mainly based on nonculture methods, which have the ability to quickly identify EHEC [16]. However, strain information conveyed by most nonculture tests currently used in Germany is rudimental (Stx presence) and does not provide the relevant information to guide clinical management and epidemiological decisions.

Characteristics of the enteroaggregative Shiga toxin/verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain causing the outbreak of HUS in Germany, May to June 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Scheutz F, Moeller Nielsen E, Frimodt-Moeller J, Boisen N, Morabito S, Tozzoli R, et al]

The _E. coli_ strain causing a large outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome and bloody diarrhea in Germany in May and June 2011 possesses an unusual combination of pathogenic features typical ofm as is described below:

The outbreak strain
-------------------
The Danish isolates were PCR-positive for the aggR gene, which is typical of enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAggEC). Further analysis showed that the outbreak strain (1st 8 isolates from Danish patients) were also positive for the following genes: sigA, sepA, pic, aatA, aaiC, aap, as well as aggA, which encodes the major component of the AAF/I adhesin. AAF/I is a fimbrial organelle usually associated with a strong ability to form biofilms and haemagglutination with human erythrocytes. Preliminary testing at WHO CC showed that the isolates were moderate to good biofilm producers particularly in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.45 per cent glucose, which is typical and defining for EAggEC strains. The outbreak strain was a typical _E. coli_: lactose-positive, sorbitol-fermenting and beta-glucuronidase-positive. Furthermore, the strain was positive for iutA encoding an aerobactin receptor found in 80 per cent of extraintestinal pathogenic _E. coli_ isolated from urosepsis [2] and negative for the STEC-associated adhesin (saa) and cytotoxin subtilase (subAB).

Taken together, these data indicate that the outbreak strain is indeed a typical EAggEC strain that has acquired the bacteriophage encoding Stx/VT. Using a novel protocol for subtyping of stx/vtx genes [3], we have shown that the gene encoding Stx/VT is stx2a/vtx2a.

Sequence analysis of the published stx2a/vtx2a sequence (SRX067313 on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) showed 100 per cent amino acid identity of the holotoxin to Stx2a/VT2a from _E. coli_ O157:H7 EDL933 isolated from Michigan ground beef in 1983 (accession number X07865 [4]) but differed by one nucleotide at position 867 (C instead of T), making the nucleotide sequence identical to the sequence found in sorbitol-fermenting O157 strains from Germany in 2002 and 2005 (accession numbers AY143336 and AY143337, unpublished), DQ231589 and DQ231590 [5], and Scotland in 2006 (EU526759) [6]. This sequence variant of stx2a/vtx2a has also been detected in isolates from seagulls (accession number AB030484, unpublished) and human isolates of different serotypes: _E. coli_ O121:H19 from Canada (DQ143182 and DQ143183) (7) and Idaho, USA (EF441611) [8], and O111:H8 also from Idaho, USA (EF441606) [8].

These findings could explain the unexpectedly high level of virulence in a STEC/VTEC strain negative for the attaching/effacing pathogenicity island. It is indeed conceivable that the enteroaggregative adherence phenotype could have allowed these _E. coli_ O104 strains to colonize the intestinal mucosa of the affected patients as efficiently as the typical eae-positive STEC/VTEC strains. The different mechanism of adhesion might also explain why this strain is more likely to cause severe disease in adults rather than in children, as would be usual for typical HUS-associated STEC/VTEC: adults and children might differ in their susceptibility to the adherence and/or colonization properties of this type of EAggEC strain. Obviously, elucidating this aspect requires dedicated studies, and we cannot exclude that the different rates of HUS between adults and children observed in the current outbreak just reflect a difference in the exposures.
