U.S. lab tests confirm that Singapore researcher had SARS
--------------------------------
Samples from an ill Singapore researcher have tested positive for SARS at
an American laboratory, confirming earlier results showing the man had the
potentially deadly disease, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said Sunday.
The results of the tests by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention were released at a charity event on Saturday, said the
spokewoman, Bey Mui Leng.
The 27-year-old medical researcher had already tested positive for SARS in
2 local tests.
The World Health Organization has said it appeared to be an isolated case
and does not signal a new SARS epidemic. It is believed that the man caught
SARS from live virus samples in one of 2 labs he worked in.
Singapore reported the case -- its first in 4 months -- on Monday [8 Sep
2003], making the city-state the first country to announce a new [case]
since the WHO declared SARS under control in July [2003].
The infected man, who's name has not been released, is in isolation at Tan
Tock Seng Hospital's Communicable Diseases Center. He no longer has a fever
and is said to be recovering well.
25 friends, colleagues and relatives of the man are under 10 days'
compulsory home quarantine as a precaution.
Bey also said that one of two WHO officials arrived in Singapore on
Saturday as part of a team that will review safety procedures at both labs
to try and determine how the man caught the virus.
The 10-member team -- comprised of the WHO experts, local officials and
representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will
begin work Monday. It is headed by Dr. Anthony Della-porta, an Australian
bio-safety expert who is expected to arrive in Singapore Sunday, Bey said.
Singapore recorded 33 deaths from 239 infected with the virus. Globally,
the disease killed over 900 and sickened more than 8,400.

[In the prior ProMED-mail posting (SARS - worldwide (172): Singapore,
probable case 20030910.2276) , pending issues included confirmation of
laboratory findings by an independent international laboratory. According
to this newswire, this has been completed by the USA Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. As has been stated in prior postings, it does not
appear as though this isolated incident is heralding a return of
transmission of the SARS coronavirus (Co-V) at this time, if none of the
patient's contacts develop illness associated with SARS Co-V infection (as
the diagnosis was made on 8 Sep 2003, the far end of the 2 incubation
period watch for additional cases prior to implementation of full
respiratory isolation would be 28 Sep 2003). The rapid response and
openness of the Singapore Ministry of Health is to be commended. We await
the results of the investigation as to how this apparent laboratory
accident occurred. - Mod.MPP]
