A mystery disease is striking California's huge flocks of pelicans,
which are being found disoriented far from their usual habitat and
displaying extreme fatigue and bruising inside their beaks, as was
reported Wednesday [7 Jan 2009].

Bird rescuers suspect that fatal algae toxins may be responsible for
the scourge, but the birds do not display many of the signs
associated with those toxins, which normally occur in the summer.

Another suspect is run-off from the fire retardant that was used in
enormous amounts to battle wildfires along the coast last summer
[2008]. The birds are usually seen flying in formation along the
Pacific coast or diving into the ocean to catch fish in their large
beaks. But in recent weeks, many have been found deep inland and far
away from their usual routes. Adding to the consternation is that
many of the dead pelicans are adults, while it is usually the younger
birds that are the most frequent victims of disease.

"We have ruled out starvation, because there are plenty of fish in
coastal waters right now," said Jay Holcomb, executive director of
the northern California-based International Bird Rescue Research
Centre. "We are seeking answers from all the experts we can find."

[Were there any storms in recent weeks? Storms have been known to
affect birds' navigational systems, causing them to be in areas not
otherwise frequented.

The fire retardant may accumulate in the fish they eat, but given the
dilution factor of the ocean, this seems like a stretch. Without
testing, it is impossible to know.

This article does not mention whether any necropsies on the birds
have been done, which may shed some light on why the birds are dying.
If someone has some definitive information, we would appreciate your
sharing it with us. - Mod.TG]
