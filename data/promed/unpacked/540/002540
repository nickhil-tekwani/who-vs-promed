[Abattoir] workers diagnosed with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently 6 slaughter workers of "Tappe Salam" of Mashhad have been
admitted to the hospital due to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
virus infection. According to ILNA [Iranian Labour News Agency], this
disease has spread among the workers after importation of domestic
animals from Afghanistan. The workers of "Tappe Salam" reported to
medical staff with high fever, severe pain in all body muscles,
headache, and nausea; they were diagnosed with Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever.

Domestic animals with Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus infection
have been imported into Iran previously, although according to law,
any import or export of animals must be authorized by the Ministry of Health.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic
fever caused by a virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_ in the
family _Bunyaviridae_. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases
and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur frequently. The
disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

The geographical distribution of the virus, like that of its vectors,
argasid or ixodid ticks, is widespread. CCHF virus may infect a wide
range of domestic and wild animals. Animals become infected with CCHF
from the bite of infected ticks. A number of tick genera are capable
of becoming infected with CCHF virus, but the most efficient and
common vectors for CCHF appear to be members of the genus _Hyalomma_.
Transovarial (transmission of the virus from infected female ticks to
offspring via eggs) and venereal transmission have been demonstrated
amongst some vector species, indicating one mechanism, which may
contribute to maintaining the circulation of the virus in nature.

Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct
contact with blood or other infected tissues from livestock during
this time, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority
of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry,
such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

The length of the incubation period for the illness appears to depend
on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick
bite, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of
9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood
or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13
days. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching
muscles), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache,
sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be
nausea, vomiting and sore throat early on, which may be accompanied
by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal pain. Over the next few days,
the patient may experience sharp mood swings, and may become confused
and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by
sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may
localize to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly
(liver enlargement).

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death
occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover,
improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in
CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component
replacement is required. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used
in treatment of established CCHF infection with apparent benefit.
Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.

Mashhad is the capital of Razavi Khorasan province in northeastern
Iran, close to the border with Turkmenistan. It can be found on the
