[On 7 Jul 2021, Mongolia reported 5 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)-O located in the provinces of Suhbaatar (2), Hentiy (2) and Dornogovi (1). See https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=35747.

The following information and abstract come from an article by Limon et al (citation follows):
Limon G, Ulziibat G, Sandag B, et al. Socio-economic impact of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks and control measures: an analysis of Mongolian outbreaks in 2017. Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020; 67(5): 2034-49. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tbed.13547
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"The current national FMD control strategy in Mongolia consists of vaccination twice a year in high-risk areas, modified stamping out (i.e., only destroying animals with clinical signs) and movement controls. Following a report of an animal with clinical signs suspected as FMD, a 10-km quarantine zone is put in place and an outbreak investigation begins. The size of the quarantine zone might vary depending on the location and natural barriers. Animals with clinical signs are destroyed and farmers receive compensation worth 90% of the commercial value of the animals culled. Once the last animal is destroyed, a 28-day quarantine period begins. During the outbreak investigation and quarantine period, no animals or people can move in or out of the quarantine zone. Once the quarantine period has concluded, the subsequent appearance of clinical signs of FMD in a herd is considered a new outbreak and a new investigation and quarantine period initiated.

"Estimating the impact of animal disease and resultant control measures at both the national and herder levels provides information that can be used to guide future control policy and resource allocation for animal diseases. This study addresses the impact of FMD in Mongolia in 2017 by (a) assessing the socio-economic impact of FMD and the control measures on herders; and (b) estimating the national gross economic losses during 2017."

Abstract
--------
"Mongolia is a large landlocked country in Central Asia and has one of the highest per capita livestock ratios in the world. During 2017, reported foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in Mongolia increased considerably, prompting widespread disease control measures. This study estimates the socio-economic impact of FMD and subsequent control measures on Mongolian herders. The analysis encompassed quantification of the impact on subsistence farmers' livelihoods and food security and estimation of the national-level gross losses due to reaction and expenditure during 2017. Data were collected from 112 herders across 8 provinces that reported disease. Seventy of these herders had cases of FMD, while 42 did not have FMD in their animals but were within quarantine zones. Overall, 86 of 112 herders reported not drinking milk for a period of time and 38 of 112 reduced their meat consumption. Furthermore, 55 herders (49.1%) had to borrow money to buy food, medicines and/or pay bills or bank loans. Among herders with FMD cases, the median attack rate was 31.7%, 3.8% and 0.59% in cattle, sheep and goats, respectively, with important differences across provinces. Herders with clinical cases before the winter had higher odds of reporting a reduction in their meat consumption. National-level gross losses due to FMD in 2017 were estimated using government data. The estimate of gross economic loss was 18.4 billion Mongolian tugriks (USD 7.35 million) which equates to approximately 0.65% of the Mongolian GDP. The FMD outbreaks combined with current control measures have negatively impacted herders' livelihoods (including herders with and without cases of FMD) which are likely to reduce stakeholder advocacy. Possible strategies that could be employed to ameliorate the negative effects of the current control policy were identified. The findings and approach are relevant to other FMD endemic regions aiming to control the disease." - Mod.CRD
