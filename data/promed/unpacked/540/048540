Albania: Contaminated Tap Water Causes Hepatitis A Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
Albania's Health Ministry said today that 111 children from a northern town
have fallen ill during a lengthy outbreak of hepatitis A infection caused
by contaminated tap water. The deputy mayor of Lac, Gjergj Roshi, said the
water-distribution network in 3/4 of the town is badly damaged.
Health Ministry spokeswoman Doreada Mio said the government had urged the
residents of the town not to drink the water without boiling it first. But
the outbreak, which began in November 2002, is continuing, and the town
wants the Education Ministry to close the city's schools and preschools to
avoid a wider epidemic.

[Hepatitis A virus is a hepatotropic enterovirus transmitted by the
fecal-oral route. Many infections are silent, particularly in young
children. Large amounts of infectious virus are excreted in the feces for
several days after the onset of jaundice, and the virus can survive for
long periods in water and wet environments. Consequently, hepatitis A virus
infection is common where sewage treatment and hygiene are inadequate. In
such situations, immunity is acquired as a result of sub-clinical infection
in early childhood. An effective vaccine is available. However,
contamination of tap water is avoidable, and an engineering solution to the
outbreak in the town of Lac should be the priority. - Mod.CP]
