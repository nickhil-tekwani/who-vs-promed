ICAR [Indian Council of Agricultural Research]-National Research Centre on Equines (ICAR-NRCE), Hisar (Haryana), in collaboration with ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh, has developed a homologous live-attenuated LSD vaccine.

The new technology was released by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Union Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Minister Parshottam Rupala at an event held in the national capital.

Sheepox virus (SPV) and goat pox virus (GPV)-based vaccine (heterologous vaccine) is usually authorized to induce cross-protection against LSD in cattle, where homologous LSD vaccine is not available.

The Centre has authorised the use of goatpox vaccine to control LSD in cattle. However, heterologous vaccines provide partial protection and are not as efficacious as homologous vaccines, the ICAR said.

Rupala complimented the ICAR scientists for the development of the indigenous [homologous] vaccine, which he said would help in controlling the LSD.

Till now, the Minister said, the states are currently using goatpox to control this disease, which is also effective.

[The vaccination against LSD in India, and the goatpox vaccine applied, have been addressed in the posting 20220810.8704965. The posting included a request for information on the goatpox vaccine's validation and licensing. From the above media report it may be concluded that the goatpox vaccine has been validated and certified by the competent Indian authorities, allowing its commercialisation and mass application, while the newly developed homologous vaccine is yet to be certified and commercialised. - Mod.AS
