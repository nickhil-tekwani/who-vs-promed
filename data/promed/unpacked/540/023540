Emergency management warning 6: Newcastle disease confirmed in California
in backyard poultry
------------------------------
Officials with the California Department of Agriculture (CDFA) and the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on
October 1, 2002, and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs.
Mortality is up to 90 per cent of exposed birds. Commercial poultry, at
this time, are not involved in the disease occurrence. Investigations are
continuing and all figures are pending final validation.
Situation update:
Number of premises positive: 30
Number of contacts: 36
Number of premises depopulated: 62
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 4
Birds depopulated to date: 10 600 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino
Operational Update:
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up all epidemiological associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered a
single outbreak cluster within a 30 mile [48 km] radius in Los Angeles
County and along the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized and
double-bagged The bags are disinfected and the carcasses transported to
restricted landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews, has established no
links to eastern states within the United States and no exposure to other
backyard poultry in other states. Local commercial table egg layer birds
are being closely monitored and will be allowed to move only intrastate
under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen movements restricted to the day they
are scheduled for processing.
Trade Issues:
Nothing new to report.
If you have questions about this situation please contact USDA, APHIS,
Veterinary Services, Emergency Programs at <EMOC@APHIS.USDA.GOV>.

[This is an ongoing investigation. Since the last report there are very few
additional comments. As this is very localized, there are no concerns for
trading partners. Furthermore, this is not in any commercial flocks. It
seems this outbreak in the game birds housed primarily in back yards and in
small operations was caught in a timely fashion. - Mod.TG]
