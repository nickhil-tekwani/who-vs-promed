Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - update
--------------------------------------
On [12 Feb 2014], The Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia reported a human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the case are as follows:
A 67-year-old woman tourist from Guangdong Province, China, arrived in Malaysia on [3 Feb 2014] in a tour group of 17 persons, including relatives, and stayed overnight in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The tour group then went on a visit to Sabah, Malaysia from [4 to 6 Feb 2014]. On [7 Feb 2014], she was admitted to hospital and later transferred to another hospital in Sabah. The patient is currently in a stable condition.

Four days prior to travelling to Malaysia, on [30 Jan 2014], she was treated in China for symptoms of fever, cough, flu, fatigue, and joint pain. Given the onset of symptoms, and travel dates, the most likely exposure occurred before arrival in Malaysia.

The Malaysia Ministry of Health is conducting an investigation including contact tracing and is also coordinating information sharing with the Chinese government.

While the recent report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However, as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely, as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low. The overall risk assessment has not changed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas, especially given expected increases in the trade and transport of poultry associated with the Lunar New Year.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.

Two more people were confirmed to be infected with H7N9 bird flu in 2 provinces, health authorities said Monday [17 Feb 2014].

Infection of a man, 63, from Lujiang County in east China's Anhui Province was confirmed on Sunday [16 Feb 2014], according to the provincial health department.

The man is in critical condition. Four cases of human H7N9 have been reported in Anhui this year [2014], according to the department.

A 64-year-old man from Shaodong County in central China's Hunan Province was also confirmed as infected on Monday [17 Feb 2014], bringing the total infections in the province this year [2014] to 11.

There have been more than 120 human H7N9 cases reported in China so far this year [2104] and at least 32 deaths, according to the latest official tally of the country's health and family planning commission.

Chinese cities have stepped up control of the live poultry trade as the number of human H7N9 bird flu infections continues to rise.

Health authorities in east China's Anhui Province on Saturday [15 Feb 2014] reported a new human H7N9 infection. A teenage girl was diagnosed in a hospital in Huaining County, Anqing City on Friday [14 Feb 2014]. She is in stable condition.

The health department in south China's Guangdong Province on Saturday [15 Feb 2015] also reported 2 new H7N9 infection cases. A 4-year-old girl in the provincial capital of Guangzhou is in stable condition. The other patient, a 79-year-old man, also in Guangzhou, is said to be critically ill.

The department also announced that 2 former H7N9 patients in Zhaoqing City were discharged from the hospital after they fully recovered.

Anhui, along with Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, are the worst-hit regions for the deadly bird flu. Anhui reported one death from the virus on Monday [10 Feb 2014], triggering concerns about more human H7N9 cases in the country in the near future.

There have been more than 120 human H7N9 cases reported in China so far this year [2014] and at least 32 deaths, according to the health ministry's official tally earlier this week.

Poultry trade has been considered a primary source of human infection for the virus, as most of the diagnosed patients had close contact with poultry.

On Saturday [15 Feb 2014], Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, banned all live poultry markets for 2 weeks. The ban will be in effect until [28 Feb 2014] as part of the government's new effort to curb the spread of the H7N9 virus.

Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, announced on Saturday [15 Feb 2014] that it would permanently stop live poultry trade in the city proper. The measure had already been in place as a temporary ban since [24 Jan 2014], a week before the Spring Festival, China's lunar New Year.

The notice issued by the municipal government on Saturday [15 Feb 2014] specified that the live poultry ban covers both birds sold for meat and as pets. Two of the city's outlying districts will be allowed to decide whether to lift the ban 3 months later.

The notice said that the city will set up more designated poultry slaughterhouses to ensure the supply of frozen poultry products.

Chicken and duck dishes are among the most favored foods in China's eastern and southern regions. The catering industry has been severely dampened by the spread of bird flu.

A popular Korean TV series, "My Love From the Star," has partly helped to make up for the industry's losses. Restaurants in Hangzhou saw a surge in fried chicken sales during snowy weather this month [February 2014] as fans of the drama imitated the show's heroine, who eats fried chicken with beer during the 1st snow of the year.

[Cases continue to occur, with the overwhelming majority associated with known contact with live birds, frequently through contact with live poultry markets. This moderator remembers discussions regarding closures of live poultry markets from the Chinese New Year through April. From the above media report, it appears as though this was not implemented as a national policy. A major challenge with H7N9 is that it is an LPAI virus, so that infected avians do not necessarily exhibit evidence of infection, alerting individuals not to handle them.

The imported case into Malaysia is the 1st case of human infection with H7N9 associated with the current transmission in China that has occurred outside of China.

Fortunately, to date, there does not appear to have been any significant person-to-person transmission.
