[In case the news above (particularly item 1) on the confirmation of
the ASF diagnosis is correct, confirming that ASF has jumped into
Kaliningrad, this is concerning news for northern Europe. Kaliningrad
region (oblast), previously East Prussia, is a Russian exclave without
land connection to the rest of Russia; it is situated on the Baltic
coast, bordering Poland on its south and Lithuania on its east and
north east; see maps at <http://www.inkaliningrad.com/english/> and
<http://healthmap.org/r/0sym>. A previous jump of the ASF virus to
northern Russia was reported and confirmed when the disease was
diagnosed in the Leningrad oblast.

The location of Pravdinsk can be seen on the map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/23/Pravdinsk.html>. Kostyukovka
is situated very close to the Polish border, 7.8 km (about 5 mi) from
the Polish city of Lipica; see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/23/Kostyukovka.html>.

Official confirmation or otherwise is requested. - Mod.AS]
