[Over the last 2 years, both France and Germany have reported
pseudorabies in both dogs and wild boars. Commonly this occurs when
hunting dogs come into contact with infected wild boars, which are
found to be infected with pseudorabies from time to time in Europe.
Other European countries do report the wild boars with Spain,
Portugal, Hungary, Italy, and Slovenia reporting the disease to OIE
WAHID database since July of 2009.

Just as a reminder, pseudorabies has nothing to do with rabies as the
virus is a herpesvirus which attacks the nervous system. In cattle,
pseudorabies causes intense pruritus which is sometimes known as "mad itch".

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map appended to the
