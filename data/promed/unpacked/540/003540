Skunk positive for rabies
-------------------------
The Clay County health department has confirmed that a skunk in the
Barnard Road area tested positive for rabies.

A skunk that attacked 2 dogs on 9 Nov 2008 tested positive for
rabies, health department director Janice Patterson said. The
incident occurred on Barnard Road in the Myers Chapel area. This is
the 2nd skunk testing positive for rabies in Clay County this year.

Patterson said the dog owners acted quickly to notify Emergency
Management who in turn contacted an employee of Clay County Health
Department. The older dog was currently vaccinated for rabies and
required a booster vaccine due to the exposure. The 2nd exposed dog
was a 10-week old puppy and had to be euthanized. Both dogs were
confined to the owner's yard with an underground fence at the time of
the attack.

"Rabies is present in Clay County wildlife," Patterson said. "Make
sure dogs, cats, and ferrets are vaccinated against rabies. Keep
vaccinations up to date and keep your pets supervised on your
property to reduce the chance of exposure to rabies. Avoid contact
with wild animals, especially bats, skunks, raccoons, and foxes. Be
alert to animals acting strangely. If any contact occurs or is
suspected get medical advice as soon as possible. Some animal bites
are small and people can be bitten without realizing it (bats can
bite humans when they are asleep)."

Surrounding counties have had numerous incidents this year. By August
2008, Cherokee County had 6 confirmed cases of rabies. There were
also numerous cases reported in Fannin County, Georgia. Patterson
said she is requesting that Clay County be included as a surveillance
site for the state. This means that rabies would be tracked. She is
also requesting that the state air drop oral vaccines across the
county. The vaccines are packaged in ketchup-sized packs and are
eaten by wild animals. This helps prevent wildlife from contracting
the disease, which will limit exposure to pets and people.

"If your pet is attacked or bitten by another animal report the
attack to the Clay County Sheriff's Department and the Clay County
Health Department," Patterson said. "Be sure your pet gets a booster
vaccination within 72 hours even if they are currently vaccinated. If
a person is bitten, don't panic. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap
and lots of water. Get medical help immediately. The person might
need preventive treatment. Rabies rarely occurs in humans if
preventive treatment is started immediately. Alert the Sheriff's
Department to help capture the animal."

To test for rabies, health officials must remove the brain. That is
why it is important that the head remain intact when the animal is
killed. Rabies is a disease that affects the animal's brain and spinal chord.

Rabies virus is transmitted through bodily excretions and tissue,
according to information provided by the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention. Saliva and brain or nervous system tissue are
considered infectious materials that can transmit rabies virus.
Contact from petting or handling an animal, or contact with blood,
urine or feces does not constitute an exposure. Rabies is transmitted
only when the virus is introduced into a bite wound, open cuts in
skin, or onto mucous membranes (such as the mouth or eyes).

Rabies can be prevented through a series of vaccinations after
exposure, but it is fatal once symptoms appear. Patterson said
hunters should also be alert when encountering wild animals. They
should make sure their hunting dogs are kept up-to-date on
vaccinations as well.

[Rabies is a disease caused by the rabies virus. It may take several
weeks or even a few years for people to show symptoms after getting
infected with rabies, but usually people start to show signs of the
disease 1 to 3 months after the virus infects them. The early signs
of rabies can be fever or headache, but this changes quickly to
nervous system signs, such as confusion, sleepiness, or agitation.
Once someone with rabies infection starts having these symptoms, that
person usually does not survive.

Pet owners should be especially vigilant to have their pets
vaccinated regularly.

Many kinds of animal can pass rabies to people. Wild animals are much
more likely to carry rabies, especially raccoons, skunks, bats,
foxes, and coyotes. However, dogs, cats, cattle (cows), or any
warm-blooded animal can pass rabies to people. People usually get
rabies from the bite of an infected animal. Many animals, such as
dogs, cats, and horses are vaccinated against rabies, but you should
always wash any bite thoroughly and check with your health care
provider about what to do if any animal bites you.
