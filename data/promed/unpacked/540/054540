Bird flu in southern Vietnam
----------------------------
Ca Mau province, Vietnam's southernmost, has
reported an outï¿½break of bird flu, the first
since declaring it was free of the disease before
the Lunar New Year in mid-February [2007].
More than 100 ducks had died of the disease in
Khanh Binh Dong commune in Tran Van Thoi district
Friday [30 Mar 2007], deputy head of the
provincial administration, Pham Thanh Tuoi,
said. The ducks had not been vaccinated, he added.
All poultry in the infected area have been
killed, and the administration has asked
authorities to step up surveillance to prevent the disease from recurring.

submitted to the OIE on 23 Mar 2007, there had
been 56 H5N1 outbreaks in Viet Nam since the end
of December 2006. Out of 43 852 susceptible
birds, there were 21 459 clinical cases of which
17 162 died, and 22 287 were destroyed. For

Bangladesh says bird flu spreads to more farms
----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has spread to 5 more farms in central
and northern districts, Bangladesh said on Friday [30 Mar 2007].
"The avian flu has now spread to 16 farms in 5
districts so far. But no humans have been
confirmed infected," an official of the
fisheries and livestock ministry said.
Bangladesh has culled about 60 000 birds since
confirming the outbreak of the H5N1 flu virus
simultaneously on 6 farms near the capital,
Dhaka, on 22 March 2007. All the culled birds
belonged to the 16 affected farms. So far, 30
workers in the 5 newly affected farms were being
monitored after they were given health checks.
Earlier, 100 poultry workers were released after
no H5N1 infection was detected by a local
laboratory, which tested their blood and other
samples days after the initial outbreak was detected.
Movement of chickens has been banned outside a 10
sq km (3.9 sq miles) area around the affected farms, officials said.
Livestock officials said after the outbreak of
the virus they had inspected about 10 000 farms
containing nearly 1.1 million birds.

[An official "immediate notification" from
Bangladesh was sent to the OIE on 30 Mar 2007 --
see [4] above -- reporting 3 outbreaks in Dhaka
province; 2 of them occurred in the district of
Jamalpur, sub-district Sharishabari, reportedly
starting on 5 and 21 Feb 2007, respectively; the
3rd outbreak occurred in the district of Dhaka,
subdistrict Savar; reportedly, it had started on
22 Feb 2007. For details and map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5154>.
Previously, it was reported that avian influenza
experts participated in a team investigating the
unexplained death of 3 people in northern
Bangladesh, in mid-February 2007 (see
20070217.0597). It would help if the results of
the said investigation become available.
WHO map "World : Areas reporting confirmed
occurrence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and
wild birds since 1 Jan 2007, status as of
29.03.2007 (latest available update)" can be seen at

- Mod.AS]
[Examination of the full report for Bangladesh
gives some cause for concern, as the largest of
the 3 flocks affected is a parent stock facility
with 32 000 layer birds. The other 2 facilities
are smaller commercial flocks with 2800 and 1000
birds respectively. The poultry industry in some
instances has a vertical structure in which
genetics flow down from grandparent and parent
stock to commercial flocks. This allows for rapid
advances in the genetic composition of the birds
involved, but can sometimes result in disease
transmission when birds, trucks, equipment, and
people move between facilities. - Mod.PC]
