Two cases of septicemia caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139
were reported in different regions of Poland during a month in the
summer of 2006.
The 1st case was in a 49-year-old man, who was found drowning in a
small lake in a city. After effective resuscitation, he was admitted
to the intensive care unit of a hospital where he presented with a
high fever and diarrhea. He died a day later. The patient had neither
been reported to be seriously ill before the incident nor had he
recently traveled outside Poland. None of his household or
occupational contacts reported having diarrheal illness around the
time of his death.
Preliminary microbiological examination of blood samples suggested
_Vibrio cholerae_ infection. A _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 strain
was subsequently identified. Further investigation showed that the
isolated strain had the gene coding hemolysin, but did not contain
genes coding cholera toxin, heat-stable enterotoxin NAG-ST, or TCP A pilin.
Water samples collected from 4 different locations in the lake tested
positive for _V. cholerae_ non-O1 and non-O139. Further investigation
of the environmental strains found in the lake where the patient
drowned revealed significant molecular diversity. Although all
isolates also contained the hemolysin-coding gene, none matched the
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain
reaction (ERIC-PCR) profile of the strain isolated from the patient.
As a summary of the epidemiological investigation, the near drowning
of the patient was established as the most likely source of exposure,
because such a stressful incident might increase the risk of
infection with _V. cholerae_ non-O1 and non-O139 -- in comparison to
that for normal healthy swimmers. The fact that the strain which was
isolated from the patient did not match the strains found in the lake
could have been due to chance. There also remains a small possibility
that the infection had taken place before the near drowning incident
even though no signs of major illness had been reported by the
patient's household contacts.
_Salmonella_ and _Escherichia coli_ strains in above-acceptable
quantities were also found in the water samples from this lake.
Because of the likelihood of sewage contamination, control measures
following the investigation included a complete ban on swimming in
the lake. Further tests on 34 water samples collected from different
rivers, lakes and ponds nearby indicated the presence of _Vibrio_
species in 12 of these samples.
The 2nd case of _V. cholerae_ septicemia occurred in a 79-year-old
man in another part of Poland. The patient was admitted to hospital
in summer 2006 with symptoms of high fever, diarrhea and severe
abdominal cramps. Shortly after admission, he developed pneumonia and
septicemia. No diarrheal illness was reported among household
contacts, and the patient had not recently traveled abroad.
Laboratory investigation of 2 consecutive blood cultures revealed _V.
cholerae_. Further analysis of the isolated strain at the reference
laboratory identified _V. cholerae_ non-O1 and non-O139. The strain
was negative for cholera toxin, but positive for genes coding
accessory cholera toxin (ACE), zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) and
hemolysin. The patient was treated with amoxicillin with clavulanic
acid and ciprofloxacin. Stool samples collected after start of
antibiotic therapy were negative for _V. cholerae_. The patient
recovered and was discharged from hospital.
Epidemiological investigation indicated that the probable source of
exposure in this case was water from an old, infrequently used well.
The well water was found to be unsuitable for drinking because of
contamination with _Aeromonas_ species and _E. coli_, but no _Vibrio_
bacteria were identified. The presence of _E. coli_ can indicate that
water was contaminated with sewage.
Discussion
---------
Studies indicate that _V. cholerae_ is a naturally occurring,
ubiquitous organism in the environment in Poland. Human cases of
infection with _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 serotypes are more
often associated with seawater, but can also occur in freshwater
[5,6,7]. Previous studies of surface water contamination carried out
in 1994-98 and 2004 in eastern regions of Poland, which border on
Ukraine, revealed the presence of _V. cholerae_ non-O1 strains in the
water throughout the year, even in winter. Strains isolated from
eastern Polish rivers also did not contain cholera toxin genes, but
40 percent were found to produce heat-stable enterotoxin NAG-ST, with
varying haemolytic activity, and toxigenicity was shown in tests on
animals (8,9,10).
In Europe, infections with _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 serotypes
are rare, and sporadic cases are generally reported. Experimental
infections in healthy volunteers and data from gastroenteritis
outbreak investigations indicate that the incubation period is 10
hours in volunteers and 12 to 24 hours in outbreaks. The median
duration of illness ranges from 12 to 24 hours (3).
Symptoms of _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 infection include
gastroenteritis if large numbers of the bacteria enter the digestive
tract, and wound infections. Septicemia is also a possibility,
especially in infected patients who are immunocompromised (1,2,3).
The atypically high temperatures in the summer of 2006 provided
conditions favorable for the growth of _Vibrio_ bacteria in the
environment. During such a hot summer, routine testing of water
samples from bathing beaches should be extended to detect the
presence of Vibrio, due to the increased level of bacteria in the water.
