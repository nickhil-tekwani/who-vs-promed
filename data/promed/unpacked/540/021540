Colombian health authorities on Mon [13 Mar 2006] reported a 2nd outbreak of
hantavirus infection in Necocli, a town in the northeastern Department of
Antioquia, brining the total number of those infected to 8.
Felipe Aguirre Arias of the Health Ministry confirmed that the patient is not
in danger of dying of the illness [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome], and that he
will be transferred to Medellin, the capital of the Antioquia Department, for
the swiftest treatment.
Last week, 4 people died of the disease, including soldiers and civilians, but
31 soldiers who are under observation in local hospitals are recovering
satisfactorily.
General Luiz Alfonso Zapata, Commander of the Colombian army's 18th Brigade,
said that the 3 non-commissioned officers and 28 ordinary soldiers of the
Velez Battalion, based in Necoclil, will be under observation for 1 more week.
Hantavirus infection causes haemorrhaging, muscular pain, gastritis, kidney
damage and breathing difficulties. The virus is most commonly spread by
rodents in their droppings.
