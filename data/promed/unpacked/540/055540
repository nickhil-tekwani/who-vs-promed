NIPAH VIRUS ENCEPHALITIS

Clinical Features of Nipah Virus Encephalitis: The UMMC Experience

>From February to April 1999, 96 patients were admitted to the University of
Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) from the Nipah virus encephalitis outbreak
areas. Ninety-one patients were found to have the disease based on clinical
findings and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. The male: female
ratio was 5.1: 1. Age range was 13-58 years (mean 36.5). The ethnic
breakdown was 82.4% Chinese, 14.3% Indian, 1.1% Malay and 2.2% others. The
majority (95.6%) had direct contact with pigs. Main presenting symptoms
were fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, and drowsiness. Focal neurological
signs observed included segmental myoclonus, cerebellar signs, tremors,
ptosis and tendon aflexia. Seizures occurred in 22%. 59.3% of patients had
deterioration of consciousness. Forty -four (48.4%) were ventilated. CSF
was abnormal in 77.5% of patients - 33.7% CSF lymphocytosis, raised protein
and 43.8% raised protein only. Hendra serology was positive 73.4% and
equivocal in 2.2%. Electroencephalograph (EEG) shows diffuse slow waves
with/without bitemporal independent sharp waves. 28 (30.8%) patients died,
52 (57.1%) discharged while 11 (12.1%) remained in hospital. Poor
prognostic factors included low Glasgow coma scale score at nadir, high
maximum heart rate and blood pressure, seizures, segmental myoclonus, small
pin-point pupils and abnormal doll's eye reflex and sharp waves on EEG.
Flaccid tetraplegia during recovery was observed in some cases. Four cases
had neurological relapse.
Conclusion: The Nipah virus causes a febrile encephalitic illness. Severe
cases were characterised by reduced conscious level, seizures, focal
neurological signs and signs of brain-stem dysfunction. Neurological
relapse may occur.

Nipah Virus Encephalitis : Imaging Features
-------------------------------------------
Sarji SA, Abdullah BJJ, Goh KJ*, Kamarulzaman A*. Departments of Radiology
and *Medicine.
This study describes the findings on imaging in 26 patients who were
admitted into the UMMC with clinical features of encephalitis and were from
the outbreak areas. Their brains were imaged by computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There were no abnormalities found in
those who were imaged by CT, but MRI demonstrated abnormalities in the
brains of all 26 patients. In both the acute and later phases of
encephalitis, the main MRI finding was the presence of multiple, small,
asymmetrically distributed focal lesions in the subcortical and deep white
matter, likely areas of infarcts. In patients who had neurological relapse
or worsening of neurological symptoms, diffuse continuous involvement of
the cortical gray matter was demonstrated and this extended into the deep
white matter on follow-up imaging. Widespread cerebral vasculopathy
resulting in areas of demyelination or a direct attach on the neurons by
the virus may be the underlying cause.
In conclusion, MRI was found to be a sensitive and useful imaging process
for diagnosing Nipah encephalitis and for following the progression of the
disease in the brain. The MRI features appear distinct from MRI
descriptions of other viral encephalitides.

Pathological Changes In Nipah Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------
Wong KT, Looi LM
Department of Pathology
This study describes the pathological changes in tissues of patients who
died of the Nipah virus infection, and postulates on its pathogenesis.
Eighteen autopsy brains and 4 sets of other organs were examined after
formalin fixation, routine processing and H&E staining. Material gathered
from 14 autopsies performed in the Ministry of Health and 4 performed in
the UMMC. All the patients had direct contact with pigs and presented with
clinical features typical of Nipah virus encephalitis. Sixteen had
anti-Hendra antibodies either in the serum and/or CSF. In addition 4 cases
had virus isolated from the CSF. The main pathological change was
vasculitis in small blood vessels (venules, capillaries, arterioles, and
muscular arteries), particularly in the brain. Other organs involved
included the lung, heart and kidney. Vasculitis-induced thrombosis appeared
to cause widespread, focal infarction/ischaemia. Occasionally, endothelial
syncytia formation was noted. Syncytial formation was also noted in the
Bowman's capsule. Neuronal inclusions, presumably viral, were observed in
the brain. The pathogenesis of Nipah virus infection appears to be
primarily due to endothelial damage resulting in vasculitis, thromboses and
infarction which is especially severe in the brain but direct neuronal
infection may also play an important role.

Nipah Virus Outbreak : Clinical Management At The UMMC
------------------------------------------------------
Kamarulzaman A, Goh KJ, Tan PSK, Delikan AE, Imran ZA, Tan CT Departments
of Medicine and Anaesthesiology
The Nipah virus outbreak and the identification of a new causative agent
whose properties were largely unknown at the onset of the outbreak provided
an enormous challenge to those involved in the clinical care of patients.
A multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, infectious disease
physician, intensivists, nurses and physiotherapists was essential in the
overall management. Supportive care was the mainstay of treatment which
included intensive care monitoring and the initiation of mechanical
ventilation as needed for airway protection with the onset of neurological
deterioration.
With the recognition that arterial thrombosis may play an important role in
the pathology of the disease anti-thrombotic agents aspirin and
pentoxyfyline were used in all patients.
Ribavarin, a nucleoside analogue which has in vitro activity against Hendra
was used in an open labeled nonrandomised trial in 73 patients admitted to
UMMC. The results of its clinical activity in Nipah encephalitis will be
discussed.
Given the limited treatment options and high case fatality rate of Nipah
encephalitis, prevention of the disease particularly in the health-care
setting was paramount, infection control measures involving standard and
droplet precautions were employed in the outbreak as soon as the
identification of a new potentially highly infectious agent was recognised.
