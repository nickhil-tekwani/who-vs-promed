Cundinamarca alert for an outbreak of avian virus that can be transmitted to humans.

The Health Ministry warned that there have been cases of Newcastle disease in the municipalities of F칩meque and C치queza. Red eye or eye discharge, itching, or burning are the main symptoms of Newcastle disease in humans. Authorities make recommendations for prevent contagion.

On Tue 22 Jan 2018, the country woke up to the news of an outbreak of the little known viral disease, Newcastle disease, which is highly contagious for humans and is transmitted by direct contact with sick birds. The alarm was reported by the Ministry of Health of Cundinamarca after registering cases of Newcastle disease in the municipalities of F칩meque and C치queza.

Authorities issued a statement with recommendations to learn more about the disease and to prevent further spread of the disease. In avians, Newcastle disease may cause acute respiratory symptoms, neck bowing, neurologic signs, and even death.

In humans, although the symptoms are milder and more limited, infection results in conjunctivitis, discharge from the eyes, and itching or burning of the eyes. Hence, the MOH advises individuals not to handle birds in commercial farms or in backyards or to consume poultry of unknown origin.

Increased hygiene measures in high risk areas is suggested. These include washing hands, changing clothes after contact with poultry, and making sure potable water is consumed. Personal protection measures such as goggles and masks are recommended as well as avoiding handling unprocessed organic fertilizers.

["Newcastle disease is an infection of domestic poultry and other bird species with virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV). It is a worldwide problem that presents primarily as an acute respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form. Severity depends on the virulence of the infecting virus and host susceptibility. Occurrence of the disease is reportable and may result in trade restrictions.

NDV, synonymous with avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (PMV-1), is an RNA virus and the most important of the 11 known PMV serotypes as a pathogen for poultry. The original classification of NDV isolates into one of three virulence groups by chicken embryo and chicken inoculation as virulent (velogenic), moderately virulent (mesogenic), or of low virulence (lentogenic) and has been abbreviated for regulatory purposes. Velogens and mesogens are now classified as virulent NDV (vNDV)."

"All NDV strains can produce a transitory conjunctivitis in people, but the condition has been limited primarily to laboratory workers and vaccination teams exposed to large quantities of virus. Before poultry vaccination was widely practiced, conjunctivitis from NDV infection occurred in crews eviscerating poultry in processing plants. The disease has not been reported in people who rear poultry or consume poultry products."

However, this article does not tell us the number of animals affected or if vaccines are in use. From the public health concentration in this article, it would seem vaccination of poultry or other avians is not being practiced.
