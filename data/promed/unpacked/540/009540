[1] Case update

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus disease dated 8 August, 2018:
- a total of 44 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 17 confirmed and 27 probable.
- 54 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 1 death of a confirmed case in Mabalako.
- * The laboratory tests of the samples taken from the 2 suspected cases of Goma proved negative this Thursday, 9 August at 22h.

News of the response
- Dr Richard Kitenge, national head of medical care, has arrived in Goma where he will assist the Provincial Health Division of North Kivu to put in place a contingency plan in case Ebola reaches the provincial capital. The first pillars of the response to Goma have been activated. For example, a transitional isolation unit was identified at the North Kivu Provincial Hospital (Goma), border health officers began to be deployed at various entry points in the city, and Social mobilization is also underway to raise awareness about the disease and prevention methods.
- The sample taken from the health zone of Watsa, Haut-Uélé Province, was analyzed in the mobile laboratory located in Béni and proved to be negative for Ebola virus serotype Zaire.

[The last item leaves us up in the air: was the sample from Watsa tested solely for EBOV serotype Zaire, or were other EBOV serotypes also ruled out? Haut-Uélé Province is in the extreme north east of the DRC, bordering South Sudan. As discussed by Dr Peter Salama in his recent interview with Science Insider [Ebola Update (62), part 2], many experts would have expected EBOV serotypes Bundibugyo or Sudan rather than EBOV-Zaire to emerge in north east DRC, because the former two have appeared in nearby Uganda. - Mod.

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus disease dated 9 August, 2018:
A total of 48 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 21 were confirmed and 27 were probable.
- 51 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases in Mabalako.
- 2 deaths of confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako.

News of the response
- The minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, and the director general of WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom, went to Beni this Friday, 10 August, 2018. They were accompanied by Dr Matshidiso R Moeti, regional director of WHO for Africa, and Peter Salama, director of WHO's emergency management program. In Beni, distinguished guests were able to attend the launch of the vaccination and interact with the health workers participating in the response. They also visited the new headquarters of the provincial coordination of Beni which is now in the new base of MONUSCO.
- The Medical Unit of Rapid Intervention (UMIR) of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) arrived in Beni since Thursday, 9 August, 2018. Their role is to take charge of awareness and prevention in military camps as well as to ensure the security of the surveillance teams when they make their investigations and follow the contacts in unsecured areas.

[The DRC military medical unit is now in Beni, underscoring the need for IPC (infection prevention and control) activities in large camps of mobile individuals such as the army. Similar activities should be in place for the huge MONUSCO contingent of UN peacekeepers (the so-called Blue Helmets, "les Casques bleues") in the region, and not just to prevent Ebola, as demonstrated by the disastrous 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak. - Mod.

[2] Security Issues

Wed 8 Aug 2018. Ebola is spreading again in Congo -- this time in an active war zone
[Washington Post, excerpted and edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ebola-is-spreading-again-in-congo--this-time-in-an-active-war-zone/2018/08/08/8997aa74-9aea-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html

Just one week after an outbreak of the Ebola virus was extinguished in north western Congo, a new one was declared in the country's conflict-hit north east. This is Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak since the 1970s, and some health officials are worried it might be the hardest to contain.

The new outbreak is centered on a thickly populated stretch of Congo's eastern border with Uganda -- an area that is also the epicenter of decades-long clashes between dozens of militias that have forced millions into squalid refu­gee camps.

"We are still in the early days, and there are lots of unanswered questions," said Peter Salama, WHO's head of emergency response. "But we are expecting this one to be significantly more costly and complex than the last. All the factors that made the Equateur outbreak enormously complex are present in the new one in North Kivu. Urban centers, infected health-care workers, proximity to international borders -- it's all there. But then you have 20 highly active militias in the region as well, and more than a million displaced by them."

The conflict makes one essential component in preventing Ebola's spread particularly difficult: tracing the contacts of those who are suspected to be infected. There are numerous areas of North Kivu and neighboring Ituri provinces that are highly volatile and often cut off entirely by clashes. Salama told reporters at a news conference earlier this week health workers may need armed escorts when they trace contacts.

"Beni is more or less surrounded by armed groups," said Nicolas Lambert, the deputy leader of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Congo, who is in Beni. "We have an ongoing dialogue with several of them to negotiate the safety of our health workers. But, more importantly, we must all work to stop the outbreak before it becomes lodged in areas with more active fighting."

According to the Reuters news agency, authorities in North Kivu announced on Tuesday 14 bodies had been discovered in the town of Tubameme, about 25 miles northeast of the outbreak's epicenter. The various conflicts in North Kivu and Ituri are led by both ethnic and religious armed militias, and the government, based more than 1,000 miles away in Kinshasa, exerts only sporadic control.

But the conflict does make the response to the outbreak easier in one way.

The region is home to the world's largest and most expensive peacekeeping operation, a United Nations mission known as MONUSCO. It has contributed to the building of roads and airstrips, which will make the delivery of supplies somewhat easier than in Equateur, which has the least developed infrastructure in what is already one of the world's least developed countries.

[This article has been edited down here to emphasize security issues, but is worth a proper look because it includes a colored "heat map" of armed conflict zones in the DRC, graphically demonstrating that North Kivu, Ituri, and the other northeastern provinces have the highest intensity of conflict fatalities. - Mod.
