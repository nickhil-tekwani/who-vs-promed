Uruguay to Go Ahead With Vaccination
---------------------------------------
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay - Uruguay will vaccinate its entire 10.4 million cattle
herd to fight foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the government announced. The
decision will likely hamper recovery from a 2-year recession. Authorities
made the decision after "an all-out" fight failed to contain the disease,
said Deputy Agriculture Minister Martin Agirrezabala.
The move came 10 days after FMD was detected in the South American country.
Officials said 190 cases have been confirmed across 16 of the country's 19
counties. The vaccination play means Uruguay will likely lose its status as
FMD free "without vaccination" for at least 4 years -- the length of time
officials estimate it will take for Uruguay to prove to international
authorities its herds are completely protected.
With vaccinated meat currently earning about half the price of
non-vaccinated meat in international markets, the decision is likely to hit
Uruguay's economy hard. Of greatest concern has been the effect the
outbreak will have on this small nation's economy -- reeling from a
recession which has sent unemployment up to 14.3 percent.
Uruguay has already been forced to suspend all meat exports, which
generated a half a billion dollars last year, 25 percent of Uruguay's total
exports. The outbreak in this small South American country mirrors those
having hit Europe and nearby Argentina and Brazil.
When the disease was discovered on 24 Apr 2000, Uruguay tried to eliminate
the virus by isolating the affected area and killing cattle that could have
been affected. A partial herd vaccination was attempted. But Friday's move
confirmed the failure of its previous strategy.
For the last week schools have been shut, border patrols intensified and
thousands of beef industry workers have gone out on strike demanding
government clarification of measures to help the industry battle the disease.
