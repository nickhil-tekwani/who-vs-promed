Hundreds of thousands of mackerel and pilchard have covered a beach in Cornwall "as far as the eye can see", witnesses have said. The fish were washed up on [Sat 17 Dec 2016] night on the beach at Marazion at St Michael's Mount in the south-west of Cornwall.

[A local woman] had gone down to the beach to take pictures said: "I was astonished. It was almost as if the waves were made up of thousands of shimmering fish," she told the Plymouth Herald. She added that as well as the fish, she found a dead dolphin rotting on the beach. "The closer I got I realised the beach was just covered in dead fish and more and more were coming in with every wave. It was a horrible but breath-taking scene."

Other people on the beach were also puzzled, [she] said, particularly because the dead fish were not attracting gulls. [Her] husband who also saw the fish, said: "I've never seen anything like it in my life. It's just dead fish as far as the eye can see."

This is the 2nd mass of dead fish on Cornish beaches this month [Dec 2016]. The 1st incident occurred on [3 Dec 2016] at Pentewan at St Austell, discovered by dog walker [a local man] from Mevagissey, who posted images of the beach covered in fish on Twitter.

A possible cause for such events is that it was a bycatch, where fishing trawlers cast off unwanted fish, which sometimes wash up on beaches. Another explanation could be that the fish were attempting to escape large predators and beached themselves. However, no definitive cause for the blanket of dead fish has been identified so far.

[The causes underlying massive fish die-off could be several, and there is need of post mortem examination and other steps of an outbreak investigation to be able to speculate possible reasons.
