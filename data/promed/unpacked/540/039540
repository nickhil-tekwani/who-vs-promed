[This posting and "Legionnaire's disease epidemiology (5)"
collect several replies, through Sat, 6 Jan, in response to the

In response to the Legionnaire's Epidemiology:RFI and the followup
Legionnaire's Epidemiology (2) concerning the distinction between
community and nosocomially acquired infections - I agree that the data as
presented give no indication that either patient was infected with
Legionella. However, a nosocomial infection is one in
which there is no evidence that the infection was present or
incubating at the time of admission. The definition is therefore
dependent on a knowledge of the incubation period of the particular
infectious disease under discussion but as Dr. Wallis points out, in
general, the patient must be in the hospital at least 48 hours.
Since the incubation period of Legionnaire's disease is approximately
2-10 days, the fact that the patient was in the hospital 2 days
or longer would not automatically define this as a nosocomial
infection. Knowledge of the incubation period, risk factors for
infection, exposures etc. would need to be considered to decide
whether the infection was aquired in the community or in the hospital.

In response to the request for information concerning the differentiation
between nosocomial and community acquired Legionnaire's disease:
The traditional definition of "nosocomial" infection of any kind, simply
stated, would include any infection which manifests itself greater than 48
hours after admission and yet was not incubating at the time of admission.
In this particular case, one must also take into account the incubation
period for Legionellosis which is generally 5-6 days.
It is of interest that, apparantly, in neither of the cases which you present
was the cause of death ascribed to Legionellosis. However, if we assume that
Legionellosis was, indeeed, the cause of death, then, according to the above
generalized definition of "nosocomial", neither of the cases would be
considered as "nosocomial" or hospital associated.

Joseph Wagner posed the question "Would anyone be able to tell me how
community acquired Legionnaire's is differentiated from nosocomial?"
The following reference may be of interest:
Strebel PM et al. Legionnaires' disease in a Johannesburg teaching
hospital. Investigation and control of an outbreak. South African Medical
Journal 1988; 73(6) 329-33.
This reports on an outbreak investigation of a time cluster of 12 cases in a
hospital in which some cases were community-acquired, some were
nosocomially-acquired, and in some cases it was not initially clear where
the infection had been acquired. The investigators used epidemiologic
reasoning to distinguish between nosocomial and community cases. The
nosocomial cases were associated with being on a ventillator, but not
with the water supply despite the finding of culture-positive water sites.
