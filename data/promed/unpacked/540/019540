Given the critical role livestock play in Mongolia, transmission of tick-borne diseases can have very real health and economic implications for livestock and the herders that tend to them. Dr. Michael von Fricken explored this association using a multidisciplinary One Health research approach, which focused on the interaction between nomadic herders, the livestock they own, and the tick-borne diseases they are exposed to.

Von Fricken spent a year living in Ulaanbataar as a postdoc with Duke University, under Dr. Greg Gray, working alongside veterinarians from the Institute of Veterinary Medicine and the National Center for Zoonotic Diseases. Now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Global and Community Health, which is part of George Mason University's College of Health and Human Services, von Fricken and his colleagues recently published their findings on 2 tick-borne diseases in Acta Tropica, "Estimated seroprevalence of _Anaplasma_ spp. and spotted fever group _Rickettsia_ exposure among herders and livestock in Mongolia" (1).

This study is unique given the under-studied target population of Mongolian herders, and the diverse landscapes covered, ranging from the arid Gobi region to the south to the Central Steppe and Altai Mountains to the north. In this study, von Fricken and his team (Dr. Boldbaatar Bazartseren and Dr. Lkhagvatseren Sukhbaatar) tested serum for antibodies indicative of previous exposure to _Anaplasma_ and spotted fever group (SFG) _Rickettsia_, 2 tick-borne diseases in the region that can have very serious effects on humans.

SFG rickettsia infections typically cause fever, rash, abdominal pain, and may even cause death due to heart and kidney failure in more severe infections. While SFG rickettsia species are non-pathogenic in livestock, _Anaplasma_ spp. can cause weight loss, fever, spontaneous abortion, and even death in infected livestock. One species in particular -- _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) -- can result in kidney failure if left untreated.

"By relying on One Health methodologies, we are investigating the broader implications for risk of disease transmission. That includes not just human health, but that of livestock and the environments they live in," von Fricken explained. "This makes for much richer datasets that can be used to identify key factors driving disease exposures that may be missed using siloed research approaches."

The research team detected high rates of previous _Anaplasma_ spp. and SFG _Rickettsia_ in their human and livestock samples. Humans were significantly more likely to have been exposed to a tick-borne disease in the northern provinces of Mongolia compared to samples collected from the Gobi Desert region. "Seroprevalence studies -- those that test for the presence of a disease in blood serum -- are great tools to identify populations or locations of interest. Findings from this study make a case for expanded tick-borne disease research in northern Mongolia, as it appears to be a hot spot for pathogen exposure, which is something we plan to investigate with partners in Mongolia."

While the prevalence of exposure to these diseases in some regions has been documented, the presence in Terelj National Park (in Tov province) is of particular concern, as it is a common international destination for hiking and tourism. "The Mongolian countryside is profoundly beautiful and holds a special place in my heart. If you ever get a chance to visit Mongolia, I highly recommend you take it, just take precautions to avoid tick bites and be sure to check for ticks after any outdoor activities," von Fricken recommends.

[The following is the abstract from the published article referenced in the news report above.

Abstract
"Background: To better understand the epidemiology of tick-borne disease in Mongolia, a comprehensive seroprevalence study was conducted investigating exposure to _Anaplasma_ spp. and spotted fever group (SFG) _Rickettsia_ spp. in nomadic herders and their livestock across 3 provinces from 2014 to 2015.

"Methods: Blood was collected from 397 herders and 2370 livestock, including sheep, goats, cattle, horses and camels. Antibodies against _Anaplasma_ spp. and SFG _Rickettsia_ were determined by indirect immunofluorescence using commercially available slides coated with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Rickettsia rickettsii_ antigens. Logistic regression was used to determine if the odds of previous exposure differed by gender, location, and species, with or without adjustment for age. To examine the association between seroprevalence and environmental variables, we used ArcGIS to circumscribe the 5 major clusters where human and animal data were collected.

"Results: _Anaplasma_ spp. exposure was detected in 37.3% (136/365) of humans and 47.3% (1120/2370) of livestock; SFG _Rickettsia_ exposure was detected in 19.5% (73/374) humans and 20.4% (478/2342) livestock. Compared to the southern province (aimag) of Dornogovi, located in the Gobi Desert, humans were significantly more likely to be exposed to _Anaplasma_ spp. and SFG _Rickettsia_ in the northern provinces of Tov (OR=7.3, 95% CI: 3.5, 15.1; OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.7, 7.5), and Selenge (OR=6.9, 95% CI: 3.4, 14.0; OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8).

"Conclusion: The high seroprevalence of _Anaplasma_ spp. and SFG _Rickettsia_ in humans and livestock suggests that exposure to tick-borne pathogens may be common in herders and livestock in Mongolia, particularly in the more northern regions of the country. Until more is known about these pathogens in Mongolia, physicians and veterinarians in the countryside should consider testing for _Anaplasma_ and SFG _Rickettsia_ infections and treating clinically compatible cases, while public health authorities should expand surveillance efforts for these emerging infections."

The above study tested for antibodies to _Rickettsia rickettsii_ and _Anaplasma phagocytoplasma_. However, the closely related spotted fever group rickettsial (SFGR) species (such as _R. akari_, _R. parkeri_, _R. conorii_, _R. africae_ or R. philipii) share similar antigens such that antibodies directed to one of these antigens can exhibit serologic cross-reactivity with available tests for _R. rickettsii_.

Although little cross-reactivity of _Rickettsia_ with _Anaplasma_ species exists, antibodies reactive with _A. phagocytophilum_ occasionally react with the other _Ehrlichia_ and Anaplasma_ species (e.g., _A. bovis_, _A. caudatum_, _A. centrale_, _A. marginale_, and _A. ovis_) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm).

The following is extracted from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website Other Tick-borne Spotted Fever Rickettsial Infections (http://www.cdc.gov/otherspottedfever/):

"In addition to _Rickettsia rickettsii_, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), several other tick-borne species of _Rickettsia_, broadly grouped under the heading 'spotted fever group _Rickettsia_ (SFGR)' have been shown to cause human infections. Tick-borne SFGR are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick and may cause similar signs and symptoms to those observed for RMSF. These pathogens include several species of _Rickettsia_ found in the United States, including _R. parkeri_ and _Rickettsia_ species 364D (Table 1). In addition, numerous tick-borne SFGR pathogenic to humans have been described internationally, including but not limited to _R. conorii_ and _R. africae_ (Table 2). Travelers may be at risk for exposure to these pathogens when engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for tick exposure, and physicians should maintain awareness of these diseases when a patient presents with a febrile illness within 2 weeks of returning home. Rickettsial infections with _R. africae_ have been reported as a common cause of fever in travelers returning from South Africa."

"The initial symptoms of tick-borne SFGR infections generally include fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. A maculopapular or petechial rash may be present, and frequently a distinctive eschar (blackened or crusted skin) may develop at the site of a tick bite. Multiple eschars may be present if more than one tick bite occurred. The observance of an eschar at the site of tick bite may provide the clinician with a diagnostic clue that can help differentiate the infection from RMSF, although eschars may also be rarely reported with _R. rickettsii_ infection. The severity of illness may vary depending on the species. For example, human infections with _R. parkeri_ and _R. africae_ are generally considered mild and to some extent self-limiting infections. In contrast, _R. conorii_ and some other SFGR infections may be more severe. Prompt treatment with doxycycline is recommended if tick-borne SFGR is suspected and should never be delayed pending the outcome of diagnostic tests."

"Different SFGR pathogens cause immune reactions in humans that can be difficult to distinguish with antibody-based laboratory techniques. Because these agents exhibit serologic cross-reactivity with available tests for _R. rickettsii_, some human illnesses currently being attributed to RMSF in the United States may actually be caused by other SFGR, such as _R. parkeri_, _Rickettsia_ 364D, or imported spotted fevers.

"Although the severity of infections attributable to SFGR vary greatly depending on the causative species, all suspect patients should be treated as if they have _R. rickettsii_ infection. Physicians seeking confirmation of infection with an SFGR pathogen may elect to use commercially available serologic assays that diagnose RMSF and should report it as a case of 'spotted fever rickettsiosis' to their state health department. Additional methods that may be used to help identify the causative agent include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and culture isolation of a swab or biopsy from an eschar or rash site. Specimens should be submitted to the state health department in the state where the patient resides, who can submit the samples to CDC for testing. For more information, see In Depth Information on RMSF."

"Tick-borne SFGR infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline, and this is considered the antibiotic of choice for patients of all ages."

For a discussion of anaplasmosis, please see my moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail posts Anaplasmosis - USA: (VT) increased incidence 20160929.4523508 and Anaplasmosis - China: (HL) new species, humans, goats, tick-borne 20150404.3275851, and Anaplasmosis - USA: (ME) increased incidence 20120811.1239966.

Mongolia is divided into 21 provinces (often translated as aimags) and one provincial municipality. The capital, Ulaanbaatar, is governed as an independent provincial municipality separate from Tov Province, in the center of which it is situated (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Mongolia). Dornogovi province is in the Gobi Desert in the southeast of the country, bordering PR China's autonomous region of Inner Mongolia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornogovi_Province). - Mod.ML]

[Bovine anaplasmosis, a severe clinical disease of cattle, results from infection with _Anaplasma marginale_. A 2nd species, _A. centrale_, has long been recognised and usually causes benign infection; while capable of producing a moderate degree of anaemia, clinical outbreaks in the field due to this agent are extremely rare.

_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ has been recently included within the genus, but they are not reported to cause clinical disease in cattle. The primary reservoir of _A. phagocytophilum_ is in rodents.

Anaplasmosis is included in OIE's list of notifiable cattle diseases. For further information on anaplasmosis in cattle, including the differential diagnostic methods (there is cross-reactivity between _A. marginale_ with both _A. phagocytophilum_ and _Ehrlichia spp._ in serological tests), please refer to OIE's terrestrial Manual, chapter 2.4.1. at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.01_BOVINE_ANAPLASMOSIS.pdf.

_Anaplasma marginale_ infection has not been reported in humans. - Mod.AS
