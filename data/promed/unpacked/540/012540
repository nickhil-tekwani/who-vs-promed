[African Horse Sickness (AHS) is an OIE List A disease, i.e.,
"Transmissible diseases that have the potential for very serious and rapid
spread, irrespective of national borders, that are of serious
socio-economic or public health consequence and that are of major
importance in the international trade of animals and animal products" (OIE
definition).
In the case of African Horse Sickness, the potential for high mortality
(75-90 percent) in an equine population is substantial, as many horses may
be lost before AHS could be brought under control. This is particularly
true if vectors of the Culicoides spp. are not adequately
addressed. Clinically, it is an ugly death, as the animal succumbs to
respiratory insufficiency when the lungs are filled with a frothy
exudate. Findings of subcutaneous gelatinous edema in places like the
ligamentum nuchae are not uncommon.
Although AHS is endemic throughout the middle of Africa, it occurs
occasionally in Southern Africa with rare spread into Northern Africa. It
was long ago identified in the Middle East and Spain, occurring as recently
as 1989 in Portugal. It is important to monitor the occurrence of this
disease in order to help free countries be more vigilant in keeping it out,
because its entry could devastate equine populations including donkeys and
mules. - Mod.PC]
