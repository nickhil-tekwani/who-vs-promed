Cambodian survives H5N1 bird flu virus - official
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 19-year old Cambodian man has survived the H5N1 bird flu virus
which has killed 7 other people [between 2005 and 2007] in the poor
Southeast Asian nation since 2005, a health ministry official said on
Sunday [21 Dec 2008]. The youth, who became infected after eating
dead poultry, was discharged from a Phnom Penh hospital on Saturday
[20 Dec 2008] after being treated for 10 days, Ly Sovann, deputy
director of communicable disease control department, said. "He left
safe and sound," Ly Sovann told Reuters.

Cambodia began culling poultry near its capital last week, and
ordered a 3-month ban on poultry being moved from the province of
Kandal, 50 kilometres [31 miles] south of Phnom Penh, after tests
confirmed it had been hit by the deadly virus.

The young man, the 8th person in Cambodia to have contracted bird flu
since its 1st case in 2005, fell ill on 28 Nov 2008 but was only
confirmed as having bird flu on 11 Dec 2008. All 7 of Cambodia's
previous human cases have died. Since H5N1 resurfaced in Asia in 2003
it has killed more than 200 people in a dozen countries according to
WHO [246 as of 16 Dec 2008, see;
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_12_12/en/index.html>.
- Mod.CP]. Experts fear the constantly mutating H5N1 virus could
change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and
potentially killmmillions worldwide.

[The survival of the 8th patient in Cambodia in 2008 in contrast to
the deaths of all previous 7 cases during the period 2005 to 2007
does not support the inference that the virus may be mutating towards
greater virulence for humans.
