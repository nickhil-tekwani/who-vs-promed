Salinas Valley lettuce growers are incurring serious losses from a set of plant diseases that continue to increase in frequency and intensity across the region. A grower said 2022 was a disaster due to the widespread outbreak, with large fields without a single head of harvestable lettuce. Of the 20% of lettuce acreage in Salinas Valley thought to be impacted this year [2022], about 1/3 was lost from disease.

Laboratory tests point to _Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) and pythium wilt. The symptoms may be similar, which can make it difficult to determine the primary cause of death for a plant. Both pathogens largely responsible for the lettuce deaths occur independently, but one may enhance the other. INSV seems to be the trigger for pythium wilt as plant stress increases.

[INSV
----
_Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) was considered a strain of _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus _Orthotospovirus_, previously _Tospovirus_) but has since been classified as a separate species in the genus. It has a wide host range and is of significant economic importance for many crop and ornamental hosts. The virus is distributed in Europe and North America and has also been identified in a few locations elsewhere. INSV is transmitted by the western flower thrips _Frankliniella occidentalis_; other thrips vectors have so far not been recorded.

Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses able to infect a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species, which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs; tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, as well as use of resistant crop cultivars. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.

Pythium wilt
---------------
_Pythium_ species cause root and stem rots on a wide range of plant species, including lettuce and other crops. Stress on plants from other infections (such as viruses, as mentioned above for INSV) and/or environmental factors increases their susceptibility to pythium diseases. The pathogens can survive in most soil types for long periods. They can be spread with infected materials (such as equipment, soil, plant debris), by mechanical means, and with water. Disease management may include the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, and preventative fungicide treatments of planting materials.
