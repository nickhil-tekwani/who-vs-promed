[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Kano State)
Date: Sun 20 Jul 2014

A cholera outbreak in northern Nigeria's Kano State has killed 6 people and infected scores, the state health commissioner said on Sun 20 Jul 2014, although a local charity put the toll higher. "6 people died out of the 46 cases recorded," Abubakar Labaran Yusuf told AFP [Agence France-Presse] of the outbreak this week in Kafin Dalawa village, 70 km (43 miles) outside the state capital of Kano.

Contaminated water in the area was the most likely cause, he said, adding that teams had been dispatched to clean water sources and supply drugs.

But a local medical charity put the toll higher, saying at least 16 people had died and that the outbreak was threatening to become a pandemic. "We have recorded 16 deaths from the cholera outbreak in the past 6 days, which has so far infected 701 people with 20 severe cases," Surajo Alkassim of ISMA Medicare Initiatives told AFP. He said the organisation had been treating patients in a make-shift hospital in the village since the outbreak. "The outbreak is becoming a pandemic in the area because patients are trooping from neighbouring villages, which is putting a strain on our team and medical supplies," Alkassim said.

Cholera, a highly contagious intestinal infection, is transmitted by water soiled by human waste. The disease leads to diarrhoea, dehydration and death if untreated.

Outbreaks are commonest during the rainy season, which runs roughly rom April to October in Nigeria.

Cholera claimed 2 lives within last 48 hours in Khusda Khurd village [Uttar Pradesh State]. The health department officials claimed that the disease had broken out in the village on Monday [21 Jul 2014] and over a dozen persons with cholera symptoms were undergoing treatment at Manda community health center.

Chief medical officer [CMO] [in] Allahabad, Dr Padmakar Singh told TOI, "1 person died of the disease on Monday evening while another died here on Tuesday morning [22 Jul 2014]." The 2 persons had developed acute gastroenteritis (one of the symptoms of cholera) that had led to their death. He added that 2 medical teams have been pressed into service to take care of patients undergoing treatment at the community health center.

The CMO further maintained that initial report indicated [that a] supply of contaminated water [was] behind the spread of disease besides unhygienic conditions also prevailing in the village. Apart from health officials, 2 special constituted medical teams were campaigning in the area and carrying out examination of villagers. The officials, however, maintained that the situation in the village was under control as people are being advised to take precautions while consuming water. They were also told about the measures that are helpful in checking the status of potable water.

Health authorities have also distributed medicines in the village and set up a makeshift dispensary. Meanwhile, the district administration is ascertaining the source of water that was consumed by the villagers after which they fell ill.
