News of the response
General strike in Beni
----------------------
Following the violence that occurred this Sat 22 Sep 2018 in Beni, the civil society had called the population to respect 5 days of general strike ["ville morte"] to protest the violence. They demanded that all commercial activity and all activities of the response be halted during this period. On Tue 25 Sep 2018, the coordinator of the response, Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, and the mayor of the city of Beni invited the president of the civil society of Beni to explain the dangers of stopping the response for a whole week. After the meeting, understanding the severity of the epidemic, Beni's civil society president announced that all the response teams, from both the government and partner organizations, could continue to work during these general strike days. Thus, field activities should be able to resume in Beni from Wed 26 Sep 2018 if the security conditions are met.

Medical care
------------
- To date [Tue 25 Sep 2018], 39 patients have been treated with mAb 114, Remdesivir, or Zmapp. Of these 39 patients, 19 are cured and have been discharged, 12 have died and 8 are still hospitalized.

Surveillance
------------
- To date [Tue 25 Sep 2018], 5 572 092 travelers have been checked at the various entry points set up.

Vaccination
------------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 11 773 people have been vaccinated, including 4122 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3652 in Beni [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 884 in Butembo [North Kivu], 803 in Katwa [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 164 in Komanda, 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy), and 60 in Tchomia [Ituri].

[According to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6209169/Congo-says-Ebola-efforts-resume-deadly-attack.html, Congo's health ministry says efforts to contain the latest Ebola outbreak can resume Wed 26 Sep 2018 in a key community where a deadly rebel attack over the weekend caused work to be suspended. However, according to https://actualite.cd/2018/09/26/rdc-beni-insecurite-et-ebola-au-menu-des-discussions-entre-paluku-et-la-societe-civile, insecurity and Ebola are on the agenda of discussions between the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku and civil society. The governor of North Kivu is trying to persuade members of civil society to suspend their declared strike in Beni. Civil society members temporarily withdrew from the meeting room to agree on the answer to be given to the governor of the city.

The situation is such high risk for healthcare workers and civilians, as well as a serious threat of international spread, that it may be time for the WHO to consider declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which is a formal declaration by the WHO promulgated by that body's Emergency Committee operating under International Health Regulations (IHR). This is defined as an extraordinary event which is determined, as provided in these Regulations: "to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease; and to potentially require a coordinated international response." This definition implies a situation that: "is serious, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border; and may require immediate international action" (excerpted from http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/pheic/en/). - Mod.LK]

[2] Save the Children effort
Date: Tue 25 Sep 2018
Source: Save the Children [edited]
https://www.savethechildren.net/article/save-children-statement-new-ebola-case-ituri-drc-near-ugandan-border


Save the Children is concerned at the news of 5 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) confirmed over the last few days, 2 of which were identified in the health zone of Tchomia, in Ituri province. Located on Lake Albert, Tchomia is 62 km [approx. 38.5 mi] south of the provincial capital of Bunia, close to the Uganda border, and approximately 200 km [124 mi] from the DRC's 10th Ebola outbreak in Beni, North Kivu.

Save the Children is working in close coordination with the DRC government, UN agencies, international aid organisations and local health providers to contain the spread of Ebola. The organisation is specifically working in community outreach to reduce fears of the disease, offering information and techniques on how families can protect themselves against the virus.

While fear and misunderstanding of EVD has made community acceptance of aid organisations like Save the Children difficult, the organisation has already reached more than 254 000 people with its vital messaging.

"Our Community Health Workers are doing a tremendous job visiting families door to door and alleviating fears of Ebola," said Heather Kerr, Save the Children's Country Director in DRC.

"If people get to a treatment centre in time they have a good chance of surviving. Yet families have seen some patients entering the centres and not coming out, sparking fear among the community, which can cause some people presented with symptoms to flee. These last identified cases--a known contact from Beni, found in Tchomia--reinforces how critical Save the Children's work is in and around Beni."

Save the Children are also supporting communities and authorities in Uganda to prepare in case Ebola spreads across the border, by installing handwashing facilities and training village health teams.

[3] Unrest disrupts control effort
Date: Tue 25 Sep 2018
Source: UN News [extracted, edited]
https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1020392


A "perfect storm" of active conflict and traumatized communities in Ebola-affected areas of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could enable the deadly disease to spread, but there are "no plans" to pull UN workers out of the country despite concerns for their security, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Tue 25 Sep 2018].

"We are now extremely concerned, that several factors may be coming together over the next weeks to months to create a potential perfect storm," said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response. "A perfect storm of active conflict, limiting our ability to access civilians, distress by segments of the community, already traumatized by decades of conflict and of murder."

The senior WHO official's comments follow a spate of attacks, including one that killed at least 21 civilians on [Sat 22 Sep 2018] in the city of Beni, where WHO's Ebola-response teams are based. "We've seen attacks now on 24 Aug, 3, 9, 11, 16, 21 Sep [2018] and most recently and most dramatically 22 Sep [2018] in the city itself of Beni," he said. He said that Beni was the base for the agency's base for the 'entire operation'.

Apart from the worrying targeting of civilians, Dr. Salama expressed concern that in the aftermath of the latest attack, outraged communities had declared Beni a "ville morte" so that mourners can grieve, effectively suspending UN operations.

"We've heard this morning, that 'ville morte', which was yesterday [Mon 24 Sep 2018], has now been extended right through to [Fri 28 Sep 2018] of this week," he said, "which basically means for the UN family, including WHO, a lockdown in Beni. Our operations are in effect suspended."

The development meant that on [Mon 24 Sep 2018], WHO staff were able to reach only 20% of the contacts they wanted to, in and around Beni, Dr. Salama said.

Butembo could also declare a "ville morte" in coming days in sympathy with the people of Beni, he said, potentially increasing the chances of the situation deteriorating rapidly. "If we do see unsafe burials that can't be responded to and symptomatic people that can't be accessed, we can see this situation deteriorating very quickly," Dr. Salama said.

Speaking to journalists at the UN in Geneva, Dr. Salama noted that the international response to the major public health threat had been excellent and that donors have responded "very quickly and generously" to this latest outbreak, which is DRC's tenth since the 1970s.

This progress risks being undone by the uptick in violence in the Kivu region, which is home to more than 100 armed groups, he said, before noting that neighbouring countries now also face an increased risk of the disease spreading.

"We call on the international community to continue to fund the response," he said, "both in North Kivu, but also, and this is increasingly important, in the neighbouring provinces of the Kivus and Ituri, and in surrounding countries."

"There are no plans for WHO or UN staff to pull out," he added. "You know the UN philosophy is to stay and deliver under all circumstances unless we become direct targets of violence."

Salama: "I don't believe...we can stop Ebola without a very significant presence of UN and partners, despite the fact that the Ministry of Health has exerted great leadership and is doing an extremely good job in this response," he added.
