Foot & mouth disease in Ramat Magshimim
----------------------------------------
1. On Thursday, 1 Jun 2011, a suspicion of FMD was reported from a
cattle fattening unit in Moshav Ramat Magshimim, southern Golan
Heights, eastern to the Sea of Tiberias and 3 km [2 miles] from the
Syrian border. The unit includes about 750 bull-calves of various
breeds and ages.

2. From samples, sent to the Department of virology at the Kimron
Veterinary Institute [KVI], Beit-Dagan, FMD virus has been isolated
this morning [5 Jun 2011]; serotyping not yet accomplished.

3. A zone in radius of 10 km [6 mi] around the outbreak [within
Israel's territory], has been declared infected; see map at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/684E7D2D-F571-468D-81D1-E06742222254/0/ramat_magshimim_1611.jpg
[The map includes the 3 km (2 mi; yellow) and 10 km zone (blue)
circles around the focus].

4. All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats, issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10-km zone, are
void.

5. In entrances to the quarantined farms, disinfection drive-through
pools for vehicle wheels should be activated.

[The circular includes additional information and guidelines such as
surveillance activities, revaccinations, special arrangements for
slaughter within the region etc. - Mod.AS]

[This is the 8th outbreak of FMD in Israel during 2011. The
accumulated list of outbreaks is the following:

Location/District/Starting date/species
1. Bet Zera/ North/ 1 Mar/ cattle
2. Yavneel/ North/ 21 Apr/ cattle
3. Tuba-Zangariyya/ North/ 6 May/ cattle, sheep, goats
4. Senir/ North/ 8 May/ cattle
5. Sharona/ North/ 11 May/ cattle, sheep
6. Kefar Szold/ North/ 17 May/ cattle
7. Beeri area/ South/ Mid May?*/ sheep, goats
8. Ramat Magshimim/ North/ 2nd half May?*/ cattle

(*No OIE data yet)

7 of the outbreaks, including the one reported in this posting, are
located in north-east Israel within Hazafon (=northern) province,
adjacent to the Lebanese, Syrian, and Jordanian borders. The first 7
isolates (of which 6 in the north, one in the south) have been
serotyped by KVI as FMDV-O. Serotyping of the 8th, current outbreak
has not been published yet, and is requested. It will not be
surprising if this isolate is similar to the other isolated in the
northern cluster, of which one isolate (from outbreak 1, Bet Zera),
has already been genotyped by the WRLFMD as Topotype ME-SA, strain
PanAsia-2(ant-10) (very close to Turkish and Bulgarian strains).

However, in view of the information on other serotypes and strains
circulating in the Middle East, continuous vigilance is being applied;
further information on the isolates collected since April 2011 and
their genotyping results, if available, will be appreciated.

The timing of 2011 outbreaks falls in line with the accumulated
information on FMD's significant seasonality in Israel, starting
Jan-March, peaking in April-May during infected years. During the
years 1974 -- 2010, 13 years remained, reportedly, free of FMD
outbreaks. The most prevalent serotype was FMDV-O (recorded during 20
"infected years"). Serotype Asia 1 was recorded in 1984 and 1989;
serotype A in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 2009.

It will be interesting to note if the recent outbreak in the south,
adjacent to the Gaza strip and to Egypt (Sinai), has been caused by
the same PanAsia-2(ant-10) (northern) strain. In 2009, WRLFMD
genotyped the FMDV circulating in Egypt as topotype ME-SA, strain
Sharquia-72.

Information on the current FMDV situation in Syria, Lebanon and
Jordan will be helpful.
