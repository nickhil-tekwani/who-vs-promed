The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) confirmed this weekend [7-8 Apr 2012] that a production lot of Beef Burger Meat Mix 80/20, recalled on 6 Apr 2012 by Intercity Packers (East) Ltd, was the source of an outbreak of salmonellosis that sickened 50 people in Ottawa during March [2012].

The Ottawa outbreak victims, including 40 children ranging in age from 15 months to 18 years, consisted mainly of students and staff at a day care and at more than a dozen schools in the Ottawa area. 3 people were hospitalized as a result of their infections.

The outbreak was traced to The Lunch Lady, a caterer that supplied lunches to the affected schools and to the day care facility. Investigations carried out at the catering premises revealed the presence of _S._ Typhimurium in a 13 Mar 2012 sample of frozen uncooked ground beef, and the presence of _S._ Heidelberg in raw chicken sampled on 15 Mar 2012.

Traceback investigations identified the contaminated beef as having originated from Intercity Packers (East) Ltd., located in Mississauga, Ontario.

The recalled meat, identified as Intercity Packers Ltd Brand Beef Burger Meat Mix 80/20, was sold in 5 kg cases (each containing 2 x 2.5 kg units) bearing UPC 90066172180172 and lot code 046. The affected product can be identified by the Establishment number (EST) 503 that appears on the outer cases. The chubs inside the case do not carry any label. The product was distributed to public and commercial food establishments in Ontario and Newfoundland, and possibly also to retailers in Newfoundland.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency reports that Ontario and local public health authorities are participating in the outbreak investigation, including in parts of southern Ontario outside of Ottawa. Neither the total number of illnesses nor geographic locations where other suspected outbreak-related illnesses are under investigation have been revealed. PHAC has described the outbreak as comprising "more than 50 illnesses" in Ontario.

On 2 Mar 2012, Toronto Public Health reported an unusually high incidence of salmonellosis, 114 cases during the 1st 2 months of 2012. Included in these cases were an outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium illnesses among attendees at a large catered event in York Region that took place on 11 Feb 2012, and a separate outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg illnesses that across the Greater Toronto Area.

The recalled Beef Burger Mix was identified as bearing lot code 046, which indicates that it likely was produced on 15 Feb 2012, too late to be responsible for the 11 Feb 2012 York Region outbreak cluster of _S._ Typhimurium infections, even if burgers were on the menu at the event.

It would not be unusual, depending on the findings of the investigation, for the recall to be expanded to include additional production lots predating or subsequent to the lot that already has been recalled.
