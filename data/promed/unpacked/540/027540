Mosquito-borne St. Louis encephalitis [virus] has been identified in Butte County for the first time since 1969, according to the Butte County Mosquito and Vector Control District.

The disease [virus] was found in a group of mosquitoes collected near Honcut. The disease is similar to West Nile virus. Most people who get it show no symptoms, but in extreme cases it can cause death or permanent disability.

There is no cure for either disease. The only way to avoid the diseases is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The district recommends people use insect repellent, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outside, and avoid outdoor activities and dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.

[Active St. Louis encephalitis [SLE] virus transmission is occurring in several locations in California this year (2017). It has now been detected in mosquitoes in Butte County after an absence of 48 years. Fortunately, no human cases have been reported there or elsewhere in California so far this summer. SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005.

Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report. Avoidance of mosquito bites is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents.
