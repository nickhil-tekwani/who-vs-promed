This 14 Oct 2022 the Ministry of Health (MINSA) issued an epidemiological alert to the personnel of health establishments nationwide due to the frequent occurrence of cases of intoxication by methanol in Metropolitan Lima and Callao in order to identify the source of exposure and implement immediate control measures.

"As reported in AE 21-2022, cases of methanol poisoning have been reported since 28 Aug 2022. As of 13 Oct 2022, a total of 117 cases have been reported in 9 hospitals in Metropolitan Lima and Callao, of which 46% are deceased.

"Of the total cases, 79% were confirmed by clinical diagnosis and 21% by laboratory; 89% were male. The ages of the cases range between 18 and 64 years, with a mean of 41 years; 62% are adults aged 30-59 years, and 84% of cases have a history of chronic alcoholism."

MINSA explained, according to place of residence, the cases are distributed in 18 districts of Metropolitan Lima and Callao, and 80.2% are concentrated in the jurisdiction of Diris Lima Norte. The national health authority also reported as of 12 Oct 2022 there are known cases of alcoholic intoxication in the Hu√°nuco region, which are currently under investigation.

This type of intoxication is due to the consumption of adulterated alcoholic beverages in substitution for ethanol or due to deficiencies in the distillation process, which has given rise to massive intoxications. Among the neurological complications associated with this intoxication are the following:

- Visual disturbances (blindness)
- Cerebral basal ganglia ischemia or hemorrhage
- Parkinsonism
- Cerebral edema
- Early seizures
- Coma

Additionally, there are other sequelae that, despite early hemodialysis treatment, persist over time, for example, movement disorders due to involvement of the basal ganglia.

Other clinical manifestations and laboratory findings include:

- Clinical manifestations:
1. Mild to moderate intoxication: headache, dizziness, lethargy, confusion
2. Severe intoxication: coma, convulsions
3. Vision: red eyes, poorly reactive pupils to light, blurred vision, altered visual field, blindness
4. Gastrointestinal tract: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

- Laboratory findings:
1. Metabolic acidosis (with high anion gap): approximately 12-30 hours after ingestion
2. Elevated serum amylase

According to the National Center for Epidemiology, Disease Prevention and Control (CDC-MINSA), the differences are as follows:

- Suspected case: person with a clinical picture of alcohol intoxication
- Confirmed case:
1. By clinical criteria: person with clinical manifestations consistent with methanol intoxication
2. By laboratory criteria: all suspected cases with positive dose of methanol in the blood

[Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until some time after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Methanol is also known as wood alcohol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid, early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH [alcohol dehydrogenase], but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10-20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL [1 oz] of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.
