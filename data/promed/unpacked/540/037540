A 42-year-old man died from bubonic plague in the Lambayeque [Peru] region. He had contracted the disease in the Salas district, as confirmed by the Regional Health Management.

The head of Epidemiology, Dafne Moreno Paico, indicated that the Peruvian citizen likely acquired the disease by the bite of a flea infected with the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ in the Moistures Alto de Salas sector on [Fri 29 Jun 2018]. Moreno noted that the patient, who had been living in the USA for 7 years, was admitted to the Regional Hospital of Lambayeque, where doctors confirmed bubonic plague, which later developed into septicemic plague. The specialist said that the citizen had high fever and malaise, which complicated his health, leading to his death.

Dafne Moreno said that, for 20 years, no deaths from this disease were reported in this region following the outbreak of plague occurring in several areas of Morrope; several people died in that outbreak.

[Lambayeque is a region in northwestern Peru known for its rich Moche and Chimu historical past. The region's name originates from the ancient pre-Inca civilization of the Lambayeque. It can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambayeque_Region. - Mod.LL]

A relative of the deceased and a patient of the Regional Hospital presented some symptoms, but the immediate analysis ruled out the disease. A total of 120 people from the Lambayeque [Peru] region remain under surveillance after having had contact with the 42-year-old patient, who died after presenting symptoms of bubonic and septicemic plague.

The head of the Epidemiological Area of the Regional Health Management, Dafne Moreno, said that after a census of the patient's contacts, 89 people in the Regional Hospital, 16 relatives, and 15 in the clinic, where [the patient] was initially attended, were identified. He said that all were evaluated by specialists, and each person will receive the corresponding week-long treatment to prevent the disease. A relative of the deceased and a patient of the Regional Hospital presented fever, but the immediate analysis ruled out the disease; this is expected to be reconfirmed by the National Institute of Health.

"The probabilities of transmission (due to septicemic plague) are few, given that the patient has not had major respiratory manifestations that could allow him to exhale the bacterium. Obviously, all precautions must be taken, and that is why all of them are given the corresponding treatment," he explained. Moreno also indicated that surveillance and vector-control actions are continuing in different parts of the region in order to prevent the spread of the _Yersinia pestis_ bacteria, which causes bubonic plague, a disease usually transmitted by the bite of fleas from sick rodents.

On [Thu 12 Jul 2018], representatives of the Regional Health Management met with professionals from the National Health Institute and the National Health Strategy of Zoonosis of Minsa, who will provide technical assistance to strengthen these preventative activities.

The Regional Health Management confirmed on [Thu 12 Jul 2018] the death of a Peruvian patient, who for 7 years had been living in the USA. He arrived in Lima [Peru] and then visited the Salas district. There he was apparently bitten by a flea from a rodent. On [Wed 4 Jul 2018], he went to a clinic, which referred him to the Regional Hospital Lambayeque for his acute condition. However, one day later he died.

[_Yersinia pestis_ is endemic in parts of South America. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. Only if spread to the lungs occurs can the infection spread from person to person. However, if one acquires the infection by the respiratory route, this pneumonia is infectious as well. - Mod.LL
