Strange disease kills 5 in Bushenyi
-----------------------------------
5 children have died in the last week following an outbreak of a strange
disease that hit Katerera sub-county in Bunyaruguru. Residents in the area
have expressed concern over the disease.
Speaking to The Monitor in Kakindo village on Sunday, the sub-county vice
chairperson, Ms Patricia Kyabashasha, said the symptoms include vomiting or
a running stomach [diarrhea]. The patient dies within 6 to 7 hours. "Its
not cholera. It's a disease yet to be [identified]," she added.
Kabashasha said that some children develop complications in the chest. She
advised parents in the sub-county to rush their children to nearby health
units at Kyamuhunga and Ishaka should they fall sick.
Kyabashasha identified the affected villages as Nyakagyezi, Katerera
trading centre and Mwogyera. She appealed for intervention by authorities
before the situation gets out of hand.
The district director of health services (DDHS), Dr Charles Katurebe has
promised to visit the area and cross-check the facts concerning the
allegations. This is the 2nd strange disease to hit the area in a short
time. Recently, another strange disease hit Queen Elizabeth National Game
Park, killing hundreds of hippopotami and Uganda kobs [a type of African
antelope].

[The description of the clinical illness is not specific enough (vomiting
and diarrhea with death within 6-7 hours) to hazard a differential
diagnosis of the etiology, as these may represent a very large spectrum of
illnesses, including malaria and measles as well as diseases of the cholera
and dysentery family. Information on the total number of cases (including
non-fatal cases) is not provided, nor are there estimates on the size of
population at risk of illness. The article also refers to the
as-yet-unresolved outbreak among hippopotami in the nearby region; ProMED
postings on that subject are referenced below. More information on this
current outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
