A case of bird flu was confirmed on Wednesday [2 Jan 2013] morning in a poultry farm in Sitapaila in the 3rd such occurrence in just over a week in the capital.

According to Narayan Prasad Ghimire, a senior veterinarian at the Directorate of Animal Health (DoAH), bird flu virus was detected in a poultry farm jointly owned by Prem Manandhar and Rajendra Budhathoki in Sitapaila-1. A DoAH team culled 2640 bird flu-tainted chickens and destroyed 550 eggs at the farm this morning [2 Jan 2013], Ghimire said, adding that another 200 chickens had died Tuesday [1 Jan 2013] night due to avian influenza.

The poultry farm lies some 500 meters from another farm owned by Surya Mohan Pokharel in Sitapaila-1, where some 2240 chickens were destroyed on 26 Dec 2012 after the virus was detected in the farm. Before that, the disease was confirmed at Subir Singh Basnet's farm at Ramkot-6, where all 2500 chickens died. Veterinary technicians destroyed over 19 000 eggs from the farm.

All 3 infected poultry farms lie within less than one km distance [from each other].

[From official sources, we are gratefully informed that the number of birds destroyed is not exactly same as published in the above news report, but the information regarding the outbreak is correct. Outbreaks in these 3 farms are epidemiologically linked, so it is regarded as a single event which continued in 3 farms, one after another, reported to the OIE (see 20121229.1474284). Control operations were carried out in all of them.
