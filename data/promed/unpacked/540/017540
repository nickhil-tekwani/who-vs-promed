national level, probable cases are reported by all countries except
the United States of America, which is reporting suspected cases
under investigation.
2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by
the national public health authorities.
3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in
which local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas
are provided on the list of affected areas
4. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.

since the last update. - Mod.MPP]
[C] Update 34 - Unanswered questions: a critical point in the
evolution of SARS - 19 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_19/en/>
As probable SARS cases continue to be reported from a growing number
of countries, WHO is taking stock of what is known about the new
disease, particularly concerning its mode of spread, and what remains
a puzzle.
The agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified. The
SARS virus is a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or
animal virus in the Coronavirus family. Because the virus is new,
much about its behaviour is poorly understood. Key questions, which
are undergoing intense study, include stages in the course of
infection when virus shedding may be highest, and the various
concentrations of virus in different body fluids. Scientists are also
working to determine the amount of time the virus can survive in the
environment on both dry surfaces and in suspension, including in
faecal matter.
The vast majority of countries reporting probable SARS cases are
dealing with a small number of imported cases. Experience has shown
that when these cases are promptly detected, isolated, and managed
according to strict procedures of infection control, further spread
to hospital staff and family members either does not occur at all or
results in a very small number of secondary infections. These
experiences confirm abundant early evidence that the SARS virus
spreads, in the vast majority of cases, through exposure to
respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact.
However, information now emerging from outbreaks in Hong Kong and
Canada is raising some important new questions about SARS. In Hong
Kong, a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases (321)
seen in residents of the Amoy Gardens housing estate has raised the
possibility of transmission from an environmental source.
In addition, reports from Hong Kong health authorities indicate that
patients in this cluster depart in some ways from the previously
established clinical picture. The disease appears to be more severe
both in Amoy residents and in related cases among hospital staff.
Around 20 percent of Amoy-related cases require intensive care,
compared with 10 percent seen in non-Amoy cases. Some deaths are now
occurring in younger, previously healthy persons as well as in the
elderly and persons with underlying disease. Around 66 percent of
Amoy Gardens patients present with diarrhoea as a symptom, compared
with 2 to 7 percent of cases in other outbreaks.
Speculation centres on whether these cases represent infection with
high virus loads, as might occur following exposure to a concentrated
environmental source, or whether the virus may have mutated into a
more virulent form. Viruses in the Coronavirus family are known to
mutate frequently.
In Canada, concern has centred around a cluster of 31 suspect and
probable cases in members of a charismatic religious group, the
health care workers who have treated them, and close family and
social contacts. The outbreak is particularly disturbing because of
its potential to move into the wider community. Large meetings of the
religious group at 2 events, on 28 and 29 Mar 2003, may have led to
multiple additional exposures, especially among the members of this
close-knit religious group.
Intense contact tracing, home quarantine, and close follow-up by
health officials may work to prevent further spread of cases in the
general community. The index case in this cluster has been traced to
contact, in a hospital emergency room, with a subsequently fatal SARS
case. The outbreak is regarded as a test case of whether rigorous
contact tracing and other stringent public health measures can
contain further spread even when very large numbers of persons may
have been exposed.
This index case has also been linked to 3 of 4 SARS cases
concentrated in the same block of a 247-unit condominium in Toronto.
As the fourth case could not be linked to direct contact with a SARS
patient, some speculation arose concerning possible environmental
contamination within the building as the source of the fourth
infection. However, all 4 cases occurred in early April, with 4 Apr
2003 being the date of onset of the fourth case. The incubation
period has now passed with no further cases detected. There appears
to be little risk that the case arose from an environmental source.
Viet Nam
A week has passed since Viet Nam officials reported a new probable
case of SARS. No new deaths have occurred during this period. The
situation in Hanoi seems to have stabilized. Following the
introduction of infection control measures in the French Hospital,
the transmission of SARS appears to have been contained. 10 patients
are now listed as recovering from SARS, none of whom is listed as in
critical condition.
The Vietnamese government is considering closing its land border with
China in an attempt to prevent the importation of SARS cases. In a
proposal submitted to the Prime Minister by the Ministry of Health,
the 1130 kilometre border with China would be sealed indefinitely to
overland visitors.
WHO officials in Viet Nam said earlier this week that while Viet Nam
appears to have controlled the SARS outbreak within its borders, it
still faces the threat of massive importation of the disease from
China.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3547 cases with 182 deaths have
been reported from 25 countries. Compared with yesterday, 12 new
deaths, all in Hong Kong SAR, have been reported.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 19 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 19 Apr 2003, there are an additional 31 patients confirmed
to have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals
earlier. They include 2 healthcare workers (both from Alice Ho Miu
Ling Nethersole Hospital). The remaining 29 were other patients and
contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 363 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and
have been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 41 were
discharged today. 109 patients are receiving treatment in intensive
care unit.
12 patients died in Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH), Princess Margaret
Hospital (PMH), Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), Tseung Kwan O
Hospital (TKO), Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) and United Christian Hospital
(UCH). This brought to 81 the total number of deaths relating to
atypical pneumonia. The deceased include 7 men, aged from 71 to 86,
who have a history of chronic diseases. The remaining are 3 men and 2
women, aged between 37 and 75. [only one of the deaths occurred in an
individual less than 50 years of age - Mod.MPP]
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
[the cumulative no. of deaths is presented in the total line, but is
not available by type of individual/exposure - Mod.MPP]
Nature: Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths*
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 311/ 112/
Patients, family members & visitors: 1047/ 251/
Total: 1358/ 363/ 81
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a
relatively late stage of infection.
[The document with preliminary findings of the investigation of the
Amoy Gardens outbreak can be found at:
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>. We apologize for not including
this in yesterday's update where the results of this investigation
were presented and discussed. - Mod.MPP]

SARS Situation Update 19 Apr 2003
As of 19 Apr 2003, 3 additional SARS patients have been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to
100. 61 SARS patients remain hospitalised. There are 5 additional
SARS cases reported today. They are:
1. 21 year-old female nurse of [National University Hospital] NUH
Ward 64 who was a contact of a SARS patient. The SARS patient was
admitted to NUH on 8 April, transferred to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital]
TTSH on 9 Apr 2003 and died on 12 Apr 2003
2. 37-year old male inpatient of [Singapore General Hospital] SGH Ward 58
3. 52-year old housewife Investigations are underway to determine
the source of infection
4. 54-year old male who drives a taxi - it is highly likely that the
couple he ferried on 5 Apr 2003 included the brother of the "index"
patient of the SGH Ward 57&58 cluster. The brother was accompanied by
his wife. The brother with his wife worked at the Pasir Panjang
Wholesale Market. He was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003 as a probable
SARS, transferred to TTSH on 9 Apr 2003 and died on 12 Apr 2003. The
brother's wife became ill on 8 Apr 2003 and was admitted to TTSH on
10 Apr 2003. She was diagnosed a probable SARS on 15 Apr 2003.
5. 45-year old male who works at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Center --
became unwell on 8 Apr 2003. It is likely that he was infected at his
workplace as the brother of the "index" patient of the SGH Ward 57&58
cluster works at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market. Contact tracing
is underway.
A 72 year old male who works at the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market
became unwell on 18 Apr 2003 and was admitted to TTSH on 19 Apr 2003
as a suspect SARS. [People who were in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale
Market on 5 Apr 2003 from 1 AM to 11 AM, 7 Apr 2003 from 7 AM to 9
AM, 8 Apr 2003 from 6 AM to 9 AM and are symptomatic have been
requested to call a hotline and an ambulance will be sent for them]
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market will be closed as from 10.30 PM for a
period of 3 days in the first instance.

A summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 100
Hospitalised: 61
Deaths: 14 + 2 (pending further post mortem test results)
Total: 177
Suspected: 77 (including 5 children below 18)

[A] Saudi Arabia from News24.com 19 Apr 2003 11:25 SA
<http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Sars/0,,2-10-1488_1349510,00.html>
Saudi Arabia reported its first suspected case of the atypical
pneumonia Sars on Saturday - a Philippine national who returned to
the kingdom the day before. The man, who arrived on a Singapore
Airlines flight into the western city of Jeddah, was taken for tests
and will be subjected to precautionary isolation for 10 days.
"Initial medical tests for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(Sars) have been negative. But the man will be kept under observation
for further checkups," Merghalani told AFP. Al-Eqtissadiah newspaper
said on Saturday that the flight crew reported the Filipino's case to
airport authorities after he was seen coughing abnormally. Tests
conducted at the airport's special isolation room showed the
functions of his respiratory system and lungs were normal, the paper
said.
[B] Canada, British Columbia from Maple Ridge Pitt Meadows News 19
Apr 2003
<http://www.mytelus.com/news/article.do?pageID=community/mapleridge&articleID=1313812>

A nurse who cared for an elderly woman now in Surrey Memorial
Hospital with a probable case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) has been hospitalized after showing symptoms of the disease.
The 44-year-old nurse, who cared for the woman at Royal Columbian
Hospital (RCH) when she returned to [British Columbia] BC from Hong
Kong, is the fourth probable case of SARS in the province and is
believed to be the first person to have contracted the virus in BC.
Dr. Rob Parker, deputy medical health officer with the Fraser Health
Authority (FHA), said the nurse followed the appropriate infection
control procedures while dealing with her patient -- such as wearing
a mask, gloves, and gown. As a result of the apparent transmission,
the provincial medical health officer recommended that health care
workers in contact with probable SARS patients now wear protective
eye goggles at all times. Previously, goggles were only required for
certain procedures, such as suctioning breathing tubes.

[In today's worldwide update there were 86 new cases and 12 new
deaths reported in the past 24 hours. All new deaths were reported
from Hong Kong, where 7 of the 12 had a history of chronic illness,
and one of the deaths was in an otherwise healthy individual less
than 50 years of age. Not all countries with known cases have
reported updates in the past 24 hours so numbers may vary greatly
when the updates are received.
The WHO worldwide update [C] is an excellent discussion of key issues
of concern that are pending; most notably related to chains of
transmission in Hong Kong and potentially in Ontario, Canada, where
extensive community exposure has potentially occurred. The newswires
have been filled with articles related to SARS in Ontario with rumors
galore about potential other areas of contact and spread. In
addition, there is mention of 2 suspected cases where transmission
route has not been determined. (We do not know if those newswire
reports are related to the information discussed in the WHO update in
[1][C] above or if these are new cases not previously described.) We
await further information from official sources on the actual
situation in Ontario Canada.
The newswires mention the first contact spread in British Columbia in
a health care worker taking care of a SARS patient. The actual dates
of onset of the illness in this health care worker were earlier this
week, and the case has been officially reported, it is just the
details of contact transmission that are new in this newswire, and
the change in recommendation to include routine wearing of goggles as
part of infection control procedures.
There was an additional newswire not included of a suspected case in
Jordan meeting the clinical criteria, but not meeting the travel or
contact with traveller from SARS affected area or known SARS case.
This was noteworthy as a demonstration of the implementation of
disease surveillance activities to detect clinically compatible cases
meeting the SARS clinical definition in many countries that have not
as yet identified SARS cases. - Mod.MPP]
