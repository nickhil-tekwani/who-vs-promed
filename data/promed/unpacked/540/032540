A 63 year-old Rhode Island woman experienced fevers of >104 F following a
tick bite, and was subsequently found to have contracted babesiosis and
Lyme disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory blood tests. The
case occurred during July of 1999.
Although Lyme disease is well recognized in this region, Rhode Island has
reported an average of only 2 cases of babesiosis per year since the
disease was identified there in 1994. This year South County Hospital has
already treated 12 cases, and Westerly Hospital has treated 6 cases.
Commenting on the diagnosis of babesiosis, Dr. Thomas Maher, director of
the University of Rhode Island's Center for Vector-borne Disease is quoted
as saying, "it clearly seems as though there's been a bit of an outbreak."
Rhode Island health officials do not think that there has been a large
increase in actual babesiosis cases, but rather suspect that increased
awareness among regional physicians has resulted in increased diagnosis and
reporting of cases.
Most of Rhode Island's babesiosis cases have been reported in South County.
This year, the severe drought conditions have reduced the tick
populations, so the number of cases may have already peaked, according to
state health officials.
