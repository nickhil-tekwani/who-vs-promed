H5N5, a new, highly pathogenic sub-type of bird flu, has been found on several turkey farms in northern Germany, adding to concerns of the spreading of new strains of avian influenza.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany's national institute for animal health, discovered H5N5 on 21 Jan 2017 at 4 different locations, all owned by the same company, in Steinburg, in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. 1st, a farmer found a number of dead turkeys at a site housing 3400 birds. The virus then spread to a larger facility housing 15 000 birds, according to the news agency Kieler Nachrichten. The birds were culled in an attempt to stop the virus, but on Thursday [26 Jan 2017], the Schleswig-Holstein Agriculture Minister Robert Habeck stated that 2 more nearby farms with another 15 000 birds had been infected and would also have to be culled. Preventive measures, including closing down the sites, have been put in place to contain the virus, according to Habek.

Habek described the new subtype, which has never been found in European poultry, as "highly aggressive," noting that it killed more than half of the flock of 3400 birds where it was 1st discovered within 48 hours, with the rest of the turkeys having shown disease symptoms. H5N5 had already been found in wild geese in Germany and in wild birds in the Netherlands, Italy, Montenegro, Croatia and Israel.

"This discovery shows how dynamic the bird flu is. The virus is still present and is changing," Habeck told Deutsche Welle.

There hasn't been a known case of H5N5 being contracted by humans, according to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. In China, a different subtype of the virus, H7N9, has jumped to humans, sickening more than 1000 people and killing nearly 40 percent of those who contracted the illness.

Since October [2017], poultry flocks in 23 European countries have been hit by a different subtype of avian influenza, H5N8, which led to the culling of more than 1.5 million poultry so far, according to Reuters.

[Germany has duly reported to the OIE about HPAI H5N5 affecting wildfowl and commercial poultry farms. See the 'immediate notification' submitted on 24 Jan 2017, published by ProMED-mail, with commentary, in 20170125.4791590.

According to the information from the Schleswig-Holstein Agriculture Minister, included in the above media report, HPAI H5N5 has been recorded in wildfowl in Israel. The source of this information and its confirmation, or otherwise, are requested. Israel submitted on 24 Jan 2016 its 5th follow-report on the HPAI H5N8 event, which has been spreading throughout the country, specifying 9 species of wildfowl recently found infected in 3 locations (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=22541).

The new HPAI H5N5 has, reportedly, been identified in wild birds in the south European countries Croatia, Montenegro and Greece. Those countries are situated along flyways crossing, further southeast, Israel.

According to Germany's reference centre (FLI), so far, no human cases of HPAIV H5N8 nor of H5N5 infections have been detected worldwide. - Mod.AS
