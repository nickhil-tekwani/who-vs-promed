Since [7 Feb 2019], Public Health, Seattle and King County, has learned of 2 people from one household who got sick after eating raw blue crab from Seafood City in Tukwila on 18-19 Jan 2019. One of the sick people has laboratory-confirmed _Grimontia hollisae_, which is part of the same family as _Vibrio_ bacteria and causes a similar illness to vibriosis. One of the ill people was hospitalized, and both have since recovered.

The exact food or drink that caused the illness was not identified, though this is not uncommon for outbreaks associated with a bacterial toxin.

Here's more from Public Health:
Seattle/King County Public Health investigated a household cluster of _Grimontia hollisae_ associated with eating raw blue crab purchased live from Seafood City on 18 Jan 2019. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Public health actions:
Environmental Health investigators visited Seafood City on 12 Feb 2019. Investigators did not identify any factors that contribute to the spread of _Grimontia_ bacteria, such as incorrect refrigeration temperatures or evidence of cross-contamination. We worked with the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) Shellfish Program and Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) to investigate the source of the blue crab.

Laboratory testing:
One of the people who got sick tested positive for _Grimontia hollisae_. We do not have laboratory confirmation for the 2nd person who got sick, but symptoms are consistent with _Grimontia hollisae_ infection.

About _Grimontia hollisae_ and vibriosis:
-_Grimontia hollisae_ is a species of bacteria within the same family and closely related to _Vibrio_. It was formerly known as _Vibrio hollisae_ and resembles _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ in terms of where it lives and how it causes illness.
-_Grimontia_ and _Vibrio_ sp. are naturally occurring in marine waters. Eating undercooked or raw shellfish and other seafood (e.g., crab) is the main risk factor for getting this illness. Growth of these organisms increase in marine waters during the warmer months, which usually causes an increase of these bacteria in shellfish during the summer.

Prevention:

General advice for reducing risk of contracting _Grimontia_ or _Vibrio_:
1. Because raw seafood can be contaminated with _Grimontia_/_Vibrio_ or other organisms, always cook crab, shellfish, and other seafood before eating. Crab should be cooked until the flesh is pearly and opaque.
2. Wash cutting boards and counters used for shellfish/seafood preparation immediately after use to avoid cross-contaminating other foods.
3. Wash hands thoroughly with soap after handling raw shellfish/seafood.
4. Stay out of brackish or saltwater if you have any wounds (including scrapes and cuts), or cover your wound with a waterproof bandage to prevent a skin infection.
5. Wash wounds and cuts with soap and water if they have been exposed to seawater or raw seafood and raw seafood juices, to prevent a skin infection.
