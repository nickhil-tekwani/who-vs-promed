At least four new cases of _E. coli_ infection have been discovered in this
Ontario town, health officials said, more than a month after the deadly
bacterial outbreak was thought to have been contained. Dr Walter Ewing,
associate medical officer of health with the Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound health
unit, confirmed on Friday that 4 more people were infected by _E. coli_, as
well as 3 other patients that showed similar symptoms.
First detected by the town's water supply in mid-May, the bacteria killed 6
people and sickened an estimated 2000.
Ewing said Friday that the new cases appeared to be secondary infections in
which people contracted the disease from others. He said they weren't the
direct result of Walkerton's water supply, which now appears to be free of
_E. coli_.
The discovery comes more than a month after officials said there were no
reports of new cases in the community of 5000.

[The approximate dates of infection or relationships of the new patients to
persons who were known to be infected earlier are not clear from this
report, so it is difficult to assess the assertion that the cases are
secondary to prior infections caused by contaminated drinking water, which
is now free of contamination. - Mod.ES
