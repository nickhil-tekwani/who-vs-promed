After a lull of 3 years, the outbreak of anthrax disease in 4 mandals
[sub districts] in Chittoor district is panicking people and driving
the officials into [a] tizzy.

The disease first came to light [25 Jul 2011], when a 58 year old
resident of Musalimadugu village in Palamaner mandal was detected
positive at Palamaner hospital. Later the doctors at the hospital also
confirmed 8 cases of anthrax from the same village.

According to the information, 4 of them were shifted to Tirupati SVRR
hospital while the other 4 were referred to CMC hospital, Vellore [in
Tamil Nadu].

Meanwhile, medical and health officials confirmed 3 more cases in
Yadireddypalle Gollapalli village in Yadamarri mandal. They developed
the disease after they ate the meat of a dead wild boar. Similarly, 4
cases of anthrax from Vasanthapuram village in Gudipala mandal tested
positive and doctors said they ate beef in recent days.

According to sources, 5 people fell ill after they ate goat meat
during a Jathara in Kurmaipalle in Bagarupalem mandal [a] few months
back. They were first admitted in KGF hospital and later, shifted to a
private hospital in Bengaluru. They were suspected to be affected by
anthrax.

[Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, can be found on the maps at
http://www.maplandia.com/india/andhra-pradesh/chittoor/chittoor/ and
http://healthmap.org/r/15-Q.

Andhra Pradesh has a long Indian history of anthrax.

2005 when there were 39 livestock outbreaks involving 20 cattle and
135 sheep and goats;
2006, 46 outbreaks with 8 cattle cases and 251 sheep and goats
affected;
2007, 54 outbreaks with 35 cattle cases and 216 sheep & goats
affected;
2008, 26 outbreaks, 24 cattle cases and 51 sheep and goats affected;
2009, 7 outbreaks with 19 cattle cases and 8 outbreaks involving some
194 sheep affected;
2010 the data has yet to reach OIE in Paris.
It is similarly common in humans, this report notwithstanding.

In 2009 ProMED-mail reported 65 human cases with 17 deaths. With zoo
animals affected -- they are fed carcasses of local dead stock -- and
wildlife ('wild boar' which will have itself got infected from
scavenging dead animals) there is a significant anthrax problem in
Andhra Pradesh. The wildlife cases are possibly a spillover from the
livestock cases. This present report emphasizes this as there were
recent human cases arising from a wild boar, cattle, and goats. -
