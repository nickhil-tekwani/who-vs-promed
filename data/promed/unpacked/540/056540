Early foot-and-mouth tests prove negative
-----------------------------------------------
Initial tests carried out on a slaughtered pig with suspected
foot-and-mouth disease today proved negative. The animal, discovered at a
slaughterhouse in Leicestershire, was killed yesterday amid fears it could
have been infected with the disease thought to have been wiped out 9 months
ago.
Investigations by the Department for Environment, Agriculture and Rural
Affairs will continue into early next week before the area is declared free
from foot-and-mouth. But preliminary tests look hopeful for local farmers.
Rural workers around the village of Congerstone were told yesterday
afternoon that a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease had been
found at the Dalkins International abattoir.All animal movements within a
five-mile radius were banned and an exclusion zone was placed around the
area. The slaughterhouse, based in the centre of the village and surrounded
by dozens of farms and a zoo, was sealed off and a sign on the locked gate
read: "Notice: Foot-and-mouth disease. Please keep out". A spokeswoman for
Defra said animal movement restrictions would not be lifted until all
further tests had been carried out.

Origin of the 2001 Foot & mouth disease epidemic
------------------------------------------------
DEFRA [the Department for Environment, Rural Affairs and Food] has today
placed on its website the results of its investigations into the how the
2001 FMD epidemic started and spread.
The origin for that outbreak is considered to have been a pig finishing
unit in the North-East of England. Thereafter, disease spread via 2 routes.
First, through the movement of diseased pigs to holdings in Essex and Kent.
Second, through windborne spread of FMD virus to sheep on a neighbouring
holding followed by their subsequent sale via markets and dealers in
Northern England. In the course of these movements other sheep, people and
vehicles, became infected spreading disease widely throughout England,
Wales and the southern counties of Scotland.
The source of the virus responsible for the epidemic was most probably meat
or meat products infected or contaminated with the FMD virus but it is
unlikely that the origin of this material and the route by which it entered
the UK will ever be identified.
