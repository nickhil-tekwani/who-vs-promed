Alberta halts most mumps vaccinations due to serious allergic reactions
---------------------------------------------------
Alberta has suspended a province-wide campaign to vaccinate young
people against the mumps after 5 people suffered serious allergic
reactions for reasons that are still unknown.

Dr. Karen Grimsrud, acting chief medical officer of health, said
Tuesday [11 Dec 2007] that about 62 800 people between the ages of 17
and 26 have been vaccinated across the province since the program
began in November [2007]. Only 2 to 5 serious reactions are expected
in one million vaccinations, said Grimsrud.

"Obviously, our level of concern was great, and this is above what we
would expect to be a normal rate of anaphylaxis in MMR
(measles-mumps-rubella)," she said after the decision to suspend the
program was made in conjunction with Health Canada.

Anaphylaxis is a serious reaction that can cause
wheezing, swelling of the throat and collapse.
All 5 people, who all had a history of allergic
reactions, were treated immediately and have fully recovered.

Grimsrud stressed that most of these reactions
would happen immediately and at most 24 hours
after the vaccine, so the tens of thousands of
people who have recently been vaccinated are safe.

Millions of doses of the vaccine have been
administered in Canada since 1988, and there have
been only 21 reports of anaphylaxis following immunization.

Alberta officials have been in contact with
federal health officials since the first 3 cases
were reported 26 Nov 2007. When the 5th case came
to light Monday [10 Dec 2007], they decided to act.

All 5 cases came from one lot of vaccine, but 2
other lots were also produced from the same bulk
products. Alberta had purchased about 200 000 of
the 250 000 doses from the 3 lots made by
MerckFrosst Canada, and it was decided to suspend
the use of all of those vaccines, severely
limiting the supply in the province. They've
warned other provinces that may have bought the
other 50 000 not to use those lots.

"Health Canada will be conducting an
investigation into the root cause of this
particular serious allergic reaction to MMR
vaccine, it's highly unusual," she said. "It will
be important to know what the source or the reason is behind those reactions."

The mass vaccination program for students and
staff in post-secondary institutions started in
November [2007] after a flurry of cases were
reported in Lethbridge and Calgary. Grimsrud said
it's hoped enough people have been vaccinated to
date to stop the spread of the virus. There have
been 157 cases of the mumps in the province since
September [2007]. Grimsrud said it is interesting
to note that none of the young children who
received the vaccine from the same affected lot have had a reaction.

"It is unusual because it's in young adults, and
is there something unique about that age group
that would lead us to some information as to what
the root cause is," she said. "Until we know why
we're having problems, we won't be able to
purchase large quantities of vaccine."

The province is still conducting vaccinations for
one-year-old children from unaffected lots, said
Grimsrud. But all vaccinations for young adults
and children in kindergarten have been suspended
in order to conserve the doses. Other provinces
have also been contacted to ask for extra doses
to tide the province over until health officials
can find a new supplier, said Grimsrud.

"Regional health authorities are going to vary in
their ability to continue their one-year-old
program, because they vary in supply of the vaccine," she said.

Some health regions may have to suspend even the
vaccinations in young children for a day or 2, or
even a week, until temporary vaccines can be found, she said.

The province still hopes to re-launch
vaccinations for young adults in the new year,
but will only be able to do that when a safe supply has been found.

Mumps vaccine being probed for allergy links
Health Canada warns officials countrywide to halt
use of product after 6 Albertans suffer serious reactions
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials across the country are being
told to stop using a measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine that is now being investigated for
possible links to 6 cases of serious allergic
reactions in patients in Alberta. All 6 people,
who were treated and have fully recovered,
received an inoculation from the same batch of a
product known as MMR-II, which is sold by Merck
Frosst Canada Ltd. They experienced anaphylaxis,
a potentially fatal reaction. But the
Quebec-based company said 2 other lots of the
vaccine were made with the same material and are
affected by Health Canada's warning to suspend use until a probe is completed.

"We always take these things seriously, but this
is not a disaster," Merck spokeswoman Sheila
Murphy said yesterday [12 Dec 2007].

In total, 276 290 doses were shipped across the
country with the bulk -- more than 222 000 doses
-- ending up in Alberta, which is trying to stem
the tide of a mumps outbreak. Significant
quantities of the vaccine also wound up in
Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia. Also
affected, but in much smaller numbers, are all 4
Atlantic provinces as well as Ontario, the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

Karen Grimsrud, Alberta's acting chief medical
officer of health, said because the province's
supply has been crippled by the suspension, it
has asked other regions for extra doses while it
looks for a new supplier. Meanwhile, it has
halted the immunization campaign among young adults and kindergarten children.

Arlene King, a director-general with the Public
Health Agency of Canada, said the federal
government is working to address national supply
issues. "We are ensuring we have enough supply to
address the immediate needs in the country,
particularly related to the pediatric program and
any needs related to outbreak control," she said.
Dr. King said the agency has 2 ways to address
supply problems: reallocating vaccines between
provinces and territories and looking to other
drug manufacturers for more product.

In the meantime, no other cases of anaphylaxis
have been reported in Canada, but Merck is
looking at whether anything during the
manufacturing process might be to blame or if
there are other cases of illness elsewhere in the world.

"At this point, we haven't seen any problem," Ms.
Murphy said. "...We've come up empty-handed so far."

She, as well as public health officials, also
pointed out that at least 5 of the 6 patients who
fell ill in Alberta had a history of allergic
reactions. In Alberta, there have been 157
reported cases of mumps since September 2007, and
about 62 800 young people have been vaccinated
during the recent campaign targeting at those aged 17 to 26.

Dr. Grimsrud said none of those people should be
concerned about experiencing a possible allergic
reaction because symptoms occur immediately or,
at most, 24 hours after the injection is
received. Mumps is a viral infection of the
salivary glands. The virus is spread through
contact with any surface that has been
contaminated, or through saliva, coughing,
sneezing, sharing drinks or kissing. Symptoms,
which can take up to 7 to 10 days to appear,
typically include fever, headache, muscle aches
and loss of appetite. In rare cases, mumps can
lead to meningitis or inflammation of reproductive organs.

Health Canada spokesman Alastair Sinclair said
yesterday it's not known how long the
investigation will take. But Merck has been asked
to provide a written report on any manufacturing
or safety concerns associated with the affected
vaccine lots. Mr. Sinclair said federal officials
will also work with the drug company, as well as
the 6 Albertans who became sick. "They are going
to do some follow-up. I understand there is
nothing so far, but we want to make sure there
are no further side effects," he said.

According to Health Canada, millions of doses of
the vaccine have been administered in this
country since 1988, and there have been only 27
reports of anaphylaxis after immunization. Health
officials have been racing to immunize young
adults across the country since a mumps outbreak
was 1st detected in Atlantic Canada earlier this
year [2007, see prior ProMED-mail postings below
- Mod.MPP] and has since spread westward.

Nova Scotia, which has been the epicentre of the
outbreak and has had 744 reported cases of mumps
since February [2007], said yesterday [12 Dec
2007] that none of the 4030 affected doses it received were ever administered.

Locations of affected doses
-----------
Merck Frosst Canada has distributed 276 290 doses
of its measles, mumps and rubella vaccine across
the country that are now being investigated in
connection with 6 suspected cases of serious allergic reaction in Alberta.

All 6 cases are linked to a single lot of the
vaccine, but 2 other lots are also affected by
Health Canada's warning to suspend use until the probe ends.

Where are the affected doses?

Alberta -- 222 290
Manitoba -- 19 250
Quebec -- 17 950
British Columbia -- 8050
Nova Scotia -- 4030

Measles, Mumps and Rubella Vaccine Lots Suspended from Use
--------------------
Health Canada is advising provincial and
territorial health authorities not to use 3 lots
of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine while the
Department investigates 5 suspected cases of
anaphylaxis in Alberta patients receiving the
product. All cases were associated with lot 1529U
of the MMR-II vaccine sold by MerckFrosst Canada,
and involved young adults who had a previous
history of allergy. All the individuals recovered
upon treatment. The vaccinations took place
during a catch-up campaign for young adults in the context of a mumps
outbreak.

Health Canada has requested that MerckFrosst
Canada provide a written report on any
manufacturing or safety problems associated with
Lot 1529U or its bulk components to complement
other ongoing investigative efforts. In addition,
2 more lots (1528U and 1680U) that were made with
the same materials were also sent to Alberta for
the catch-up campaign and may be in use elsewhere
in the country. Health Canada has requested that
the use of these lots be temporarily suspended as
well. In total, approximately 200 000 doses are
affected. Other lots of the MMR-II vaccine remain
available for use throughout the country.

Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of
Canada continue to monitor the safety of the
MMR-II vaccine and will continue to inform
Canadians if new safety information arises.
Serious adverse events following MMR vaccination
are rare. Despite millions of doses of the
vaccine administered in Canada since 1988, there
have been only 21 reports of anaphylaxis following immunization.

Canadians getting MMR-II vaccinations for
themselves or their children should consult with
their physician if they have any questions or
concerns. Any serious or unexpected adverse
reactions in patients receiving the MMR-II
vaccine should be reported to their health care practitioner.

[The most recent newswire mentions 6 cases of
anaphylaxis associated with the lot of vaccine in
question, suggesting that since the original
Health Protection Agency announcement on 11 Dec
2007 there has been another case identified. One
would not be surprised to learn of a few more
cases being reported following the announcement
of the hold on vaccination (equivalent to a
recall of the vaccine) once there has been wider
dissemination of the information of the problem.
In most countries around the world, reporting of
adverse events following vaccination is done
through passive surveillance systems (the health
sector does not actively followup on all
vaccinees to learn if there have been adverse
events, but rather at the time of vaccination the
vaccinee or parent/guardian of the vaccinee is
advised to contact the health provider should
there be any adverse events occurring within 30
days following receipt of the vaccine). Hence,
the announcement of a problem with a lot of
vaccine may well lead to enhanced reporting of
adverse events after raising the awareness on the
part of the population to report such events.

According to the most recent Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the USA
recommendations for the use of MMR (Measles,
mumps and rubella vaccine), allergic reactions
(also known as "hypersensitivity reactions"), are
rare events following receipt of MMR or any of
the individual components of the vaccine
(measles, mumps or rubella vaccine alone). During
the period 1990 through 1998 (when the most
recent ACIP recommendations on MMR vaccine were
released) with more than 70 million doses of MMR
distributed in the USA, the Vaccine Adverse
Events Reporting System (VAERS) reported a rate
of possible anaphylaxis following receipt of a
measles containing vaccine of less than 1 case
per 1 million doses distributed (CDC, unpublished
data). There is also mention that there have been
reported cases of allergic reactions involving
rash, pruritus and purpura temporally associated
with receipt of the mumps component of the
vaccine, but all have been transient, mild and
self limited. (see ref 1 below).

The most recent summary of surveillance data from
the VAERS system covers the period 1991 through
2001. Unfortunately the data available in that
report do not specify how many anaphylactoid
reactions were associated with MMR vaccine (see
ref. 2 below). There is mention that during that
period, there were 452 anaphylactoid reactions
reported through the system for all vaccines
combined; there is also mention that during that
period there were 23 787 total adverse events (of
any type) reported following receipt of MMR
vaccine, with a total of 145 581 091 doses of MMR
distributed during that period.

D'Souza et al reported a single anaphylactic
reaction among approximately 1.7 million children
vaccinated in Australia during an MMR campaign,
resulting in a reported rate of 0.06 per 100 000
doses of vaccine administered, or 0.6 per 1
million doses administered. (see ref 4 below). It
should be noted that comparing the USA reported
rates and the rates reported in Australia should
be done with caution, as the USA data use the
number of doses distributed as the denominator,
whereas the Australian data use the number of
doses actually administered (which differ on the
average by approximately 20 percent, depending
upon the average wastage factor).

Of interest, in the early days of MMR vaccine,
allergic reactions to eggs were felt to be
predisposing conditions for allergic reactions to
the vaccine. In more recent times it is now felt
that the allergic reactions are more related to
the presence of gelatin or neomycin in the
vaccine. (see ref. 3, 5 - 13 below).

One wonders if the implicated lots of vaccine may
well have had higher than usual concentrations of
gelatin that would lead to a higher than usually
observed rate of anaphylaxis among the
recipients. Information on the epidemiology of
the reported events including prior history of
food or antibiotic allergies would be appreciated.
