MEASLES IN TRAVELERS RETURNED FROM BALI
A cluster of measles cases has been detected in Victoria, Australia by the
enhanced measles surveillance initiative of the Department of Human
Services, Victoria and the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference
Laboratory (VIDRL).
The first case was notified on Monday 1 March 1999 and has been confirmed
by measles IgM assay. The index case was a 21 year old returned traveler
from Bali, Indonesia. There are four more laboratory confirmed cases, two
of whom have clear epidemiological links to the index case. A number of
other epidemiologically linked cases are currently being investigated. The
infecting virus is very likely to be the same genotype D5 virus as the
measles strain that was obtained by VIDRL from a teenaged Victorian
returned traveler from Bali in January of this year (World Health
Organisation. Expanded Program on Immunization. Standardization of the
nomenclature for describing the genetic characteristics of wild type
measles virus. Weekly Epidemiological Record 1998; 73:265-9.)
Travelers to Bali should ensure that their measles vaccination is up to
date before leaving home. Other clinicians and public health jurisdictions
might expect to see similar measles activity among returned travelers from
Bali and their contacts.
