The presence of cholera in Cuzco region's communities of Sicuani and
Quillabamba has mobilized the authorities and health promotors to
emphasize before, during and after Holy Week [Semana Santa - the week
before Easter, 28 Mar - 3 Apr 1999] prevention and control measures
[cholera] in the city of Cuzco, where one case of the disease
[cholera] was detected.
Health officials reported confirmation of several cases of cholera in
the provincial capitals of Canchis (Sicuani) and La Convencion
(Quillabamba) felt to be due to lack of personal hygiene and
ingestion of foods prepared publicly [?street vendors].
The presence of cholera in Cuzco mobilized not only the health
authorities, but also the municipality and national police in order
to implement a campaign of health education in the community,
especially amongst food handlers whose posts are along public routes
[probably refers to street vendors - MPP].
As a first action, health officials from the Ministry of Health will
train food handlers, especially on the eve of Holy Week, where the
vendors of [special foods for Holy week] (mazamorra, rice with milk,
sweetened apples, maicillos and salcipapas) are preparing those foods
with no controls. At these times there is the clandestine sale of red
meat and fish without veterinary examination in the streets around
the central market.
