Tide's toxins trouble lungs ashore
-------------------------------
A massive red tide off the beaches of southwest Florida is causing an
outbreak of wheezing and coughing among beachgoers, and new evidence
suggests that the effects of an airborne neurotoxin the tide produces may
be more harmful than health officials previously thought.

Since early January 2005, a large algae bloom stretching from the mouth of
Tampa Bay to Sanibel Island has been releasing into the air odorless toxins
that waft onto beaches with every onshore wind. Red tide occurs nearly
every year, but this year's bloom is unusually persistent, parking itself
in coastal waters and failing to dissipate.

Calls about the toxins have poured into hospitals, doctors' offices, and
poison control centers, and some doctors say the current algae bloom is
producing more reports of health difficulties than any other red tide they
can remember.

''It's awful -- you choke," said a visitor from Massachusetts who was
visiting Lido Beach in Sarasota last week with her husband. ''As soon as we
got here we started to cough."

Florida tourism officials have long downplayed the human respiratory
effects of red tide, in part because exposure depends on shifting winds and
the toxins affect some people differently than others. But some results
from a 5-year, $6.5-million federally funded series of studies by
scientists and health officials being published next month show for the 1st
time that the events may be causing significant health problems.

During a 3-month 2001 red tide event examined in the study, Sarasota
Memorial Hospital's emergency room admissions for respiratory problems were
54 percent higher for people living along or visiting the coast than during
the same time period the next year, when there was no red tide. There was
no similar spike inland.

The study also documents that beachgoers with chronic respiratory problems
have reduced lung capacity after even a short exposure to red tide,
although it's unclear how long the problems last.

''For years we've had anecdotal information this is happening, but you
can't decide public policy on anecdotes," said Barbara Kirkpatrick, staff
scientist at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota and one of the lead
researchers of the study, which will be published in a series of 7 papers
in Environmental Health Perspectives. She wants state and local officials
to develop a visible warning system to alert beach visitors to red tides.

Still, healthy people appear to be affected only temporarily; their watery
eyes and scratchy throats can be cured by simply going inside an
air-conditioned room or leaving the beach.

Florida's version of red tide -- actually more green-brown in appearance
than red -- is a different organism from the one blamed for the red tide
that appears off the New England coast, which doesn't produce an airborne
toxin and is most dangerous to humans if they eat contaminated shellfish.

First documented in the 1800s, Florida's red tide is caused by a naturally
occurring single-celled organism, _Karenia brevis_, and can stretch tens of
miles wide and long. The current bloom is patchy, but stretches about 50
miles north to south and about 20 miles from shore in some places,
according to researchers at Mote. For reasons that are not entirely
understood, the organism multiplies and accumulates in the Gulf of Mexico
almost every year, reaching concentrations that discolor the water with the
tiny plants' pigments. The neurotoxin is released when the fragile cells
die -- and also perhaps when they are smashed in the surf. Red tide does
not normally occur on Florida's East Coast.

This year's outbreak has killed thousands of fish, many of which could be
seen last week speckling the shoreline along the Siesta Key and Lido
beaches. At least 44 endangered manatees are believed to have died from
exposure to the algae, according to wildlife officials. People who eat
seafood contaminated by the neurotoxin can become ill. Still, swimming is
allowed and most people report few adverse reactions.

Whether the blooms have been getting worse or are persisting longer are
matters of debate among environmental researchers in this state, where
tourism is a major industry. Some studies have suggested sewage and other
runoff might be to blame. Florida wildlife officials say no evidence exists
to show that the blooms are increasing in frequency or lasting longer. ''We
haven't seen an increase in the duration or frequency of red tides," said
Cynthia Heil, a scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research
Institute.

State officials also say it's unclear whether this year's bloom has caused
more medical problems.

Symptoms associated with exposure to red tide's neurotoxins can mimic the
start of a cold, change with variable winds, and affect different people in
different ways. Several doctors who deal with red tide complaints say that
they always see an uptick in emergency room visits and calls during red
tide, but that sometimes it can be hard to sort out which complaints are
truly related to red tide and which are separate respiratory events.

''Still, I've heard about more difficulties this year than any year in
recent memory," said Dr. Terrence Kane, a pulmonologist with Lung
Associates of Sarasota who was one of the authors of the emergency room
admission study. ''There have been bad spells before, but they have been
relatively short-lived."

How best to warn the public about red tide's respiratory effects is a
delicate subject in southwest Florida, where so many people's livelihoods
rely on tourism. Although Florida public health officials have stepped up
awareness campaigns in recent years with pamphlets and public service
messages that warn people with respiratory problems to stay away from
beaches during a red tide bloom, several first-time tourists to the area
said they were unaware why they were coughing during a particularly gusty
Wednesday night last week on Lido Beach.

Because Florida does not close beaches during red tide events, lifeguards
often educate beach-goers. State public health officials say they and
Kirkpatrick are developing a pilot program to place beach signs warning
about the dangers.

''We do tell people to bring an inhaler if they are asthmatic," said Tamara
Pigott, beach and shoreline project manager for Lee County Visitor and
Convention Bureau in Fort Myers. ''For most people, it's a nuisance. It's
not going to ruin their vacation."

Kirkpatrick, along with Daniel Baden of the University of North
Carolina-Wilmington, lead investigator on the forthcoming study, said there
are still many unknowns about red tide, such as how long symptoms can last
and the potential for exposure to cause chronic and immune system problems.

''You feel the effects before we have the ability to measure them. It's
happening at very low levels," said Baden. His groups' research, funded
largely by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences with
help from the Centers for Disease Control, is under review for another 5
years of funding. ''We still need to learn more."

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it
is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes
shellfish to be toxic for consumption. Generally the effects in people are
short-lived and not serious. - Mod.TG]
