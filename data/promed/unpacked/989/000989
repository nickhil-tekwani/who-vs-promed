As of 22 Nov 2017, a total of 536 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases has been reported from all provinces across the country since 1 Jan 2017 (Figure 9). Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (65%, 348/536) followed by Western Cape (12%, 67/536) and KwaZulu-Natal (6%, 35/536) provinces.

In the majority of cases, diagnosis was based on the isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in blood culture (69%, 371/536), or CSF (26%, 141/536). Where age was reported (n=517), ages ranged from birth to 93 years (median 26 years) and 37% (193/517) were neonates aged 28 days or less. Females accounted for 53% (273/517) of cases where gender was reported.

As of 22 Nov 2017, 180 case investigation forms (CIFs) of variable completeness have been received. Apart from neonates (28 days or under) and the elderly (over 65 years), other risk factors reported in adults with listeriosis were pregnancy (10/35 females aged 15-49 years) and HIV infection (38/93 (41%) cases where HIV status was known). Final outcome data is available for 12% (65/536) of cases, of which 52% (34/65) died.

To date, whole genome sequencing has been performed on 189 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates. 15 sequence types (STs) have been identified; however, 71% (134/189) belong to a single ST (ST6). Isolates in this ST6 cluster are very closely related, showing less than 20 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences. This suggests that most cases in this outbreak have been exposed to a widely available, common food type/source.

Actions to date to assist with identification of the source include in-depth interviews of persons who have been diagnosed with listeriosis, engagement with food control industry to identify potential sources, and ongoing data collection.

As of 29 Nov 2017, a total of 557 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported from all provinces since 1 Jan 2017 (Figure 1). Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (62%, 345/557) followed by Western Cape (13%, 71/557) and KwaZulu-Natal (7%, 37/557) provinces. In the majority of cases, diagnosis was based on the isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in blood culture (69%, 386/557), followed by CSF (26%, 146/557). Where age was reported (n=540), ages range from birth to 93 years (median 26 years) and 37% (203/540) are neonates aged 28 days and under (Figure 2). Of neonatal cases, 96% (195/203) had early-onset disease (birth to 6 days or less). Females account for 53% (286/538) of cases where gender is reported. Provincial distribution of cases by district is shown in Figure 3.

Clinical findings
---------------------
As of 29 Nov 2017, case investigation forms (CIFs) of variable completeness have been received for 192 cases. Apart from neonates (28 days and under) and the elderly (over 65 years), additional risk factors for listeriosis reported include pregnancy (10/39 females aged 15-49 years) and HIV infection status. In non-neonatal cases where HIV status was known (n=63), 62% (39/63) were HIV positive. Maternal HIV status is known for 57 neonatal cases, of which 22/57 (38%) were HIV positive. Final outcome data is available for 12% (70/557) of cases, of which 51% (36/70) died. Limited food consumption history data are available, and indicate that a wide variety of food items documented to have caused previous outbreaks/clusters of listeriosis (including dairy products, meat products, vegetables, fruit, and ready-to-eat products) were commonly consumed, and no specific food item/s or food consumption patterns that could guide targeted environmental investigations have been identified as yet.

Reference laboratory findings
-----------------------------
To date, whole genome sequencing has been performed on 189 clinical _L. monocytogenes_ isolates. 15 sequence types (STs) have been identified; however, 71% (134/189) belong to a single ST (ST6). Isolates in this ST6 cluster are very closely related, showing under 20 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences. This suggests that most cases in this outbreak have had exposure to a widely available, common food type/source.

Narrative summary of actions to date
------------------------------------
Epidemiology and surveillance
- The line list database of listeriosis cases is updated daily with data from NHLS Central Data Warehouse (CDW) downloads as well as direct reports of listeriosis cases detected at private sector laboratories.
- Case investigations forms (CIFs) are currently being completed by numerous healthcare workers in public and private sectors, including GERMS-SA surveillance officers at enhanced surveillance site hospitals (public sector), clinical microbiologists (public sector), IPC practitioners at private sector hospitals, and Department of Health officials. Data from CIFs are entered into the database. All healthcare practitioners (clinicians, nurses, IPC practitioners, pathologists, Department of Health officials etc.) are encouraged to complete CIFs where possible, since identification of possible contaminated food types/sources will be guided by analysis of this data. The CIF with accompanying instruction sheet can be found on the NICD website at http://www.nicd.ac.za, and completed CIFs emailed to <outbreak@nicd.ac.za>.
- A team of NICD epidemiologists has compiled a comprehensive food item checklist and is conducting in-depth interviews of case-patients in Gauteng Province when feasible in order to ascertain detailed food consumption histories. To date, 5 such interviews have been conducted. This information will hopefully assist us in drafting a concise food consumption questionnaire, which can easily be administered by an interviewer or completed by case-patients themselves.

Clinical management
- Clinical listeriosis management guidelines have been drafted and are currently under review. If you would like to view the draft and provide comment, please email <outbreak@nicd.ac.za>.

Laboratory diagnostics and investigations
- Private and public sector laboratories are submitting clinical isolates to the NICD Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED). Please email <arvindas@nicd.ac.za>, <junot@nicd.ac.za> or <karenk@nicd.ac.za> should you have queries or require assistance.
- For cases where there is a high clinical index of suspicion for listeriosis but specimens (blood culture or CSF) are culture negative, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test can be performed at the NICD. Please contact <anthonys@nicd.ac.za>, <arvindas@nicd.ac.za>, <junot@nicd.ac.za> or <karenk@nicd.ac.za> for further details.
- All _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from food samples tested at the NHLS Infection Control Services Laboratory are routinely submitted to the CED.
- Selected private sector food testing laboratories have voluntarily submitted _L. monocytogenes_ isolates (from anonymised food samples and food processing facilities) to the CED.
- All isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ received at the CED are subjected to confirmatory identification tests, and are stored.
- Whole genome sequencing is being performed on all clinical isolates and selected food/environmental isolates.

Food control and environmental health
- The Director General of the National Department of Health has formally requested food industry stakeholders to submit _Listeria_ isolates to the NICD, along with details of _Listeria_-positive food/food processing environmental samples.
- Environmental health practitioners have been requested to visit homes of persons diagnosed with listeriosis and sample food from their refrigerators. These specimens must be submitted to the NHLS Infection Control Services Laboratory in Johannesburg. Please email Rob Stewart (<rob.stewart@nhls.ac.za>) or Teena Thomas (<teena.thomas@nhls.ac.za>) for details regarding specimen submission.

Communications
- The NICD has made information available on the website regarding listeriosis, including Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), clinical management guidance, and laboratory testing methodology. These can be accessed at http://www.nicd.ac.za/index.php/listeriosis/.
- The Food Control Division within the National Department of Health has distributed information about the outbreak to food industry stakeholders.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Irene Lai, from SOS International, and an EpiCore member for their submissions of the above reports in response to the RFI.

In summary, most laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis in South Africa have been reported from Gauteng Province (62%, 345/557), where cases started to increase around epidemiological week 23 (4-10 Jun 2017) when 5 cases occurred in that week to epidemiological week 46 (12-18 Nov 2017) when over 20 cases occurred (item 1, figure 9 at the source URL.) 37% (203/540) are neonates aged 28 days or less. Of neonatal cases, 96% (195/203) had early-onset disease.

No specific food item/s or food consumption patterns have been identified as yet from a limited number of food histories. However, whole genome sequencing, performed on 189 _L. monocytogenes_ clinical isolates, found that 71% (134/189) belong to a single sequence type (ST6) and identified a clonal cluster within sequence type (ST) 6, which suggested that most cases in this outbreak have been exposed to a common source. Investigations to identify this source are ongoing.

Gauteng, one of the 9 provinces of South Africa, is the smallest and most populous, with a population of over 13 million residents, containing the country's largest city, Johannesburg, its administrative capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng).
