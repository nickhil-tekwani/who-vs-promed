[Repeating my moderator comment from 15 Dec 2002, "This past week has seen confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV1) in environmental samples and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2), continue to be identified. Note that while Pakistan hasn't reported any AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection in the past few weeks, the positive ESs confirm that the virus is still circulating in the country and the same can be said for Afghanistan." In the past week cVDPV2 cases have been confirmed in different countries than last week. Last week there was AFP identified in the DR Congo and positive ES samples identified in Botswana. This week AFP cases were confirmed in Sudan and Yemen, the former being confirmation of a report posted in Poliomyelitis update (51): Sudan, Indonesia, WHO, RFI 20221221.8707383. In the past week there have been 4 countries (Pakistan, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria) reporting identification of a poliovirus circulating in their country.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

Polio surveillance review yields results in Afghanistan
-------------------------------------------------------
Recommendations from the international review of Afghanistan's poliovirus surveillance system are yielding important results for the country's eradication programme.

The review team, comprising experts including virologists and epidemiologists, visited Afghanistan in June [2022], conducting a comprehensive nationwide assessment of the country's polio surveillance system. Among their recommendations was the need to address gaps in environmental surveillance and expand the number of environmental surveillance sites in areas deemed high risk for polio, including the country's east, southeast, south and west regions, to ensure any presence of the virus is quickly detected.

Afghanistan's AFP surveillance system -- monitoring for signs of Acute Flaccid Paralysis in children under 15 years of age -- is complemented by environmental surveillance -- the collection of sewage samples at designated sites to check for the presence of the virus in the community. Together, they enable the programme to detect where the virus may be circulating and, importantly, mount a timely response.

Following the review's recommendations, 3 new environmental surveillance sites have now come online, bringing the total number of sites in Afghanistan to 32. One of those sites, at Pezand Pana Dafter in Nangarhar province has produced 3 positive environmental samples since coming online in September [2022]. The programme quickly mounted a response targeting 1.4 million children under 5 years of age in all 4 eastern provinces -- Nangarhar, Kunar, Laghman and Nuristan.

"Surveillance is the eyes and ears of the polio programme, and environmental surveillance plays an important part in eradicating polio because it enables the programme to detect the presence of the virus," says Dr. Khushhal Khan Zaman, who oversees polio surveillance for WHO Afghanistan. "Environmental surveillance tells us very plainly where transmission is likely happening."

WHO guidelines stipulate that an environmental site be located in areas with substantial populations, and with flowing sewage water. In Afghanistan, sites are established in major cities and larger population centres with existing wastewater and drainage systems. Communities with mobile populations are also a focus. Samples are regularly taken and sent to a WHO-accredited polio laboratory for testing.

Afghanistan has made significant progress in interrupting transmission of the virus. From 56 children paralysed by WPV1 in 2020, so far this year [2022] there have been 2 cases, in Paktika and Kunar provinces. Seventeen positive environmental samples have been detected in 2022, all in the country's east region.

Further environmental surveillance sites are planned as WHO Afghanistan continues to implement recommendations from the surveillance review.

[The value of using environmental sampling for poliovirus circulation cannot be overstated. If not for the positive ESs in Afghanistan, there would have been a false sense of security that transmission had been interrupted after the case reported earlier in the year [2022]. The ES picks up silent circulation of the virus, identifying areas to enhance AFP surveillance and target vaccination activities.

According to the above descriptive, all but the North of the country is considered high risk for poliovirus circulation ... a sobering assessment.
