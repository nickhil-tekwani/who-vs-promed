Recurrence of undiagnosed fever in Siliguri, West Bengal
--------------------------------------------------------
SILIGURI: Eight people have died in a fresh spell of "mystery fever" during
the past 2 weeks in Siliguri. A few other patients with similar symptoms
are struggling for life in different nursing homes and hospitals. Doctors
[have refused, however, to [confirm that the disease is encephalitis.
The 8 deaths in Siliguri [have been associated with symptoms similar to
the mystery fever that took 50 lives just 5 months ago in Siliguri. Two of
these cases were referred to the Medical College from a Siliguri nursing
home. At least 3 out of these 8 patients have been relatives or visitors to
patients who died in the outbreak of the disease last February.
[It is reported that similar cases are coming from different corners of
the Dhubri district of Assam, and from Dooars, Jalpaiguri and Cochbehar
districts. According to a senior West Bengal Health Service doctor, some of
the private nursing homes are not officially reporting the encephalitis
cases out of fear of losing business. "Government doctors are also
tactfully reporting the cases, by-passing the word "encephalitis" due to
"the hidden pressure" of [the local authorities [that existed there
during the February outbreak" he said.
According to the Dt. CMO (H) Dr TN Chattaraj, all the new deaths have been
reported to the health department as "natural death due to
meningomyelitis'", although he has accepted that the symptoms were quite
similar to those [observed in the February outbreak. The superintendent of
Siliguri Hospital Dr V Thapa has appealed to all private nursing homes to
refer all similar cases directly to North Bengal Medical College "since
[the College has better infrastructure set up during the last epidemic to
tackle the situation" he said.

[It noteworthy that again the cases in Siliguri seem to be adults, and
nursing home related. Are the same nursing homes involved? Further
information would be welcome from the local and national public health
authorities. Considerable confusion remains about the true situation in
Siliguri, as a result of earlier erroneous reports of the prevalence of
atypical strains of measles virus in the area. - Mods.MPP/CP
