[Maintaining cleanliness adequate to avoid providing breeding sites for vector mosquitoes is doubtless very difficult for refugee populations like this one.

[ProMED-mail seldom receives reports of dengue in Africa. Given this report, cases have been occurring in past years, leading one to suspect that there is significant underreporting. The report above increases to 21 the number of individuals hospitalized in Dar es Salaam due to dengue from the 10 reported the previous week (see ProMED-mail archive 20140203.2252372).
