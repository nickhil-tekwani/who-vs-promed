With respect to the following article on anthrax vaccine adverse event
surveillance, I must highlight the following points:
1. The MMWR is highly respected, but it relies on reports to arrive from
various health departments around the US. This particular report arrived
from--guess where? It appears to have been orchestrated by the AVIP (John
Grabenstein), and the Offices of the Army Surgeon General and Assistant
Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs, which have been the sources for many
earlier incorrect reports on the vaccine. The list of authors does include
the principal investigator for the Tripler study, Col. Wasserman, and the
principal investigator for the Korea study, Dr. Hoffman.
2. These studies have not been published or peer reviewed. When their data
were reported at the Fort Detrick meeting in May 1999, and by the GAO in
Congressional testimony last April and July 1999, things were not so rosy:
48% at Tripler had systemic reactions, and 8% sought medical assistance or
missed work after their first injection -- and these were all medical
personnel. The deliberations of the committees who reviewed the VAERS
reports, which happen to include members selected by DOD, have also not
been subjected to outside scrutiny. I encourage independent review of the
VAERS reports, which are available through FOIA to FDA.
3. The initial data from the Korea study showed that women had a rate of
SYSTEMIC and local reactions 2-3 times that of men. This came from Dr.
Renata Engler's presentation at Fort Detrick. Her slides are posted on the
Anthrax Links website. Note that the initial paragraph of this report does
not comment specifically on systemic reactions, but by leaving out systemic
reactions, it implies that there was no difference in the rates of systemic
reactions between males and females.
4. The Tripler data were also presented differently at the Detrick meeting.
Instead of reporting that "11 were not vaccinated because of pregnancy" the
audience was told that 11 women who were vaccinaterd were then found to be
pregnant. If they weren't vaccinated because of pregnancy, they would have
been excluded from the study. The fact that they remained study subjects is
evidence that they were vaccinated during or immediately before pregnancy.
Thus the extremely important question that Col. Wasserman has skirted is:
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE WOMEN AND THEIR INFANTS?
5. The Editor wrote, "The studies were not designed to detect or quantify
chronic or long-term adverse events." However, the expressed purpose of the
Tripler study was to do precisely that: provide information on long-term
systemic adverse effects. Will DOD supply the initial study proposal so the
purpose of the study can be verified? It appears that they changed what
they were studying, or reporting, to best deal with the data they were
(unfortunately) generating. I could go on but it shouldn't be necessary.
Remember what mother taught: "Consider the source."

Anthrax vaccine has now been the subject of 13 safety studies, involving
more than 16,000 vaccine recipients directly. The recent article in the
Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) puts more of this safety record
into the peer-reviewed literature
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4916a1.htm>. The anthrax
article was written by Defense Department scientists and peer-reviewed by
vaccine specialists at CDC, FDA, and elsewhere in the Department of Health
& Human Services (HHS). The thickness of my 8-month file of drafts attests
to the critique and clarification process this manuscript went through.
In May 1999, the principal investigator (PI) from Tripler Army Medical
Center and a proxy for the PI from US Forces Korea presented preliminary
data on their studies in the form of slides, rather than text. Anyone who
has ever collected data in a field study knows that preliminary data often
seems naive when the full written analysis is complete. In these specific
cases, literally thousands of additional observations have been collected
since May 1999 and the results are presented by the PIs themselves, rather
than through intermediaries. The data presented last week in the MMWR are
not fundamentally different from any previous presentation of the data.
In the specific case of the GAO, the GAO chose to sum all adverse events
together to generate the fraction of vaccine recipients who reported any
symptom whatsoever, regardless of duration or intensity. This method
produced a value of 43%, which is on par with other vaccines analyzed in
the same way, especially with a 2-week observation window. With anthrax
vaccine, all we ask is that apples be compared to apples. [I wonder how
that analogy is worded on other continents. In the April 28, 2000,
article, readers will find differences in the rates of systemic events
reported by men and women in Figure 1. The corresponding data from Tripler
were comparable. Sustantial portions of the text and an additional table
submitted by DoD were removed in MMWR's editing process due to space
constraints. The data excised has been publicly available at
http://www.anthrax.osd.mil for many months [at that site, select
"DocuCenter," then "Top 10 Resources," then "Safety Reviews".
In the Tripler study, 11 Service Members became pregnant after receiving
their initial doses of anthrax vaccine. Because of their pregnancy, they
were deferred by DoD policy from additional doses of vaccine until after
their pregnancies concluded. Note that this is a more cautious policy than
would be expected based simply on the biology of immunologic stimuli during
pregnancy. Indeed, ACIP, AAP, ACP, and ACOG encourage vaccination during
pregnancy against tetanus, hepatitis B, influenza, and meningococci (each
of which is an inactivated vaccine, like the anthrax vaccine) if the woman
is susceptible to infection. All of the DoD data from personnel around the
world points to the conclusion that women vaccinated against anthrax have
the same reproductive outcomes as women not vaccinated against anthrax. No
inactivated vaccine has ever been found to produce any pattern of adverse
reproductive effects.
It is wrong to assert that the independent civilian committee that reviews
all VAERS reports involving anthrax vaccine (called the Anthrax Vaccine
Expert Committee, AVEC) consists of members selected by the Defense
Department. The members of the AVEC are independently selected by the
Department of Health & Human Services, without knowledge or comment by DOD,
from among civilian scientists identified by the Health Resources and
Services Administration, HHS, as vaccine experts. This committee is
currently developing a manuscript that will describe the full findings of
the committee. DoD has already publicly stated that the committee is free
to report whatever findings they wish.
There are already more long-term safety data on vaccines based on
protective antigen than for other vaccines licensed in U.S. in the 1990s
(see for example Annals of Internal Medicine 1974;81:594-600). The Tripler
study was designed to collect short-term data, intermediate-term data, and
long-term data (with long-term defined here as 1-2 years). The Tripler
study is happening in real time, of course, so the data from dose #5 is
being analyzed now and the data from dose #6 is being collected now. Other
studies have and are continuing to assess safety at the scale of decades.
Despite assertions to the contrary, America's anthrax vaccine scientists
have consistently made their findings available to the public. They have
and are in the process of subjecting it to peer review. Our goal is to most
accurately describe the safety profile of anthrax vaccine, so that the true
profile can be used to guide vaccination policy.

[During the past six months I have visited a number of Air National Guard
units and this experience has put this vaccine problem in a larger context.
Their worries about this vaccine are part of a larger concern. Briefly it
seems to have four dimensions:
1: "Greater than 1 Shot"
a) This is inconvenient and the two week timing is a nuisance as they have
to see their private doctor; it would be better if this could be done at
the regular monthly parades;
b) "It is compulsory!"
c) "If greater than 1 shot is needed, the vaccine can't be any good";
d) As infectious diseases have become less common the need for vaccination
is no longer appreciated which is fed by the normal side effects of any
vaccination plus a national trend in rejection of vaccination, and the
common American distrust of science.
2: "Gulf War Syndrome"
a) There is the normal human psychological uncertainty and fear of large
organizations;
b) The past and on-going problems with Agent Orange and Gulf War Syndrome;
c) "X-Files" and the audience and fears it plays to;
d) And that government research on these problems has been perceived as
belated and not proactive.
3: "Lack of experience of disease"
a) Very, very few in the military have ever seen a case of anthrax in
livestock, much less humans (for that matter few veterinarians have seen a
case);
b) There is disbelief in the reality of threat;
c) There is readily available information supporting any and every
viewpoint on the web, in news reports, and fed by barrack room and email
rumors.
d) There is a common 'temporal dysfunction' in judging the time needed to
do anything; it is assumed that research, for example, can be done in
moments; while any TV crime program takes 60 minutes to complete 3-12
months of investigation and court time; ten years of research are covered
in five minutes on "Dateline" or "60 Minutes".
4: Various dissatisfactions within the National Guard
The functions of the military are changing and this affects the NG, who now
find themselves filling some 40% of US military duties. Shooting wars and
natural emergencies they are used to and what they signed up for originally
but not international police work. Postings of four to nine months are
occurring which disrupts family and civilian careers. The reluctance of the
US politico-military establishment to take any losses resulting in further
tactical & strategic complications in the short & long term. And other
aspects, all impacting on morale and mission identification, and the normal
balancing between satisfactions and dissatisfaction. This may be the most
important dimension.
In my opinion for certain individuals all these come together and find
expression in the fear and rejection of this one vaccine. And for some this
may be the only way they can react against 'the system'. We will cut the
thread at this point. -Mod MHJ
