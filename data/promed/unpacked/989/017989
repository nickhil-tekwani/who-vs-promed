Health staff's leave of absence cancelled: Anthrax spreads in Pabna
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has spread in new areas, infecting 165 people, including 38
anew in the last 24 hours, a senior health official said on Thursday
[26 Aug 2010], urging people not to be panicked as the disease is
both preventable and curable.

Director of Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR) Dr Mahmudur Rahman said anthrax has spread to Faridpur
upazila [district] of Pabna district on Wednesday night outside the 4
already affected upazilas of Shahjadpur, Belkuchi and Kamarkhand in
Sirajganj and Shanthia in Pabna.

"More than 15 persons have been affected in Faridpur upazila along
with several other new infections in 4 other affected upazilas of
Pabna and Sirajganj in last 24 hours," he told BSS by phone.

According to statistics up to Thursday morning, he said, 48 people
were infected with anthrax bacilli in Shahjadpur, 43 in Kamarkhand,
32 in Belkuchi, 27 in Shanthia and 15 in Faridpur.

Civil Surgeon of Pabna Dr AKM Ashrafuzzaman, however, said one more
person was detected with anthrax yesterday morning [26 Aug 2010] in
Bera, the 3rd affected upazila in Pabna district after Shanthia and Faridpur.

This is the 6th upazila being affected by anthrax, a bacteria-borne
disease that broke out in Shahjadpur upazila this week after people
consumed meat from two diseased cows.

Senior scientist of IEDCR Dr Mushtaque Ahmed said they have requested
the government to disseminate 'health message' in state-run media,
especially Bangladesh Television, round-the-clock to give people
correct information about anthrax. He said BTV [Bangladesh TV] is
likely to start airing anthrax control messages in a day or 2. The
messages would ask people to stop slaughtering diseased cows, goats
and lambs; to bury the dead cattle immediately after the death; take
precautionary measures to handle diseased cattle; and to refrain from
eating meat of sick cattle and report to physicians if anybody feels sick.

When asked about possibility of imports of diseased cow in the
capital Dhaka from affected areas, Dr Mushtaque said some
unscrupulous cattle traders might have tried to do so, but Dhaka City
Corporation should take steps to impose a complete ban on
slaughtering cattle outside the approved slaughter houses.

Dr Mahmudur Rahman, however, said Dhaka and other big cities were
free from the threat of consuming anthrax-affected beef as the
infected cattle could not survive more than 48 hours of their
infection. He said the chances are very slim to transport anthrax
infected cows for human consumption in the capital Dhaka, nearly 200
km [125 miles] off the epicenter of the outbreak. [But not if they
were merely incubating the disease during trans-shipment. MHJ]

Rahman said the government health staff have been providing treatment
to the infected people and majority of them were supposed to come
around in 10 days. He, however, declined to name the drugs being
provided to anthrax patients. He said both 1st and 2nd line drugs for
anthrax were ready for dispensation.

Vaccines to cattle and treatment to human beings are going together
in the affected areas, he said, adding that people who have once
infected with anthrax has a little chance to be infected for 2nd
time. [Repeat infections are infrequent but not unknown. MHJ]

Sirajganj livestock department has cancelled the casual leave of all
livestock staff to spearhead the ongoing mass vaccination programme
for cattle in the district. A total of 37 teams have been formed to
vaccinate 587 500 cows, goats and lambs; livestock officials hope
that the vaccination would be completed by 8 Sep 2010.

A debate has also been raised regarding the test of human samples in
veterinary laboratory in Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), a
delegation of which visited the anthrax affected areas and suggested
for incineration and burial of dead cows deep in the earth.

"Testing human samples in veterinary labs without having proper
biosafety measures and approval from Bangladesh Medical Research
Council is absolutely an ethical deviation," said a scientist, who
deals with tests of the human samples to confirm anthrax. He said the
BAU delegation should refrain from commenting on the issue as it
might confuse people. [And maybe PH (public health) silence on this
topic would be appropriate. MHJ]

Anthrax is a potentially lethal bacterium that exists naturally in
the soil and commonly infects livestock, which ingest or inhale its
spores while grazing. It can be transmitted to humans who handle or
eat infected animals.

Anthrax was 1st detected in 2008 and there have been 8 outbreaks in
Bangladesh. It does not spread directly from one infected human or
animal to another but is spread through spores.

At some point it would be of interest to have an estimate of the
numbers of infected cattle that were slaughtered and butchered.

Analysing human samples in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory is not
unknown and for a disease more frequently seen in livestock than
humans, it may have a positive purpose. At one time I had to
investigate the PH (public health) and veterinary services in the
Caribbean vis-a-vis zoonotic diseases. On one island the 2 services
essentially shared the same facility but with necropsies and
autopsies done in different wings. It made economic sense. The
problems come when animal samples go to a public health laboratory as
the pathogens can differ as to major species and growth characteristics.

For example a PH laboratory comfortable with culturing _M.
tuberculosis_ will traditionally always come up negative with _M.
bovis_ as the latter will not grow on the _M.tb_ media. This is
patently a learning experience for the Bangladesh health services. - Mod.MHJ]
