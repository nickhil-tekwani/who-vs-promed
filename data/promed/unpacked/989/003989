There appears to be a problem of definitions here. Relative risk is
derived from dividing incidence rate among the exposed by the incidence
rate among the unexposed. Absolute risk is represented by incidence rate
among persons exposed to a specific risk. Therefore, absolute risk can be
readily derived from relative risk. However, the two equations shown are
confusing. It is not clear how the relative risk for the household contacts
are derived, since all household contacts are presumably exposed to the
index case; thus there are no unexposed persons. Actually the incidence
rate among the household contacts represents absolute risk. The expression
"7 to 30 days following an index case" is generally used to establish a
definition of a secondary case. A case occurring among household contacts
within that defined period is a secondary case and those occurring outside
that period are either co primaries or cases unrelated to the index case.
Secondary attack rate is then calculated from all cases occurring among
household contacts within that period.
