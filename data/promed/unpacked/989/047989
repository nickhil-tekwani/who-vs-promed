An adult male, recently treated in Cairns Base Hospital, has been
diagnosed as having Japanese Encephalitis. It is believed he acquired JE
while working on a boat at the mouth of the Mitchell River on the west
coast of Cape York Peninsula.
This is the first time JE has been diagnosed on the mainland of
Australia. An outbreak of JE in the outer islands of the Torres Strait
in 1995 resulted in two deaths and led to the vaccination of over 3,500
outer island residents against the disease.
Medical Director of the Cairns-based Tropical Public Health Unit (TPHU),
Dr Jeffrey Hanna said the man had recovered and had been discharged from
hospital late last week.
Queensland Health, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS)
and Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) are taking
immediate action to identify the source of the virus and curb its
spread.
Health Minister, Mike Horan said that any response, which might include
vaccination of pigs or people, would be made following a thorough risk
assessment by Qld Health medical staff and animal health scientists,
which will begin immediately.
Queensland Health will be testing people on the mainland in two nearby
Cape York communities for JE. DPI and AQIS will be testing feral pig
populations on the Cape to assess whether they are carrying the virus,
he said.
The only other cases of JE in Australia were contracted in the outer
islands of the Torres Strait in 1995 (three cases) and 1998 (one case).
