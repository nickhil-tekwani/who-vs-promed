[1] Cholera, variant strains - Viet Nam: (North)
Date: Wed 6 Feb 2008 16:01:18 +0900
From: Masahiko Ehara <ehara@nagasaki-u.ac.jp>


A recent cholera outbreak has occurred in northern Viet Nam.

Since 2006, we have been working on vibriophages in the environmental
surface water samples in Thai Binh and Hai Phong provinces (Northern
Viet Nam) to collect information to predict outbreaks of cholera. In
2007, we isolated several vibriophages in May, July, and particularly
in September, we could isolate many vibriophages almost from all
points where we collect water specimens (20 locations).

In November 2007, however, when the cholera outbreak began, we could
not isolate any vibriophages. Instead, we faced a surprising fact
that all _Vibrio cholerae_ strains were found infected with
filamentous phage fs2 and partially infected with filamentous phage
fs1. This pattern was also observed among the epidemic strains from
cholera patients.

Since the report of Matlab and Mozambique strains of _V. cholerae_ O1
biotype El Tor that have some characteristics of the classical
biotype, an outbreak of cholera due to hybrid strains occurred in
Orissa [India] killing 150 people (ProMED-mail Cholera, diarrhea &
dysentery update 2007 20071213.4015.) We analyzed the genome of
epidemic strains in Northern Viet Nam. Surprisingly, all strains were
shown to have 2 copies of filamentous phage CTXf (classical type) in
a small chromosome and one copy (El Tor type) in a large chromosome.
This finding suggests that epidemic strains are changing to hybrid
strains. This hybrid strain is much more virulent than El Tor strain
up to the present.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ehara for this report.

Described by Nair, et al (1) from the International Centre for
Diarrhoeal Research in Bangladesh, such hybrid or variant strains of
_V. cholerae_ were obtained from patients with cholera from the
Matlab Hospital and they are often referred to as the Matlab variants.

Formally, the 2 established biotypes, classical and El Tor, can be
distinguished from one another by a number of properties including
hemolysis of sheep red blood cells, agglutination of chicken red
blood cells, the Voges-Proskauer reaction as well as susceptibility
to polymyxin B and to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Nair, et
al, described 3 Matlab types based on the hybrids of these phenotypic
traits. A hybrid strain has also been found in Mozambique (2), which
had genetic relatedness to the Matlab strains (3). Importantly, the
Matlab variants have been shown to have all the necessary genes to
initiate a pandemic (3). The classical biotype tends to cause more
clinical disease than El Tor. It is not clear where the hybrid
strains will fit in in this analysis of disease but it may be
intermediate between them. It is also not clear how closely these
Vietnamese strains relate to the Matlab variants.

[2] Acute watery diarrhea, fatal - Somalia: (Middle Shabelle)

At least 8 children have died in southern Somalia's Middle Shabelle
region after drinking contaminated water, relatives said Monday [4
Feb 2008]. The children died in Bal'ano village, east of the
provincial capital Jowhar. Several relatives told Garowe Online that
the village has been experiencing severe water shortage in recent
weeks. The children are believed to have died from a form of watery diarrhea.

Tens of families began leaving the village in search of clean water
sources in nearby towns, locals said. Somalia has lacked an effective
central government since 1991, a development that has impacted the
livelihoods of thousands of ordinary civilians who face the daily
challenges of conflict, drought and poverty.

Scores of children have been hospitalized in various hospitals in
Asaba, Delta State and neighboring towns following an outbreak of
cholera especially in riverine communities of the state.

A similar cholera epidemic occurred in 2007 in the state, claiming no
fewer than 10 lives.

The state director of Information, Mr Austin Mowah, confirmed the
epidemic yesterday [4 Feb 2008], saying: "The Ministry of Health has
reported an outbreak of gastrointestinal infection popularly known as
cholera in some parts of Oshimili South local government area."

Suspected cholera has broken out in Kitwe's Ipusukilo Township where
residents have been drinking water from shallow wells following the
closure of water kiosks by Nkana Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC)
for non-payment.

District director of health, Chikafuna Banda, said 3 people were
currently admitted and were under observation at the District Health
Management (DHM) cholera center while 3 others had been discharged.
Dr Banda said during a district disaster management meeting, chaired
by district commissioner, McDonald Mtine and attended by Town Clerk,
Ali Simwinga that the report on the outcome of the tests to determine
whether it is actual cholera or not was still being awaited.

"People in Ipusukilo are drinking contaminated water after NWSC
closed down water kiosks and the water table level has risen. We are
currently treating 3 people from the same township for suspected
cholera," he said.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR: (Katanga)

A cholera epidemic has killed at least 76 people and infected nearly
3000 in Democratic Republic of Congo's southeastern province of
Katanga since the start of the year [2008], health officials said on
Wednesday [6 Feb 2008].

"This year [2008] is worse (than most)," Katanga's provincial health
minister, Augustin Ilunga, said. "There has been a major demographic
explosion with the arrival of mining companies. Population has grown.
And there are neighbourhoods without drinking water or proper
sanitation," he told Reuters.

Lubumbashi, the heavily populated capital of Katanga, and the mining
city of Likasi, 90 km (58 mi) to the northwest, have been among the
worst hit by the epidemic.

Cholera is endemic in many parts of Congo. However, large-scale
epidemics in Lubumbashi, which alone has registered 1284 cases of the
disease including 18 deaths since the beginning of January 2008, are
relatively rare.

A cholera outbreak alert has been sounded in an (internally displaced
persons) IDP camp in Narok. The more than 1000 IDPs camping at Narok
North district headquarters do not have proper sanitation and the 3
pit latrines they have been using are full.

District Public Health officer John Towett told a district executive
meeting chaired by area DC Andrew Rukaria that the victims are also
in dire need of food, clothing and shelter. The most affected are the
elderly, children, and pregnant mothers, he said.

Meanwhile at least one person has reportedly died and 70 others are
admitted to Mandera District Hospital following an outbreak of
cholera in the town.

Speaking to the Kenya News Agency, the Area Medical Superintendent Dr
Muktar Omar said samples sent to the National Public Health
Laboratory confirmed the outbreak of the disease. He said they are
recording more cholera cases at the institution by the day.

[7] Cholera - Tanzania: (Arusha)

Municipal authorities have issued an alert message to residents of
Arusha calling them to be aware of an outbreak of cholera, which
until last week [21-27 Jan 2008] has affected 54 residents. They
called on residents to observe the highest standards of hygiene in
order to curb the water born disease, which broke out on 5 Jan 2008.

The Arusha municipal health officer Dr EH Mamuya told reporters in
his office that the problem was looming larger in the slum areas of
Sokoni I, Sombetini, Unga Limited, Themi, Ngarenaro, Sekei, Ilboru,
Losunyai, Sanawari, and Sakina. He said unless residents took
concerted efforts to fight the disease it will continue as a health
hazard and nagging problem for a long time.

Cholera outbreak has been an on- and-off problem in Arusha and many
other parts of Tanzania for many years now. This time around the
epicentre is Sokon One south of the municipality, a ward that harbors
most of the rain and wastewater flowing from the town center.

[8] Cholera - Angola: (Kwanza Sul)

The Red Cross of Angola (CVA) in coastal Kwanza Sul province
intensified in the past days the awareness campaign against cholera
to enable the population to acquire knowledge on the cares with the
disease. Speaking to ANGOP, the coordinator of CVA's programme of
combat to cholera, Agostinho Kaquinda considered necessary that the
population learns about the 1st symptoms of the disease and head
urgently to health centers or hospitals nearest to the community.

ANGOP learnt from a source of the region's public health sector that
during the month of January 2008 the province registered 7 cases of
cholera without deaths.
