- New preventative nasal spray treatment that could protect people from COVID-19 infection and prevent transmission announced
- Novel therapy developed by Australian biotech company, Ena Respiratory, shown to significantly reduce COVID-19 virus levels in the nose and throat, in a gold-standard animal study
- Reduced COVID-19 replication by up to 96%, study performed by Public Health England (PHE) scientists
- Mode of action complementary to COVID-19 vaccines, with easy nasal administration, delivered once or twice a week
- Potential to be used to prevent infection in at-risk populations, including healthcare workers and the elderly
- Ready to progress to human clinical trials within 4 months

A novel nasal treatment developed to boost the natural human immune system to fight common colds and flu has proved remarkably successful in reducing COVID-19 viral replication test results, released today [28 Sep 2020], reveal.

The novel product, INNA-051, being developed by Australian biotech company, Ena Respiratory, reduced viral replication by up to 96 percent in a gold-standard animal study led by Public Health England's (PHE) Deputy Director, Professor Miles Carroll, and published today on biomedical pre-publication research site, medRxiv [1].

The INNA-051 compound works by stimulating the innate immune system, the 1st line of defence against the invasion of pathogens into the body. By boosting the immune response in this way with INNA-051 prior to infection, the ability of the COVID-19 virus to infect the animals and replicate was dramatically reduced the PHE study showed. The study provides evidence that INNA-051 can be used as a stand-alone method of antiviral preventative therapy, complementary to vaccine programs.

"We've been amazed by just how effective our treatment has been," says Ena Respiratory Managing Director, Dr Christophe Demaison. "By boosting the natural immune response of the ferrets with our treatment, we've seen a rapid eradication of the virus."

"If humans respond in a similar way, the benefits of treatment are 2-fold. Individuals exposed to the virus would most likely rapidly eliminate it, with the treatment ensuring that the disease does not progress beyond mild symptoms. This is particularly relevant to vulnerable members of the community. In addition, the rapidity of this response means that the infected individuals are unlikely to pass it on, meaning a swift halt to community transmission."

Ena Respiratory has raised AUD 11.7 m [about USD 8.32 m] from Australian investors and, subject to successful toxicity studies and regulatory approval, the company could be ready to test INNA-051 in human trials in less than 4 months.

INNA-051 is a synthetic small molecule and would be self-administered via an easy-to-use nasal spray, taken once or twice a week, with the treatment taking almost immediate effect. If human trials are successful and, given the unprecedented need for drugs to combat COVID-19, this prophylactic immune modulation therapy could be rapidly manufactured at scale and be available for use soon.

"This is a significant development as the world races to find a solution to halt COVID-19 transmission and infection of at risk-populations," says Professor Roberto Solari a respiratory specialist, advisor to Ena Respiratory and visiting Professor at Imperial College London. "Most exciting is the ability of INNA-051 to significantly reduce virus levels in the nose and throat, giving hope that this therapy could reduce COVID-19 transmission by infected people, especially those who may be presymptomatic or asymptomatic and thus unaware they are infectious," Professor Solari says.

Unlike vaccines which are targeted to a specific strain, INNA-051, is designed to be effective for all types of respiratory infections. "Our nasal treatment has amazing potential for combatting COVID-19 and future pandemics," continues Dr Smith. We know that vaccinations are often the most attractive approach in combating respiratory virus epidemics, but this method often comes with challenges as vaccines trigger a specific response in the adaptive immune system which might not be effective against future mutations of a virus. INNA-051 utilises the non-specific innate immune response meaning it is effective against a broad spectrum of viruses."

The authors of the study include scientists from Public Health England (PHE), Ena Respiratory, and leading Australian research organisations, the Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, and the University of Melbourne.

Highlights
----------
- Chimpanzee adenoviral vaccines encoding stabilized S induce neutralizing Abs
- Chimpanzee adenoviral vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and pneumonia
- Intranasal vaccine delivery generates robust mucosal B and T cell responses
- Intranasal ChAd-SARS-CoV-2 prevents upper and lower respiratory tract infection

Summary
-------
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.

Caveats
-------
Immunization and challenge studies with hamsters and non-human primates are planned to confirm the extent of protective mucosal immunity conferred by ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S in mice and expand upon our understanding of how the route of inoculation impacts vaccine-mediated protection. Moreover, studies in humans are needed to assess for cross-immunity between the ChAd vector (simian Ad-36) and adenoviruses circulating in humans. Finally, studies must be conducted to monitor immune responses over time after intranasal vaccination with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S to establish the durability of the protective response.

In summary, intranasal delivery of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces mucosal immunity, provides superior protection, and possibly promotes sterilizing immunity, at least in mice that transiently or stably express the hACE2 receptor. We suggest that intranasal delivery of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a promising platform for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, and upper airway transmission and thus warrants clinical evaluation in humans.

[Intranasal administration drug delivery is a non-invasive method which has been used for influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Drugs can be absorbed into the systemic circulation through the nasal mucosa, allowing this route to be used in a range of acute or chronic conditions requiring considerable systemic exposure. Intranasal administration offers advantages such as ease and rapid onset of action, providing a good alternative to intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous inoculations.

In the 1st report above, one would need to take the intranasal drug regularly. Whether this would lead to side effects would need to be studied. In the 2nd paper, it will need to be determined how long lasting protection is. But the intranasal route shows great promise. - Mod.LK]

[2] USA: hospital outbreak
Date: Mon 28 Sep 2020
Source: Medscape [abridged, edited]
https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/938215


Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston is experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19 among patients and staff, which the facility blames partly on lapses in infection control practices by employees.

The hospital, a Harvard Medical School teaching facility, reported on [26 Sep 2020] that 23 employees and 11 patients tested positive as a result of exposure within the hospital. The outbreak was first detected on [22 Sep 2020], and cases have risen with increased testing. The hospital said it had tested 400 employees and 54 patients as of [26 Sep 2020].

Brigham and Women's is not alone in trying to keep COVID-19 from rearing its head within its walls. Hospitals and health departments reported an outbreak in late August [2020] in Washington and in early September [2020] at a hospital in Connecticut.

The Boston Globe reported in late September [2020] that Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Plymouth and New England Baptist Hospital both had recent outbreaks at their facilities, also.

But COVID-19 clusters in hospitals are relatively rare, said Ann Marie Pettis, RN, BSN, CIC, FAPIC, president-elect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC). "Fortunately, this is obviously not unheard of, but it's fairly occasional really as opposed to being rampant," Pettis told Medscape Medical News.

Brigham and Women's reported that the outbreak may have started with a presymptomatic employee who had mild symptoms that the worker attributed to seasonal allergies. That worker interacted with a patient. Both the patient -- who received an aerosol-generating treatment -- and the employee later tested positive.

The hospital said its investigation determined other factors that likely fueled the spread, including that many patients were not masked during clinical care and interactions with staff; that clinicians and healthcare workers were inconsistent in the use of eye protection during patient encounters; and that staff did not observe physical distancing while eating and unmasked.

The hospital would not release information on the clinical status of any of the infected, saying in its [26 Sep 2020] statement, "Due to patient privacy, we are not able to provide information about specific cases."

The hospital reported that it believes the cluster has been contained to 2 medical-surgical units, that it continues to test all inpatients and staff, and that it is involved in contact tracing. Some 650 people are connected to the cluster, said the hospital.

Pettis said it is only natural at this point in the epidemic that staff might be less diligent with personal protective equipment and other infection control practices.

"I like to call it PPE fatigue," she said, noting the difficulty of wearing masks and other PPE throughout a shift.

Infection control specialists at hospitals help gauge the appropriateness and functioning of air handling and filtering and monitor staff on PPE-wearing and other infection control measures because "of that tendency to perhaps let your guard down a little," Pettis explained.

With the potential for people with SARS-CoV-2 to be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, it is "incredibly difficult to have an absolute risk-free environment," she said.

"Even if you do everything right, there is the potential for [an outbreak] to happen," Pettis continued, adding that hospitals are required to report hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections to their local health departments, which then report to state health officials, but there is no national repository of such COVID-19 outbreaks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require such reporting, but will assist with outbreaks if asked, she said.

APIC [Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology] urges hospitals to follow infection control recommendations for health care workers issued by the CDC, which were last updated in early June [2020].

[The infection control guidelines issued by CDC can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html. And are basically a review of the NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions such as PPEs (personal protective equipment), face masks, gloves; social distancing including in break rooms and cafeterias, and frequent hand washing. These apply to all individuals inside of the healthcare facility -- staff, patients, and people accompanying patients.

The article mentions PPE fatigue on the part of staff, but there is NPI fatigue among non-healthcare workers as well. We are 8 months into the pandemic with 6 or more months of NPI restrictions and recommendations. Combined fatigue and lifting of restrictions are leading to less adherence to the recommendations. I keep wondering where are the medical anthropologists to help design effective measures to communicate the continued risks. As a side comment, note that even the top academic teaching institutions are not immune to these types of issues. - Mod.MPP]

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CEST, 27 Sep 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
To date, over 32.7 million COVID-19 cases and 991 000 deaths have been reported to WHO. During the week of [21-27 Sep 2020], there were more than 2 million new cases and 36 000 new deaths reported, which is similar to the numbers reported the previous week. Cumulative deaths are expected to exceed one million in the coming week.

Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region, and global deaths, [30 Dec 2019] through [27 Sep 2020].

The Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest incidence of COVID-19 globally (Table 1), reporting similar numbers of new cases and deaths as the previous week. The Region accounts for 38% of all new cases and 52% of all new deaths reported in the past 7 days. The Eastern Mediterranean Region showed the greatest increase (9%) in cases in the past week, while the European Region reported a substantial rise in deaths, with a 9% increase compared to the previous week. The WHO African, Western Pacific, and South East Asia Regions reported decreases in the new case and deaths over the past week.

Figure 2: COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories, and areas, [21 through 27 Sep 2020]

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
The African Region continues its decreasing trend for the 7th week, reporting a 7% decrease in new cases and a 14% decrease in new deaths. During the past week, 33 of the 49 affected countries reported either a decrease in deaths or no deaths. South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and new deaths followed by Ethiopia, Uganda, Algeria, and Mozambique. South Africa also has the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths per one million population in the Region, followed by Cabo Verde which has reported increasing numbers of cases and deaths over the past month.

Cases in Mozambique have consistently increased over the last 4 weeks stretching health system capacity. More than half of the new cases (and total cases) are in the capital city, Maputo. Mozambique's overall case rate, however, remains relatively low: 248 cases per million population and 2 deaths per million population.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [27 Sep 2020]

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas remains the most affected WHO Region, accounting for 50% of all reported cases and 55% of deaths. The Region reported similar numbers of new cases and deaths this past week as compared to the previous week and accounts for 38% of new cases and 52% of new deaths.

The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia continue to report the highest number of new cases in the past week. Mexico reported the 6th highest number of new cases and 3rd highest number of new deaths.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [27 Sep 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
Over the past month, the number of new cases and deaths reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has consistently increased, with a 9% and 3% increase respectively. The highest numbers of new cases were reported by Iraq, Iran, and Morocco. Somalia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, and Tunisia reported the greatest relative increase in cases compared to the previous week. While Iraq reported the highest number of new deaths, Bahrain and Jordan reported the greatest increase in deaths compared to the previous week.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [27 Sep 2020]

- European Region
While the number of new cases and deaths reported in the European Region continued to increase in the past 7 days, the rate slowed (Figure 6), with only a 5% increase in new cases and 9% increase in new deaths reported (compared to 11% and 27% increase, respectively, the previous week). France, the Russian Federation, Spain, and the United Kingdom continue to report the highest numbers of new cases. Turkey reported the 3rd highest deaths in last 7 days after the Russian Federation and Spain.

In France, the highest 7-day incidence was observed in the regions of Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur -- the latter including the city of Marseille, which has emerged as the epicenter of the country's 2nd wave in recent weeks. While the number of hospitalized cases has doubled in the past 10 days, hospitalization numbers remain a magnitude smaller than observed earlier this year and hospital stays have tended to be shorter. Nonetheless, test positivity rates have continued to trend upwards (reaching 7.4% on [27 Sep 2020]), and 58/101 departments are now classified in the red zone indicating very high levels of infection.

In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID19 in all age groups, with the regions of Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the North West, and the North East reporting the highest incidence in the past week. Wales has reported the highest rates of infection to date (727.7 per 100 000 population), followed by England (664), Northern Ireland (566.6), and Scotland (504.7).

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [27 Sep 2020].

- South-East Asia Region
The South-East Asia Region is the 2nd most affected Region, accounting for 21% and 11% of cumulative cases and deaths, respectively. While the Region had been reporting increasing cases and deaths since March [2020], in the past week, a 7% decrease in new cases and a 3% decrease in new deaths were observed. The countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, while Myanmar reported the highest increase in cases (92% increase) and deaths (80% increase) compared to the previous week.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [27 Sep 2020]

- Western Pacific Region
Overall, the Western Pacific Region continues to show the lowest cumulative cases, accounting for just 2% of global cases and 1% of all deaths. The Philippines and Japan account for the highest number of new cases and new deaths in the Region. All countries in the Region except Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam reported decreases in new cases, as compared to the previous week. Only Malaysia reported an increase in new deaths.

Incidence of COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea remains low. An 8-fold increase was reported in August [2020] (396 cases) compared to July [2020] (52 cases). The number of cases reported so far in September [2020] (73 cases) is lower but there may be other undetected cases since the testing and overall health care capacity in the country are limited.

[Interpretations of today and yesterday's data need to be cautioned due to weekend artifact. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours included Sweden and Venezuela, but a number of countries show a significant decrease in reported daily numbers compared with Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday reports. The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (69 671), followed by the USA (40 268) and Brazil (16 018) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 51.7% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3954 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (27-28 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (13 068), Argentina (11 807), Russia (8135), and Colombia (5147); 31 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 7 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 1.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.2%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
