Zimbabwe has imposed a quarantine on ostrich farms after detecting an
outbreak of the H5N2 strain of avian flu, which can be lethal to birds but
poses little risk to humans, a state newspaper reported on Thursday.
"Until the full extent of the disease can be established by completion of a
national survey, all ostrich farms in the country have been placed under
quarantine," the state-run Herald newspaper quoted Dr Stuart Hargreaves,
the principal director for Veterinary Services, as saying.
The Herald said the virus had been detected on 2 ostrich farms in
Matabeleland North in the country's west from samples that had been sent to
South Africa.
Hargreaves' secretary confirmed the Herald story and said he was in South
Africa awaiting more test results.
A source at South Africa's Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, where most
testing of this nature is done in the country, could not confirm that it
had received samples from Zimbabwe.
South Africa in 2004 had an outbreak of H5N2 among ostriches that led to
around 26 000 of the birds being culled. It declared itself bird flu-free
in September 2005, and the European Union in November 2005 lifted a ban on
the import of South African ostriches and their meat. H5N2 is not as
virulent as the H5N1 strain that has killed nearly 70 people in Asia since
2003.
The H5N1 strain has not yet been detected in Africa, but experts say
uncovering it in the region's rural areas will be difficult because of poor
surveillance and already high mortality rates among the continent's
backyard chickens.

[It is important to note that this is not H5N1 which was a concern in our
earlier posts. - Mod.DK] [H5N2 is not nearly as pathogenic as the H5N1
strain. However, much of what is known about H5N2 is based on smaller
poultry and not on ostriches.
According to the reports by the WHO, the OIE, and the South African
Institute for Communicable Diseases, the H5N2-virus poses almost no risk to
humans, who have no receptors for the virus in their respiratory tract.
It is likely that the ostrich industry will assemble a task force, such as
it did in 2005 to work in collaboration with the government regarding
control measures for the disease. - Mod.TG]
