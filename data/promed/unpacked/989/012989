FERAL CAT CONTROL (6)
=====================
Over here in Australia we have a severe feral cat problem.
In some areas groups of trappers have formed to exterminate as many cats
as possible in national parks and neighbouring suburbs. Their mode of
operation is to trap during the night (even in their own homes) using
bait smeared with old fish grease. When the dawn trap inspection reveals
a trapped cat it is shot and dumped.
There is no danger of getting scratched and the only draw back is that a
few pets get it. In one area of national park an individual managed to
kill 400 feral cats in a year. This method is of course illegal...here.
