Date: November 19, 1998
From: Henry Wilde MD <wilde@md2.md.chula.ac.th>

The recent outbreak of leptospirosis in Thailand was mostly due to _L.
batavia_. This organism was most commonly isolated from sporadic cases in
the Bangkok area and at Chulalongkorn University Hospital.
Cases cluster during the rainy season and are commonly associated with
wading in flooded streets and gardens. The diagnosis is usually made on
clinical signs (myalgia, hematuria, often jaundice). Laboratory diagnosis
is delayed due to lack of availability of simple bed-side slide tests.
Treatment with IV penicillin is started on an empiric base while awaiting
culture reports. Rarely, the organism is seen in the urine but this is
neither very sensitive nor specific.
A few patients presented with severe right-sided abdominal pain causing
them to be first seen by the surgical service. One was operated on
(cholecystectomy for acalculous cholecystitis) and the diagnosis was made
by the pathologist. The patient recovered. A second similar case avoided
surgery because a resident started IV penicillin, and the clinical
diagnosis was later confirmed by culture.
A simple, inexpensive bed-side slide test would be of great help. Would the
veterinary screening ones work in humans? In any case, leptospirosis is in
Thailand an episodic disease and should pose no threat to tourists.
