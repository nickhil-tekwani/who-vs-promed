Even as novel coronavirus infections in northeast India are comparatively under control so far, the 8 northeastern states are staring at a new threat -- African swine fever (ASF) -- which is suspected to be behind the mysterious deaths of hundreds of pigs.

Animal resource experts in northeast India suspect that the highly contagious ASF came to the region from Tibet in China through Arunachal Pradesh. Four of the 8 northeastern states are free from coronavirus, whereas its spread has been tamed in the other 4 states.

Besides Assam and Meghalaya, which have reported suspected ASF in a total of 15 districts, other state governments in the northeast have sounded a high alert and asked people, especially owners of piggeries, to refrain from bringing pigs from other states.

Assam Agriculture and Veterinary Minister Atul Bora confirmed the deaths of more than 2260 pigs in the state's 6 districts due to suspected ASF, with authorities waiting for confirmatory reports from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal.

The Meghalaya government has already banned the transport of pigs from outside the state after the deaths of pigs in some districts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

Meghalaya's Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong on Wednesday [29 Apr 2020] said that the state issued a notification on Monday [27 Apr 2020] to ban ferrying of pigs from other states. "We have advised people to consume adequately cooked pork only (above 70 deg C [158 deg F] for at least 20 minutes)," the Deputy Chief Minister, who is in charge of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department, told IANS over the phone from Shillong.

The Meghalaya Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department's Principal Secretary Shakil P. Ahamed said in a notification that all government and private pig farms and pig owners should take adequate and strict measures for hygiene and biosecurity such as disinfection of farms/piggeries and other equipment and restrict outsiders' entry to pig farms. "Signs of high fever in pigs and any abnormal mortality should be brought to the notice of the authority concerned," said the notification.

According to animal resource experts, pigs generally are affected by classical swine fever (CSF), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), besides the ASF.

Tripura's Animal Resources Development Department Director and Additional Secretary Dilip Chakma told IANS that after the ASF outbreak in 6 districts of Assam and 9 districts of Arunachal Pradesh, his department has alerted all government and private pig firms and pig owners to take adequate measures to prevent the disease.

According to the Meghalaya government notification, the unusual mortality of a few thousand pigs was reported from Dhemaji, North Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar and Jorhat districts of Assam and in West Kameng, Papum-pare, Lower Siang, Upper Siang, East Siang, Lohit, Lepa-Rada, Namsai, and Changlang districts of Arunachal Pradesh.

Assam's Minister Atul Bora said: "The pigs are dying of a foreign virus, and we guess that it may have come from Tibet in China. Reports of pigs' deaths in Arunachal Pradesh were reported in the 1st week of April [2020]. Many villagers in the state threw the carcasses of dead pigs into a river which flows down to Assam, causing pig deaths in Dhemaji district, which borders Arunachal Pradesh."

According to the minister, more than 2260 pigs have died in Assam's 6 districts so far. "This foreign virus spreads very fast. The Assam government had on 25 Apr 2020 banned the procurement and sale of pigs and pork, shut all slaughterhouses and banned movement of people associated with piggeries from one place to another place," Bora said. He said that normally this is a period for CSF in pigs in Assam. "We have vaccinated animals against CSF."

According to the 2019 census, the population of pigs in various Assam farms was 21 lakh [2.1 million].

[African swine fever (ASF), a re-emerging, lethal, viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boar, has been spreading during the recent decade throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. This OIE-listed disease, against which no vaccine is available, has never been reported from India. Confirmation of the above suspected outbreaks, or their exclusion, is anticipated at the earliest. If confirmed, this 1st outbreak of the disease deserves immediate submission to the OIE.

For the location of India's northeastern states where the suspected cases occurred, such as Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, see map at https://tinyurl.com/ydd7g6va.
