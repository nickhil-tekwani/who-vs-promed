Speaking this afternoon with Dr. Louise MacFarland, Louisiana State
Epidemiologist, she said that they have had laboratory confirmation of four
cases of SLE in residents of Jefferson Parish, and for one resident of
Lafayette. The latter case was first ill in early August [the Jefferson
cases started in mid-August and has been in rehabilitation for resulting
muscular problems.
Presently there are a further two suspect cases in Jefferson; one, a young
woman, is at home; the other is elderly and is in hospital in intensive
care with severe encephalitis.
Interestingly, to date this year they have had no laboratory confirmed
positive birds or mosquitoes. A Jefferson Parish collection from 7+ days
ago is in the laboratory being examined.
