Re: ProMED post "Psittacosis - USA: (MI) parrot, 20160924.4513369"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference outbreak - there was no mention as to the origin of these birds - there is a continuous problem with illegal importation of wild caught species from Central-South America, which in itself is a violation of international accords resulting in birds that are not banded and officially identified, quarantined, and medicated with approved antibiotic protocols.

Follow-up information of the epidemiology and trace back investigation by USDA APHIS needs to be reported in additional postings. APHIS investigators would be directly involved in the official treatment and protocols in addition to the State Department of Agriculture personnel. The private veterinarian's protocols would have to meet official guidance, etc.

Bottom line: this facility may be dealing with illegally captured and smuggled birds.

[Global trade in illegal wildlife is a growing illicit economy worth billions of dollars annually. South and Central America are known sources of Psittaciformes (parrots, macaws, parakeets). Infected birds are usually transported in crowded and stressful conditions which favor pathogen shedding and transmission. - Mod. PMB

In most places in the US psittacosis [in humans] is a reportable disease to the health department, who likely will report it to their USDA counterparts. - Mod. TG
