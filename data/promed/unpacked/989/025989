Officials from the Vermont Secretary of State's Office are investigating
the source of severe bacterial infections among 5 young people in
Middlebury, all of whom recently received tattoos.
The bacterial infections, caused by MRSA (methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_), may be related to tattoos received from an
unlicensed practitioner, according to Dr. Cort Lohff, state epidemiologist
for the Vermont Department of Health.
The Secretary of State's Office, which regulates professional tattoo
artists, is working with the Health Department to halt the spread of the
infection.
MRSA can be transmitted person-to-person by direct contact, or by touching
contaminated objects that have been handled by someone with this infection,
Lohff said.
"The outbreak may or may not be related to tattoos received by these young
people in Middlebury in late Jul 2005," he said. "2 of the young people
have been hospitalized. Right now our primary concern is to make young
people aware of the dangers of receiving a tattoo from someone who is not
licensed."
He added that the "infections can be serious, and though (they) can be
treated with antibiotics, (they) may also require surgery."
Secretary of State Deborah Markowitz said that if the suspected tattoo
artist is found to be the source of the infection, several laws will have
been violated.
Tattooists and body piercers are regulated by the Office of Professional
Regulation, a division of Markowitz' office. Tattooing can only be
performed in licensed shops that are subject to inspection and strict
sanitation and sterilization requirements.
