British troops 'mutiny' over Gulf anthrax jab
By Andrew Gilligan and Peter Almond
ALMOST three-quarters of British servicemen deployed to the Middle East
during the recent Gulf crisis refused anti-anthrax injections - many
because of fears about Gulf war syndrome, the MoD has confirmed.
The low take-up of the jabs is a blow to George Robertson, the Defence
Secretary, who was publicly vaccinated in an attempt to rebuild confidence
in the vaccine. The anthrax jab is the same as one that formed part of a
cocktail of injections blamed by some for outbreaks of mysterious illness
among veterans of the 1991 Gulf war. However, the other vaccines which made
up the 1991 cocktail were not offered this time round.
On Britain's Gulf flagship, the aircraft carrier Invincible, not a single
sailor in the 1,200-strong crew took the injection. On Illustrious, the
carrier that replaced her, only two sailors agreed to be vaccinated.
Take-up on other Navy ships and in the RAF was higher. But overall, only
27 per cent of the 3,500 Service personnel sent to the Gulf accepted the
jabs, the MoD admitted.
Although the troops were not ordered to take the injection, Service chiefs
and ministers "strongly recommended" that they did so because of the threat
of a germ warfare attack by Saddam Hussein. Every Serviceman received a
letter from Mr Robertson assuring them that the vaccine was safe and that
their protection was "paramount". As well as Mr Robertson, John Reid, the
Armed Forces Minister, and General Sir Charles Guthrie, the Chief of the
Defence Staff, were vaccinated.
But MoD officials believe that troops' concern about Gulf War syndrome
outweighed fear of Iraqi attack. Ministers are now reconsidering whether to
make the jabs compulsory, as they were in 1991 and as they still are for
American and other allied troops. A spokesman said: "This matter is kept
under review and we would not rule out compulsion in the future."
The vaccines are not the Services' only line of defence against germ
weapons. Each Serviceman is issued with a protective suit, and parts of
ships can be sealed to make them contamination-proof. One MoD official said
last night: "If we force people to take the vaccine we will be accused of
compromising their rights, and if we don't we will be accused of ignoring
their safety."
Anthrax vaccination requires three injections over six weeks and then a
further injection after six months before it is effective.
