Bolivia's National Tropical Diseases Center (Cenetrop) has confirmed
910 cases of dengue since January [2007], after examining 2790
samples taken from patients with similar symptoms, according to news
reaching Lima on Thursday [15 Mar 2007].
With 848 cases, the eastern province of Santa Cruz was the worst hit
by the disease. There were also 45 cases in the northern province of
Beni, 8 in the southwestern province of Chuquisaca, and 6 in the
central province of Cochabamba, the Center's director Jorge Vargas
was quoted as saying.
If water does not recede in flooded areas, new dengue cases will keep
appearing in the country, Vargas added. Heavy rains triggered by the
El Nino weather phenomenon had created many possible breeding grounds
for the mosquito.
In 2006, there were 1988 cases of classic dengue in Bolivia, or 21
per 100 000, with the vast majority reported in Santa Cruz.

Dr. Cecilia Perret, Faculty of Medicine of the Catholic University,
assured everyone that the 2nd outbreak of dengue detected on Easter
Island [Isla de Pascua] from 2000 until the present does not imply
any danger [from the disease] for the inhabitants of mainland Chile.
"There is a 2nd dengue outbreak, but it is [caused by] the same
[dengue virus] type that appeared in 2000, which explains why there
are so few cases, since the majority of the population is immune, so
mainland Chile does not run any risk [of dengue]."

The Nicaraguan capital Managua and several municipalities of the
western country are on an epidemiologic alert after the deaths of 2
children with hemorrhagic dengue and the detection of another 20
cases of the classical variant of the illness.
The deceased were a 6-year-old girl and a boy of 4 in Managua in
recent days, according to the Public health Minister (MINSA).
About 20 people with dengue are in the capital and the San Rafael del
Sur, Masachapa and Tipitapa areas. A red alert was declared for the
affected municipalities, according to MINSA authorities.
Local authorities exhorted the population to support the
institution's efforts to eradicate the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the
main transmitter of the illness.
Cleaning and fumigation campaigns are announced in the whole city for
the next weeks as part of those actions.

So far, there have been approximately 5000 cases of dengue fever in
Viet Nam, mainly in southern provinces, according to Assistant
Professor Pham Ngoc Dinh, Vice Director of the Central Institute of
Epidemiology. So far, there have been few cases found [in 2007] in
the north because the disease [there] often occurs between June and
November. However, according to estimates, the incidence of disease
tends to rise, especially in the north. To cope with the situation,
the executive board of the Dengue Fever Control Project has actively
trained grassroots health care workers and coordinators to keep close
watch over the development of the disease and has called on people to
take preventive measures.

Subang Jaya recorded the highest number of dengue cases in the 1st 11
weeks of the year [2007]. As of last Saturday [17 Mar 2007], the
municipality recorded 1023 suspected dengue cases with 5 deaths,
outstripping Shah Alam, which recorded 711 cases.
Parliamentary secretary to the Health Ministry Datuk Lee Kah Choon
said that for this year [2007], the number of suspected dengue
infections stood at 12 086 cases. "This number is still high,
particularly for areas in Selangor and Federal Territory, which
continue to be the hotspots for dengue infections," he told reporters
after a briefing with health and local authority officers at his
office here yesterday [20 Mar 2007].
Lee said the government remained concerned over the lack of effort
shown by some residents in the Klang Valley in controlling the spread
of the disease and the breeding of _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
"The neighbors should instead make sure that the rubbish is collected
or disposed of properly, because if there is any breeding of
mosquitoes, they are the ones at risk of contracting dengue," he said.

Dengue cases in Bukidnon province have now reached a 5-year record
high, pushing the region-wide figure despite a declining trend in
other provinces in the past 3 months of the year [2007].
As of Tuesday [20 Mar 2007], 47 dengue cases have been recorded in
Bukidnon, compared to only 12 in the same period last year [2006],
records from the Regional Epidemic Surveillance Unit (Resu) showed.
The deadly mosquito disease has already claimed the lives of 3
victims, one each from Misamis Oriental town of Tagoloan and the
cities of Cagayan de Oro and Valencia.
Although the Bukidnon figure was only a fraction of the 168 dengue
incidents recorded in Misamis Oriental as of this month [March 2007],
it marks a steady growth above the average number posted in the past
5 years, said Dr. David Mendoza, Resu head.
"That the 47 cases are distributed in almost all of the province's
municipalities augurs a wide-scale increase in dengue cases once a
simultaneous outbreak occurs within the province," said Mendoza.
"When you reach the alert threshold, then something is brewing," said
Mendoza, adding that Resu, an agency of the Department of Health
(DOH)-Northern Mindanao, has already taken appropriate interventions
to prevent an epidemic.
Meanwhile, dengue cases this year [2007] have already reached 256 as
of this month [March 2007], slightly higher than the 234 cases
recorded in 2006. However, cases in all other provinces except
Bukidnon have gone down in the past 3 months, with Misamis Occidental
cutting by half the recorded 32 cases in the same period last year [2006].
Mendoza reiterated the DOH's 4S strategy to prevent a dengue
outbreak: "Search and destroy mosquito breeding sites, seek treatment
in case of high fever, self-protection through the use of mosquito
repellent and other contraptions, and say no to indiscriminate fogging."

The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
