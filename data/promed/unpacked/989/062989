Re: Anthrax in Israel

Two cases of bovine anthrax were diagnosed July 10th and 11th [2004] in the
Kimron Veterinary Institute. The attending clinicians suspected anthrax
because of the sudden deaths and uncoagulated blood oozing from the
animals' orifices. The geographical location of the incident is the Lachish
region in the center-south area of Israel. No previous cases of the disease
have been reported from this area. The cows were from a herd of about 250
animals that pastured along a dry riverbed that is usually flooded in the
winter. The contamination may have originated from the area up-river (the
Hebron Mountains).

Diagnosis was based on the morphological aspect of the bacteria in blood
(encapsulated, square-ended rods in short chains), cultural characteristics
(medusa head, lack of motility), susceptibility to penicillin (bead test)
and was confirmed by PCR.

The carcasses were burnt and buried; the herd was vaccinated and removed
from the contaminated area. An environmental study to assess the
contamination of the riverbed is currently being conducted.

Anthrax cases are recorded in ruminants Israel sporadically (0-2
cases/year). The last cases were observed 5 years ago in the north of the
country. It is the policy of the Veterinary Services to vaccinate the
afflicted herds for 10 years after an outbreak.

[According to the official Israeli Vet Services vaccination figures, the
total numbers of cattle vaccinations during the last 5 years were:

Year: 1999/ 2000/ 2001/ 2002/ 2003
No. vaccinations: 2527/ 2199/ 1900/ 2030/ 22891


The mass vaccination of cattle in 2003 was due to the biological war threat
during the Iraqi war. The disease has been under very effective control for
some years in Israel. The speculative explanation for downstream spread is
not unknown elsewhere in the world but is always very difficult to prove as
it usually depends on unknown cattle graves being washed out. Northern Israel
has always been the most severely affected in the past, although the disease
is now well controlled there. Our thanks to Dr Elad for this very prompt and
informative report. - Mods. MHJ/AS]
