Update on outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis in Ohio
---------------------------------
A total of 86 cases have been confirmed in the outbreak of
cryptosporidiosis that started in Delaware County in July; 59 cases in
Delaware County, and 27 in the adjoining Franklin County. Of these 11 are
within the city of Columbus. Additional cases (no number specified) are
being reported from adjoining Licking County. Children at 7 Delaware
County day-care centers have either tested positive or shown symptoms of
the disease. Some food-service and medical personnel in the county have
tested positive. Efforts at stopping the outbreak are being concentrated
on day-care centers. A team from CDC is on site to study the outbreak.

[The initial outbreak was reportedly associated with a swimming pool, that
it now seems much more widespread indicating that drinking water may be at
least an important factor in the outbreak.-Mod.EP
