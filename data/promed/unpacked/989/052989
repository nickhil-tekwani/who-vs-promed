Farmers lose 300 goats to disease
---------------------------------
More than 300 goats have died in the last one month in East Pokot
District following an outbreak of a disease suspected to be Rift
Valley fever. Kolloa Division residents said that at least 10 farmers
in Kolloa and Kaisagat locations had lost half of their stocks and
appealed to the government to intervene to avert more deaths.

Pastor Job Rutto of the Africa Inland Church said the symptoms of the
disease included coughing, diarrhoea, mucus in the nostrils and
foaming in the mouth. "When slaughtered, the lungs are smaller than
usual and dark in colour," the cleric said. Pastor Rutto, who is also
the representative of livestock keepers from Kolloa at the District
Steering Group, complained that even though they had reported the
matter to the relevant authorities, no action had been taken to
address the plight of the farmers. "We fear that if the trend
continues, we will end up losing all our goats," he said, adding that
the 1st symptoms were noticed 3 months ago.

Contacted for comment, East Pokot District Veterinary Officer Joseph
Lang'at said he suspected the killer disease to be the contagious
caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP). "A resident bought a goat from Kolloa
recently and brought it to Chemolingot and within a few days the
other goats were infected and some died," Dr Lang'at said. He said
samples had been taken to Kabete veterinary laboratory for testing,
but the results were not yet out. The veterinary officer denied
receiving any complaints from livestock keepers in Kolloa, but
advised those affected to treat the sick animals with broad-spectrum
antibiotics. "We have also deployed our officers to ascertain the
farmers" claims," Dr Lang'at said.

However, Pastor Rutto said most farmers could not afford to treat
their animals as the drugs were expensive. He said he had spent more
than Sh 5000 [USD 61.54] to treat his goats, but they still died.

Dr Lang'at said plans were underway for his office to roll out
vaccination of livestock in Churo, Tangulbei and Kolloa areas next
month with assistance from VSF Belgium, an international
non-governmental organisation. He advised farmers in the affected
areas in Kolloa to quarantine their animals within the affected
locations to curb further spread of the disease.

[According to Kenya's reporting to the OIE, CCPP is endemic in the
said country; during 2009, 17 outbreaks were reported, and 1 493 335
goats vaccinated.

Excluding RVF, a serious zoonotic disease, is particularly important
due to its public health implications. RVF was absent during 2009;
the last outbreak in animals was recorded in June 2007. However, in
May 2010, the Kenyan government was, reportedly, on high alert over a
possible outbreak of RVF epidemic in North Eastern, upper Eastern and
the Rift Valley provinces. According to the Livestock Minister, high
activity of the disease was observed in animals in pastoralist areas
and vaccinations were undertaken (see archived 20100520.1675)

The East Pokot district is situated in the Rift Valley province.

Epidemiological and laboratory results of the current event are
requested. In view of the described disease signs (coughing,
diarrhoea), PPR deserves to be considered as well. - Mod.AS]
