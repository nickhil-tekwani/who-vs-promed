Plague Confirmed in Albany County Cat
-------------------------------------
Laboratory testing has recently confirmed a rural Albany County cat died of plague, according to the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH).

The cat's home was in the Laramie area and the animal lived primarily outdoors or in outbuildings. Other cats in a group at the same location have also died during the past several months, indicating likely spread of plague.

While there have been no human illnesses associated with the current Albany County situation, WDH reported a human case of pneumonic plague in a Fremont County individual who had exposure to sick pet outdoor cats last September [2021]. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during 2010-2019 there was an average of 5 human plague cases each year in the United States.

"Plague is a serious bacterial infection which can be deadly for pets and people if not treated as soon as possible with antibiotics," said Courtney Tillman, epidemiologist with WDH. "The disease can be passed to humans from ill animals and by fleas coming from infected animals. We are letting people know of the potential threat in the cat's home area as well as offering a reminder about plague to people across the state."

"While the disease is rare in humans, plague occurs naturally in the western United States in areas where rodents and their fleas become infected," Tillman said. "It is safe to assume a risk for plague exists all around our state."

Recommended precautions to help prevent plague infection include:
*Use repellent if exposure to fleas is possible during activities such as camping, hiking or working outdoors. Products containing DEET can be applied to the skin as well as clothing.
*Keep fleas off indoor and outdoor pets by applying flea control products. Animals roaming freely outdoors are more likely to come into contact with plague-infected animals or fleas.
*Avoid unnecessary exposure to rodents, including avoiding areas with unexplained rodent die-offs and rodent carcasses.
*If pets become sick, seek care for them from a veterinarian as soon as possible.
*Do not allow dogs or cats roaming free to share beds with people.
*Reduce rodent habitats around the home, workplace and recreational areas by removing brush, rock piles, junk, cluttered firewood and possible rodent food supplies.
*Wear gloves and a mask if handling potentially infected or deceased animals to prevent contact between your skin and the plague bacteria and to prevent inhaling the plague bacteria.

Plague signs in pets can include enlarged lymph glands; swelling in the neck, face or around the ears; fever; chills; lack of energy; coughing; vomiting; diarrhea and dehydration.

Plague symptoms in people can include fever, swollen and tender lymph glands, extreme exhaustion, headache, chills, coughing, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. People who are ill should seek professional medical attention.

[Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, other small rodents, and sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel, other rodents, or other animals or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts.

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1-7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic (actually there are 3 forms: bubonic, pneumonic, and some include septicemic. - Mod.TG). Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes.'
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30%-60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives." (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague)

Cats
----
"Signs and diagnosis
The most common presentation of plague in cats is bubonic plague. Cats with bubonic plague usually have fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, and an enlarged lymph node that may be abscessed and draining. Ulcers in the mouth, skin abscesses (pockets of pus and infection), discharge from the eyes, diarrhea, vomiting, and diffuse spreading inflammation of tissues beneath the skin have also been documented. High fever may be present. Cats with primary septicemic plague have no obvious disease of the lymph nodes but have fever, lethargy, and poor appetite. Septic signs may also include diarrhea, vomiting, excessively rapid heart rate, weak pulse, and breathing distress. Primary pneumonic plague has not been documented in cats. Cats with secondary pneumonic plague may have all the signs of septicemic plague along with a cough and other abnormal lung sounds.

"To diagnose plague, your veterinarian will take samples (such as blood, fluid from the lymph nodes, or a swab from the mouth or throat) for testing and confirmation of the presence of plague-causing bacteria. Blood tests may also help.

"Treatment and prevention
Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"The duration of infectivity in treated cats is not known with certainty, but cats are thought to be noninfectious after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment if there are indications of improvement. During the infectious period, cats should remain hospitalized, especially if there are signs of pneumonia. Human cases have occurred in cat owners trying to give medications by mouth at home, exposing them to contact with the mouth and associated infectious secretions.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs that suggest plague should be placed in isolation at a veterinary hospital, and infection control measures, should be implemented for the protection of you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected animal. Examples of infection control measures include disinfection, protective clothing (such as gloves and face masks), and possibly preventive antibiotics for in-contact animals or people. Your veterinarian will contact local public health officials so they can help minimize spread of the disease.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to the plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your cat." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/cat-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-cats/plague-in-cats)

Dogs
----
"Septicemic plague results when the plague spreads through the blood and affects multiple internal organs (such as the spleen, liver, heart, and lungs)."

"Dogs are inherently resistant to the plague-causing bacteria. Dogs becoming infected with plague are less likely to show signs of illness than infected cats. Signs may include fever, lethargy, inflammation of the lymph nodes below the lower jaw, a pus-like lesion along the jaw, lesions in the mouth, and cough.

"Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained with bacterial cultures. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs suggestive of plague should be placed in isolation and infection control measures implemented to protect you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected pet.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your pet." (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-dogs/plague-in-dogs)

Veterinarians are susceptible to plague, as bubos can rupture unexpectedly onto their hand(s) during the examination an animal. Any tiny cuts/scrapes could easily result in infection, as could possible inhalation of any bacteria.

Protecting your pets from fleas is critical for their well-being, and for yours. Fleas carry plague and potentially other diseases. But what do you use to treat your pet? There are a number of products on the market. However, some over-the-counter medications can be toxic to your pets, especially cats. A brand name does not mean safety and effectiveness. Please consult your veterinarian about safe and effective flea prevention. In some areas, fleas are resistant to some prevention products. The veterinarian is most familiar with what products are safe and effective in your area. - Mod.TG
