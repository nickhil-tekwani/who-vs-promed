Tunnels filled knee-high with bat guano caused a deadly outbreak of histoplasmosis in the Dominican Republic, raising awareness of what may be an underdiagnosed infection in Latin America, investigators said.

The outbreak occurred in 2015 among 36 men who were hired to clean the bat excrement from several long access tunnels leading to a hydroelectric dam, according to findings from a CDC-led investigation that were published in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1]. The tunnels, which allow access for inspection and maintenance of the dam, were home to large colonies of bats and had not been cleaned in decades, Paige A. Armstrong, MD, MPH, medical epidemiologist in the Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, and colleagues reported.

A total of 28 men were hospitalized in the outbreak, including 9 who required intensive care, and 3 died. The men likely became infected by breathing in stirred-up fungal spores while working without proper respiratory protection in the dark, hot tunnels, the investigators said.

Although the fungi responsible for the infections, _Histoplasma capsulatum_, is endemic to the Caribbean, and histoplasmosis is diagnosed in travelers returning from the Dominican Republic, this was the 1st outbreak reported on the island. However, Armstrong and colleagues said previous cases and outbreaks may simply have gone unnoticed.

"These were likely not the 1st cases of histoplasmosis in the Dominican Republic," Armstrong told Infectious Disease News. "Identifying cases ... can be challenging, usually requiring special diagnostic methods."

The investigators said clinicians in the Dominican Republic were largely unfamiliar with histoplasmosis before the outbreak and no laboratory had the capacity to definitively diagnose it. But Armstrong said investigators believe the outbreak increased awareness among health care providers about the disease. "Throughout this investigation, we worked closely with partners from the CDC Dominican Republic office and the ministries of health and labor," she said. "Efforts are ongoing to expand education and diagnostic capacity for histoplasmosis in the country."

_H. capsulatum_ live in the environment, particularly in soil containing large amounts of bird or bat droppings, according to the CDC. Most people who breathe in the spores never have symptoms. Armstrong and colleagues said delays in recognition and treatment in the 2015 outbreak likely contributed to an unusually high proportion of hospitalizations and deaths among the tunnel workers.

Health officials in the Dominican Republic asked the CDC on Sept. 16, 2015, to help determine what caused an outbreak of an unknown severe febrile illness. Upon arriving, investigators -- including Armstrong, then an officer in the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service -- looked at company payrolls to find workers who had been in the tunnels and reviewed records from the hospitals where they were treated. During their investigation, they interviewed workers who were still living and the immediate family members of those who had died.

They said patients were initially treated for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease endemic to the region, but their infections did not respond to penicillin. Physicians notified local health officials about the illnesses and the patients' common exposure to tunnel work.

Abstract
--------
Background
----------
"Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection associated with exposure to bat guano. An outbreak of an unknown severe febrile illness occurred among tunnel workers in the Dominican Republic (DR), and resulted in several deaths. We conducted an investigation to confirm etiology and recommend control measures.

Methods
-------
"A case was defined as fever and greater than or equal to 2 symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis in a tunnel worker, July-September, 2015. We interviewed workers and family members, reviewed medical records, tested serum and urine for Histoplasma antigen/antibody, and conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors for histoplasmosis and severe infection (intensive care).

Results
-------
"A crew of 36 male workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels without respiratory protection for a median of 24 days per worker (range: 1-25). Median age was 32 years (range: 18-62); none were immunocompromised. Thirty (83 percent) workers had illness that met the case definition of whom 28 (93 percent) were hospitalized, 9 (30 percent) required intensive care, 6 (20 percent) required intubation, and 3 (10 percent) died. The median time from symptom onset to antifungal treatment was 6 days (range: 1-11). Twenty-two of 34 (65 percent) workers had laboratory evidence of histoplasmosis infection.

Conclusions
-----------
"Severe illnesses and death likely resulted from exposure to large inocula of Histoplasma capsulatum spores in an enclosed space, lack of respiratory protection, and delay in recognition and treatment. Clinician education about histoplasmosis, improved laboratory capacity to diagnose fungal infections, and occupational health guidance to protect workers against endemic fungi are recommended in the DR to prevent future outbreaks."

The crew of 36 male workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels at the Bao-Tavera Dam Complex, 2 earth-filled embankment dams located about 15 km (9.3 miles) south of Santiago in Santiago Province of the Dominican Republic; it provides municipal water and water for irrigation, and generates hydroelectric power (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao-Tavera_Dams).
