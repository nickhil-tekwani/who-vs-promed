Authorities urged 4500 people treated by a local anesthesiologist to
get tested for hepatitis, saying 3 patients may have been infected
with the liver-damaging disease while the doctor was giving them
anesthesia.
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said
Thursday [14 Jun 2007] it was mailing letters to everyone at risk and
noted that the disease cannot be spread by casual contact. At total
of 3 people treated by the doctor in August 2006 were diagnosed with
hepatitis C in recent months, the health department said. Laboratory
tests and other evidence suggest they were infected while getting
intravenous anesthesia drugs during outpatient medical procedures,
according to the agency.
Authorities have not identified the anesthesiologist. A state Health
Department spokeswoman, Claudia Hutton, said the agency had not
established "that the doctor is guilty of doing anything wrong." The
doctor has had a medical license since 1977 and "does not have a
history of spreading infection," Hutton said.
City authorities said they were contacting everyone treated by the
same anesthesiologist while he or she practiced at 10 different
medical offices in New York City, from 1 Dec 2003 to 1 May 2007. The
doctor has stopped practicing during the investigation, the city
health department said.
"Transmission of hepatitis in a medical setting is rare, but as a
precaution we are reaching out to anyone who could have potentially
been exposed," Dr. Marci Layton, the agency's assistant commissioner
for communicable disease, said in a statement. She stressed that
intravenous medications are "very safe when standard
infection-control procedures are followed," and that patients should
not avoid important procedures because of worries about infections."
Hepatitis C (HCV) is a virus that can cause scarring or other damage
to the liver. It often does not cause noticeable symptoms, although
some people experience flu-like symptoms, a yellowing of the skin and
the whites of the eyes, dark urine and pale feces. There are several
treatments.

[The NYC DOH press release is available at
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr2007/pr048-07.shtml>. One
suspects they are checking to see if it is MD related or if it is
center related before they release more specific information. They
have done outreach using the MD records so once they can identify the
most likely "route" of infection, they identify the individuals who
have not responded to their outreach letter/contact attempt. This
post will serve as an alert for other MDs to inquire if patients with
newly diagnosed HCV have a history of outpatient surgery. - Mod.MPP]
