The nation's dog lovers have been warned that they must get their pooches
vaccinated against rabies or risk "serious punishment". According to a
regulation issued on Friday [18 Jan 2008] by the Ministries of Health and
Agriculture, all dogs in China are required to be vaccinated against rabies.

A total of 3380 people were killed in China by rabies last year [2007],
according to statistics from the Ministry of Health. A joint statement
issued by the Ministries said that owners who refuse to get their dogs
vaccinated will face "serious punishment," while legal action will be taken
against owners whose dogs cause the spread of the disease.

Currently, less than 10 per cent of dogs are vaccinated against the disease
that affects the nervous system. Most of these are registered dogs in
cities, Ding Zhengrong, an epidemic prevention official in Yunnan province,
said. "If the dogs aren't vaccinated, it's their owners' fault," Beijing
pensioner and dog lover De Shulan, said. She has registered both of her
dogs and got official licenses. "With the licenses, my dogs receive free
annual vaccinations against rabies at a designated pet clinic," De told
China Daily. Beijing has more than 300 such facilities. It cost De 1000
yuan (USD 140) to register each dog and 500 yuan (USD 70) a year to renew
the licenses. The payments vary depending on different cities. Dog lovers
in Guangzhou have to pay 10 000 yuan (USD 1400) for registration and then
6000 yuan (USD 840) a year to keep their canine companions.

However, such a clear-cut dog registration and vaccination system is
lacking in the countryside, meaning most of the people who contract rabies
are rural dwellers, Ding said. The new regulation requires strengthened
vaccination work in rural areas.

Meanwhile, city dwellers have been urged to help the authorities to track
down stray dogs to ensure they are vaccinated.

An official from the dog keeping administration office in Beijing's
Dongcheng district called on the public to report abandoned animals by
calling a hotline on 01064005129. "They will be taken to the sanctuary
where they will be vaccinated and stay until they get new owners," the
official said.

[Compulsory canine vaccination could become one of the 1st positive
outcomes of the 2008 Olympiad in Beijing. Human rabies is an escalating
problem in China which requires a drastic response. The numbers of rabies
deaths in China are given by the Ministry of Health as 2651 in 2004, 2537
in 2005, 3279 in 2006, and 3380 in 2007. Compulsory vaccination of canines
kept as companion animals is a laudable aim, possibly achievable in
Beijing. But the considerable expense of vaccination for pet owners and
lack of uniformity of regulations in other cities may be barriers to
achieving control of rabies outside the capital. Canine rabies control in
rural areas remains an unsolved problem and may require implementation of a
state-supported free vaccination campaign. - Mod.CP]
