On Thursday [28 Jan 2016], 4 people are believed to have died of yellow fever [YF] in the municipality of Caluquembe, southern Huila province.

The information was released by Huila health authorities who added the 4 were part of 7 suspect cases of yellow fever reported in Caluquembe, some 117 kilometres of the capital, Lubango.

Speaking at the end of an emergency meeting convened by Huila province governor, Marcelino Tyipinge, the head of the local Health Department said the suspect cases were brought by patients who arrived from Luanda.

Telma Diogo said the cases were mainly diagnosed in adults, having the samples been sent to Luanda for testing.

Huila province last recorded cases of yellow fever in 1992 [there were suspected cases in 2006 in Huila; see ProMED archives listed below].

[In the previous report of YF earlier this week, there were 99 cases, of which 26 are confirmed with 8 deaths (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160127.3965357). These cases occurred in Viana municipality, a suburb of the capital, Luanda, which was reported on 26 Jan 2016. The current YF cases are in the municipality of Caluquembe, located in southern Huila province and nearly 1000 km [620 miles] from the Luanda outbreak. This raises the question if these are independent outbreaks, or if the Huila outbreak was initiated by a viremic individual traveling from Viana to Caluquembeas as the governor suspects. The Angola outbreak is a month old now. Vigorous action including vaccination and vector control are necessary to bring the outbreak in these 2 localities under control before they spread further. In YF outbreaks, time and inaction are the enemies.
