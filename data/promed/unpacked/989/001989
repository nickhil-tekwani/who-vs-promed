At least 4 people have been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for
suspected red tide poisoning, nearly 3 months after the state Fisheries
Department warned of the outbreak in Sabah's coastal areas.
Of the 4, one was from Kampung Tebongon in Menggatal some 12km from here
while the rest were from Kampung Sabang in Karambunai, some 16km from the
city.
Quoting hospital sources, the report said the 4 had eaten crabs and ikan
tamban before vomiting and having difficulty in passing motion. The sources
said 1of the patients had been allowed to return home while the other 3
were still being kept under observation.
Sabah Medical and Health Services Department director Dr Saimy Ismail and
Queen Elizabeth hospital director Datin Dr Rahimah Mohd Said could not be
reached for comment.
The Fisheries Department first warned of the red tide outbreak last January
in waters off the northern Sabah district of Kudat and Sandakan, Tawau and
Lahad Datu in the east coast.
Following the outbreak, caused by sea-borne micro-organisms, the department
has warned the public against consuming all types of shellfish and some
types of fish such as ikan tamban and ikan tulai.
