A chicken died suddenly at the Clark County Fair as a result of a herpes virus, fair officials said.

"It's a herpes virus, highly contagious," said Clark County Fair veterinarian Dana King, who confirmed the diagnosis Friday morning [27 Jul 2018]. "We're going to have to inform every exhibitor that, unfortunately, we've had a contagious disease here. Fortunately, it's only in chickens and pheasants."

King said the fair was contacted Wednesday [25 Jul 2018] night after a chicken suddenly died. After testing with the Ohio Department of Agriculture, it was determined the death was a result of the virus.

King said the virus usually has a low mortality rate; however, officials are contacting everyone who had an animal on exhibit at the fair.

The birds brought to the county fair are now being quarantined for 30 days, which will prevent any of them from attending the state fair in Columbus. "The exhibitors going on to the state fair are going to be denied that opportunity, which we feel very sorry about," King said.

[Herpes virus in chickens, and rarely in turkeys, is also known as Marek's disease, sometimes known as MD.

Marek's disease, a List B poultry disease, is found in most countries where chickens are maintained. MD occurs at 3-4 weeks of age or older and is most common between 12 and 30 weeks of age.

Marek's disease may present as a neurological disease. As such, the CNS and nerve involvement results in transient paralysis, which may occasionally be longer lasting, and is most noticeable in the wings, the legs, and may cause eye lesions. It has earned the nickname "floppy broiler syndrome."

This herpes virus may also present as tumor in the heart, lungs, muscles, ovaries and testes. This form is referred to as the visceral form.

The 3rd way this may present is the cutaneous form. having tumors in the feather follicle.

This article does not tell us which of the 3 forms was present, but rather it may have been diagnosed post mortem. However, in living birds, clinical signs may include: Paralysis of legs, wings and neck; weight loss; in the eyes, the iris may be grey or there may be irregular pupils and there is believed to be vision impairment; if the skin and feather follicles are affected, there may be a raised and roughened appearance to the skin.

Prevention is generally by strict hygiene and by vaccination. - Mod.TG
