The outbreak of the dreaded foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), locally known as "khredu", in the sheep and goats coming to lower Kangra from tribal Chamba district is affecting the financial condition of shepherds. Over 1000 shepherds are harried a lot, as most of their sheep and goats have got infected with the transmitted disease. A large number of animals have been killed [see comment]. The state Wool Federation is yet to rescue the hapless shepherds.

The migratory shepherds, who have arrived the lower Kangra areas from Bharmour in Chamba district, lamented that neither the federation nor the Veterinary Department authorities had taken any steps. "After infected with the disease, some animals had high fever before dying," they said.

The shepherds are in a panic after losing their livestock and seek immediate treatment of their ailing animals and vaccination to their livestock, as these are their source of livelihood. Panic has also gripped the villages where they are keeping their livestock for grazing, as the disease is being transmitted to their livestock too.

[FMD is endemic in India, mostly reported from bovines, predominantly cattle, as well as buffaloes and wild species. The scarcity of reported cases in small ruminants (sheep and goats) from India may reflect a true absence of disease, due to low susceptibility of local breeds to the circulating virus strains. More likely, outbreaks are missed because clinical signs of FMD in sheep and goats are generally of a lesser significance than their presentation in cattle; in many cases, lameness is the only sign observed. However, serious cases do occur; a notable, serious manifestation of FMD infection in small ruminants is sudden, mass mortality of young lambs/kids, due to cardiac arrest (pancarditis).

The symptoms in sheep and goats, described in the above report, are compatible with FMD, though high mortality of adult animals due to FMD is rather unusual. In the absence of a denominator, the mortality and case fatality rates cannot be calculated. The diagnosis deserves confirmation by the State veterinary authorities, excluding other etiologies.
