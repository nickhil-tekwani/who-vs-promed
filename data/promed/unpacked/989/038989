According to epidemiologist Marco Acuna of the Aysen SEREMI (Regional
Ministerial Secretariat) for Health, the presence of [a] hantavirus
[infection] is suspected in a 30-year-old man from the
difficult-to-reach Rio Cuervo area on the Aysen coastal plain. The
pertinent tests have been carried out and confirmation or not of the
presence of the virus is expected next Tuesday [30 Mar 2010].

"We carried out an epidemiological investigation of this case, which
was reported on Tuesday [23 Mar 2010]. It is a suspected hantavirus
infection in a 30-year-old patient with a clinical picture of
pneumonia who works in an extremely rural sector, 20 km [12 mi]
northwest of Puerto Aysen," said the specialist.

The man was transported by air to the Puerto Aysen Hospital, where
pneumonia was diagnosed. "We immediately initiated investigations but
because the sector where this worker had been is accessible only by
helicopter, only today [25 Mar 2010] SEREMI Health personnel could go
to the area to conclude the investigation. We were able to verify that
there were no important risk conditions in the area of the camp where
this worker was living and eating, but conditions for high risk of
infection were present in the ecological environment where he carried
out his activities," explained Marco Acuna.

[The ecological conditions that led the epidemiologists to conclude
that the patient had been in a high risk area are not specified. These
conditions would determine the rodent hantavirus reservoirs that might
be present and the hantavirus that might be involved. Although not
stated, the hantavirus involved in this case is likely Andes virus.

Health authorities of Osorno province announced that there was a
suspected case of hantavirus [infection], in a 40-year-old man who was
admitted to the Osorno Base Hospital. Currently, he is in stable
condition. According to the 1st information [released], he is a
construction worker who was working in the rural area of Las Gaviotas
(Puerto Octay commune).

The patient was admitted yesterday (Tuesday 23 [Mar 2010]) into the
Osorno Base Hospital with a [clinical] picture of fever, headache and
respiratory involvement; a rapid test for hantavirus[es] was positive,
although confirmation by the ISP [Institute of Public Health] is
awaited.

Tomorrow (Thursday 25 [Mar 2010]), personnel of the Health Authority
will carry out an epidemiological operation in the area of the rural
sector of Las Gaviotas in order to observe the environmental
conditions, which might determine the probable infection.

The most important mode of transmission [of hantaviruses] is by
inhalation of aerosols from feces, urine, and saliva of carrier
rodents. In Chile, the causal agent is Andes hantavirus, which causes
a cardiopulmonary syndrome or a milder disease without pulmonary
complications. The reservoir is the wild rodent _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_ (long-tailed pygmy rice rat), and its habitat extends
from the south of the Atacama region to the Magallanes.

Note that in Osorno province there have been 25 confirmed cases of
hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome since 2001.
