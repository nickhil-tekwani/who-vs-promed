Doctors on the Andaman Islands have confirmed that members of the Jarawa
tribe have been suffering from measles. The local authorities had denied
that there had been an outbreak of measles within the tribe, claiming
instead that a number of Jarawa had "heat rash".
A large number of Jarawa children have been admitted to GB Pant Hospital in
the town of Port Blair in the past month, with various diseases including
pneumonia and eye problems -- both common after-effects of measles. All
have now been returned to their forest. Doctors told the BBC this week that
the children were in fact suffering from measles.
When 108 Jarawa contracted measles in 1999, the local authorities also
denied that the Jarawa had [contracted] the disease, but were forced to
concede several weeks later following the testimony of doctors on the
islands. Survival [International] has repeatedly warned that the
authorities' failure to keep outsiders out of the Jarawa reserve, and to
close the road that runs illegally through the reserve, put the Jarawa at
risk of potentially fatal diseases.
Diseases like measles have wiped out many tribal peoples worldwide. In the
19th century, the disease wiped out at least half of the Great Andamanese
on one island and all those on another island. That tribe, once 5000
strong, now numbers only 41 people.
In 1978, following the construction of a highway through their forest, 4
Yanomami communities in Brazil lost 50 per cent of their population to measles.

[The Andaman Islands are a group of islands in the Bay of Bengal, and are
part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India. Port
Blair is the chief community and the administrative center of the Union
Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within
the Union Territory, the Andaman district (the Nicobar district was
separated and established as a new district in 1974). The population of the
Andamans has a population of 314 084 in 2001.

It is likely that measles virus infection will continue to contribute to
the decline in the isolated indigenous tribal populations of the Islands
unless the Indian authorities introduce a systematic vaccination programme.
