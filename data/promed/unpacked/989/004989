Close to 500 cases of scrub typhus have been reported from various districts of Odisha this year [2021], Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar informed the Parliament on Friday [10 Dec 2021].

In a written reply to an unstarred question by Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka, the minister said the centre was aware of the occurrence of the scrub typhus disease in the state. "In 2021, a total of 497 cases of scrub typhus have been reported from various districts of Odisha. Nabarangpur has reported 43 cases this year," he said.

In view of rising trends of scrub typhus, an advisory was issued by National Center for Disease Control in September 2021 to all states/UTs regarding containment measures for the prevention of the occurrence and management of the outbreaks.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is caused by a bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. It spreads to people through bite of infected chiggers (larval mites). The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash.

[We are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species, including _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like organism that is the cause of scrub typhus. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease, and one taken 2-4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of chiggers, the larval stage of infected mites. Mites serve as both the vector and reservoir for _O. tsutsugamushi_. Larvae can also acquire _O. tsutsugamushi_ from infected rodents and while co-feeding on uninfected rodents with infected larvae (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6136631/).

Chiggers, after feeding on their hosts, drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Odisha, formerly Orissa, is an Indian state located along the Bay of Bengal in Eastern India, bordered by West Bengal and Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, Andhra Pradesh to the south, and Telangana to the southwest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha). Nabarangpur is a district and city in southwest Odisha; most of its population is tribal, and the land is heavily forested (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabarangpur_district).
