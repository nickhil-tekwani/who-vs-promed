65 children have been hospitalized in Gudermes Hospital with a diagnosis of
leptospirosis, according to Chief Physician of the Central District Hospital
Idris Baysultanov. The outbreak occurred in the village of Ilishan Yurt in the
district of Gudermes. The source of infection is thought to be the Michik
River, where the children were swimming. According to Baysultanov, the water
is the source of infection, since the decomposing carcass of an animal was
discovered upstream.
The children are experiencing the characteristic symptoms of muscle pain and
fever.
The river water is used by local people for cooking. Baysultanov claims that
measures have been instituted by officials to identify infected people, and
swimming is forbidden.ï¿½
There is the danger that disease could spread to other districts, because the
Michik flows into the Gums River, which then joins with another river, the
Sunjey.

[It is not stated how the specific diagnosis of leptospire infection was made
in these cases. Serious, potentially life-threatening complications of
leptospirosis include renal failure, liver disease, and pneumonia.
Although leptospirosis is usually acquired by exposure to water contaminated
with infected rodent urine, the reservoir may also be larger animals,
including livestock. The presence upstream of a decomposing animal (species
not stated) may have nothing to do with this cluster. - Mod.LL]
