Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples
- Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) detected in the stool samples of 2 healthy contacts of 2 different negative acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases
- Nigeria - 1 new case of cVDPV2 and 2 new cVDPV2-positive environmental samples
- Somalia - 1 new case of cVDPV2

Afghanistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported this week.
- The total number of cases reported in Afghanistan in 2018 is 11.
- The latest case, from Arghandab district, Kandahar province, had onset of paralysis on [17 Jul 2018].
- A total of 2 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, one from Jalalabad province and one from Kandahar province.
- During the August [2018] immunization campaign, almost 10 million children were visited by vaccinators to protect them from the virus.

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported this week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases reported in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case, from Dukki district, Balochistan province, had onset of paralysis on [18 May 2018].

Nigeria
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- One new cVDPV2 case has been reported in the past week, from Nganzai Local Government Area, Borno state, with onset of paralysis on [13 Jul 2018].
- A total of 2 new cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, one from Yobe state and one from Sokoto state.
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct AFP surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] subnational immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continues to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in the DRC. The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 remains 11.
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In the past week, cVDPV2 was detected in the stool samples of 2 healthy contacts of 2 different negative AFP cases. Based on the positive contacts, AFP cases will be classified as cVDPV2.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication."
- The high-level meeting was convened by HE the Minister of Health, as well as the WHO Director-General and the Regional Director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- One new cVDPV2 case was reported in Somalia in the past week, from Daynile district, Banadir province, with onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2018].
- Somalia has reported a total of 5 cases in 2018: 2 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3 and one cVDPV2&3.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week.
- The total number of cases in the country in 2018 is 4 (one from Eastern Highland, one from Enga and 2 from Morobe province).
- The latest case, from Eastern Highland province, had onset of paralysis on [8 Jul 2018].
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang and Eastern Highland provinces. In addition, 3 more campaigns are planned for late August, September and October [2018].
- With confirmation of recent cases in Eastern Highland and Enga provinces, the geographic extent of the outbreak response is currently being reviewed and will be expanded as necessary.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of AFP and poliovirus are being implemented across the country, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

[Once again there is good news and not so good news. The good news is the absence of newly confirmed cases of WPV1 in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria, with the most recent dates of onset of cases in Pakistan 18 May 2018, Afghanistan 17 Jul 2018, and Nigeria 21 Aug 2016, as well as the absence of identification of new cases of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea. The not so good news: 2 positive WPV1 environmental samples in Afghanistan, 2 cVDPV2 cases identified in DRC Congo (confirming AFP cases), one cVDPV2 case in Nigeria (Borno), 2 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples in Nigeria (Yobe, Sokoto), and one cVDPV2 case in Somalia (Banadir). Hence, VDPVs continue to be a significant issue confronting the polio eradication goal with current circulation and outbreaks identified in Nigeria, DRC, and Somalia, as well as continued circulation of WPV1 in Afghanistan.

Confusing information is presented in the cumulative totals of cases reported. The cumulative total number of cVDPV cases globally is listed as 25 this week, the same number of cumulative cases listed last week, yet new cases were identified and confirmed during this week. Clarification of these figures would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP

[2] Brazil (SP), catchup house-to-house vaccination - media
Date: 24 Aug 2018
Source: Folha de S. Paolo [edited]
https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/scienceandhealth/2018/08/1979835-sp-government-will-knock-door-to-door-to-find-unvaccinated-children.shtml


Health workers will search house by house for children yet to be vaccinated against measles and polio in the state's capital, São Paulo, in a government effort to reach the vaccination goals set for this year. They will knock door to door to explain to residents the importance of vaccines and give guidance on the topic.

This campaign is part of a pack of measures planned by the city administration, which also include vaccination in city schools, a pop-up vaccination booth in Avenida Paulista and an Action Day next Saturday [25 Aug 2018], when all city health clinics will be open for people who want to vaccinate their children.

The measures' targets are children between one and 5 years of age, who are the focus of the ongoing national vaccination campaign against both diseases. The campaign ends on 31 Aug 2018.

The campaign goal is to vaccinate 95% of children in that age-group, but so far, only 59% of them received vaccines in the state's capital, São Paulo. "If we continue like this, we won't reach our goal," said Maria Lígia Nerge, São Paulo's vaccination program's coordinator.

Another attempt was mandating that city schools ask for students' immunization records earlier this month. Beginning next week, students with incomplete records and proper parent or guardian authorizations will be able to be vaccinated by healthcare works who will go from school to school to administer vaccines.

[I have included this media report from Sao Paolo to highlight the problems identified in major areas where local poliovirus transmission has long been interrupted -- declining vaccination coverages leaving large pockets of susceptible persons should the virus be introduced.  It is comforting to see the identification of this problem and the control measures implemented in Sao Paolo to rectify this situation. The estimated population of Sao Paolo in 2017 was 12.1 million, a sizable population. - Mod.MPP
