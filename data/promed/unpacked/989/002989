Ongoing Measles Outbreak in Orthodox Jewish Community, London (By Vanessa Baugh et al., Public Health England, London, UK, and (V. Baugh, et al., at Homerton University Hospital Foundation Trust, London)

Measles outbreaks have been reported in Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities across Europe and Israel (1-5). We describe an ongoing outbreak within the largest European Orthodox Jewish community (including a Charedi population of 17 587), based in London, focused in Hackne. Vaccination coverage within this community is lower than in the general population of London, causing low herd immunity and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination coverage data within the communities cannot be extrapolated, because membership is not classified as an ethnicity and not collected within health electronic recording systems. However, general practice surgeries in Hackney known to have high proportions of Orthodox Jewish patients have considerably lower vaccination coverage (55 percent-75 percent of patients 24 months of age had received measles, mumps, rubella [MMR] vaccine in the 3rd quarter of 2012) compared with the London average (87.3 percent). Health beliefs, family size (the average Charedi household size is 6.3 persons), and underutilization of immunization services contribute to low coverage.

The outbreak clinical case definition was taken from Public Health England's guidance. It also included membership in the Orthodox Jewish community; residency in the London borough of Barnet, Hackney, or Haringey; and notification during 20 Dec 2012-19 Mar 2013. After serologic confirmation of measles in the index case-patient, an unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish 4-year-old from Hackney, the case was reported to the Health Protection Team (HPT) on 20 Dec 2012. The family could not recall having contact with someone with measles. The child attended nursery while infectious; subsequently, cases in 3 secondary patients in the nursery were reported to the HPT. Transmission was observed within households, extended family groups, nurseries, schools, and a camp for Orthodox Jewish teenagers attended by 80 girls (mainly from Hackney) with staff from Italy. Five secondary cases from this camp were reported (in 3 residents of London, one resident of Sheffield, and one resident of Hertfordshire).

During 20 Dec 2012-19 Mar 2013, a total of 62 notifications of measles cases meeting the case definition were received in residents of Barnet (8 cases), Hackney (47), and Haringey (7). Patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 27 years (median 7 years). 34 (55 percent) were female. 54 (87 percent) had never received an MMR vaccine, and 8 (13 percent) had received only one. Three were admitted to hospital, and 5 were clinically assessed in accident and emergency departments (patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 4 years).

All case-patients were assessed for risk by the local HPT for vulnerable contacts and source of infection. The HPT provided infection control guidance and an oral fluid testing kit. 16 (26 percent) case-patients could not recall any contact with a person with measles; the remainder stated various epidemiologic links to a case-patient.

42 cases have been confirmed (measles IgM detected) by serologic testing (4 cases) or oral fluid. One notified case-patient did not have measles IgM on oral fluid testing but had an epidemiologic link to a case-patient and clinical symptoms. They are included in this analysis. 17 IgM-positive oral fluid samples were genotyped, and all were D8, currently the most common genotype in the United Kingdom.

In response to the outbreak, active case finding and awareness-raising have been undertaken by the HPT, National Health Service (NHS) public health departments, and community NHS services focused on health and education services and Orthodox Jewish communities. Information letters were sent to the 38 Orthodox Jewish schools and nurseries in Hackney and to attendees of the youth camp. Community NHS vaccination clinics have been maintained to complement standard immunization services offered in general practice surgeries. This includes a Sunday vaccination clinic. Furthermore, community NHS staff provided a vaccination clinic in a secondary school that had an attack rate of 7 percent (9 cases), at which 9 pupils received one MMR vaccine after parental consent. This was the only on-site school vaccination clinic offered; thus, no comparative uptake data are available to supplement our evaluation of the intervention.

Information relating to the outbreak was placed in 2 Orthodox Jewish newspapers and targeted information for families (in English, Yiddish, and Hebrew) has been disseminated. Finally, all 25 HPTs were alerted to this outbreak, and the national Public Health England database (HPZone) has been enhanced to capture notifications from Orthodox Jewish communities.

This ongoing outbreak highlights continued health risks in communities with low vaccination coverage. The outbreak has been largely contained within London's Orthodox Jewish communities, with limited spread outside of the city and to just one local non-Orthodox Jewish child. Given the mobility of members, the risk for transmission outside of London is relatively high. The outbreak underscores the need for ongoing evidence-based and culturally appropriate health interventions that seek to improve vaccination coverage.

Kano State government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dangote and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations for the revitalisation of routine immunisation and other primary healthcare services, an official said.

The executive secretary, Kano State Primary Health Care Management Board, Dr Shehu Abdullahi, made the plan known in Kano yesterday [23 Sep 2013] at the inauguration of the Kano State Implementation Training for 2013 Integrated Measles Campaign. The secretary said that the state had recorded 200 deaths from 8000 cases of measles since 2012.

He said that 80 per cent of those affected, aged between 0 to 59 months, were not immunised against the disease. He said it was unfortunate that parents and caregivers of the affected children did not make them available for immunisation and as such exposed them to the disease.

He said that the training for Local Immunisation Officers, State Technical Facilitators, and Local Government Facilitators were aimed at addressing the challenges.

Turkey has witnessed a 20-fold increase in measles cases this year [2013], particularly in its southern provinces, which have seen the arrival of a substantial number of Syrian migrants. According to the latest data announced by the Turkish Medical Association (TTB) Central Council, the number of recorded measles patients in Turkey, which was 349 in 2012, approached 6000 in the 1st 6 months of the year [2013].

Turkish Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu attributed the cause of the remarkable jump in measles cases to "the mass movement of people that Turkey is exposed to given its location," answering a petition filed by the independent Istanbul deputy Levent Tuzel on 23 Sep 2013. The minister said Turkey's location and recent rise in migration had raised the risks of exposure to contagion. The surge in population in the southeastern and Mediterranean provinces, where most Syrians have fled to since the outbreak of civil war, provoked particularly high exposure rates, Muezzinoglu also noted.

However, Turkey's Public Health Institution contradicted claims that the source of the measles outbreak was Syria. "The source of the viruses is not Syria, it's Europe, as Europe is currently experiencing a large-scale measles epidemic. This has been proved by way of laboratory findings," the institution's Deputy Chairman Mehmet Ali Torunoglu told Anadolu Agency yesterday [24 Sep 2013]. He said they vaccinated the children of Syrian immigrants regularly, keeping to a timetable. "We vaccinate children younger than 5 against measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and diphtheria at camps, and family doctors control those outside of camps," he said.

Torunoglu, however, claimed the surging flow of Syrian refugees into Turkish provinces caused a slight increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis (or "Aleppo boil") cases. [Leishmaniasis is caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus _Leishmania_]. Humans are infected via the bite of phlebotomine sandflies. "There are 50 000 Aleppo boil cases in Syria according to official data, but 200 000 according to non-official figures. Therefore, there has been a slight increase in Aleppo boil cases originating from Syria [in Turkey], but there is nothing to worry about," he said. Torunoglu said both measles and Aleppo boil cases were under control, with the intention to alleviate the public's concerns. The Turkish Health Ministry has been taking all necessary measures and has been successful in curbing the rapid rise [of cases of measles], he added.

UNICEF had issued a warning to Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey against measles outbreaks, calling on pertinent institutions to gear up their pre-emptive efforts in a report it released in April 2013. "With considerable amounts of migration as well as the breakdown of regular health services in Syria, additional precautions are required to ensure that children are protected against deadly diseases such as measles no matter where they may be," Mahendra Sheth, UNICEF Regional Health Advisor, had said. Since the crisis' onset more than 2 years ago, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled into neighboring countries including Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt, with an average, at present, of up to 8000 Syrians fleeing the country daily, the UNICEF statement read.

Michigan is among 16 [states] that have reported increased cases of measles in 2013 through mid-August [2013]. This data is confirmed by a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The once common disease is now a rarity in United States, but that progress may be threatened by the high incidence of measles elsewhere in the world and insufficient levels of immunizations in some communities.

"Measles is highly contagious and is by no means a trivial disease. It can result in hospitalization, pneumonia, encephalitis, and death," said Dr. Matthew Davis, Chief Medical Executive with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH). "We need to achieve and sustain high levels of vaccination in Michigan and across the United States. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles outbreaks from occurring and to prevent this disease from spreading widely in our communities."

According to the CDC, there were 159 cases reported nationally as of 24 Aug 2013. From 2001-2012, the average number of measles cases reported nationally per year was 60. Michigan reported 2 of the cases this year [2013] and is currently investigating another. Of the 2 Michigan cases, both involved infants who were exposed to the disease when they traveled out of the country. They have since recovered. Both of Michigan's cases involved infants younger than 12 months of age.

The 1st of 2 routine childhood measles vaccine doses is given at 12 months of age, but current recommendations call for infants as young as 6 months who will be traveling outside of the U.S. to be vaccinated against measles. This recommendation means that parents can begin protecting their children as early as 6 months of age if they have plans to travel internationally.

Nearly all of the 159 cases nationally were "import-associated," meaning that they were directly or indirectly linked to a case or an exposure in another country. The majority of cases, 82 percent, occurred among persons who were not vaccinated, with another 8 percent in persons with an unknown vaccination status. Measles vaccine has been routinely in use and recommended for children in the U.S. since the 1960s. The CDC report also identified 8 outbreaks among the 159 cases, including one involving 58 cases, the largest outbreak nationally since 1996.

New South Wales Health has issued a warning for measles after 3 young men were diagnosed with the highly contagious virus in Sydney last week. The 3 men, aged in their 20s and 30s, recently spent time around Earlwood, Hurlstone Park, Alexandria and Waterloo in the city's inner west.

They visited medical centres in Rozelle, Croydon, and the Royal Prince Alfred emergency department while they were infectious. The health department says symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear and is warning unvaccinated people to be on the lookout for signs of the disease. Director of Communicable diseases Doctor Vicky Sheppeard says there is a real risk others have been infected.

"The symptoms that arise with measles are fever, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes, and they start around 10-14 days after you're exposed," she said. "Then 3 to 4 days later, a red, blotchy rash arises and starts on the face and then spreads to the trunk and then to the limbs."
