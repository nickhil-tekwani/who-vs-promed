Two deer harvested on 15 Oct 2010 in deer hunt areas 47 and 51 in the
Bighorn Basin have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD),
a brain disease known to affect some deer, elk and moose. One deer, a
mule deer buck, was harvested in area 47 in the Durphy Gulch area.
The other CWD positive, a white-tailed doe, was harvested in area 51
near the Horse Creek/Shell Valley Road.

Personnel at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department(WGFD) Laboratory
analyzed samples taken as part of the department's annual CWD survey
and discovered positive results for the 2 deer.

WGFD wildlife disease specialist Hank Edwards said the discovery of
CWD in those areas was not unexpected since there have been positive
tests in animals in surrounding areas 122, 125, 41, 46, 27 and 23.

After a review of available scientific data, the World Health
Organization in December 1999 stated: "There is currently no evidence
that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is transmitted to humans." In
2004, Dr. Ermias Belay of the Center for Disease Control said: "The
lack of evidence of a link between CWD transmission and unusual cases
of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human prion disease) despite
several epidemiological investigations suggests that the risk, if
any, of transmission of CWD to humans is low." Nonetheless, to avoid
risk, both organizations say parts or products from any animal that
looks sick and/or tests positive for CWD should not be eaten.

[It is the fall season when hunting of cervids occurs. As hunter
surveillance programs are underway and tests are being conducted, it
is likely that there will be many more such reports from various
places across North America coming out soon.

Wyoming is a state known to have CWD, so this occurrence does not
seem surprising, nor does it seem to have moved into zones in the
state where it has not previously been detected. - Mod.TG]
