Cyclospora illnesses have spiked to 384 sick in 22 states and 30 hospitalized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is an increase of 323 cases since the last update was issued on 30 Jun 2022. Cases are still being reported. Ill persons live in 22 states and New York City. The median illness onset date is 30 Jun 2022, and the illness onset range is from 3 May 2022 to 18 Jul 2022. No deaths have been reported.

A specific case count by state has not been issued by the CDC. But according to the case count map, ill persons live in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and New York.

There has been a cyclospora outbreak, in fact, usually several cyclospora outbreaks, in the United States during the spring and summer months every year since 2013. Last year [2021], two unexplained cyclospora outbreaks sickened at least 153 people. In 2020, a cyclospora outbreak linked to Fresh Express bagged salads sickened at least 701 people in 14 states and hospitalized 38.

Cases usually peak in June and July, although activity can last through September. The number of clusters varies from season to season. In the past, these outbreaks have been linked to products such as fresh basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberrie , vegetable trays, and snow peas.

Unfortunately, many of these cases cannot be linked to a specific outbreak, in part because there isn't a validated laboratory fingerprinting method for this pathogen. Instead, officials use questionnaires and interview patients to find out [what] they ate before they got sick. A common food can sometimes be linked to illnesses through traceback and epidemiology.

Cyclospora is a single-celled organism that invades the wall of the small intestine, which causes the classic symptom of diarrhea. People eat the sporulated oocyst after it is deposited on plants, which then excyst in the body. The sporozoites mature into oocysts which are excreted in stools. The oocysts must mature outside the body, so this pathogen is not spread person to person.

It's difficult to protect yourself against this pathogen, as the oocysts are sticky and usually can't be rinsed off produce, especially leaves of lettuce and fresh herbs, but rinsing does help. Cooking will kill the parasite, but it will survive freezing temperatures.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis include explosive and profuse diarrhea, abdominal cramps, gas, bloating, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, body aches, and fever. These symptoms can least for months if not treated.

[For the original CDC report and map of the affected states, see https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/outbreaks/2022/seasonal/index.html. Following accidental ingestion, cyclospora oocysts primarily infect the jejunum, and the clinical presentation of cyclosporiasis thus encompasses, in addition to diarrhea, symptoms of small intestinal infection and malabsorption such as gas, bloating, and weight loss, as opposed to those of colitis, as seen in bacillary dysentery.

It is not surprising that reported cases are up sharply compared with the prior CDC update through 28 Jun 2022, since cyclospora cases in the United States tend to peak between June and July. The geographic distribution of cases, however, is unusually concentrated in the eastern and southern states, with no cases reported from states west of the Colorado River, which tend to be more arid. The temporal and geographic distribution of cases in the United States raises the possibility of waterborne infection, as water-based activities like swimming are much more common in the summer months, and both sporadic and endemic cases of cyclosporiasis have been traced to contaminated water. Cyclosporiasis can easily elude diagnosis if this entity is not considered by clinicians, so it could be illuminating to survey potential and suspected water sources for cyclospora by PCR.
