Fever Kills 200 in Saudi Arabia and Yemen
--------------------------------------------------
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates: The death toll from Rift Valley Fever has
climbed to about 200 in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, medical sources and
newspapers said on Sat 23 Sep 2000. Authorities in Saudi Arabia said fresh
rainfall was making it difficult for emergency teams to fight the disease,
which is transmitted from livestock to humans by mosquitoes or through
contact with infected animals. Saudi sources told Reuters that "up to 100
people" had died in the kingdom from the viral disease which broke out
nearly 2 weeks ago. In neighboring Yemen, the death toll from the disease
had risen to around 100, a local newspaper said. Government figures released
in both countries are considerably lower. The Saudi health ministry has
reported 17 deaths and said that around 50 people were being treated in
hospitals. Yemen's health ministry has said that 17 people died in the
country.
Saudi Arabia shut down schools in Jizan province and banned the import of
sheep, goats and camels from Yemen and several African countries. The Saudi
sources, who declined to be named, said that the disease may have already
spread to areas outside Jizan, on the border with Yemen. They said that some
infected livestock may have found its way outside the province before health
measures were taken. Saudi Arabia has taken other precautions, including
requiring people traveling from Jizan to undergo medical tests, Saudi media
reported. The 2 neighbors have been cooperating in spraying
mosquito-infested areas along their common border with pesticides to control
the disease. Yemen had also called for international help to combat the
disease, which officials say had wiped out nearly half of the livestock in
the area of Wadi Moor in Hudeidah province.
Neighboring Gulf Arab states, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, have said
they had not been affected by the disease but were taking preventive
measures, including a ban on import of livestock from several
countries.(Report updated to 23 Sep 2000, 8:11 AM ET)

Rift Valley fever death toll now 24 in Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry has said that 113 cases of Rift
Valley fever, 24 of them fatal, had been reported so far in the country,
since the disease first struck there on 11 Sep 2000. The Ministry in a
statement relayed by the official Saudi news agency, SPA, on Sat 23 Sep 2000
said that of the total infected, 96 were male.
The largest number of people infected, 98, live in the Jizan region, and all
the other cases were reported in areas on the border with Yemen. Ninety-two
people have died in Yemen of the disease, an agriculture ministry official
in Sana'a said on Fri 22 Sep 2000, but the Yemeni health minister Abdullah
Abdelwali said only 17 have died from the disease.
The Saudi authorities have stepped up the state of alert in the Kingdom to
stop the spread of the disease. It is the first time that the disease, which
affects domestic animals and can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes,has
been known to strike outside Africa. The symptoms include haemorrhagic
fever, encephalitis and eye problems, although human deaths from the disease
are rare, according to experts.
The Saudi Agriculture Ministry announced on 18 Sep 2000 that it had
suspended livestock imports from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan
and Yemen, all of which are on the Red Sea. Yemen has also decided to ban
imports of livestock from Africa, the official Yemeni news agency Saba said
on Sat 23 Sep 2000.

Two Rift Valley fever cases detected in Riyadh
-----------------------------------------------
RIYADH: King Fahd, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, has ordered the
destruction of all livestock carrying or suspected of carrying the deadly
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus with immediate effect as the number of fatal
cases rose to 27 yesterday, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. He
also ordered quick payment of compensation to the livestock's owners.
In a press statement yesterday, the Health Ministry said 3 more people died,
2 of them in Jizan, during the past 24 hours bringing the total to 27. The
ministry also confirmed 14 new RVF cases including 2 in Riyadh, one each in
Jeddah and Najran, 3 in Asir and 7 in Jizan, bringing the total number of
people infected by the disease to = 129. The viral disease was first
reported on 11 Sep 2000 in the southern border city of Jizan.
The Governor of Jeddah, Prince Mishaal ibn Majed, confirmed that there was a
suspected RVF case in the city. He said the Governorate had taken
precautionary steps to prevent the spread of the disease. The Health
Ministry said 3 patients had recovered from the disease and had left the
Jizan hospital. It refuted press reports concerning 2 RVF cases admitted to
the King Fahd National Guard Hospital in Riyadh and the King Abdul Aziz
Hospital in Jeddah, saying that the patients were suffering from malaria and
liver-related illness respectively. The ministry said all RVF cases were
generally linked with Jizan and neighboring areas.
King Fahd's order to destroy infected livestock comes because the
potentially fatal virus is transmitted to humans through animals. According
to he Agriculture and Water Minister, Abdullah Muammar, RVF virus has killed
10 768 sheep, cows and camels in Jizan. As many as 16 212 sheep have aborted
and 153 000 animals have been treated against the disease. Speaking to
reporters after inspecting the areas worst hit by RVF in Jizan, Muammar said
the situation in Aridha, Uhd Al-Mesaraha and Wadi Jazan had returned to
normal after the government had taken measures to contain the disease.
Twenty-one additional special planes have been sent to Jizan to spray
insecticides on all affected areas in the region. He downplayed the panic
created by the spread of RVF in Jizan and other parts of the country and
said the disease had been found only in limited areas, making the efforts to
contain the killer virus easy.
The Health Minister, Dr. Osama Shubokshi, told a press conference in Jizan
on Sat 23 Sep 2000 that most of the patients affected by RVF were over 55.
and they had contracted the disease because of their inability to resist the
virus. He admitted, however, that it was not possible to say that the
disease was under total control. "The government is trying to control it by
all means. Our efforts in this respect will become fruitful within the next
few days," the minister told the conference. Shubokshi commended Saudi
doctors for their detection [confirmation of the disease 24 hours before
the results of tests had come back from the United States.

Sheep smuggled from Yemen responsible for Jizan outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
JIZAN/JEDDAH : Saudi authorities yesterday allayed fears about the spread of
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) by announcing the various measures taken by the
government to contain the disease which has killed 24 people and affected
113 others in Jizan. Potential cases of RVF have also been reported in
Jeddah. Two possible cases were admitted to the = emergency room of the
Al-Thaghr General Hospital last evening.
Agriculture and Water Minister, Dr. Abdullah Muammar, told a press
conference in Jizan yesterday that sheep smuggled from Yemen were
responsible for the spread [introduction of the virus into Jizan where
10 768 sheep, cows and camels have died over the past weeks. As many as
16 212 sheep have aborted and 153 000 animals were treated against RVF
infection he said. The press conference presided over by the Jizan Governor,
Prince Mishaal Al-Sudairy, was also addressed by the Minister of Health, Dr.
Osama Shubokshi, and the Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs, Dr.
Muhammed Al-Jarallah. Senior government officials from the 3 ministries
were also present. They disclosed that no infection had been detected among
the sheep imported from African countries. However, the import ban on that
region would remain in place as a precautionary measure.
Earlier, Shubokshi and Jarallah, along with the accompanying delegation
visited the King Fahd Hospital in the city to inquire about the condition of
patients. Journalists from Riyadh were taken aboard a chartered Saudia
flight to Jizan for a briefing on the latest situation in the coastal city,
southwest of Riyadh, and government measures to combat the disease
transmitted to humans through infected sheep and camels. Providing an update
on the situation, Shobokshi said that RVF, first identified in Kenya's Rift
Valley in 1930, is also indigenous to southern and eastern Africa. "The
infected animals abort their fetus, and farmers who try to help them may
also fall victim to the virus." He said mosquitoes also acted as vectors of
the disease,which could thrive in the hot and humid climate of Jizan. The
situation was worsened by the recent rains which provided breeding grounds
for the mosquitoes. The minister, himself a medical doctor, said the
infection could be cured in 99 percent of cases, adding that complications
such as renal failure and hepatitis were reported in one percent of cases.
He disclosed that during the last 24 hours 10 additional RVF cases had been
reported. Several patients, discharged from various hospitals, were being
constantly monitored, even though they were in good health. To allay
concerns among the population, he pointed out that fears such as eating out
in restaurants were misplaced. Meat was safe so long as it had been prepared
hygienically.
Referring to the measures taken by the Agriculture Ministry. Muammar said
that the entry of all imported sheep through Jizan and other ports in the
Kingdom had been banned. The ban also applies to the local movement of these
animals in and out of this city as well as the rest of the country. The
Kingdom imports 1.5 million sheep annually. In this context. Muammar
confirmed that his ministry had received a letter from Saudi pharmacist
Ahmad Ali Hikami alerting them to the smuggling of infected sheep into the
Kingdom. However. the minister said no cases of viral infection were found
among the sheep imported from African countries. This had been proved later
as all the affected animals were brought in illegally from Yemen at cheap
rates.
Among the other measures outlined by the agriculture minister were the
aerial spraying of insecticides, for which 26 planes had been put into
service. This was in addition to 200-250 groups that had been mobilized for
mechanical spraying of insecticides. They were also touring villages and
farms to eradicate dead bodies of animals. "Experts from FAO and southern
Africa are coming here and they will be touring all the affected areas with
me tomorrow. Other measures will be announced on the completion of their
report," Muammar said.
Dr. Abdul Raheem Aqeel. director of health in Jizan, told Arab News that
they had launched a large-scale health awareness campaign through schools,
mosques and other community centers. Meanwhile schools reopened in Jizan
yesterday but attendance was thin. At King Khaled International Airport in
Riyadh passengers coming from Jizan must now have a blood test before
leaving the airport. Ghazi Mir. from the duty manager's office at Jeddah's
King Abdul Aziz Airport, said there were as yet no regulations or procedures
for people flying in from Jizan. "We are different from Riyadh as we still
don't have the disease," claimed Mir.
Six more possible RVF cases were also admitted to Qunfuda General Hospital,
near Jizan, yesterday. All 6 were Yemenis.
