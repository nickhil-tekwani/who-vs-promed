Nationwide outbreak of conjunctivitis
----------------------------------------------
The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus slammed the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) yesterday, accusing the organization of failing
to react sooner to a nationwide outbreak of conjunctivitis. At a
press conference in the legislature, KMT Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang
said the Department of Health (DOH) and the CDC failed to keep the
outbreak under control when a large number of conjunctivitis cases
were 1st reported earlier this month [October 2007].

"At the very beginning of the outbreak, the DOH and the CDC regarded
the cases as regular [sporadic] conjunctivitis. Therefore, they did
not take the outbreak seriously," Hsieh said. Hsieh said the outbreak
first hit Keelung and Yunlin on 4 Oct 2007, but the CDC did not
collect samples from patients to determine the cause of the condition
until 8 Oct 2007 although several thousand pinkeye cases had been
reported.

The CDC confirmed on Thursday [11 Oct 2007] that Coxackievirus type
24 [classified as Human coxsackievirus A24 in the ICTV nomenclature],
an enterovirus, was responsible. "A CDC official told me in private
that Coxackievirus type 24 once infected 40 percent of the residents
of a town abroad. That is to say, the virus has the ability to infect
up to 40 percent [of a population]," Hsieh said, asking if a similar
situation could occur in Taiwan. "[The DOH and CDC] completely
ignored the possible serious consequences of such an acute disease,"
Hsieh said, adding that the conjunctivitis outbreak has spread to
Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Steve Kuo the director of the CDC, said they had done their best to
keep people informed. Kuo said that Coxackievirus type 24 contributed
to a similar outbreak in Central and South America between August and
October 2003, during which time hundreds of thousands of people were
infected, although the infection rarely caused serious health
problems.

Kuo said 10 510 students nationwide had been infected with the
disease as of Friday [12 Oct 2007] with cases concentrated in
Keelung, Yunlin, Taipei, Kaohsiung and Chiayi. "What is alarming is
that the outbreak implies that people in the country still have poor
health habits," Kuo said.

Starting yesterday for 3 weeks, Taipei City schools must report cases
of pinkeye to help track the outbreak, a city government education
official said yesterday [15 Oct 2007]. Department of Education
Director Wu Ching-chi recommended those affected stay at home until
they fully recover.

[Outbreaks of conjunctivitis are frequent in some Asian countries at
this time of year. Currently extensive outbreaks have been reported
from India, Taiwan and the Northern Mariana Islands. The etiology of
viral conjunctivitis has been discussed in previous posts. Epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis and the epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are
self-limiting conditions that can be caused by several different
enteric viruses including enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24, and
human adenovirus types 8, 11, 19, and 37. Acute hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis has been associated particularly with adenovirus 11.

The significance of the above report is that it identifies
coxsackievirus A24 as the cause of the outbreak of conjunctivitis in
Taiwan. In an earlier report from Taiwan it was inferred that
enterovirus 70 infection might be the cause of the outbreak. There is
no protective vaccine or specific treatment. - Mod.CP]
