Direction generale de l'alimentation, Bureau de Sante Animale has issued on
the French Ministry of Agriculture's website dated 28 Aug 2008 the
following information:

The confirmation of new cases of bluetongue BTV-1 in Aude, Gers, and
Lot-et-Garonne has caused a modification in the zonage of the perimeters.
This zonage was instituted by decree on 27 Aug 2008 and defined the
regulated zones relative to bluetongue. The text is to be published and
will come into force on 28 Aug 2008.

The actual list of regulated communes will only show the communes which
appear in the regulated zone.

8167 cases of bluetongue serotype BTV-8 in the year 2008 came from viral
circulation in 2008. 178 new cases of bluetongue serotype BTV-1 came from
viral circulation in 2008.

15 569 cases of bluetongue were declared in 2007 (3 cases of BTV-1).

6020 cases of bluetongue BTV-8 declared in the 1st 6 months of 2008 came
from viral circulation in 2007 (6 cases of bluetongue serotype BTV-1).

[Even though the presentation of figures is a bit difficult to follow,
there are definite increases in the reported cases, most probably due to a
failure of vaccination. In most situations in Europe, vaccination will be
the best protection for dairy, beef, and small ruminants. - Mod.PC]

[2] United Kingdom, DEFRA, restriction zones expanded

DEFRA has confirmed that bluetongue has been detected in Devon and that an
extension of the Protection Zone into Northumberland and Cumbria will be
made to allow vaccination in all of England.

DEFRA today [29 Aug 2008] announced the detection of bluetongue (BTV8) in 8
imported cattle on premises near Tiverton, Devon. The animals originated
from the same consignment imported from within the BTV8 Restricted Zone in
Germany.

On 20 Aug 2008, DEFRA announced that Northumberland and Cumbria would both
enter the Protection Zone at the same time but not before 1 Sep 2008. This
has given livestock keepers and sales organizers a degree of certainty to
help them plan movement of their animals to slaughter or to sales in
England and Scotland to mitigate the impact on trade. DEFRA can now confirm
that the Protection Zone will be extended on Mon 1 Sep 2008 into
Northumberland and Cumbria. This will complete the roll-out of the
vaccination program by bringing the whole of England into the Protection
Zone, enabling farmers to protect their animals from the threat of bluetongue.

The cases in Devon were detected as a result of post-import testing carried
out by DEFRA on all bluetongue susceptible animals arriving from
continental Europe in addition to checks at the country of origin.

These cases emphasize the need for farmers to be aware of the risks of
importing animals from within Restricted Zones and to consider very
carefully the potential consequences for their existing livestock and the
livestock of their neighbors. This also highlights the importance of
vaccination. It is the only effective tool to protect susceptible animals
from bluetongue. Farmers throughout the Protection Zone should vaccinate as
soon as vaccine is available to them.

A mass vaccination campaign against bluetongue began in late April this
year [2008], and approximately 21.5 million doses have so far been made
available to farmers as far north as Durham and Lancashire to protect their
stock.

Protection Zones for BTV8 across the EU are regarded as being "confluent."
This means that it is legally possible to move susceptible animals from the
BTV8 Protection Zone in Germany to the Protection Zone in England and Wales
and vice versa. It is, therefore, not unexpected to find infected animals
in the Protection Zone.

There is no evidence to suggest that virus is circulating between local
midge and animal populations in the local areas. Full epidemiological
investigations are underway. In respect of the decision to extend the
Protection Zone on 1 Sep 2008 into Northumberland and Cumbria, livestock
keepers in the areas coming into the Protection Zone will be able to obtain
the vaccine from the time they become part of the Zone; however, they are
encouraged to order vaccine in advance through their vet. The vaccine will
be available in 20 ml, 50 ml and 100 ml bottles, although some bottle sizes
may be more readily available than others as supply proportions vary over time.

Protection Zone restrictions will apply to those keepers coming into the
extended zone. Animals can only be moved out of the Protection Zone if they
are vaccinated, naturally immune or moving for slaughter, subject to
meeting certain conditions. Please refer to the Defra website for further
guidance.

All livestock farmers are strongly encouraged to be vigilant and to
vaccinate at the earliest possible opportunity.

Please refer to the Welsh Assembly website for the latest information on
the roll-out of vaccination in Wales.

Notes to editors:
The Protection Zone will be expanded at 00:01 on Mon 1 Sep 2008.
The vaccination roll-out plan is available on the DEFRA website at

[3] United Kingdom, Devon, imported

Farming ministry DEFRA last night [29 Aug 2008] urged farmers to think
about where they are sourcing animals, after it confirmed 8 cattle imported
from Germany to a farm in Devon were infected with the deadly bluetongue
virus. It is the 3rd time this week that the disease has been found in
animals brought in from the continent. On Wed 27 Aug 2008, Defra said
bluetongue was discovered in rams imported from a disease zone in France to
Lewes in East Sussex and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire.

DEFRA said the latest case involved a batch of 20 bulling heifers imported
from a disease zone in Germany more than a week ago to Tiverton. In all
cases, the virus was picked up through post-import testing. DEFRA said
there was still no evidence the disease, which is spread between animals by
midges, was circulating in the midge population in the areas in England
where it had been found.

But the National Beef Association feared bluetongue could be lurking
undiscovered in England and urged farmers to vaccinate their stock.
Vice-chairman Frank Momber said: "These animals (imported to Devon) were
sourced from an area in Germany which has still to report circulating BTV8
(the strain of bluetongue) virus in 2008."

Scientists in the UK are increasingly certain that bluetongue is already
moving inside Britain too. "If importers must bring in stock, they should
not accept word-of-mouth affirmation from suppliers that the animals carry
no bluetongue risk and protect their reputations and their own cattle by
insisting on a vaccination certificate that has been signed by a vet."

Mr Momber said that, with bluetongue having been confirmed in Britain last
September 2007, there was no room for complacency. He urged farmers in the
English Protection to redouble vaccination efforts to prevent the virus
from spreading.

The ministry also last night [29 Aug 2008] confirmed the extension of the
bluetongue protection zone into Cumbria and Northumberland from 12.01 AM on
Monday [1 Sep 2008]. The decision essentially closes the border to all
sheep, goat and cattle movements from England into Scotland, except for
animals that are vaccinated and which have gained immunity. These animals
also have be accompanied by veterinary certification that the vaccine was
administered by a vet. Movements of animals from the disease free zone in
Scotland into England are not affected.
