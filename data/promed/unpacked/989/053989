FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN ARGENTINA
--------------------------------------------
Diagnostic findings (serology)
(Date of last reported outbreak: April 1994)
Emergency report: Translation of an e-mail received on 10 Aug 2000 from Dr
Oscar Alejandro Bruni, President of the National Service of Agrifood Health
and Quality (SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and
Food, Buenos Aires:
This report covers the period from 22 Jul to 8 Aug 2000 and refers to
diagnostic findings of serological tests carried out by the SENASA Central
Laboratory with respect to foot and mouth disease (FMD). Location of the
farms involved:
- district of Clorinda, province of Formosa
- department of Mercedes, province of Corrientes
- department of Concepcion del Uruguay, province of Entre Rios
Initially, the geographical area involved only one of the many
establishments covered by epidemiological surveillance and monitoring
carried out by SENASA field services on a regular and continuous basis,
namely an establishment in the Province of Formosa. The general
epidemiological situation up to 2 Aug 2000 had been perfectly normal. All
the blood samples from 5 872 cattle, 124 pigs and 58 goats, tested using
the VIAA(1) and EITB(2) tests, had given negative results. These routine
serological tests are carried out on a day-to-day basis in the border zones
and in other establishments that are considered to present a sanitary risk.
On 2 Aug 2000, in the context of the epidemiological surveillance
activities and procedures carried out in the border zones, 10 bovines
illegally imported from a neighbouring country were discovered in a
jointly-owned establishment located in a border transit zone in the
district of Clorinda, province of Formosa. In view of this fact, since the
relevant health documentation was missing, it was decided to take the
maximum preventive measure in compliance with current legislation, namely
the preventive slaughter and destruction of the 10 bovines, after taking
blood samples for serological screening for FMD. The laboratory diagnosis
proved positive in 4 of the 10 bovines sampled prior to slaughter, none of
which had presented specific clinical signs of vesicular disease on any of
the previous visits or inspections. After the investigations confirmed that
the herd in question had entered on 22 Jul 2000, stamping-out measures were
applied to all of the animals that had been housed in the aforesaid
establishment: 1 300 bovines were considered to have come into contact with
the illegally introduced bovines and blood samples were taken from 82
animals, 8 of which tested positive to the laboratory tests conducted.
Consequently, measures were adopted to mitigate the risk during the entire
period covered by this report. In addition, the relevant tracing and
monitoring measures were applied to all of the 13 consignments of animals
sent from the above-mentioned zone in the province of Formosa to the rest
of the country. Measures included blood sampling for serological testing of
all the animals dispatched, with the herds being kept under strict
surveillance and quarantine control. As a result of these investigations in
the 13 consignments, further positive serology results were obtained in 2
animals from a consignment of 4 bovines, in a farm situated in the
administrative department of Mercedes, in the province of Corrientes. It
was therefore decided to apply stamping-out measures to all of the bovines
that were housed with these animals. At the time of stamping out, none of
the 1 608 bovines involved presented any clinical signs of foot and mouth
disease.
Further epidemiological investigations detected a positive reactor in a
newly formed herd of 62 bovines, comprising 2 bovines from the previously
mentioned consignment and 60 native bovines transferred from the Mercedes
establishment, where they were born, to another establishment belonging to
the same owners located in the administrative department of Concepción del
Uruguay, in the province of Entre Ríos. Stamping-out measures were applied
to the positive bovine and its 700 contacts. Sera from all of the aforesaid
bovines were processed at the SENASA Central Laboratory in the district of
Martínez, in the province of Buenos Aires. Measures adopted:
In accordance with Article 1.4.4.4. of the OIE International Animal Health
Code, it was decided to implement a "surveillance zone" in the province of
Formosa and the areas considered to be at risk in the provinces of
Corrientes and Entre Ríos, in accordance with the previously mentioned
epidemiological situation. All of the livestock-producing establishments in
the area are currently subject to intensive surveillance, including
serological testing, as well as all establishments which, due to their
presumed epidemiological links, pose a possible risk.
The criteria established and the measures adopted must take into account
the official FMD status of Argentina and follow the procedures established
under SENASA Resolution No. 779/99 regarding the National Health Emergency
System, which fall within the guidelines established and recommended by the
OIE for such circumstances, as well as for continuous epidemiological
surveillance and monitoring in accordance with Chapter 1.4.5. of the
International Animal Health Code.
These measures include the following:
- inspection and strict border controls for all products (it should be
noted that the entry of susceptible animals from Brazil and Paraguay is
prohibited);
- incentive schemes to encourage the immediate and compulsory reporting of
suspected vesicular disease;
- tracing;
- restriction on movements;
- stamping-out measures;
- epidemiological monitoring;
- epidemiological surveillance;
- zoning.
It should be noted that, in the province of Formosa, there are no abattoirs
approved for the domestic market or for export purposes, neither do any
exist within the established surveillance zones.
(1) VIAA: virus infection associated antigen.
(2) EITB: electroimmunotransfer blot.
Note by the OIE Central Bureau: the above report states that FMD virus
antibodies have been detected. The report does not state whether this is
considered to be confirmation of infection. The OIE Central Bureau has
asked the Delegate of Argentina for clarification on the FMD status of his
country. Furthermore, the report has been sent to the members of the OIE
Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Epizootics Commission for their evaluation
and advice on this point.

[Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) was introduced by European cattle to South
America in 1870s. A major achievement for animal health, economic growth
and hence human health has been the momentum gained toward the eradication
of FMD in the southern part of South America. A sustained effort by Primo
Arambulo at PAHO, many years of hard work by scientists at PANAFTOSA and
most importantly individual national veterinary services in the southern
most part of the hemisphere has led to remarkable progress. Chile and
Uruguay were early successes and they are FMD free without vaccination.
Argentina, Paraguay and southern region of Brazil-Rio Grande do Sul and
Santa Catarina are either free with vaccination or have transitioned
recently to free without vaccination status. It is for this reason that
stamping out this outbreak is so important.
It appears that the problem in Argentina may be due to trans border
movement of animals. Neither the OIE report nor the report on ProMED-port
by Dr Oscar P. Larghi (see above) indicate the presence of clinical signs
suggesting a new virus has been introduced into a susceptible population.
So the situation is different from the recent outbreaks sweeping across Asia.
However, this outbreak will be a definite set back because export from
Argentina has been already halted. Export eligible status is bolstered by a
system of FMD control which prohibits movement of cattle into Argentina
export herds from regions where they vaccinate for FMD or worse yet they
actually have FMD. In this case, the most likely scenario is that
vaccinated cattle crossed the border and hence the odd reactors. It appears
that the national animal health authorities are jumping right on this
outbreak but with FMD, success in eradication is never a given and leaky
borders are a tough problem to solve. Good luck to all involved and
ProMED-mail will keep you posted. - Mod.PC
