Fourth BSE case occurs in the Czech Republic
---------------------------------------------
PRAGUE: Less than a week after the discovery of the third case of BSE in
the Czech Republic, the fourth case has been detected, this one at the
Sestajovice farm east of Prague, State Veterinary Administration SVS
spokesman Josef Duben said. The infected 7 year old cow was slaughtered on
02 Oct 2002. The positive result has yet to be confirmed by another test
whose result will be known on 07 Oct 2002.
The risk group of cattle which will have to be slaughtered and tested for
BSE if the positive test is confirmed numbers 25. Until the confirmation,
special protective measures are being applied at the farm.
Duben stressed that the duty to test all cattle older than 30 months and
also those animals whose age is not known for various reasons ensures that
no infected meat can reach meat shops.
The Czech Republic registered the third case of BSE when a cow slaughtered
in Brno on 25 Sep 2002 tested positive for the disease. The cow was born in
1997 and was owned by the farm at Deblin, South Moravia. The first 2 cases
of BSE were discovered in June 2001 in Dusejov, South Moravia, and in
August 2001 in Svetnov, South Moravia.

[The previous, third suspected BSE case in the Czech Republic was reported
in BSE update (11) 20021003.5451. The Scientific Steering Committee of the
European Union adopted on 30 Mar 2001 an opinion on the Geographic BSE Risk
(GBR) of the Czech Republic, concluding "that it is likely but not
confirmed that one or several cattle that are (pre-clinically or
clinically) infected with the BSE agent are currently present in the
domestic herd of Czech Republic (GBR-III)". The first BSE case, in a 68
month old dairy cow, was confirmed in June 2001, followed by a second one
-- a 72 month old dairy cow -- in Sep 2001. Both animals were tested within
the framework of the compulsory testing for BSE of all bovine animals over
30 months of age subject to slaughter. This active surveillance started in
February 2001. The main points in the GBR Opinion were the following:
Czechoslovakia was exposed to a high external challenge from 1988 to 1992
(insufficient data on cattle imports before 1988 and on MBM [meat and bone
meal] imports before 1986). According to EUROSTAT data, during that period,
a total of 6459 live cattle were exported to Czechoslovakia from France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. From 1986 to 1990, 5950
tonnes of MBM were exported from France and 6887 tonnes were exported from
Germany, France and Belgium in 1991 and 1992.
Since 1993 the Czech Republic has been independent and the external
challenge has been very high. According to EUROSTAT data, a total of 29 711
cattle were exported from France, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany,
and Italy. The Czech Republic also imported MBM, MM (meat meal), BM (bone
meal), or greaves [residue left after the rendering of tallow] from BSE
affected countries. Since 1993 to 1999, a total of 104 240 tonnes were
exported from UK, France, Belgium/Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Germany, and Italy.
Information provided by the Czech Republic and by the Slovak Republic,
between 1980 and 1992, suggests that the BSE/cattle system of
Czechoslovakia was very unstable. The BSE/cattle system of the Czech
Republic was very unstable from 1993 to 1995, unstable in 1996, and has
been neutrally stable since 1997.
An RMBM (ruminants MBM) ban was installed in 1991 in Czechoslovakia, only
applicable to the current Czech Republic part. Its efficiency cannot be
judged. In 1996, an MBM feeding ban was installed and controls started.
Since 1999, analytical controls have also been carried out. Rendering in
the Czech Republic is done to the 133 Celsius/20 min/3 bars standards.
There is no SRM (specified risk material) feed ban but regulations for
handling SRM have been put in place since the end of 2000. Cross
contamination of cattle feed with MBM was likely and still cannot be
excluded. Passive surveillance of BSE was nonexistent before 1997 and
insufficient until 2001. An active surveillance started on 01 Feb 2001 and
this is highly welcome. The opinion can be seen at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out181_en.pdf>.
Until official confirmation of the last two cases, which are -- reportedly
-- 5.5 and 7 years old, both are regarded as "suspected". - Mod.AS]
