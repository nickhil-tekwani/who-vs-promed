Health officials in Southern Thailand are on high alert after 11 people became infected with a strain of malaria that primarily infects the macaque monkey, governor Chamnanwit Terat said on Monday [23 May 2022]. Health authorities said Trat, Songkhla, and Ranong in the south accounted for the most prone areas of _Plasmodium knowlesi_ infections.

Koh Chang has reported 9 of the infections, with the rest being reported from Bo Rai. According to the governor, most of the patients lived and/or worked near forests inhabited by the macaque monkey. Although the patients have since recovered, Mr. Chamnanwit said they had been asked to remain vigilant to prevent further spread within the community from the macaque monkey.

Over the course of the past year, 70 people have contracted malaria, which is caused by a parasite. _P. knowlesi_, like other malaria-causing parasites, can only be spread by its vector -- _Anopheles_ mosquitos. In 2004, researchers in Sarawak, Malaysia, discovered that the parasite was capable of infecting humans and the long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque monkey.

The provincial administration plans to inform the public about the threat posed by _P. knowlesi_ infections, Mr. Chamnanwut said. To prevent being infected, residents living near forested areas are advised to apply mosquito repellents before going out and sleeping with mosquito nets covering them. According to the Department of Disease Control, residents living near wild macaque habitats are also advised to take extra precautions.

On Koh Chang, a popular tourist destination, is where at least 1000 long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques live, according to park chief Dusit Samuttrakapong.

_P. knowlesi_ has now been recognized as the 5th type of _Plasmodium_ causing malaria in humans. Infections have been reported throughout Southeast Asia.

According to molecular, entomological, and epidemiological data, human infections with _P. knowlesi_ are not newly emerging, and _P. knowlesi_ malaria is primarily a zoonotic disease. In humans, infections were not diagnosed until molecular detection methods distinguished _P. knowlesi_ from the morphologically similar _P. malariae_.

The infections caused by _P. knowlesi_ in humans are potentially fatal, but if detected early enough, the infections are treatable.

[It has been known since 2008 that humans can acquire _P. knowlesi_ from macaque monkeys (https://doi.org/10.1086/524888). ProMED has posted regularly on this emerging infection. So far, there is no evidence that humans infected with _P. knowlesi_ can transmit to other humans, so it is a one-way infection from macaques to humans. _P. knowlesi_ has a 24-hour life cycle, so clinical symptoms evolve rapidly. _P. knowlesi_ is fully susceptible to artemisinins and artemisinin combinations. - Mod.EP
