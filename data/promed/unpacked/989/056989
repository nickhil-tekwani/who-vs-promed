Employee exposed to anthrax returns to work; no sign of germ's source
---------------------------------------
One of the 3 supermarket tabloid employees who were exposed to anthrax
returned to work Thursday as investigators waited for test results that
might help them find the source of the bacteria that killed one of her
co-workers.
The woman, 36, said health officials used a swab to test her nasal passages
Monday and she was told Wednesday afternoon that it had come back positive
for anthrax. She is taking antibiotics to ward off the bacteria. She is an
office services associate whose duties include receiving packages and
delivering the mail.
The case has prompted fear in south Florida and raised concerns across
the country about a biological attack using anthrax. Health officials
say the contamination is limited to the American Media building in Boca
Raton, and the three-story, 66 000-square-foot building has been closed.
Federal authorities have begun a criminal investigation but say there is
no evidence of terrorism. The FBI is awaiting test results on evidence
from the building that has been sent to federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention laboratory in Atlanta.

[Just as no good deed goes unpunished, no stupid deed is unrewarded. It
is clear that I was taken in by misinformation from Florida concerning
the nature of the strain of _Bacillus anthracis_ involved in this outbreak
that it was related to isolates from Haiti, Texas and Iowa. This I am
informed is untrue and thus my explanation of its meaning was nonsense.
I apologise for passing on this misinformation. - Mod.MHJ
