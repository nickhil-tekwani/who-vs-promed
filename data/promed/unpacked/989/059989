Ebola virus disease, West Africa - update
-----------------------------------------
Guinea
------
On 5 Jun 2014, a new district, Kouroussa, reported one new case and one death. This brings to date a total of 7 new cases nationwide (4 confirmed, 3 suspected), including 6 new cases and 6 new deaths reported from Conakry (2 new cases and 1 death), Gueckedou (1 new case and 1 death), Macenta (1 new case and 1 death), and Telimele (2 new cases and 2 deaths) during this period.

Cumulatively the total number of cases and deaths attributable to EVD in Guinea is 351 (210 laboratory-confirmed, 83 probable, and 58 suspected) including 226 deaths by 5 Jun 2014. [The government contests these numbers, claiming 208 cases and only 126 deaths; see ProMED archive 20140610.2529988. WHO has stated that numbers are subject to revision given the fluid situation. - Mod.JW]

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Conakry, 67 cases and 29 deaths; Gueckedou, 194 cases and 146 deaths; Macenta, 45 cases and 27 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; Telimele, 25 cases and 7 deaths; Boffa, 7 cases and 6 deaths; and Kouroussa, 1 case and 1 death.

In terms of isolation, 33 patients are currently hospitalized (8 in Conakry, 9 in Gueckedou, 15 in Telimele, and 1 in Boffa). The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 1011 distributed as follows: Conakry, 329 contacts; Gueckedou, 317 contacts; Macenta, 176 contacts; Telimele, 111 contacts; and Boffa, 78 contacts.

Liberia
-------
No new cases have been reported from Liberia; however 11 contacts (5 health-care workers and 6 community relatives) are currently being followed-up. These contacts were of the probable case from nearby Kailahun, Sierra Leone who died in Foya, Liberia. The deceased was taken back to Kailahun for burial.

Sierra Leone (Freetown)
-----------------------
As of 18:00 on 6 Jun 2014, 8 new cases (2 confirmed and 6 suspected) and 1 new death were reported from Kailahun (3 cases and 1 death), Kenema (1 case and 0 deaths), Bo (1 case and 0 deaths), Port Loko (1 case and 0 deaths), and Freetown (2 cases and 0 deaths). This brings the total number of EVD clinical cases to 89 (33 confirmed, 3 probable, and 53 suspected) including 7 deaths. All 33 confirmed cases and 7 deaths were reported from Kailahun district. The number of cases among health-care workers is 5 and deaths is 1. There are currently 11 cases in isolation at Kenema Hospital. The number of contacts currently being followed-up is 30.

Community resistance is hindering the identification and follow-up of contacts. Overall, the total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data and enhanced surveillance.

WHO response
------------
WHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and control measures in the affected countries. In Sierra Leone, WHO is training health-care workers on case and data management and in reviewing messages for social mobilization. Currently, there is only 1 isolation facility located at Kenema. WHO and partners are establishing 2 isolation sites in Darra and Koindu. Clinicians and infection prevention and control experts will be deployed to manage the new isolation sites. Four proposals which were developed with support from WHO have received funding from CERF (UN Central Emergency Response Fund), OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) Emergency Fund and DFID (UK Department for International Development) and the African Development Bank (ADB). Guinea and Liberia have also received funding from ADB. In Guinea, the joint WHO/HQ and AFRO mission continues to provide support on reviewing the outbreak response operations.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office.

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa with onset in early December 2013 in Guinea now involves 3 countries: Guinea, Liberia and most recently Sierra Leone. This is the 1st documented EVD outbreak in these countries. By week 14 of 2014, it looked like the control measures would bring the outbreak to a halt, but the situation has now evolved in another direction. In week 22 of 2014, there was an unexpected surge in the number of new cases, and the outbreak spread to previously unaffected areas in Guinea and Sierra Leone. As of 9 Jun 2014, the outbreak situation is the following:

- in Guinea, 344 clinically compatible cases (207 of which were laboratory-confirmed by PCR) including 215 deaths; [now revised to 208 cases and 126 deaths, see the 1st ProMED archive below. - Mod.JW].

- in Sierra Leone, 81 cases (31 confirmed, 3 probable and 47 suspected) including 6 deaths. The surge in cases in weeks 22 and 23 of 2014 and the expanding geographical spread involving previously unaffected areas are reasons for concern. Media reports and personal accounts indicate that the outbreak response operation may have failed to gain the trust and community support required to effectively trace and monitor all contacts of EVD patients and to isolate contacts who develop symptoms. A new wave of human-to-human transmission is currently unfolding, and it is, therefore, likely that additional cases will be identified in the coming weeks.

- in Liberia, one new suspected death clinically compatible with EVD, resulting in 13 cases including 9 deaths reported since March 2014.

For tourists, visitors or residents in affected areas, the risk of infection is still considered very low if elementary precautions are followed: avoiding contact with symptomatic patients or dead bodies and their bodily fluids. In addition, generic precautions for travelling in West African countries also apply for preventing infection with ebolavirus -- for example, avoiding close contacts with live or dead wild animals and consumption of bushmeat, washing and peeling fruit and vegetables before consumption, practising safe sex and following handwashing routines.

Health care workers in the affected area are advised to apply standard precautions and contact point of care risk assessment in the care of all patients. When caring for suspected and confirmed cases of EVD, they should strictly adhere to recommended infection prevention and control measures, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment [PPE]. The risks associated with seeking medical care in affected countries depend on how well the precautionary measures are implemented in those settings.

One preacher advocated fasting and prayer to spare people from a virus that usually leads to a horrible death. Some people pray that the EVD outbreaks, which are hitting 3 countries in West Africa, stay away from their home areas. Others seem unruffled and say it will blow over. But more than a month after the president of Guinea, Alpha Conde, told reporters the EVD outbreak that originated in his country was under control, the death toll continues to climb in his country as well as in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

At least [150] people have died since the outbreak of the fearsome disease, which causes bleeding internally and externally and for which there is no known cure. Guinea has recorded just over 200 deaths [officially revised to 126 [see ProMED archive 20140610.2529988 below], along with about a dozen each in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Experts say the outbreak may have begun as far back as January [2014 - ECDC estimates December 2013 in [1] above] in southeast Guinea. EVD typically begins in remote places, and it can take several infections before the disease is identified, making a precise start date virtually impossible to pin down. It's one of the worst outbreaks since the disease was 1st recorded in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and Congo, said Dr Armand Sprecher of Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF; doctors without borders].

The West Africa Ebola situation is especially challenging because of the number of "satellite outbreaks" that have cropped up, said Sprecher, who has worked on the emergency responses in Guinea as well as in Uganda in 2000 and in Congo in 2007. There have been at least 6 satellite outbreaks elsewhere in Guinea -- including the sprawling seaside capital of Conakry -- and in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Sprecher said.

In each outbreak, health workers must identify patients, trace and monitor everyone they've been in contact with and teach people how to avoid the disease. "Family members and traditional leaders are strongly advised to work with health teams to avoid dead bodies and their body fluids and prevent spreading EVD and deaths of members of communities. The public is also urged to wash their hands with soap and water or use [alcohol-based] hand sanitizer or ashes, avoid eating bush meat (monkeys, fruit bats), and to chlorinate their water before drinking," Bernice Dahn, deputy minister for health services in Liberia, said in a 7 Jun 2014 news release [The basis for fearing waterborne transmission is not clear. - Mod.JW].

One preacher in Sierra Leone called for divine intervention. "Even though the virus is said to have originated from birds and other animals, I believe the virus could be contained through God's miracle," said Pastor Balogun Macauley, chairman of the Coalition of Religious Youths in Sierra Leone, which has called for a 21-day period of fasting and prayer.

In Sierra Leone, some people take the threat seriously and heed advice put out on radio and TV stations and in newspapers by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. There is fear that Ebola might get to Freetown, the capital. Some note nervously that while the outbreak has been restricted to eastern Kailahun District next to the border with Liberia, that is the same district where on 23 Mar 1992 war spread to Sierra Leone from Liberia. That war wound up engulfing the whole country of Sierra Leone for more than 10 years.

MSF was forced to suspend activities at one treatment center in Guinea after it came under attack by protesters in April [2014]. The mob accused MSF health workers of bringing EVD to Guinea, where there had never previously been any cases. MSF cycles health workers out after 3-4 weeks because of concerns about fatigue, Sprecher said. "Given that there are [not] many people experienced with EVD in the world, you get stretched thin," he said, noting that some have undertaken multiple tours.

The number of Ebola cases in the 3 countries has risen above 400, according to WHO. The most devastating outbreak on record came in Uganda's Gulu district 14 years ago, with 425 cases and 224 deaths. "By the time this thing is done, it will probably be one of the longer outbreaks, if not the longest," Sprecher said.

[4] Guinea: Kankan infected
Date: 9 Jun 2014

http://www.afriquinfos.com/articles/2014/6/9/guinee-nouvelle-prefecture-touchee-fievre-ebola-avec-morts-255219.asp


Kouroussa town, located more than 600 km east of Conakry in the administrative region of Kankan, was on Monday [9 Jun 2014] declared a zone of epidemic hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), by the prefectural health department of the locality. The situation is currently 8 dead and several suspected cases currently isolated in the district hospital of Kouroussa.

This prefecture, just like others already affected, has recorded a cascade of deaths in several families who were unaware of the presence of EVD. It is through the analysis of samples taken from patients to the specialized medical laboratory in Conakry that the presence of the epidemic has been confirmed by the health authorities. According to preliminary investigations by the medical profession of the prefecture, the suspect cases came from one of the neighboring prefectures, Mandiana, where there is a gold mine whose operation requires the presence of waves of people from all parts of Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Mali.

A medical team was sent to the prefecture Kouroussa to inquire about the progress of the disease and to develop devices to contain the outbreak and prevent its spread to neighboring villages.

Since the emergence of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea in January [2014 - ECDC estimates December 2013, see [1] above], the balance is estimated at 126 deaths out of 206 confirmed cases according to the Guinean government; 7 prefectures and the capital Conakry are already affected by the outbreak of EVD.

[5] Sierra Leone: more cases

The death toll from EVD in Sierra Leone has doubled to at least 12 in a week, local health authorities said on Monday [9 Jun 2014], deepening the spread of a disease that has killed [150] people in Guinea and Liberia. The mounting deaths in Sierra Leone, which had been spared cases for months after EVD was confirmed in the region in March [2014], underscore the challenges weak health systems face tackling one of the deadliest diseases on the planet.

Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone's director of disease prevention and control, said all the confirmed deaths in Sierra Leone were in the east, mainly in the Kailahun district on the border with Guinea. "It is very difficult for us to ascertain community deaths at this moment, but the 12 deaths are the ones the hospital can definitely confirm to have died of EVD," Jambai said. Jambai added that there were now 42 confirmed cases of EVD from 113 people tested and that new cases had been recorded in the northern district of Kambia.

Ebola was confirmed in a remote corner of Guinea in March [2014] and then later spread to Guinea's distant capital, Conakry, and over the border into Liberia. All suspected cases in Sierra Leone tested negative until last month [May 2014], and Jambai said that the disease was spreading as authorities are struggling to control the movement of people.

International medical experts have been dispatched to Sierra Leone, but they face a combination of poor existing health systems and tensions among locals fueled by the lack of understanding over the disease; 2 weeks ago relatives removed an EVD patient from a treatment center in Koindu as they doubted the disease existed.

Iron ore producers London Mining and African Minerals have imposed some restrictions on [expat] staff in Sierra Leone as a result of the outbreak, but the firms say their output has so far not been affected.

[6] Sierra Leone: Kambia infected

[Readers are referred to the source URL for this long story full of human interest. Excerpts follow. - Mod.JW]

The much dreaded Ebola virus disease (EVD) which has been ravaging the people of eastern Kailahun district is now confirmed to have moved up to the northern town of Mambolo in the Kambia district, where there are 2 confirmed Ebola cases and 10 other people having blood samples collected from them as possibly infected with Ebola.

[There is now] widespread infection of residents in the Kissi chiefdoms bordering the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Guinea as well as another major Kailahun locality known as Jawei chiefdom, whose headquarters of Daru town and its surrounding villages have been particularly hit by the illness.

The infection and widespread deaths in Kailahun have left traditional rulers, honourable parliamentarians, and ordinary residents weeping and wailing. The wife and children of the paramount chief of Jawei, PC Musa Ngoumbuklah Kallon II, have been admitted as they are very sick with the ebolavirus. The 2 wives of a key traditional ruler, the section chief of a section located just 6 miles from Daru, have also been infected as have many other residents of the chiefdom. In one village alone, an entire family has been wiped out.

Not knowing his wife was infected with Ebola, Mr SK brought her for treatment to Bombohun in Jawei, and then from Bombohun, on the way to Kenema from Daru, the poor nurse died. Innocently, still not informed it could be EVD, her corpse was washed and prepared for burial by her mother, sisters and other women. All these women have since died from EVD. The mother of the nurse, her sisters, and husband have all died from EVD. Furthermore, Jawei health staff who treated the late nurse have all now died or are said to be in critical condition from EVD.

According to Charles Mambu of the civil society organisation known as the "Health For All Coalition", up to 70 per cent of those who have died from EVD in recent days have been frontline staff of the Ministry of Health & Sanitation. Awareness Times can confirm that despite the fact that EVD was known to be raging in Guinea and also found in neighbouring Liberia, no protective clothing [was received by] our hardworking MCH nurses and paramedics in Kailahun. Furthermore, the Rapid Response Diagnostic Test Kits for Kailahun district, which would have helped in the differential diagnosis to eliminate non-EVD conditions, had expired since March 2014.

According to our Guinean contact, a 40 year old woman, a close contact of a positive case hospitalized in the EVD Unit in Gueckedou, escaped from the village of Koueldou, Tekoulo district, Gueckedou County, Guinea, and went to Vengbemei village, Foya district, Lofa County. Her symptoms before escape were fever, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and red eyes. Her reason for escape: "afraid to come to Ebola unit in Gueckedou."

No new cases have been reported. Cumulative numbers of suspected, probable and confirmed cases remain 13 as of the reporting date [6 Jun 2014]. 11 contacts are still on active follow up in Foya (5 health workers and 6 community relatives). There has been 100 per cent follow-up as of the reporting week. None have developed symptoms/signs. There are no cases in isolation/admission.

There are 40 media professionals trained in EVD Response and Prevention (emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of the media and Civil Society in EVD response). UNIMIL (United Nations Mission in Liberia) continues a daily media campaign free of charge, and radio messages in local vernaculars continue at other local radio stations across the country.

Follow-up of 5 close contacts for the Lassa fever positive case in Montserrado County has been established and begun.

Planned activities:
- social mobilization training targeting religious, cultural and traditional leaders;
- sustain information campaign and social mobilization activities in affected and vulnerable counties along the borders (door to door using the general community health volunteers (gCHVs);
- strengthen cross border surveillance and response including information sharing approaches/lessons learnt with bordering countries;
- slan senior MRU level meeting on Ebola response to harmonise strategies and response;
- scale up preparedness and response activities to other counties (training of staff and provide other capabilities and capacities).

[It is very sad that awareness of EVD is still lacking in some areas, as are supplies of disposable plastic gloves; full personal protective equipment (PPE) is not absolutely necessary to protect carers and burial attendants. It sounds as though health services are losing large numbers of front line workers and are being overwhelmed.

Following up what are currently 1011 contacts in Guinea alone (for the incubation period of 21 days) seems to me a well-nigh impossible task.

The fact that some infected workers came from the Mandiana gold mine in Guinea, where other workers from the Ivory Coast and Mali are employed, means that if the latter flee back to their home countries, there is a risk they may take EVD with them. - Mod.JW
