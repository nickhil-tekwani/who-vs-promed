[With the addition of these 5 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, the total number of cases reported since the 1st of this year (2019) is now up to 99. Realizing that there have been 69 days since the beginning of the year, this means there have been an average of 1.4 cases reported each day since the beginning of the year. One can't help but wonder if there has been a testing criterion change with detection of milder cases, as the reported case fatality rate since the beginning of the year is significantly lower than previous reports in Saudi Arabia -- a total of 16 fatalities (16.2% case fatality rate, although there are still 21 cases pending outcome information, so this calculated rate may increase).

The outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir continues with 2 newly confirmed cases in this period, bringing the total number of reported cases in Wadi Aldwasir to 55 (or 56 if one includes a case reported from Riyadh city, but attributed to this outbreak.

Of note is that there appears to be another cluster ongoing now in Khamees Meshait city, Aseer region, with a primary case reported on 6 Feb 2019, reported to have died on 16 Feb 2019, and secondary cases reported on 7 and 10 Mar 2019. Note that the interval between last possible date of exposure to the primary case and the date of the 1st reported secondary case(s -- there were 2 reported on this day) was 19 days, so either the date of onset of illness of these cases was 5 or more days prior to confirmation, or there may be missing individuals in this chain.

Since the beginning of 2019, cases have been reported from 9 different regions: Riyadh (79 cases), Al Qasim (6 cases), Makkah (5 cases), Asir (4 cases) and 1 each from Al Jawf, Najran, Tabuk, Al Madinah, and Ash Sharqiyah.

Highlights:
- At the end of February 2019, a total of 2374 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 823 associated deaths (case fatality rate, 34.6%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1983 cases, including 745 related deaths with a case fatality rate of 37.5%).
- During the month of February [2019], a total of 76 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally: 68 of the cases were reported from Saudi Arabia with 10 associated deaths, and 8 were reported from Oman with 2 associated deaths. [In February 2019], Saudi Arabia experienced an outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir city and one of its hospitals. From [29 Jan 2019] to end of February [presume 28 Feb 2019], a total of 52 laboratory-confirmed cases with 7 associated deaths have been reported for this outbreak: 1 suspected index, 3 unknown exposures, 10 sporadic primary cases, 38 secondary cases (7 household contacts and 31 hospital-acquired cases, including 11 healthcare workers). There is no ongoing active transmission occurring. In Oman this month [February 2019], 4 additional secondary cases have been linked to the cluster previously reported in January [2019] and a new non-linked cluster of 4 cases (including 1 healthcare worker) with 2 deaths was reported as well. The new cluster includes 1 suspected index case and 3 secondary cases (including 1 healthcare worker).
- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2019, do not show any significant difference or change, except for the increase in the number of secondary cases and healthcare worker cases due to the hospital outbreak this month [February 2019]. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.
- The age-group 50 to 59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age-group 30 to 39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age-group 50 to 59 years for primary cases and 70 to 79 years for secondary cases.

[For those who are interested in following the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, I recommend going to the source URL of the EMRO update for additional information, graphics and tables.

As of the end of February 2019, there have been a total of 2374 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported worldwide, including 823 fatalities (reported case fatality rate of 34.6%). Note that the recent reports from Saudi Arabia during 2019 are showing a significantly lower case fatality rate (16.2%, although there are still 21 reported cases pending outcome information).

Of interest are the data on case classifications in Saudi Arabia for this year (2019). Of the 80 cases reported through the end of February 2019, 21 (26.3%) were classified as primary cases and 43 (53.8%) were reported as secondary cases; the remaining 16 cases were listed as "missing" further information to give a definitive classification (data available at source URL). - Mod.MPP]
