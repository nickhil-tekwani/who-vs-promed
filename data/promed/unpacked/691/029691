New hantavirus [infection] case confirmed in Aysen
--------------------------------------------------
Hospitalized in the Thorax Hospital in Santiago city and on mechanical ventilation is a 30 year old young man who is a resident of the Chile Chico community, who becomes the 5th case of the disease in the Aysen region during 2022. According to the Public Health Institute, the patient is positive for [a] hantavirus [infection].

According to the Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat] the young man went to the hospital where he was diagnosed based on symptoms compatible with the disease. Due to this, it was determined to take him to Coyhaique city, finally to be taken by air to Santiago.

As for how the contagion would have been acquired, the health authority pointed out that "they would point to a day of excursion and camping that the patient did in rural areas in the southern part of the Ays√©n region", according to Carmen Monsalve.

Regarding this case, the epidemiology team of the Aysen regional health SEREMI has already begun traceability investigation, for the purpose of which they went to the possible place of infection.

[Hantavirus infections occur in a broad Andean region of Chile every year. This case is in the Aysen region. Although not specified in this or previous reports from this and other regions, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region, which is why the Aysen regional health SEREMI is investigating the likely area in order to determine where the patient became infected probably through contact with an infected rodent or its excrement.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly from person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
