How do you vaccinate 3 million chickens?

By injecting them, one by one.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved an unorthodox
method of using vaccine to control an outbreak of a weak strain of
avian influenza in eastern Connecticut. Bruce Gresczyk, acting
commissioner of the state Department of Agriculture, said there's
only one way to administer the vaccine: "a needle."

Avian influenza cannot be transmitted through eggs and is harmless to
humans, Gresczyk said.

Bruce Sherman, director of the agriculture department's bureau of
regulation and inspection, said the new vaccine is made of dead avian
influenza, and his staff plans to supervise the vaccination process.

The company that first notified the state of the outbreak at its
facilities on 27 Feb 2003, will pay for the vaccinations, and will
use its own staff to administer them. The company employs about 290
people and has an $11 million annual payroll.

"The vaccination will be subcutaneous," Sherman said. He said the
needle must be inserted into a muscle on each laying hen for the
vaccine to work.

"There will be 2 shots given, about 14 to 30 days apart," Sherman
said. "The second one will act as a booster shot."

The process won't be as disorderly as it might seem, Gresczyk said.
"This is a cage-layer operation, with 3 or 4 birds per cage,"
Gresczyk said. "You start at one end and work your way to the other
end."

Although there are other ways of administering a vaccine to
livestock, Sherman said, injections are the only way to go in this
case. Other methods include the use of aerosol mists that can be
taken into the birds' nasal passages or oral vaccines that can be
delivered with a dropper. Putting the vaccine in feed or water won't
work because chickens are notoriously sloppy eaters, Sherman said.

Gresczyk said it may take several weeks to get all the chickens vaccinated.

It could also be weeks before the state starts the process, Gresczyk
said. This is the first time this approach is being used on chickens.

Only 2 out of several facilities in eastern Connecticut have flocks
that tested positive for the bird flu. The company's facilities in
Bozrah and Lebanon, where the outbreak has been contained, have a
combined 30 coops, Gresczyk said. "Each coop has about 100 000
chickens," he said.

"This pilot program will hopefully ensure the farms' long-term
viability," Gresczyk said.

Officials at the chicken farm could not be reached for comment.

[There seems to be something amiss here. An injection is either
subcutaneous or into the muscle, but it cannot be both -- as this
article indicates Sherman said. Furthermore, the process needs to be
uniform throughout the operation, either all subcutaneous or all into
the muscle. If the USDA or state department has clarifying
information with regard to the vaccine, ProMED-mail would appreciate
an update. - Mod.TG]
