The Centre for Health Protection is investigating a suspected
ciguatoxin poisoning case involving 5 people in 2 groups who felt
sick after eating fish at home in Sha Tin [in Hong Kong] on 30 Nov 2006.
The first group involved 2 men and one woman aged 11 to 49. They
developed symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea, numbness, and hot and
cold flushes after eating coral reef fish.
They sought medical treatment from Prince of Wales Hospital and 2 of
them were admitted. All are in stable condition.
The 2nd group involved a man and a woman, both aged 50. One of them
was admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital while the other did not seek
medical treatment. Both are in stable condition.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today (1 Dec 2006) reminded members of the public to be extra
cautious when consuming coral reef fish as they could contain
ciguatoxin, which may cause food poisoning.
The appeal followed a case of suspected ciguatoxin poisoning
involving 5 people in 2 clusters who consumed marine fish at home in
Sha Tin [in Hong Kong] on the evening of 30 Nov 2006.
The first cluster consisted of 2 males and one female aged from 11 to
49. They developed symptoms of ciguatoxin poisoning including nausea,
diarrhoea, numbness, and hot and cold flushes within 4.5 to 12.5
hours of eating the coral reef fish. They sought medical treatment
from the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales
Hospital and 2 of them were admitted. All are in a stable condition.
The 2nd cluster involved a man and a woman, both aged 50, who
developed symptoms about 3-6 hours after eating the fish. One of them
was admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital. Another person did not seek
medical treatment. Both are now in a stable condition.
To prevent ciguatera fish poisoning members of the public should
observe the following measures:
* Eat less coral reef fish.
* Eat small amounts of coral reef fish at any one meal and avoid
having a whole fish feast in which all the dishes come from the same
big coral reef fish.
* Avoid eating the head, skin, intestines and roe of coral reef fish,
which usually have a higher concentration of toxin.
* When eating coral reef fish, avoid consuming alcohol, peanuts or
beans as they may aggravate ciguatoxin poisoning.
* Seek medical treatment immediately should symptoms of ciguatoxin
fish poisoning appear.
* Coral reef fish should be purchased from reputable and licensed
seafood shops. Do not buy it when the source is doubtful.

[Some basic information regarding ciguatera poisoning can be accessed
at the eMedicine website: <http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic100.htm>.
"Ciguatera poisoning is the most common nonbacterial, fish-borne
poisoning in the United States. It is caused by consumption of reef
fish that feed on certain dinoflagellates (i.e., algae) associated
with coral reef systems. At least 5 types of ciguatoxin have been
identified and are noted to accumulate in larger and older fish
higher up the food chain. Ciguatera poisoning has been a significant
concern in tropical areas for centuries and generally is believed to
be confined to coral reef fish in water between the latitudes of 35
degrees N and 35 degrees S. In the modern era of world travel and
rapid transportation, many warm-water fish are available commercially
in markets throughout the world, and cases of ciguatera poisoning may
be seen in any location.
_Gambierdiscus toxicus_ is the dinoflagellate most notably
responsible for production of ciguatoxin, although other species have
been identified more recently. Over 400 species of fish have been
implicated in ciguatera poisoning, starting with herbivores and then
climbing up the food chain to the larger carnivorous fish.
Species of fish most frequently implicated include groupers,
amberjack, red snappers, eel, sea bass, barracuda, and Spanish
mackerel. Fish larger than 2 kg contain significant amounts of toxin
and readily produce toxic effects when ingested. Although not
completely reliable, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and mouse biologic
assay are available for detection of ciguatoxin in affected fish.
Ciguatoxin and other similar toxins are heat-stable and
lipid-soluble; they are unaffected by temperature, gastric acid, or
cooking method. Presence of toxin does not affect odor, color, or
taste of the fish. Recently, chemists have been successful in
synthesizing specific ciguatoxins, ensuring a practical supply will
be available for future biological applications.
Ciguatoxin produces toxic effects by activation of voltage-dependent
sodium channels, resulting in hyperexcitability, decreased
conduction, and prolonged refractoriness. Effects are most pronounced
on neuronal, cardiac, and GI tissues."
There have been several similar incidents reported since 1998 in this
territory. - Mod.RY]
