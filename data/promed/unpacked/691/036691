Several outbreaks of cholera have caused more than 150 deaths in at least 3
provinces of the war-ravaged Afghanistan during the past 5 weeks. As of 25
Sep 2000, hundreds of people have been affected in the Kandahar, Badghis,
and Jawzjan provinces. More than half of the deaths have been in Badghis
province. But still, "the severity of cholera is less than one-tenth of
last year", Rana Graber, spokesperson for WHO Afghanistan, told The Lancet.
The cause of the outbreaks was _Vibrio cholera_ El Tor Ogawa 01.

Ten children in Fnaydeq, Akkar were taken to hospital on Tuesday suffering
symptoms of typhoid after drinking contaminated water. Fnaydeq is the
fourth village in the region to be affected by contaminated water. Fnaydeq
Mayor Ahmad Baarini said the problem was mainly caused by sewage water
seeping into the Ain al-Banat springs which supply Fnaydeq with drinking
water. A 30-year-old network channels water from various springs in the
region to some 150 surrounding villages.

Preventable diseases arising from unsanitary environment are among the
major causes of death among children and women in Kenya. He said high
prevalence of diarrhea had made it the fourth leading cause of death among
children aged under 5 in Kenya and accounts for 40 percent of all
outpatient cases and 60 percent of child admissions at Kenyatta National
Hospital. Alipui said high rate of morbidity and mortality had greatly
affected the general output of the population with infant mortality rising
from 60 to 74 per 1000 live births over the last 10 years. "Ten years down
the line in 1990, the national sanitation coverage level had dropped to 45
percent and only increased to 46 per cent in 1996" he said.

More than 65 people, many under the age of 18, suffered from poisoning on
Tuesday, most likely caused by drinking contaminated water in the villages
of Jub Jannine and Qaraoun in Rashaya. While many were transported to
Hamed Hospital in Jub Jannine, less serious cases were treated at Qaraoun
Health Center. Jub Jannine's drinking water comes directly from the
Shamseen Springs without passing through filtering tanks. Those poisoned
suffered high fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Several cases of poisoning
caused by water contamination were reported 2 months ago in the village of
Khirbet Qanafar in the same district, increasing fears that the allegedly
contaminated water supply could spread throughout the Western Bekaa.

Government experts are investigating an outbreak of a fast-food super bug
which has claimed one life and made hundreds ill. The outbreak is being
caused by a strain of _Salmonella_ that is resistant to all commonly used
antibiotics. One person has died, 7 people have been admitted to hospital
and 249 are reported to have fallen ill. More than 100 cases have been
registered in the West Midlands. Government public health experts are
trying to trace the source of the bug and establish what kind of food is
responsible for the infection.
