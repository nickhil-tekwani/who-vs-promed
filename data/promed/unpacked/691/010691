Russia: aseptic (viral) meningitis outbreak in Komsomolsk-na-Amure
------------------------------------------------------------------
3 cases of aseptic (viral) meningitis have been notified in the city of
Komsomolsk-na-Amure (Khabarovsk District). All 3 cases were children, aged
from 2 to 9 years old, and were admitted to the city's Children's Hospital.
It was established that 2 of the infected children had swum in the Amur
river and that -- according to physicians -- is where they contracted the
viral meningitis infection. Water samples were taken in the area of the
city beach. The results of microbiological tests revealed that water
quality was far from satisfactory. Accordingly, epidemiologists have warned
both city inhabitants and visitors not to bathe in the river and to avoid
swallowing water if they disregard this advice.
Physicians are also recommending that the population wash fruit and
vegetables thoroughly and to drink only bottled or boiled water.

[The city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure (Komsomolsk on the Amur) was estimated to
have a population of 315 000 in 1989. It is located on the Amur river in
the territory of Khabarovsk in the southern part of the Russian Far East.
It is a manufacturing centre producing steel, machinery, refined oil, and
wood products. Tin mines are nearby. The city was founded (1932) by
Komsomol (the Communist youth organization). - Mod.NR
Viral meningitis is sometimes referred to as aseptic, lymphocytic, or
serous meningitis because of the predominance of lymphocytes in the
cerebrospinal fluid. 1/2 to 3/4 of cases of meningitis are caused by
viruses. The etiologic agents are predominantly enteroviruses, and less
frequently mumps virus (transmitted by droplets and fomites), herpes
simplex virus, and adenovirus.
Cases of enteroviral infection are commonest in summer months and in the
1st 10 years of life. Transmission of infection is predominantly by the
fecal-oral route, or by ingestion of contaminated water, as in the outbreak
described above. Viral meningitis is likely to occur in any situation where
there is gross contamination of environmental water and domestic water
supplies. The prognosis for viral meningitis is good and recovery is
usually complete.
Further information on the outcome of this outbreak and confirmation of the
presumptive diagnosis would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
