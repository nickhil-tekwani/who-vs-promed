Uganda Ebola free
-----------------
The ministry of health is set to announce an end of the Ebola
outbreak in the country tomorrow (Fri 17 Jun 2011).

Rukia Nakamatte, the ministry's spokesperson said Friday [17 Jun
2011] would mark the end of 42 days, the required days designated to
mark an end to such an epidemic.

The Ebola outbreak was confirmed on May 12 [2011] after a 12-year-old
girl from Zirobwe Sub County in Luwero district died on 6 May 2011 at
Bombo Military Hospital.

The case remained the only confirmed case of the Sudan Ebola strain
outbreak. All suspected cases were tested at the Uganda Virus Research
Institute, Entebbe and proved negative.

[The Ebola outbreak in Uganda is finally contained since no new cases
have been confirmed beyond the index case even after enhanced
surveillance was initiated as part of the outbreak response. 17 Jun
2011 will mark 2 incubation periods after the lone confirmed case
died, hence in the absence of additional confirmed cases the outbreak
will be declared over. Routine case based laboratory backed
surveillance for febrile hemorrhagic illness should continue to ensure
that all suspect cases are detected and investigated promptly to
prevent large scale outbreaks that have afflicted the country in the
past.
