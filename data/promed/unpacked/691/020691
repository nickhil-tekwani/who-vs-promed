An outbreak of yellow fever, an acute and contagious viral disease, has claimed 4 lives in Kenya since it was first detected in January [2022], the health ministry said Monday [7 Mar 2022]. The cases were reported in the pastoralist and remote county of Isiolo, some 270 km (160 mi) north of the capital Nairobi.

"We have an additional death to the 3 that we had reported earlier," Patrick Amoth, director general of Kenya's health ministry, told AFP (see Yellow fever - Africa (01): Kenya (IS) 20220305.8701824).

There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and found in parts of Africa and Latin America's Amazon region. The disease is transmitted by the same mosquitoes which spread Zika and dengue [viruses].

Kenya, which has not experienced an outbreak of yellow fever since the 1990s, detected its 1st case in decades on 12 Jan [2022] and had, until last week, isolated 15 patients with fever, jaundice, and muscle pain.

The risk of further spread was low as the outbreak was in a sparsely populated region, Amoth said.

"Because of the demographics of Isiolo, in terms of the number of people and how people are widely spread apart, it makes it a little easier to control," Amoth said.

However, 25% of the country has been classified as high risk, he said.

The outbreak is adding to Kenya's health challenges as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and battles a severe drought in Isiolo and other northern counties.

The disease is transmitted from humans to humans via the mosquito, which sucks up the virus and then [after a few days] hands it on when it bites someone for a blood meal.

Yellow fever vaccinations are routinely recommended for travellers going on safaris in Kenya. Bed nets, insect repellent, and long clothing are also considered good forms of protection.

As noted above, this small 3-victim outbreak has added a 4th case. The low vaccination rate is of concern. One hopes that the rapid response will lead to a prompt vaccination campaign in the affected areas. A YF vaccine shortage was reported in 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (04): Kenya vaccine shortage 20200130.6935353). Apparently that shortage has ended.

As noted in the previous post, the previous outbreak was in 1991-1993 (see references below). During that outbreak, a report indicated that nearly all confirmed infections were acquired between 1500 and 1800 m (4900-5900 ft) in the Tugen Hills (Baringo district, Rift Valley province). Transmission appeared to be entirely sylvatic, that is, all confirmed cases were independent of other human cases and had acquired their infection by contact with mosquitoes that had been infected by feeding on viraemic monkeys. Infected mosquitoes (_Aedes africanus_ and _Ae. keniensis_) were captured close to a cluster of human cases at about 1700 m (5577 ft) (see Yellow fever - Africa (17): Kenya, background 20110504.1377). Although the mosquito vectors in the current outbreak have not been reported, the mosquito surveys done in the 2 counties reported above, though distant from the current outbreak, do indicate that vector mosquitoes capable of urban transmission are present in Kenya.
