Florida health officials are urging residents in Volusia County to take basic precautions to protect themselves from mosquito-borne viruses, after tests confirm 3 cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses and several sentinel chickens tested positive for the virus.

"There is a heightened concern that the risk of transmission to humans has increased," Volusia health officials said in a press release. "Volusia County Mosquito Control and DOH-Volusia continue surveillance and prevention efforts." There have been no positive test results for EEE virus in Brevard, or any of the other mosquito-borne viruses that cause human illness, said Chris Richmond, operations manager for Brevard County Mosquito Control. "Historically, we get very little triple E (eastern equine encephalitis)," Richmond said. "We do get a few horses every couple of years."

Florida health officials also urge horse owners are to keep their horses current on their eastern equine encephalitis vaccination.

The United States only sees a few cases of EEE [in human beings] each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the US, with about a third of its [human] victims dying, and those who survive suffer significant brain damage. There is no specific treatment for EEE, according to CDC, and care is based on the symptoms. Most cases are in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, and most people infected have no apparent illness.

Severe cases result in encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness can progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma.

[There is a very effective vaccine for the equines. Horse owners need to vaccinate immediately and to continue to use equine specific mosquito and fly repellents.
