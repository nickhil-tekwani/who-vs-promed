Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel - update 15 Jul 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated in 30 sewage samples from 10 sampling sites in Israel. The samples were collected from [3 Feb 2013 to 30 Jun 2013]. Most positive WPV1 samples were detected from southern Israel. All viruses have been detected in sewage only; no cases of paralytic polio have been reported.

Detection of viruses across the country indicates increased geographic extent of circulation for a prolonged period of time. WHO assesses the risk of further international spread of WPV from Israel as moderate to high.

Health authorities in Israel are continuing to conduct a full epidemiological and public health investigation to actively search for potential cases of paralytic polio and any un-immunized persons. Routine immunization coverage is estimated at 94 percent or above over the last 8 years. The frequency of environmental surveillance sampling has been increased. Environmental surveillance is frequently used by countries around the world, including in Israel, to support the detection of diseases of public health importance. Similar activities are being implemented by health authorities in Gaza and West Bank and no WPV has been detected to date from these areas.

The Government of Israel is planning supplementary immunization activities (SIA) with oral polio vaccine (OPV). The objectives of the SIAs with OPV are to boost mucosal immunity levels to rapidly interrupt virus circulation. These SIAs follow efforts initiated at the beginning of June 2013 to catch up with any un- or under-immunized children using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3 or IPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 percent.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Just 3 countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, in 2013, the Horn of Africa is affected by an outbreak of WPV.

[The presence of WPV1 in sewage samples in more than one location over the course of 2 months is highly suggestive of circulation of the WPV1 in the southern region of Israel. The possibility is also there that it represents a traveller who has prolonged excretion of the virus.

The poliovirus has continued to spread through sewer systems across Israel, based on widespread sample surveys of sewer systems recently ordered by the Health Ministry.

Still, no polio sufferers have been found, the Health Ministry said, stressing that the virus has been located in sewer systems only.

The survey found the virus in the Ayalon sewer system that handles sewage from the cities of Ramle, Lod and Modi'in and the communities located in the Gezer Regional Council; in the sewer system that handles sewage from the Lev Hasharon Regional Council, including the community of Kalansua; and in the sewage treatment plant that serves the communities of Jaljulia and Kafr Bara. The discovery of the poliovirus in these sewer systems follows the virus' discovery at sewage treatment plants serving Negev communities. The virus was 1st discovered in May [2013] in sewage from the Negev city of Rahat.

All the polioviruses found recently have a similar genetic structure to the strain of the virus found in December 2012 in Egypt, according to the director of Public Health Services in the Health Ministry, Prof. Itamar Grotto. According to Grotto, it is believed that the virus was brought to Israel by a carrier who was infected in Egypt, and has already been transmitted to additional people, although it is impossible to estimate the number of infected.

"It can be assumed that the virus has spread and infected people in the center of the country and the Sharon region," said Grotto. However, he added, it could not be ruled out that the virus was brought to the center of the country by people living in the south who work in the center.

The survey samples from sewer systems across the country have yet to find any polioviruses in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Ashkelon or Eilat, or in the sewer systems of the central Dan region or of the north.

In recent days, the Health Ministry has increased preparations for a vaccination campaign that will provide an additional polio vaccine to children up to the age of 8 across the south. Currently children are vaccinated with an injection of a dead poliovirus at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and one year, and then in the 2nd grade of school.

The new campaign would administer an additional polio vaccine that contains a weakened live virus in drop form to children up to age 8. Grotto said the final decision to carry out the vaccination campaign will be made based on the results of a fecal sample survey being conducted now by the Health Ministry in Negev communities.

World Health Organization figures show that the poliovirus is considered active in only 5 countries today. In Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria the virus is considered to be "endemic"; in 1988, this description fit 125 countries. Isolated numbers of polio sufferers have also been found, according to the WHO, in Somalia and Kenya since the beginning of this year [2013].

Israel is likely to join these 2 countries should any individuals be diagnosed with polio. The WHO has a goal of eradicating polio worldwide by 2018.

To reduce the risk of contracting polio, the Health Ministry instructs individuals to be meticulous about personal hygiene, particularly washing hands after using the bathroom, before touching food and after changing infants' diapers. The ministry also called for parents to be meticulous about keeping up-to-date with routine vaccinations for their children up to age 6 at well-baby centers across the country.

[All of the new locales where WPV1 has been identified (Ramle, Lod and Modi'in and the communities located in the Gezer Regional Council, Lev Hasharon Regional Council, Jaljulia and Kafr Bara) are located in the Central District of Israel. The earlier report of WPV1 isolates were from environmental samples in the Negev District in the South of Israel (see prior ProMED-mail posts Poliomyelitis update (10): Israel, positive environmental samples, MOH 20130605.1756289, Poliomyelitis update (09): Israel, positive environmental samples, RFI 20130604.1754766, and Poliomyelitis update (08): Israel, environmental isolates, WHO, RFI 20130603.1753099 for more details).

The finding that the WPV1 isolates are similar genetically to those identified in Egypt in December 2012 (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (01): Egypt ex Pakistan, Niger 20130122.1509210 for more details) is in keeping with continued circulation of the same virus as originally identified in May 2013 in Rahat and Beer Sheeba in the Southern District.

Israel is comprised of 6 main administrative districts: Jerusalem District, Northern District, Haifa District, Central District, Tel Aviv District, and the Southern District.

Traces of the poliomyelitis virus are continuing to appear in sewage treatment facilities in southern and central Israel, according to the Health Ministry.

The virus, which can cause paralysis, was once considered eradicated. But nearly one million doses of the "live attenuated" oral vaccine were ordered at a cost of several million shekels after the live virus was 1st detected in February [2013] in routine samples of sewage extracted from Rahat.

Israel is one of only 5 countries in the world that routinely tests stool samples, via 16 sewage treatment plants around the country.

Health Minister Yael German stressed there is "no reason to panic," saying that not even one case of clinical poliomyelitis has appeared thus far.

But the ministry is continuing to monitor and examine stool samples around the country, and traces are continuing to spread. The areas where the virus has been detected include the Lev Hasharon area, Modi'in, Ramle, the Negev Bedouin city of Rahat, Be'er Sheva, Ashdod and Tel Aviv.

According to some experts who testified before the Knesset Health Committee last month [June 2013], some 10 percent of Negev residents have not been inoculated against the virus.

An advanced form of the oral polio vaccine is to be administered to some 150 000 children in the south this month, following last month's visit to Israel by officials from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control.

Some rabbis in Jerusalem have begun to announce their recommendation to vaccinate all children under the age of 6.

A total of 5 vaccination stations were opened in Jerusalem for the purpose of distributing polio vaccines to the hareidi-religious population [ultra orthodox], which includes families who choose not to immunize their children at all.

In an alarming development, Knesset member Yisrael Eichler (UTJ) recently charged that many of the well-baby clinics in hareidi-religious neighborhoods around the country have failed to keep up with the high birthrate and to monitor the children's health in these families.

As a result, he warned, thousands of children in the country could be at risk.

[The initial positive environmental samples were in sewage serving Arab communities in the Southern District with the speculation that there was introduction of the virus from a traveler to or from Egypt, where a similar WPV1 was identified in December 2012. Vaccination activities in the Southern District have been increased to raise coverages there and interrupt the apparent "silent" transmission of the WPV1 (in this case the use of the word "silent" means that there have not been clinical cases of polio associated with this circulating virus identified).

While the 2012 reported vaccination coverage with polio vaccine in Israel was 95 percent (according to data available on the WHO website: http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/countries?countrycriteria%5Bcountry%5D%5B%5D=ISR), concern re: pockets of unvaccinated individuals where the WPV1 could circulate is valid. The above newswire highlights the concerns raised about sub-optimal vaccination coverages in the ultra-orthodox community in Jerusalem. In the past few years, there have been outbreaks of measles and mumps in the ultra-orthodox communities in Israel, the UK and the US (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below), which serve as evidence of lower coverages with MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella), and possibly suggestive of lower coverages with other vaccines, including the polio vaccine. (This moderator attempted to find information on vaccination coverage by vaccine and administrative division in Israel but was unsuccessful).

In addition to the environmental sampling for WPV1 in sewage, the Ministry of Health of Israel has begun doing stool sampling at mother and infant care centers and HMOs in the Southern District (http://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/03072013_1.aspx). Results of this sampling will be available in several weeks. It will be interesting to know if WPV1 is detected from individuals, and to learn the vaccination status of the positive individuals. Israel uses the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and one wonders if the circulation of the WPV1 is occurring in individuals with a history of 3 or more doses of IPV (see Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Pallansch MA, Chumakov KM, Halsey NA, Hovi T, Minor PD, Modlin JF, Patriarca PA, Sutter RW, Wright PF, Wassilak SG, Cochi SL, Kim JH, Thompson KM.

Data in WHO as of 10 Jul 2012 for 2012 data and 9 Jul 2013 for 2013 data.

- In the Horn of Africa, an outbreak of WPV1 is continuing, centred around Banadir, Somalia. The majority of cases associated with this outbreak developed paralysis before the start of the comprehensive emergency outbreak response activities.

- WPV3 continues to be at the lowest ever recorded levels. Globally, WPV3 has not been detected anywhere since November 2012, from Yobe state, Nigeria. In Asia, the strain has not been detected in over a year (since April 2012, from Khyber Agency in Pakistan). With the current historic low levels of WPV3, the world has a unique opportunity to rid itself of the 2nd strain of wild poliovirus (following the last case of WPV2 in 1999).

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Nangarhar).
- All 3 WPV cases this year [2013] were reported from Eastern Region, with links to both WPV1 in 2013 from neighbouring areas of Pakistan and WPV1 in 2012 from Afghanistan. In the high-risk Southern Region, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012.
- Particular focus will be on immunizing mobile populations and Afghan populations on both sides of the border.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).

Nigeria
-------
- A total of 9 new WPV cases were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2013 to 35. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [18 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Bauchi).
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [24 Nov 2012] (from Kebbi).

Pakistan
--------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 18. The most recent WPV case in the country had onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Bara in Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA).
- No new cVDVP2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 5. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [8 May 2013] (from Gadap town, greater Karachi, Sindh).
- FATA is the major WPV1 reservoir in Pakistan at the moment. Of 18 WPV1 cases reported in the country in 2013, more than half are from FATA. Bara in Khyber Agency is particularly affected. This outbreak is threatening progress achieved elsewhere in the country and in neighbouring Afghanistan.
- In 2011 and 2012, Bara was the epicentre of a major outbreak which also spread to other areas.

Central Africa: Chad and Cameroon
---------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac).
- However, one new cVDPV2 case was reported in the country, with onset of paralysis on [3 May 2013](from Kanem), bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 to 4.
- In Cameroon, no new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (onset of paralysis on [9 May 2013] from Extreme-Nord).

Horn of Africa
--------------
- A total of 4 new WPV cases were reported in the past week (all from Banadir, Somalia), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in the region to 52 (45 WPV1s from Somalia and 7 WPV1s from Kenya). The most recent case in the region had onset of paralysis on [8 Jun 2013] (from Banadir).
- Banadir remains the epicentre of the outbreak.
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa continues to be implemented. In Somalia, campaigns were held on [1-6 Jul 2013]. In Kenya, activities were conducted on [3-7 Jul 2013]. In Ethiopia on [5-8 Jul 2013], and in Yemen the next campaigns are planned for late August [2013].

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].

[Since the last update (data from 26 Jun 2013), the total number of cases has increased by 31 cases -- from 77 to 108, with 20 additional cases reported in Somalia, 9 cases in Nigeria (all identified in the preceding week), and one case each in Pakistan and Kenya.

Using the reports of cVDPV cases (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) in a country as an indicator of low vaccination coverages, the occurrence of these cases in Pakistan and Chad in recent months serves as a reminder that pockets of susceptibles still exist in these countries.
