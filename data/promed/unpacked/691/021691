Botswana belongs to the FAO's Pool 6 - Southern Africa, which includes 8 countries: Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The serotypes present are SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3; detection of O/EA-2 in southern/western Zambia (2018-2021), Namibia (2021) and Malawi (2022) represents a new incursion into Pool 6 (https://www.fao.org/3/cc0196en/cc0196en.pdf). - Mod.CRD
