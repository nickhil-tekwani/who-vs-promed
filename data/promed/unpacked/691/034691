Regarding the recent posting on Brucellosis in cattle in Texas, which
species of Brucella was involved?

One would assume it is _Brucella abortus_. But, actually, should we
assume that _B. abortus_ is the causative agent in this particular
case? Reference is made to the last case of bovine brucellosis
(presumably due to _B. abortus_) occurring more than 5 years ago (2003
posting in ProMED). Unfortunately, in the moderator's comments,
reference is not made to 2 other cases of brucellosis posted by ProMED
that occurred in Texas a decade or so ago and that are
epidemiologically relevant. One case was in goats (_Brucella
melitensis_ infection), and the other case was in a feral pig hunter
(the Brucella species is not mentioned).

My concern is that _B. melitensis_ infection in goats in 1999/2000
also took place in Starr county (with a likely origin across the
Mexican border). _B. melitensis_ infection in cattle has been
documented and is a major public health concern (Verger et al, 1989;
Samaha et al, 2008).

For the brucellosis case in the feral pig hunter posted in 2009, the
reader is referred to the Houston Chronicle, which reported Thursday
[17 Sep 2009] that about 10 percent of Texas feral hogs test positive
for brucellosis bacteria: presumably _B. suis_ biovar 1.

Again, should we make such an assumption? In the south of the USA,
populations of feral swine are heavily infected with _B. suis_ biovar
1 (Olsen and Tatum, 2010), and infections with _B. suis_ biovar 1 in
humans occur in people handling pigs, including the hunting of feral
swine. Texas and other southeastern states report numerous cases of
seropositive cattle, which are shown by bacterial culture to be
infected with _B. suis_ (Olsen and Tatum, 2010). However, it has
recently been shown in South Carolina that feral pigs were infected
with _B. abortus_ wildtype, S19 and RB51 vaccine strains besides _B.
suis_ biovar 1 (Stoffregen et al, 2007). I am wondering whether this
could be the case in feral pigs in Texas too.

[The case of bovine brucellosis in Texas was _B. abortus_. The
individual owning the animals sold some aged animals at a market, or
1st point of testing. This is where it was detected. The owner had not
sold any cattle for a long time, and, therefore, the disease in his
herd had likely been there for a long time. The original source of the
information is posted at
<http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/news/pr/2011/2011Feb_BrucellosisInStarrCounty.pdf>.

While this may not answer all of the epidemiology questions posed, it
does provide some indication of the trace in and trace outs of the
animals from that herd. - Mod.TG]
