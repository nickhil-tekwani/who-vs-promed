A 6-year-old mare in Gallatin County, Montana has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Montana Department of Livestock reported on 25 Mar 2013. Officials say this case is not related to an EHV-1 case in Flathead County, Montana reported late last week.

"We have another case of EHV-1, but let me stress that there is no connection to the earlier case," said Assistant State Veterinarian Tahnee Szymanski, DVM. "Fortunately, the Gallatin County case, like the Flathead case, appears to be an isolated event."

The affected mare arrived in Montana 3 weeks ago from southern California. The horse began showing clinical signs of disease last week; test results received Saturday [23 Mar 2013] morning confirmed presence of the virus. The horse is housed at a boarding and training facility, which is currently under quarantine, in Gallatin County. An encouraging sign, Syzmanski said, is that none of the other horses at the facility have shown any clinical signs of contracting the virus.

"The manager and trainers at the facility have been great to work with and are letting all of their clients know about the incident," Szymanski said. EHV-1 is naturally occurring in equine populations and can cause respiratory disease, abortion in mares, neonatal foal death, and/or neurologic disease. There are 2 types of the virus responsible for outbreaks in the United States: the neuropathogenic form and the wild type. The horse in Gallatin County, as well as the horse in Flathead County, appear to have been infected with the less virulent wild type.

A Santa Barbara County, California gelding has tested positive for non-neuropathogenic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported on 25 Mar 2013.

"A Welsh Cross gelding in Santa Barbara County displaying neurologic signs on 20 Mar 2013, has been confirmed positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1," the CDFA reported in a statement on their website. "This strain of virus is responsible for the more common respiratory EHV-1 cases. A small percentage of non-neuropathogenic EHV-1 infected horses can display neurologic signs and are classified as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy cases which are a reportable condition in California.

On 19 Mar 2013, the CDFA reported that a Warmblood stallion from San Diego County had also tested positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of the virus.

"CDFA's epidemiologic investigation indicates the Welsh Cross gelding and the Warmblood stallion both participated in the HITS (Horse Shows in the Sun) event in Thermal, California," the CDFA's statement continued. "The Welsh Cross gelding departed Permanent Barn 2 on 10 Mar 2013 and the Warmblood stallion departed Tent 29 on 15 Mar 2013. Both confirmed positive horses have been quarantined and are under veterinary care. Potentially exposed horses to EHV-1 are recommended to be isolated and temperatures monitored twice daily for 14 days post potential exposure date."

Equine herpesvirus-1 is highly contagious among horses and camelids and is generally spread via aerosol transmission (when infected animals sneeze and cough) and through contact with nasal secretions from infected animals. The disease can cause a variety of problems in horses, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

Fever, ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and incontinence are signs of EHM. If a horse that has possibly been exposed to EHV-1 begins to display any of the aforementioned signs, call your veterinarian immediately.

[Spring must surely be here. The horse shows have started, and so have the various migrations of horses and people to those shows. This artificial season has a tremendous amount of travel and socialization with other horses, presenting a stress to any horse's system. Horses tire of travel and stress associated with different locations, new smells, new acquaintances, and performances repeatedly. It is no surprise these horses are a medium for this contagious virus.

Protect your animal from your own pride. If the animal is not feeling well, then do not travel with your horse. Take the temperature at least twice a day, and chart it. Do not depend upon your memory, as your equine companion's life may depend upon your recognizing the earliest hint of this virus, and that is an increase in temperature.
