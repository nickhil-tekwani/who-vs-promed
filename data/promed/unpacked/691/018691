Correction
----------
The Moderator's statement appended to the preceding post (see
reference below) that: "Hepatitis A is an acute self-limiting
infection, whereas hepatitis B virus infection progresses to a
persistent infection and ultimately may result in serious liver
damage and hepatocellular carcinoma," may have given the impression
that all or most cases of hepatitis B progress to a persistent
infection. In fact only about 1-3 percent of hepatitis B infections
result in chronic disease following an acute infection in
immunocompetent adults. Significantly fewer will develop serious
damage during their lifetime and even fewer will succumb to HCC.

[My statement was intended to emphasize that Hepatitis A virus and
Hepatitis B virus are unrelated viruses responsible for different
disease processes, and that their juxtaposition in the same report
was not necessarily meaningful. I should have written "...may
progress...... etc.", rather than "...progresses.... etc." - Mod.CP]
