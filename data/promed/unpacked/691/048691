Health and wildlife officials were gearing up to eradicate the West Nile
virus in New York by spring, even before reports the virus had been found
in wintering mosquitoes and a dead hawk. Officials in the New York
metropolitan area have been surveying areas for mosquito breeding grounds,
identifying cases of wildlife infection and planning eradication programs.
They are working in tandem with the federal Centers for Disease Control,
and state health department and insect control personnel from other states.
Area hospitals also are on alert to contact health officials should they
identify any cases of West Nile encephalitis in humans.
New York is giving special attention to its mosquito problem because the
West Nile virus emerged in the area last year, killing seven people,
infecting 52 others and decimating wildlife, including hundreds of crows.
It was the first time the virus had been detected in the United States.
To prevent infected mosquitoes from biting humans and wildlife during the
mosquito season - which runs from April to October - the New York City
Department of Health has been surveying the [metropolitan area] to find
large areas of standing water, places where the insects breed. Within the
next month, officials expect to be applying larvicide to these sites, city
health department spokesman Erich Giebelhaus says. Since many mosquitoes
feed on birds, the health department will survey live birds, including
chickens, to help find the virus before it can spread to humans.
City officials will not be spraying insecticide unless there is a confirmed
case of West Nile in New York, Giebelhaus says. Last year, workers in
helicopters and trucks sprayed the city with malathion, hoping to wipe out
the infected insects. Giebelhaus could not provide an estimate of the
number of breeding grounds that would be targeted for larvicide but said
the health department is also asking the public to look and clean up
stagnant water sites.
Christine Musa, spokeswoman for the American Mosquito Control Association,
says neighboring states also have programs in place for getting rid of
mosquitoes. And with spring around the corner, New Yorkers are being
advised to wear long sleeves, apply insecticides, and avoid areas of
standing water during the coming months.
While many people outside the metropolitan area may not be concerned about
West Nile virus, mosquito control officials suggest they should be. Many
migratory birds have been identified as carrying the [virus]. "Whether they
are capable or will indeed spread the virus outside the metropolitan area
remains to be seen," Musa says. "There are a lot of questions about the
West Nile virus."
Rhode Island has been stockpiling larvicide in case West Nile-carrying
insects appear in the state this summer.

[I think the use of "eradicate" is a little overblown but we included the
word in the title anyway. I guess bird watching in the Jamaica Bay marshes
is out for a while. Does anyone else have the impression that everyone
seems to have a different opinion, a different view, and a different
statement about West Nile virus these days? I sense political influences.
