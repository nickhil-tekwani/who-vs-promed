A plethora of viruses as well as insect vectors and pests pose an emerging threat to the tomato belt; it is a wake-up call to stakeholders to adopt good agricultural practices. Currently, the tomato virus is wreaking havoc in districts of Maharashtra. Tomatoes have turned into yellow, spongy, plastic-textured fruits.

Last year [2020; ProMED post 20200528.7388319], farmers complained of early ripening and substantial yield loss. Samples from Satara and Ahmednagar [districts] were found to be infected with _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV), _Groundnut bud necrosis virus_ (GBNV), and _Tomato chlorosis virus_. Samples from Pune [contained] CMV, GBNV, _Tomato mosaic virus_, _Pepper mottle virus_, and _Potato virus Y_ [PVY]. This year [2021], viruses detected were CMV, GBNC, _Capsicum chlorosis virus_, _Potato Virus X_, PVY, and [additional members of] the potyvirus group. _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ [also] poses a serious threat in India. As of now, we are not sure of its presence.

"One factor for the extensive spread [of the viruses] could be a change in climate and cultivation time," the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research said. Increasing international trade in seeds and fruits has enhanced the risks manifold. International trade and travel have compounded the problem [with] sap-sucking insects [that] spread many crop viruses, with new strains emerging. Seeds from reputed sources must be procured. Multiple virus invasions make [it] more difficult to get resistant/tolerant stock.

[The viruses identified above and their main routes of transmission are:
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV; _Cucumovirus_) -- more than 60 species of aphids;
_Groundnut bud necrosis virus_ (GBNV; _Tospovirus_) -- thrips;
_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; _Begomovirus_) -- whiteflies;
_Tobacco vein distorting virus_ (TVDV; _Polerovirus_) -- aphids;
_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; _Crinivirus_) -- whiteflies;
_Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV; _Tobamovirus_) -- seed, mechanical means;
_Potato virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) -- aphids;
_Pepper mottle virus_ (PepMV; _Potyvirus_) & members of the potyvirus group -- like PVY;
_Capsicum chlorosis virus_ (CaCV; _Orthotospovirus_) -- thrips;
_Potato Virus X_ (PVX; type member of _Potexvirus_) -- mechanical means;
_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV; _Tobamovirus_) -- seed, pollinator insects.
For more information on the viruses see links below and previous ProMED posts in the archives.

It is not clear whether multiple viruses were found in single samples or specific fields, or whether different viruses were present in different plants. In the scenario described, however, co-infections in at least some of the plants appear likely. Multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement of disease). If additional infections occur over a number of crop cycles, the virus population will gradually build up, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of infectious units per virus species. This invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time (see ProMEDpost 20170109.4750640). A similar situation may have developed for tomato planting stock. Regular monitoring of virus populations, as may have commenced in Maharashtra, is an important first step for developing management programmes for farmers.

Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens (for example, ProMED post 20140122.2222560). Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial and certification programmes for the crop would be needed to address the problems above.
