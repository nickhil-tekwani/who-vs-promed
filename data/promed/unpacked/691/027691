The number of European animal holdings found infected by the Schmallenberg-virus (SBV) has already reached 2948. Among the 8 countries known to be infected (Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, UK, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain), the most severely affected is Germany (1120 farms), followed by France with 1048 infected farms.

The number of holdings reporting the occurrence of misformed calves and lambs probably due to SBV is increasing in the Netherlands, particularly in cattle holdings, since the occurrence in sheep has already peaked. As of Monday [2 Apr 2012], there have been 961 complaints from concerned cattle holders, 23 added since last Friday [30 Mar 2012]. The virus has been recorded in 124 calves as well as in 106 sheep and 5 goats.

Today [Mon 2 Apr 2012], the EC will hold a scientific seminar addressing the effect of SBV. The seminar will be attended by experts from various EU-member countries as well as interested parties from 3rd countries.

[2] Human sera, PCR, Germany - no evidence of human infection
Date: Mon 2 Apr 2012

To determine whether Schmallenberg virus [SBV] not only infects ruminants but also humans, the Robert Koch Institute has developed laboratory tests and conducted a study with sheep farmers. "The results of the study show that this new virus hasn't led to infection in people in contact with large amounts of the virus," Reinhard Burger, president of the Robert Koch Institute, says. The Robert Koch Institute is the national public health institute in Germany. "With regard to the identification of new health risks, the RKI plays a central role in the sense of an early warning system," Burger emphasized.

Scientists of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute / Federal Research Institute for Animal Health [FLI] have detected SBV in cattle, sheep and goats since November 2011 and provisionally named the virus after the place of origin of the 1st sample (the village of Schmallenberg). SBV (which belongs to the group of Orthobunyaviruses) is transmitted by certain mosquitoes [midges]. Since then, the number of farms affected has, according to FLI, risen to about 1000; more than 800 of them are sheep farms. The infection of the animals at a particular stage of pregnancy can cause serious defects of the foetus.

So far, there has been no indication that infections or disease in humans from contact with SBV could occur. The closely related viruses of SBV (3 representatives of the Simbu serogroup) don't infect humans. But SBV has new genetic and animal-related clinical and epidemiological characteristics. More distantly related viruses of SBV (including 2 representatives of the Simbu serogroup) can also cause disease in humans.

The RKI has, therefore, as a precautionary measure, conducted a survey of sheep farmers, as they have the most intensive contact with the new virus. On 29 Feb 2012, scientists from the RKI attended a meeting of 60 cattle and sheep farmers in North Rhine-Westphalia and took blood samples for laboratory testing [see item 4 in archived post 20120306.1062871].

A questionnaire revealed no information that would have raised the suspicion that contact with infected animals could result in disease symptoms. The scientists of the RKI detected no antibodies against SBV in the blood samples collected. Antibodies would have shown an infection with the virus. In examined blood samples of some animal owners with non-specific symptoms such as fever or headache, a so-called PCR test that can detect the virus gave negative results.

A relatively high number of humans with intensive contact with the pathogen has been investigated in this study. Extremely rare infection events, however, cannot be detected by such a study. Based on the study results and the genetic characteristics of the new virus, the risk of infection in humans can be assessed as extremely low.

[This piece of news is indeed a relief, for which RKI scientists deserve to be commended. It may be assumed that human sera from SBV-contact persons will also undergo serological tests when the test becomes available.

ProMED-mail would like to thank Prof. Christian Griot for submitting the same press release. - Mod.AS

Luxembourg confirmed 5 new cases of SBV livestock virus, all on cattle farms, lifting the number of sheep and cattle holdings where the disease was found in the country to 12, the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health, or OIE, wrote in an alert on its website today [2 Apr 2012].

The virus, named after the German town where it was 1st identified in November [2011], causes stillbirths and deformed offspring in sheep and cattle.

[4] EFSA updated statement
Date: Mon 2 Apr 2012
Source: EFSA press release [edited]
http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/120402.htm


The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has today [2 Apr 2012] published its 2nd report on the Schmallenberg virus (SBV). The virus that to date has been identified in 8 EU Member States can affect domestic and wild ruminants, leading, in some cases, to severe birth defects. Although uncertainties and gaps in data remain, today's report importantly shows that when based on worst case scenario assumptions, the number of infected ruminants is low compared to the total number of these animals in each Member State.

Strong cooperation from Member States is reflected in the calibre of data collected according to guidance provided by EFSA, which was published last month [March 2012] in response to an urgent request from the European Commission. The data collected by Member States have allowed the Authority to analyse the current geographical distribution and impact of the disease in the European Union.

Some caution nevertheless should be exerted when interpreting the data, as underreporting or lack of diagnostic confirmation may affect the picture that we have today of the prevalence of the disease. Although all Member States have submitted detailed information about confirmed cases, only 2 also reported on suspected cases [see comment in item 4]. Data recommendations stated in this report will be used to refine further data collection. To ensure that an -- as accurate as possible -- evolution of SBV is known, EFSA will publish periodical reports on the status and analysis of the data collected. Furthermore, EFSA will assess the overall impact of SBV infection on animal health, animal production, and animal welfare together with a characterisation of the pathogen by 31 May 2012.

The results of EFSA's report are being shared at a scientific seminar held in Brussels today [2 Apr 2012] organised by the European Commission's Health and Consumers Directorate General (DG SANCO), which aims to present the current state of play on the latest scientific information on SBV and the risk management approach taken by the EU.

There is currently no evidence that the Schmallenberg virus can cause illness in humans.

[5] EFSA analysis of available epidemiological data
Date: Mon 2 Apr 2012
Source: EFSA Supporting Publications 2012:EN-261 (Question number: EFSA-Q-2012-00231); summary [edited]
http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/261e.htm


Following a request from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a technical report in February 2012 on likely epidemiological scenarios in Europe in relation to a recently detected virus, provisionally named "Schmallenberg" virus (SBV) (Simbu serogroup, Bunyaviridae family, genus Orthobunyavirus), found in ruminants. The report also included guidance on data to be collected in Member States, including harmonised case definitions and reporting guidelines for a minimum dataset at the herd/flock level and an extended dataset at the animal level. Data from affected Member States from 1 Aug 2011 to 19 Mar 2012 (or date of transmission) were analysed. This report presents the analysis of the submitted data.

All Member States have reported the number of confirmed herds following viral detection by PCR or serological confirmation. In addition, France and Italy have also reported the number of suspect herds [The Dutch reports also include numbers of complaining holdings; see also item 1 above and the Dutch data at http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201855. - Mod.AS]. The number of confirmed cases by PCR can constitute an underestimation of the number of infected herds, in particular for calves. The number of confirmed acute cases in adult cattle with viral detection by PCR is limited to 8 cases in Germany, most likely corresponding to infection during the period of viral circulation in summer/autumn 2011.

Regarding temporal distribution of confirmed herds, an increase in the number of confirmed herds has been observed up to the 9th week of the year 2012, followed by a steep decrease in the weeks 10 and 11. However, the latter should be interpreted with caution, given that the last reporting week might be incomplete. The observed pattern of case detection per species is in accordance with the hypothesis that infection may have occurred during a certain period of the gestation.

Maps representing the special distribution of cases are available.

For the purpose of this report, impact of the infection was defined as mortality and morbidity in the affected animal populations, estimated based on the proportion of cases in the populations. The total number of animals and herds of sheep, goats and cattle were compared with the numbers of animals in the confirmed herds, and the number of confirmed herds. For all affected countries, the number of affected animals/herds is low in comparison with the total number of animals/herds. This figure should be interpreted cautiously since under-reporting or lack of diagnostic confirmation may affect the ratio. In order to estimate the disease impact, information was requested on the number of pregnant animals, arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome (AHS) cases, abortions, live births, stillbirths, and cases of dystocia per herd during the reporting period. Unfortunately, most of the countries have not reported this data or provided information on more than one AHS case per herd yet.

Recommendations to improve data for further evaluation of the impact and magnitude of disease spread were provided.

1. OIE Technical Factsheet on Schmallenberg virus;
2. Recommendations endorsed by the OIE Scientific Commission on 16 Feb 2012.

The most recent SBV follow-up reports to the OIE were submitted on 2 Apr 2012 by Germany (follow-up report No. 10) and Luxembourg (follow-up report No. 3; see also item 3 above). On 30 Mar 2012, follow-up reports were submitted by the Netherlands (No. 10) and UK (No. 9). France's last follow-up report (No. 2) was submitted on 23 Mar 2012. No reports from other affected countries are available after 13 Mar 2012. All OIE reports, with interactive maps, can be accessed at the WAHID interface - Weekly Disease Information at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=weekly_report_index&admin=0.

An economic assessment of the loses caused by SBV during 2011-2012 and their comparison to losses caused by BTV8 during its 1st year in Europe will possibly become feasible after the termination of the current wave of AHS cases in large and small ruminants. - Mod.AS]
