Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) can easily be prevented by just
washing your hands, and doctors [in Fort Smith , Arkansas] said
they've been seeing more cases this season. "It's easily spread in
younger children, preschool children, school-aged children, and in day
cares. We're seeing an increase in the area currently," Ranata
Hatcher, a pediatric nurse practitioner, said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the illness
usually starts after a fever, then rashes can appear on arms and legs,
even ulcers can appear in your child's mouth, causing him or her pain
when eating or drinking foods. Hatcher said, "It's spread through
saliva, eating, and drinking after each other. That's why it's so
prevalent in preschools and day cares."

And preventing it is as easy as cleaning toys with bleach and washing
your hands. "We recommend you rub your hands together, cleaning under
your fingernails, between your fingers, backs of the hands. If you
teach them the ABC's while they're washing their hands, that's about
the time frame you need to efficiently kill all the germs," Hatcher
said.

Parents shouldn't be afraid; the disease has nothing to do with
animals. "HFMD is specific to humans. Foot-and-mouth disease is
something that you see in animals, you cannot catch hand-foot-mouth
disease from an animal," Hatcher said.

Hatcher said not being clean is the no. 1 cause for the spread of
hand- foot-mouth disease. If your child is showing signs of
dehydration, a symptom of the illness, you might want to call your
doctor.

[HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_.
This genus of viruses includes the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses,
echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most
common cause of HFMD in the United States in recent years, but other
coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Other
enteroviruses, such as enterovirus 71, have also been associated with
outbreaks of HFMD, principally in Asia.

Individual cases and outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide. In temperate
climates cases occur more often in summer and early autumn. HFMD
caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection is generally a mild disease,
with nearly all patients recovering in 7 to 10 days without medical
treatment. Since 1997, however, outbreaks of HFMD caused by
enterovirus 71 have been reported in Asia and Australia. HFMD caused
by enterovirus 71 has shown a higher incidence of neurologic
involvement and fatal cases of encephalitis have occurred during
outbreaks. However, such serious outcomes are still very rare.

HFMD infection is spread from person to person by direct contact.
Infectious virus is found in the nose and throat secretions, saliva,
blister fluid and stool of infected persons. The virus is most often
spread by persons with unwashed, virus-contaminated hands and by
contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are most
contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but may remain a source
of infection for others after symptoms have resolved.

Complications from virus infections that cause HFMD are uncommon;
"aseptic" meningitis can occur rarely with HFMD causing fever,
headache, stiff neck, or back pain. Some patients may require
hospitalization for a short time. Other more serious conditions, such
as encephalitis, are very rare although encephalitis can be fatal.
There have been reports of fingernail and toenail loss occurring
mostly in children within 4 weeks of having HFMD (see: ProMED-mail
postings Onychomadesis, coxsackievirus - USA: (MI), RFI 20080729.2317;
Onychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus 20080709.2099; and
Onychomadesis - Spain: (Valencia), coxsackievirus (02) 20080711.2120).
At this time, it is not known whether the reported nail loss is or is
not a result of the infection. However, nail loss has been temporary
and nail growth has resumed without medical treatment.

Further information about HFMD can be obtained from the CDC website
at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm.

It is difficult to assess the seriousness of the outbreak of HFMD at
Fort Smith in the absence of information on the number of children
(and adults) affected and without identification of the causative
agent. - Mod.CP]
