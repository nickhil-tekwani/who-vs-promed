A man in hospital in Saskatchewan has tested negative for Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers, a World Health Organization spokesman says.

On Monday [24 Mar 2014], provincial health officials said a man who had recently travelled in West Africa was in critical condition in hospital in Saskatoon. They said the patient had visited Liberia and was being examined for a suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever. However, a WHO official said Tuesday [25 Mar 2014] on his Twitter account that hemorrhagic fevers have been ruled out. Gregory Hartl, WHO's head of public relations, said Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and 2 other diseases have been ruled out. He said testing continues, but the patient may have malaria.

The Public Health Agency of Canada said Winnipeg lab tests confirmed the man does not have Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, or Crimean-Congo virus. Testing continues to identify the illness, but the risk to Canadians is very low, the agency said.

Canadian officials investigating a man suspected of having contracted Ebola during a visit to West Africa say it has been determined that he does not have the virus.

Cailin Rodgers, a spokeswoman for Canada's health minister, said on Tuesday [25 Mar 2014] that lab testing confirmed the individual hospitalized with symptoms of a hemorrhagic fever does not have Ebola. She says there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Canada.

The man remains seriously ill and is being kept in isolation in a Saskatchewan hospital.

[The media reports that the viral hemorrhagic fevers have been ruled out as the cause of this patent's serious illness. A possible diagnosis postulated in the media reports is malaria, albeit very few details on the actual clinical picture are provided. We would appreciate receiving more information on the clinical presentation and the actual diagnosis of illness of this patient. - Mod.MPP
