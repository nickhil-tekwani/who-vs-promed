Kilimanjaro regional commissioner, Anna Mghwira, yesterday [27 Feb 2019] confirmed that 2 people died and 8 others had been hospitalised following an anthrax outbreak in Moshi district. Addressing reporters [in Moshi] RC Mghwira said 8 people are receiving treatment in 2 different hospitals, whereby 5 were admitted at Kilema Mission Hospital in the district and 3 others were referred to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi municipality. She said that the victims are believed to have eaten the meat of cow which died of anthrax.

According to Mghwira, so, far 97 people in 3 districts have been vaccinated against the anthrax -- a rare but deadly bacterial disease. The regional commissioner said that the affected districts include Moshi, Rombo, and Siha.

Kilimanjaro regional medical officer Best Magoma, described the anthrax outbreak, as a highly infectious, fatal bacterial disease of mammals, especially cattle and sheep. When transmitted to humans it causes skin ulcers or a form of pneumonia. He cautioned the public to be extra careful when buying and consuming meat following the outbreak of anthrax in the region and other parts of the country.

On [25 Feb 2019] acting general manager, Tanzania's National Ranching Company Limited (NARCO) Philemon Wambura, warned meat consumers to get the product from authorized market places.

The local media was in the past weeks narrating an outbreak of the disease that killed 5 people and 21 cattle in Rombo district, Kilimanjaro region. Last month [January 2019], anthrax killed 4 people in south western Tanzania's district of Momba, Songwe region. In September 2017, an outbreak of the disease killed at least 42 hippos in Ruaha National Park.

[Moshi Urban is one of the 7 districts of the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. The regional capital of Moshi is located in the Moshi Urban district. The district is bordered to the north by the Moshi Rural district, to the east by the Mwanga district, and to the south and west by the Manyara region. It is to the immediate west of Songwe (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshi_District). The municipality is in the Kilimanjaro region and is situated on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano that is the highest mountain in Africa. The municipality covers about 59 square kilometres (23 sq mi) and is the smallest municipality in Tanzania by area (see with maps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshi,_Tanzania).

It is unusual to see reports of humans being vaccinated against anthrax as a public health measure. It should not be ineffective but a more cost effective strategy is to vaccinate your livestock, cattle especially, to prevent them coming down with the disease in the 1st place. This is a part of Tanzania with a serious on-going risk of livestock anthrax outbreaks and so it should be subject to a strict regional control and surveillance programme. - Mod.MHJ
