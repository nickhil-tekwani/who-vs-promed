Orange County, Florida, animal-control department has euthanized
a number of dogs and halted a busy adoption program.
The shelter's adoption program has been stopped so that nobody
takes home an infected dog. The county adopts as many as 40
dogs a week.
Orange County Animal Services discovered several dogs sick with
the parvovirus 10 days ago. The disease, highly infectious and
often fatal if untreated, in dogs only, attacks their intestines,
causing severe vomiting and diarrhea.
"If it's not treated immediately, it's pretty much fatal," Linda Haller,
director of Orange County Animal Services said. "A dog may be
feeling fine when we get it and then, boom, they're down like
nobody's business." [Some virulent strains are rapidly fatal.
Last week, Osceola County Animal Services euthanized 2 dogs
found sick with parvo. Seminole County shelter managers have had
no reported cases.
County Animal Services programs don't even try to save dogs, and
focus instead on isolating and euthanizing dogs that are sick or
have been in contact with sick dogs.
Warding off the disease can cost as little as $10 for a parvo
vaccination. Unlike rabies shots, annual parvo vaccinations are not
mandatory.

[Although a common disease, outbreaks of parvovirus in areas that
have not seen it for a while are important. Also, many people think
that mature dogs are resistant.
Parvovirus is very stable in the environment, able to withstand wide
pH ranges and high temperatures. It is resistant to a number of
common disinfectants and may survive for several months in
contaminated areas. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with
infected dogs. Indirect transmission, by fecal-contaminated
objects, is also an important source of infection. It can be carried
from pen to pen on someone's shoes. The virus is shed in the
feces of infected dogs for up to 3 weeks after infection. Recovered
dogs may serve as carriers and shed the virus periodically.
There is no specific therapy to eliminate the virus. Most dogs
recover with appropriate supportive care directed at restoration of
fluid and electrolyte balance. Because intravenous therapy is often
required, most shelter operators believe it is too costly to treat a
pet and therefore euthanize it, hoping to stop the spread of the
virus.
The virus is believed to most often attack the young animals
(puppies) however, various strain mutations, some particularly
virulent, often attack adult dogs and can be just as deadly. The
virus is easily preventable with a vaccine. The vaccine is generally
good for one year, but pets of all ages need the vaccine yearly.
Just because a dog is mature does not mean that it is capable of
resisting the disease without the vaccine - Mod.TG
