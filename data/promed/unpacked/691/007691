MYSTERY DISEASE - HAWAII (4)

Sir:
In response to the RFI from Dr. Hass in Hawaii, there is an excellent
review of the "Emergence of the Ehrlichioses as Human Health Problems"
in Vol. 2, No. 1, Jan. - March of the journal "Emerging Infectious
Diseases". This journal is available electronically at the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) at http://www.cdc.gov/. In the article the
author states that both E. chafeensis, cause of Human Monocytic
Ehrlichiosis, and the E. equi-like agent responsible for Human
Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis are carried in dogs. It is also stated that
Rhipicephalus sanguineus is the major vector of E. canis in dogs.
Ehrlichiosis in humans certainly does produce flu-like illness (or worse)
and is certainly responsive to tetracyclines. It sounds like it might be
worth some follow up serology in those patients.
Cheers,
Bruce L. Akey, M.S., D.V.M.

RE: Tick Borne Diseases Zoonotically Transferred(?)
In 1978 a cluster of Q-Fever caused by Coxiella burnetti was seen in a
group of employees of an exotic bird and reptile importing company in
New York State. These employees were involved in the handling and
removal of ticks from an infested shipment of Ball Pythons (P. regius)
from Ghana. Three types of ticks were identified including
Amblyomma nuttalli, the usual vector of Q-Fever. It was determined
that the employees became ill as a result of either inhaling infected
tick excreta and/or snake excreta (since the pythons were also infected).
