Virus threatens native parrots
-------------
A lethal disease that threatens native parrots may have found its way to
New Zealand through bird smuggling. The disease, psittacine pox, was
discovered in an Auckland aviary among rosellas that were being examined by
a veterinarian.
Auckland Zoo wildlife disease expert Richard Jakob-Hoff said smuggling was
one way the virus could have got to New Zealand.
"We don't know how it got here and we're not saying the birds that carried
the disease were smuggled, but we know the bird smuggling industry is a
major one and lucrative," Mr Jakob-Hoff said.
He is investigating the possible transfer of psittacine pox to native
parrots such as kaka, kakariki, kea, and kakapo on behalf of
the Department of Conservation.
Most of those species are tucked away on predator-free islands; kaka on
Little Barrier Island, kakariki on Tiritiri Matangi Island and kakapo on
remote Codfish Island, off the southern end of the South Island.
But the virus could travel swiftly through a previously unexposed parrot
population.
Kea could be at risk because they live in mainland alpine areas, and some
kaka are still found in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland.
Mr Jakob-Hoff said psittacine pox was just one of the wildlife health
problems discovered over the past 2 years and the zoo was struggling under
the demand for its services.
"The demand for our veterinary services from DoC, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry and overseas just keeps on growing."
A major part of the zoo's work is running health checks on dozens of kiwi
chicks raised in captivity before they are released into the wild. That
work turned up a previously unknown blood parasite that could have a big
effect on the health of kiwi chicks 18 months ago.
"That one came as a bit of a surprise," said Mr Jakob-Hoff. "Just by
looking we have found quite a lot of things that were previously unknown in
wildlife."

[Pox is a disease caused by poxviruses. There are many strains of
poxviruses that affect birds (avian poxviruses), and probably all birds are
susceptible to pox. Strains of poxviruses cause disease in specific types
of birds, for instance fowl pox in poultry and psittacine pox in parrots,
budgies, and other psittacines. Specific strains of psittacine poxvirus
will affect different species of psittacines in different ways. Strain
characteristics are determined either naturally or experimentally on the
basis of the effects in different species or families of birds. Psittacine
poxvirus does not infect humans.
There is a risk the virus will become established in the country as a
result of contact between infected captive birds and wild birds via biting
insects, or direct contact within the introduced wild parrot population.
The potential consequences for indigenous psittacines is of great concern;
their susceptibility to the strain that infected the rosellas is not known.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF)
(<http://202.78.129.207/biosecurity/pests-diseases/animals/psittacine-pox/index.htm>)
says the disease could have severe adverse consequences on the critically
endangered kakapo, as well as affecting populations of indigenous parrots
such as the kaka, kea, and kakariki. The most likely scenario is a high
mortality rate when psittacine poxvirus is introduced into a susceptible
population that has not previously been exposed. Extracted in part from the
