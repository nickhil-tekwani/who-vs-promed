Japan, where I'm currently travelling - Mod.JW

HONG KONG's first human case [caused by bacteria that killed more than a
dozen Japanese people last year has been found in a four-year-old boy.
The boy, who was infected with _E.coli 0157:H7_ while on holiday in
Britain, is in stable condition in the Adventist Hospital, health chiefs
said last night. He is believed to have contracted the bacteria by drinking
unpasteurised milk on a visit to a farm.
[_E.coli 0157:H7_ is one of the strains also known as EHEC, for
entero-hemorrhagic _E.coli_, because of its effects - Mod JW
The bacteria, most commonly contracted by eating under-cooked minced beef,
caused a major health scare in Japan in 1996 and 1997 when 10,000 people,
mostly schoolchildren, were infected and 13 died.
The Hong Kong case brought renewed warnings about food hygiene yesterday,
although the Health Department said it was "a very isolated case." The
department has classified the infection as "imported" as the boy was abroad
during the incubation period.
He developed diarrhoea on the plane home last Tuesday. _E.coli_ bacteria
are common in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals, and not all are
dangerous.
The 0157:H7 can also be passed from human to human through faecal
contamination. Symptoms include stomach cramps, bloody diarrhoea, fever and
chills. In severe cases, usually in young people, the infection can cause
blood vessel damage, kidney failure and death.
Last year, government checks on beef yielded only two finds of the
bacteria. One was detected in beef traced to a private abattoir in Yuen
Long. This led to about 380 kilograms of beef being withdrawn from markets.
A health department spokesman said there had never been a human case of
0157:H7 in Hong Kong before, probably because people here, unlike Japanese
and Westerners, like their food well cooked. This strain of bacteria can be
killed by cooking at a temperature of around 75 degrees Celsius for two to
three minutes.
The department said all milk on sale in Hong Kong was pasteurised and safe
for consumption.
Dr Lo Wing-lok, vice-president of the Medical Association said
contamination could be avoided by simply being hygienic. "Good basic
personal hygiene, like washing the hands with water and soap" is one of the
best ways to guard against the bacteria, he said.
Although untreated milk is not found in Hong Kong, Dr Lo warned against
drinking it where it is available. Such milk could also include diseases
like listeriosis, salmonellosis, brucellosis and _Staphylococcus aureus_
[infection. _Listeria_ caused a scare last year when it was found in
Dreyer's ice cream.
