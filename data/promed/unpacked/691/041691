A study performed by the European Center for Disease Control
confirmed that a quarter of the cases of tularemia detected during
the outbreak that affected 5 provinces, between June and December
2007, was caused by direct contact with rodents. The report places
the 2007 outbreak as the greatest during the last decade in Castilla and Leon.

Data from the European institution roughly coincide with the latest
studies elaborated by the Board, and they calculated that the number
of affected persons is 507, 3 times more compared to the figure
reported by the Regional Authority in Leon, Palencia, Burgos,
Valladolid, and Zamora provinces. This figure was outnumbered in
1997, with 534 cases treated, while some outbreaks were much less
prominent, such as 2004 when 13 cases were reported.

Features of patients infected with _Francisella tularensis_, the
causative agent of tularemia, include being male (80.1 percent),
between 41 and 70 years of age. The great majority of affected
persons lived in rural areas or had frequent contact with this
environment. The study points out that 34.9 percent of infected
persons were farmers or field-related workers, or people who enjoyed
natural environments who "frequently took long walks" in these areas.
All of these persons acquired the disease by dust inhaling during
agricultural activities or the like.

With respect to the "live foci" in this outbreak, the reservoir is
the vole (_Microtus duodecimcostatus_), which in 2007 severely
affected most fields in the region. 24.3 percent of infections were
caused by the rodents, while domestic animals, particularly dogs and
cats, caused 19.7 percent of infections and water crabs were
associated with 13.2 percent. The remaining cases were caused by
mosquito bites (10.9 percent), contact with other animals (9.5
percent), using non-potable water (8.1 percent), hare manipulation
(6.5 percent), manipulating straw and alfalfa (4.9 percent), and a
minimal percentage (0.2 percent) was attributed to eating raw meat.

The initial cases occurred during 1st half of May 2007 and they
reached a maximum between 18 Jun 2008 and 22 Oct 2008, when 90
percent of the infections were concentrated.

Patients had a mean incubation time for the infection between 1 to 14
days, and they took between 3 and 6 weeks to recover. They had the
following clinical symptoms: typhoidal form (59 percent),
ulceroglandular (14.6 percent), glandular (12.6 percent) and
pneumonic (7.9 percent).
