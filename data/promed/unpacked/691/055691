North Darfur:
------------
A reported 34 people in North Darfur's El Sareif locality have died from acute jaundice syndrome from January 2013 to date. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sent essential medical supplies to the affected areas.

According to the North Darfur State Ministry of Health, 2572 cases have been reported, with 34 deaths, in El Sareif locality from January 2013 to date. The most affected areas are the villages of Abuseniena and Umjamina, where displaced people have settled. Most of these people were displaced from the Jebel Amir area following conflict between the Rizeigat and Beni Hussein tribes in January 2013, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its Humanitarian Bulletin of 3-9 Feb 2014.

In response to the outbreak, the WHO sent essential medical supplies for 59 000 people in the area. Furthermore, WHO conducted trainings for health workers on outbreak investigation, response, and case management. In addition, an estimated 1900 people received health education sessions, and cleaning campaigns, water testing, and water chlorination activities took place. Finally, WHO provided financial support to cover the running costs of the area's health facilities.

South Darfur:
----------
In South Darfur, the international NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-B) reported on 5 Feb 2014 that since January 2014, 51 suspected cases of acute jaundice syndrome had been registered in El Sareif camp for the displaced in Nyala locality. Eight cases were confirmed, while 6 cases were diagnosed as hepatitis E.

Two more cases of acute jaundice syndrome were reported from Kalma camp, Nyala locality by the international organisation Merlin. The national organisation Patients Helping Fund-Sudan also reported a further case of acute jaundice syndrome in El Dereig camp, Nyala locality. The State Ministry of Health has requested all health partners working in the camps for the displaced to intensify efforts in identifying and reporting cases of acute jaundice syndrome.

[Hepatitis E has been a significant issue in Darfur. The following is from the WHO regarding the disease http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/:

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus.

Transmission:
The hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route due to faecal contamination of drinking water. Other transmission routes have been identified, which include:

- Foodborne transmission from ingestion of products derived from infected animals;
- Transfusion of infected blood products;
- Vertical transmission from a pregnant woman to her fetus.

Although humans are considered the natural host for the hepatitis E virus, antibodies to the hepatitis E virus or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species.

Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks. The ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has also been identified as the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas.

The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation in large areas of the world and shedding of the hepatitis E virus in faeces.
