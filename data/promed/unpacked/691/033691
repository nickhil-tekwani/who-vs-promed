The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Zimbabwe government have said
that a measles outbreak first announced last September [2009] has now
spread to 48 districts in the country, in a country where the public health
system remains fragile after years of economic recession and political turmoil.

According to the joint report by WHO and Zimbabwe's Health Ministry
released on Wednesday [14 Apr 2010], so far more than 200 people have died,
with most of the cases among members of religious groups that shunned
conventional medical treatment.

"The number of districts with suspected measles outbreaks has risen by 9 to
48 districts," the report said, adding that "3285 suspected cases and 200
deaths, of which 192 were community deaths, were reported since the start
of the outbreak in September 2009."

United Nations agencies and the Zimbabwe government in March [2010]
appealed for more than USD 8 million to combat the measles outbreak they
said had "reached crisis proportions" and was spinning out of control.

Zimbabwe's health system was once one of the best in Africa but collapsed
as a severe recession over the past decade meant the government was unable
to build new hospitals or maintain existing ones, while poor salaries drove
the best trained doctors and nurses abroad where pay and working conditions
are better.

The measles outbreak comes barely 12 months after a cholera epidemic --
described by WHO as the worst in Africa in more than 15 years -- claimed
close to 5000 lives, as bankrupt local authorities failed to supply clean
drinking water to residents or provide garbage collection services. The
cholera epidemic was only brought under control after international aid
agencies moved in with water treatment chemicals as well as medicines and
health support staff to treat the disease.

Zimbabwe's power-sharing government between President Robert Mugabe and
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has promised to rebuild the economy and
restore basic services such as water supplies, health and education. But
the administration has found it hard to undertake any meaningful
reconstruction work after failing to get financial support from rich
western nations, which insist they want to see more political reforms
before they loosen the purse strings.

[The previous report from Zimbabwe, dated 1 Mar 2010, indicated that the
measles outbreak then affected 28 of the 62 administrative districts of
Zimbabwe. At that time, it was estimated that there were about 1200 cases
and 90 deaths. Six weeks later, the number of affected districts has
increased to 48, and the numbers of cases and fatalities are now estimated
as 3285 and 200, respectively.

Little progress appears to have been made in containment of the outbreak,
and it seems unlikely that the problem can be attributed solely to
"religious groups that shunned conventional medical treatment".
