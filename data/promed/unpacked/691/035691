The Catanduva city government this Thursday [30 Aug 2012] confirmed that they await the reports concerning the deaths of 2 primates in the Municipal Zoo. Yellow fever [virus infection] is suspected. This situation is such that the Secretariat of Health brought the population together for a vaccination campaign and will go to the area near the zoo to investigate. To take action, the health units will remain open at night.

Yellow fever [YF] is an acute infectious disease of short duration, caused by a flavivirus. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_, without person-to-person [direct] transmission. There are no drugs to combat the virus [infection]. Depending on the seriousness [of the infection], the person has fever, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, icterus (yellowing of the eyes and skin) and hemorrhages (gums, nose, stomach, intestines and urine).

Teams from the municipal Secretariat of Health (SMS) will orient the populace adjacent to the local where the monkeys died, evaluate the vaccination situation of the residents and eliminate _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites, the main vector of yellow fever [virus]. The vaccines having been delayed, the patients will be sent to health units. In the case of bedridden patients, the vaccine will be applied at their homes.

According to the SMS, immunization is preventive and technical orientation will be provided by the state Secretariat of Health and the Ministry of Health. The 2 monkeys also were submitted for tests for lesions and mandatory notification. The samples that were collected were sent to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz and the results will be announced in 30 days [why so slow, considering the seriousness should yellow fever be confirmed? - Mod.TY].

[Yellow fever] immunization is applied to everyone ages 9 months and above, with revaccination every 10 years. The vaccine can be obtained in health units where the registration of application of the last dose can be verified.

According to the Secretariat of Health, the municipality has vaccine coverage of 69.6 per cent [of the population] against the disease, leaving a total of 34 469 people to be vaccinated.

[If the death of the 2 monkeys is confirmed as YF virus infections it was probably acquired locally in its endemic sylvan (jungle) cycle, which is endemic in the South American tropics. Cases occur sporadically in Brazil, with dead monkeys as the indicators of the occurrence of YF virus transmission in given localities. The rapid response, as indicated in the report above is essential to prevent spill-over of the sylvan virus transmission cycle into the urban cycle with rapid transmission by _Aedes aegypti_, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008 [see ProMED-mail archive no 20080308.0949). Local health authorities checking on _Aedes aegypti_ in the houses of nearby residents, and making sure the the people in the area are vaccinated, are prudent preventive measures.
