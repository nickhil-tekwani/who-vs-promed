Health authorities said that a 70 year old woman died and a 57 year old man
is critically ill in a Boston hospital after each was given a kidney from
an infected donor, reports The Boston Globe. The kidney was infected with a
hard-to-detect virus, health officials said, which came from a 49 year old
homeless man who suffered irreversible brain damage and cardiac arrest. The
donor carried a germ called lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus [LCMV], which
is most often transmitted by rodents and is usually unnoticed by healthy
people who do not suffer anything more than flu-like symptoms, according to
the newspaper. The virus also killed 3 transplant patients in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island in 2005.

Organs perish quickly, and they are tested for diseases such as AIDS,
hepatitis, and herpes, but not usually for viruses such as lymphocytic
choriomenigitis virus. And, since the demand for organs is so great,
recipients will often take the organs of homeless people, the newspaper said.

"People are literally dying for organs," said Dr Alfred DeMaria, a top
disease tracker at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. "The list
of potential things you can test for is enormous. But, balancing that
against the risk of not getting the organs, you have to make some decisions
about what's feasible and what's not feasible to test for."

The homeless donor died in mid-March 2008, according to the newspaper.
Doctors took his viable organs after his family authorized the removal. He
had been tested for AIDS, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases regularly
checked by the New England Bank, the region's organ procurement agency, but
there was no evidence of worrisome infections.

[This is not the 1st occasion on which LCMV infection has been associated
with fatal outcomes in organ transplantation. With the availability of
real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests, it would be prudent in future to screen
transplant organ donations for the presence of LCMV. Recently, the deaths
of 3 out of 4 transplant patients from a single donor in Australia was
associated with a novel LCMV-like agent distinct from previously isolated
LCMVs. In all cases, however, it is unresolved to what extent these
organ-transplanted viruses are merely passengers or are responsible also
for tissue-rejection illness and death.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the type species of the genus
_Arenavirus_ of the _Arenaviridae_ family of bipartite genome RNA viruses.
The reservoir hosts of almost all arenaviruses are rodents. Human LCMV
infection may occur in rural and urban areas with high densities of
rodents. Laboratory-acquired infections occur sporadically.

LCM is a rodentborne viral infectious disease that presents as aseptic
meningitis (inflammation of the membrane, or meninges, that surrounds the
brain and spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or
meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). Although
LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its
name implies, infection without symptoms or only mild febrile illnesses are
common clinical manifestations. In addition, pregnancy-related infection
has been associated with congenital hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and
mental retardation.

LCM and milder LCMV infections have been reported in Europe, the Americas,
Australia, and Japan, and may occur wherever infected rodent hosts of the
virus are found. However, the disease has historically been under reported,
often making it difficult to determine incidence rates or estimates of
prevalence by geographic region. Some serologic studies conducted in urban
areas have shown that the prevalence of LCMV infection among humans ranges
from 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Although rare, pet rodents may become
infected with LCMV from wild rodents.
