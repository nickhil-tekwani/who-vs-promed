------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We agree with the moderator that this report of 372 suspected cases is a surprisingly large number, at least for all being genuine HCPS [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome]. We also note at least one case, occurring in San Salvador, in the Palpala rural area. As indicated, this city is one of those with "evidence of the greatest increase in trash dumps, to the point that several of them begin to increase in proximity to the plazas and urban neighborhoods". Trash dumps fatally attract wild brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), which transmit to humans the only global hantavirus species, being Seoul virus or SEOV.

The Argentinian, and particularly the Salvador cases, should thus certainly be serologically screened for this pathogen, but a SEOV antigen is (paradoxically) absent in many American (and European) commercial ELISA or immunoblot assays, and can thus be missed, even if the attending physician suspects a hantavirus infection, as stipulated in: Clement J, LeDuc JW, McElhinney LM, et al. Clinical characteristics of ratborne Seoul hantavirus disease. Emerg Inf Dis 2019; 25:387-8; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2502.181643 Plus E-Appendix, pp. 1-4.

Typical symptoms are transient thrombocytopenia, together with different degrees of acute kidney injury (AKI), which however in milder cases, can manifest only by initial proteinuria and microhematuria, both equally transient within 2 weeks.

Salvador is a port city in North-East Brazil, surrounded by rat-infested slum dwellings with a very high leptospirosis endemicity. The continued presence of leptospira and SEOV was demonstrated in commensal rats trapped during the rainy season of 2010, and complemented with unpublished leptospira and SEOV prevalence information collected in 1998. SEOV was detected in 18% of wild brown rats in both 1998 and 2010 (n=78 in 1998; n=73 in 2010), indicating that brown rats in Salvador serve as permanent reservoir hosts for SEOV, besides of leptospira. Previously, 13.2% of 379 asymptomatic Salvador schoolchildren were found IFA-positive for a HTNV-like agent, but none for the autochthonous American Sin Nombre virus (SNV), suggesting potential rat exposure from a young age.

During a 1999 outbreak of urban leptospirosis after floods in Salvador, a total of 326 AKI cases were detected, of which 39% were serologically confirmed, and 19% considered as probable leptospirosis cases. However, the question remained as to which other reno-tropic infectious pathogen could explain the remaining 42% unconfirmed cases. Dual concomitant human leptospirosis-hantavirus infections have been described in tropical regions endemic for leptospirosis, as well as in Northern European non-endemic regions. The earliest such dual infection with AKI, in a non-tropical country, was reported from Glasgow, Scotland, in Lancet 1988 by G. Kudesia et al. Despite these previous findings, no HFRS cases have been reported from Salvador to our knowledge.

[Dr Clement is thanked for providing these comments.

He again makes a compelling case for inclusion of SEOV in clinical rule-outs and in supporting laboratory tests. It is highly likely that SEOV remains endemic in brown rats in San Salvador, with attendant risk of human infection by that virus. In a recent publication, Dr Clement states that, "there is an urgent need for greater medical awareness of Seoul virus-induced human pathology in many parts of the world. Given the mostly milder and atypical clinical presentation, sometimes even with preserved normal kidney function, the importance of simple but repeated urine examination is stressed, since initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria are rarely lacking."

One hopes that clear evidence of SEOV endemicity in rats with spillover to humans perhaps will provide incentive to eliminate trash dumps and initiate control of the rats that inhabit them. - Mod.TY
