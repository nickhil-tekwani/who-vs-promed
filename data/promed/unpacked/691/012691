12 Agusan tribesmen die in suspected measles outbreak
-------------------------
Since 23 Dec 2002, 12 persons have already died from what the health
department in Caraga Region described as suspected "measles outbreak" in 5
tribal barangays here, Mamanwa tribal leaders said yesterday.
National Commission of Indigenous People (NCIP) spokesperson Elvira
Catuburan of Caraga Region identified 7 of the 11 dead victims from the
outbreak as [occurring in members of the Mamanwa tribe aged: 45 years, 21
years, 5 children between 8 months and 2 years of age].
Catuburan told The STAR that hardest hit by "suspected measles outbreak"
were remote and hinterland tribal barangays of Matingue, Sinawsawan,
Kasagayan, Pangaylan, and Mambajo, some 30 to 36 kilometers walking
distance from Barangay Poblacion here.
Catuburan also identified [some of the hospitalized patients with ages 47
years, 39 years, 7 persons 20-29 years of age, 3 persons between 15-19
years of age, 3 persons between 10 and 14 years of age, 3 persons between
5-9 years of age, and one infant less than 1 year of age].
Catuburan claimed that the alleged "measles outbreak", started last 23 Dec
[2002] when 5 sick persons were brought to the Santiago Rural Health Center
of this town.
Municipal and provincial officials headed by Agusan del Norte Gov. Maria
Angelica Rossdel Amante immediately dispatched health personnel, medicine,
and food to the area.
The difficulty of bringing medicine and health personnel to the said tribal
barangays because of bad road condition and lack of mode of transportation
has raised fear of the further spread of the suspected "measles outbreak".
Clemente Villones of the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit of the
Department of Health Caraga Region told The STAR that blood samples of the
affected patients were already sent to the Research Institute of Tropical
Medicine (RITM) in Mandaluyong to determine the "virus" that cause the
suspected "outbreak".
"We still have to determine the medical history of the area so that
temporarily we may call it a suspected measles outbreak," Villones said.

[According to the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) Statistics, in 2001
measles was the 8th leading cause of morbidity for children 0-4 years of
age, and the 4th leading cause of death for this age group.
<http://www.doh.gov.ph/RHONCR/CHD-MM_web/STAT.htm>

The Philippine DOH has begun a measles elimination program in recent years,
reducing the annual morbidity from a high of 75 290 cases reported in 1984
(GIDEON database <http://www.gideononline.com/>). (See ProMED-mail posting
Measles, imported - Taiwan ex Philippines (02) 20020511.4171 for more data
from the GIDEON database on the background of measles in the Philippines ),
to a low of 3898 cases reported in 2001.
<http://www.doh.gov.ph/press/June202002.htm>
Symptoms associated with this outbreak are not mentioned, hence it is
difficult to categorically confirm this as due to measles. The descriptive
epidemiology of the reported cases is interesting. The news article
mentions 28 cases of which 17 were hospitalized and an additional 11 were
reported to have died (a 39 percent reported case fatality rate). Ages
were given for 24 of the 28 mentioned cases, of which 11 cases (46 percent)
were over age 20 and only 6 (25 percent) were less than 5 years of
age. This epidemiology for a measles outbreak is unusual, unless this is a
very remote tribe with very limited exposure to the general population over
the preceding 30 years. More information on this outbreak would be very
much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
