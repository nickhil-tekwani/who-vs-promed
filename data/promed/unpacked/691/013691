Murine Norovirus Propagated Successfully in Cultured Cells
--------------------------------------------------
Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have
become the 1st to successfully grow a norovirus in the lab. In humans,
noroviruses are a highly contagious source of diarrhea, vomiting and other
stomach upset that made headlines 2 years ago after a series of repeated
outbreaks on cruise ships. These viruses are a major cause of human disease
worldwide. Researchers showed that the mouse norovirus MNV-1 could be grown
in cells from mice with defective immune systems. Their findings make it
much easier to learn about the mouse virus and may help other researchers
seeking to duplicate the accomplishment with human forms of the virus.
In a study published this week in the online journal Public Library of
Science-Biology, scientists who developed the new technique report it may
already have led them to a [method] for vaccine development. "By looking at
the mouse virus we have grown in the lab, we were able to identify a part
of the capsid, the virus's protein shell, that is essential to its ability
to cause disease," says senior author Skip Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., professor
of pathology and immunology and of molecular microbiology. "If this part of
the capsid has an equivalent in human noroviruses, altering or disabling it
may give us a way to produce forms of the viruses that are weak enough to
serve as vaccines."
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
noroviruses are involved in about half of all food poisoning cases and
annually cause about 23 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the
United States. Norovirus disease is characterized by frequent vomiting and
diarrhea over the course of 1-2 days. The [prototype] norovirus, Norwalk
virus, was first identified after a 1968 outbreak at a school in Norwalk,
Ohio. [Noroviruses] also caused a series of repeated outbreaks on cruise
ships in 2002 and in military personnel in Afghanistan. Although such
infections rarely lead to serious or life-threatening illness in the United
States and other Western countries, they spread rapidly, are difficult to
prevent from spreading and can create considerable discomfort. Dehydration
from the diarrhea and vomiting induced by the virus sometimes leads to
hospitalization in the elderly, the young or those with weakened immune
systems. In the developing world, these viruses are a major cause of human
illness.
All previous attempts to culture human noroviruses in tissues in the
laboratory have been unsuccessful. "As a group, noroviruses have defied
characterization for decades because there just hasn't been a way to get
the virus to grow outside of a human host," Virgin says. In 2003,
Christianne Wobus, Ph.D., and Stephanie Karst, Ph.D., two postdoctoral
fellows in Virgin's lab, identified MNV-1, the 1st known mouse norovirus.
Virgin's group showed that the mice's ability to fight MNV-1 relied heavily
on the innate immune system, the branch of the immune system that attacks
invaders soon after they enter the body. In the new paper, Virgin's group
reveals that MNV-1 likes to infect cells of the innate immune system. In
tests in mice, the researchers found the virus thrived in macrophages,
immune system cells that normally engulf and destroy pathogens, and in
dendritic cells, sentry-like cells that pick up and display proteins from
pathogens. "We think there may be dendritic cells just beneath the lining
of the human gut that are providing the gateway the virus needs to cause
disease," Virgin says. To grow the virus in the lab, researchers took
dendritic cells and macrophages from mice with defective innate immune
systems and exposed them to the virus. "The virus grew beautifully," Virgin
says. "It's a very facile and robust system."
Comparisons of MNV-1 and human noroviruses have revealed many similarities
in gene sequence, structure and overall arrangement of the genome. But
Virgin acknowledges that differences between mouse and human physiology may
significantly alter MNV-1's interactions with its host. For example, mice
do not appear to be able to vomit. Additionally, researchers aren't sure
yet whether MNV-1 can make mice with normal immune systems sick. "The
bottom line is that this mouse model provides us with a very useful way to
examine certain similar aspects of the noroviruses," Virgin says. "Among
other things, we'll be using it to look at how the capsid protein enables
infection, viral replication processes and the receptors on host cells that
enable the virus to infect specific cell types."

disease surveillance and vaccine development. The reference for this paper

A, Mackenzie JM, Green KY, Virgin HW IV. Replication of a norovirus in cell
culture reveals a tropism for dendritic cells and macrophages. Public
Library of Science Biology, Nov. 30, 2004.
Progress in attempts to propagate human noroviruses in cultured cells has
been reviewed recently in the Journal of General Virology [see: Laboratory
efforts to cultivate noroviruses. Duizer E, Schwab KJ, Neill FH, Atmar RL,
Koopmans MP, Estes MK. J Gen Virol. 2004 Jan;85(Pt 1):79-87]. Human
noroviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite
numerous efforts, routine cell cultures have failed to yield replicating
human noroviruses. Duizer et al. reported that various cells (A549, AGS,
Caco-2, CCD-18, CRFK, CR-PEC, Detroit 551, Detroit 562, FRhK-4, HCT-8,
HeLa, HEC, HEp-2, Ht-29, HuTu-80, I-407, IEC-6, IEC-18, Kato-3, L20B,
MA104, MDBK, MDCK, RD, TMK, Vero and 293) were cultured on solid or
permeable surfaces. Differentiation was induced using cell culture
supplements such as insulin, DMSO and butyric acid. In some cases, the
cells and norovirus-containing stool samples were treated with bioactive
digestive additives. Variables evaluated in cultivation experiments
included the method of preparation of the virus inoculum, the genotype of
the virus, conditions for maintenance of cell monolayers, additives in the
maintenance medium and the method of inoculation of the cells. Serial blind
passage studies were performed routinely. In addition to evaluation for
cytopathic effect (CPE), evidence of virus replication was sought using
immunofluorescent assays to detect newly produced viral capsid antigen and
RT-PCR assays to detect the viral genome. Although some infected cultures
remained norovirus-positive by RT-PCR for up to 5 passages and an
occasional cell in a monolayer showed evidence of specific
immunofluorescence, no reproducible norovirus-induced CPE was observed and
all RT-PCR results that were positive initially were negative following
continued passaging. Thus, attempts to develop a method for the cultivation
of human noroviruses have so far been unsuccessful. The results of Wobus et
al. with murine norovirus may give fresh impetus to attempts to propagate
human noroviruses in cultured cells

Scotland: Norovirus Infection Affecting Several Communities in the Forth Valley
--------------------------------------------------
Winter vomiting disease is affecting several communities across the Forth
Valley. Outbreaks of [norovirus infection] have been reported in several
nurseries, schools and care homes for the elderly in recent weeks. Symptoms
include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and mild
fever, which normally develop 24-48 hours after exposure to the virus and
usually disappear within 48 hours. Anyone affected is advised to drink
plenty of fluids.
The virus is said to be most commonly spread by person-to-person contact,
although it can be spread through the air after an episode of vomiting. It
is infectious for up to 48 hours after the episode of illness. Good hygiene
reduces the risk of catching or spreading norovirus infection, and regular
hand-washing is advised.
Dr Malcolm McWhirter, director of public health for the National Health
Service (NHS) Forth Valley, said: "This is a particular problem at the
moment in the community, and I would ask anyone who has been affected by
this virus not to visit hospitals or residential care homes. The effect on
hospitals of this virus is extensive, as wards have to be closed to new
admissions and operations may have to be cancelled. "Patients who become
affected have to be kept in isolation until they recover and then for a
further 48 hours until they are symptom-free. If we cannot discharge
patients because they have been infected by this virus, then bed
availability also becomes affected. This is always a challenging time of
year for the NHS, but we are determined to keep our hospitals running as
smoothly as possible during the winter months."

Ireland: Norovirus Outbreak at Dublin Hospital
----------------------------------------------
More than 100 cases of norovirus infection [causing winter vomiting
disease] have been reported at a Dublin Hospital. Saint Vincent's Hospital
says that 76 patients and 43 staff have come down with the virus
infection. 15 wards have been closed as a result.
The hospital is appealing to people showing symptoms of the illness not to
attend its Accident and Emergency Department, to help prevent a further
spread of the illness. It is also asking the public to avoid visiting
patients if possible.

Ireland: Nurses Organization Blames Over-crowding for Norovirus Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Irish Nurses Organisation (INO) has blamed overcrowding at St Vincent's
Hospital in Dublin for contributing to the spread of [norovirus infection].
There are now 160 cases of [norovirus infection] at the hospital. A
spokesman for the hospital said today that 95 patients and 65 staff had
contracted the illness. That represents an increase of 18 patient and 22
staff cases since yesterday. He added that another 45 patients are showing
symptoms of the virus. 14 wards in the hospital remain closed to new
admissions as a result of the outbreak.

[These recent outbreaks in Ireland and Scotland conform to the pattern
observed in England, where between 1992 and 2004, 79 percent of all
outbreaks reported occurred in health-care settings, either in hospitals or
residential care homes. Hotels (7 percent) and schools (5 percent) were the
next most frequent settings. - Mod.CP]
