The Mississippi State Department of Health [MSDH] has identified several cases of _Eecherichia coli_ infection associated with use of the swimming pool and splashpad at Yogi on the Lake in Pelahatchie. The cases identified so far have exposure dates on the weekend of 30 Jul through 1 Aug [2021]. Additional exposures may have occurred through 9 Aug [2021]. MSDH calls this "an evolving situation", and they are now conducting an ongoing investigation to identify any additional cases. The management at Jellystone Park Camp Resort is cooperating with the investigation and response.

Health officials say that those who were swimming in the pool or splashpad at Yogi on the Lake in Pelahatchie between 30 Jul and 9 Aug [2021] should monitor for symptoms of stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. If you did use the pool or splashed on these dates, you are asked to consult a healthcare provider immediately if you do have symptoms and to tell your doctor about your exposure.

Symptoms usually develop 3-4 days after the exposure, with a range between one and 10 days. Outbreaks with recreational waters such as pools and splashpads can occur when water becomes contaminated by an infected person through diarrhea or fecal contamination. Other swimmers then swallow the water, becoming exposed and infected. Person-to-person transmission can also occur.

[Although it is not specifically stated, a cluster of illnesses blamed on _E. coli_ certainly suggests that enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is at work here, either the prototypic serotype O157:H7 or one of the other Shiga-toxin-producing strains. Other pathogenic _E. coli_ strains such as enteropathogenic or enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ could be the cause, but EHEC is most likely.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock, wild animals, or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.
