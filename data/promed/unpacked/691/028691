Searching for possible sources of the legionellosis outbreak in Juelich, another potential source has been identified. The initial samples from the power plant in Weisweiler show high concentrations of _Legionella_ in cooling water, ranging from 7500 colonies in block H to 61 500 colonies [per 100 ml] in block F; the run off from block Q contained 4000 colonies per 100 ml of water. The Weisweiler power plant is located near Juelich in the Aachen region.

Other cooling plants that tested positive for _Legionella_ include the one at the Research Centre in Juelich, as well as the cooling plants at metalworking and plastics processing plants. The cooling towers are now out of service. Whether these findings are causally related to the current outbreak in Juelich is under investigation.

_Legionella_ isolated from the power plant have been sent to a specialized laboratory in Dresden for a comparison with _Legionella_ isolated from patients from Juelich.

The Ministry for the Environment has instructed the district government in Cologne to work together with the owner of the power plant RWE to take measures to reduce the load of _Legionella_. [This probably refers to the Weisweiler power plant owned by RWE (http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/60142/rwe-power-ag/locations/lignite/weisweiler-power-plant/). RWE AG (Rheinisch-Westfalisches Elektrizitatswerk AG) is a German electric utilities company based in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWE).] In response to the findings, the Ministry has organized a meeting with all involved parties to discuss further measures.

So far, the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease has been confirmed in 30 patients; the latest case dates to 15 Sep 2014.

[In a prior news report, the legionnaires' disease outbreak in Juelich posted by ProMED-mail (Legionellosis - Germany (02): (NW) update 20140928.2812513), there were 60 cases of suspected legionnaires' disease, of which the diagnosis was confirmed in 23, ruled out in 20, and pending in 17 other cases. There are now 30 confirmed cases. There have been no cases for the past 2 weeks.

The news report likely is referring to genotyping the environmental isolates and comparing the genotypes of environmental isolates with genotypes of clinical isolates. If the clinical isolates have the same genotype, a common source outbreak is likely, and if the genotype of the clinical isolates matches that of an environmental isolate, the facility from which this isolate was obtained is the likely source of the outbreak. We await reports of the results from the Dresden specialty labs' investigation.

Juelich is a town in the district of Dueren, in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JÃ¼lich). North Rhine-Westphalia's capital is Duesseldorf and its biggest city Cologne. 4 of Germany's 10 biggest cities -- Cologne, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, and Essen -- are located in North Rhine-Westphalia. The state is divided into 5 government regions and 31 districts (Kreise) and 23 urban districts (kreisfreie Staedte). A map of the districts can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia#Subdivisions. - Mod.ML
