Wolf virus
----------
New research claims that half of wolf pups born in Minnesota each
year die from a highly contagious disease that has stunted the growth
of the state's wolf population. The study, published in the Journal
of Wildlife Diseases, shows that canine parovirus [more likely this
should be parvovirus - Mod.TG] kills from 40 percent to 60 percent of
wolf pups in Minnesota. The virus attacks the gastrointestinal tract
and can kill pups within a few days.

David Mech, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said the gray
wolf population in other states has jumped substantially. But he said
growth in Minnesota is about 4 percent a year, compared with
increases of 16 percent to 58 percent in other states.

Dan Stark, wolf specialist with the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, said the problem of dying wolf pups needs to be studied
further. He thinks disease isn't the only reason the population has stabilized.

[From the limited description of the virus affecting the
gastrointestinal tract, it sounds like parvovirus.

After ingestion, the virus replicates in lymphoid tissue of the
oropharynx; from there, it spreads to the bloodstream. It attacks
rapidly dividing cells throughout the body, especially those in the
bone marrow, lymphopoietic tissue, and the crypt epithelium of the
jejunum and ileum. Early lymphatic infection is accompanied by
lymphopenia and precedes intestinal infection and GI signs.
Replication in the bone marrow and lymphopoietic tissue causes
neutropenia and lymphopenia, respectively. By 3 days after infection,
rapidly dividing intestinal crypt cells are infected. Viral shedding
in the feces begins 3-4 days after infection and peaks when clinical
signs appear. Viral shedding decreases rapidly and may no longer be
detected 10-14 days after initial infection. Replication of the virus
in the crypt epithelium of the gut causes collapse of intestinal
villi, epithelial necrosis, and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Normal enteric
bacteria, e.g., Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli enter
the denuded mucosa and may gain entry to the bloodstream, resulting
in bacteremia.

Infected dogs are often asymptomatic. Clinical disease may be
triggered by stress (eg, boarding), and clinical signs may be
exacerbated by concurrent infection with opportunistic enteric
pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, C perfringens, E coli, Campylobacter,
coronavirus, and various parasites). The dose of virus required to
cause clinical disease may also be a factor. Prolonged contact with a
dog shedding high levels of virus increases the likelihood of
disease. The incubation period is 3-8 days. Viral shedding may begin
on day 3, before the onset of clinical signs.

Initially, 2 common clinical forms of the disease were recognized --
myocarditis and gastroenteritis. Myocarditis was seen in young pups,
especially in the early neonatal period. Infection led to myocardial
necrosis with either acute cardiopulmonary failure (causing pulmonary
edema, cyanosis, and collapse) or scarring of the myocardium and
progressive cardiac insufficiency. However, myocarditis is no longer
seen because effective immunization of bitches protects pups during
this early period of life.

Gastroenteritis is most common in pups 6-20 week old, i.e., the
period when maternal antibody protection falls and vaccination has
not yet adequately protected the pup against infection. Most affected
dogs (approximately 85 percent) are less than 1 year old. In dogs
greater than 6 months old, intact males are more likely to develop
enteritis than intact females, reflecting the tendency of male dogs
to roam. Dogs with the enteric form suffer from an acute onset of
lethargy, anorexia, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The feces are
loose and may contain mucus or blood. The severity of clinical signs
varies. Most dogs recover within a few days with appropriate
supportive care; others can die within hours of the onset of clinical
signs. A common complication is pulmonary edema or alveolitis.

There is no specific therapy to eliminate the virus. Most dogs
recover with appropriate supportive care directed to restoration of
fluid balance. Oral electrolyte solutions may be used in mildly
dehydrated dogs without a history of vomiting. More severely affected
dogs should receive IV fluid therapy (lactated Ringer's and 5 percent
dextrose with additional potassium chloride [10-20 mEq/L]) to counter
dehydration and maintain fluid balance. Monitoring of electrolyte
changes is advisable. Most dogs that survive the first 2-3 days of
disease recover. Persistent vomiting can be controlled with
metoclopramide, 0.2-0.5 mg/kg, PO or SC, qid, or 1-2 mg/kg/day, slow IV).

Routine use of antibiotics is discouraged. More severe cases (e.g.,
dogs with severe blood loss, fever, or loss of intestinal integrity)
are predisposed to bacteremia and septicemia. In these cases, a
combination of either ampicillin or a 1st- or 2nd-generation
cephalosporin, plus an aminoglycoside or enrofloxacin, provide
broad-spectrum coverage.

Food and water should be withheld until vomiting has subsided. After
this, small amounts of a bland diet (e.g., cottage cheese and rice or
a commercially available prescription diet) should be offered
frequently. A small volume of warm, salted meat broth should be given
concurrently. If GI signs recur after feeding, the dog should be
fasted for an additional 12-24 hours before feeding again. If food
can be tolerated, the bland diet is continued for 7-14 days, after
which the dog's regular diet can be gradually reintroduced.

Although the wolf pups are canines, they may respond a little
differently than the domestic dog to vaccines. It maybe that an oral
vaccine for wolves should be developed.
