The Institute of Public Health in Santiago just recently announced the
confirmation that samples were positive for [a] hantavirus [infection]
in a 33-year-old woman from the Lago Verde locale who died this past
weekend [10-11 Sep 2011] after having been taken to the main [medical]
assistance center of the region with obvious symptoms of the disease.
The woman, who returned from her vacation in the north of the country
with her family this past 10 Aug [2011], encountered situations of
risk [of hantavirus exposure], according to epidemiological
investigations. Given this situation, after presenting with symptoms
of fever, vomiting, and nausea, she was taken to the intermediate care
unit of the Coyhaique Regional Hospital and later to the intensive
care unit of said hospital, where she died.

"This is the 3rd fatal case of the disease after a health alert was
declared last July [2011], of a total of 8 confirmed cases in the
Aysen region," noted the health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial
Secretary] Claudio Vallejos, who also added that in the recent meeting
of the Regional Hantavirus Committee it was agreed to reinforce
preventive measures through educational campaigns during the summer,
and especially during national holidays, along with actions on the
ground by public health authorities and committee members.

[The 15 Sep 2011 edition of Radio Santa Maria
(http://www.radiosantamaria.cl/rsm/noticias/4018-mujer-de-33-anos-fallecio-aparentemente-por-contagio-de-virus-hanta.html
indicates that the woman was probably exposed to the virus while
cleaning her house, which was closed up while the family was away on
vacation.

Although not specified, the hantavirus most likely involved in this
case is Andes virus.

longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can

The Los Lagos health SEREMI, Monica Winkler, confirmed a new case of
[a] hantavirus [infection] in the Cochamo community, which has been
affected by a sharp increase in the rodent population for several
months. The person involved is a 63-year-old man from the Valle El
Frio area of the Cochamo community who was admitted to the intensive
care unit of the Hospital Base of Puerto Montt, suffering from a
respiratory condition associated with hantavirus [infections]. The
diagnosis was later confirmed by laboratory tests. However, the man is
currently in stable condition, although continuing under observation
to assure his progress, the regional health authority stated.

Winkler indicated that to date there are 8 hantavirus [infection]
cases in the nearby area so that constant alert and prevention is
being maintained, above all, now that visitors are beginning to
arrive.

Monica Winkler indicated also that preventive work has been done with
the delivery of materials in areas close to Puerto Varas, such as
Ralun or Puerto Octay, adding that the important thing, now that the
spring season is approaching, is that caution must be exercised to
avoid hantavirus [exposure] in the areas affected by the increase in
rodents.

[This is the newest case of a hantavirus infection (most likely due to
Andes virus) from the Valle El Frio locale in the Cochamo community of
the Los Lagos region. The previous case from was a woman from this
area hospitalized in Mid-August [2011], who died (see ProMED-mail
archive no 20110822.2551). The area was placed under an agricultural
alert due to abundant rodent populations, which may account for the
spill-over of the virus into humans.
