A woman from Redruth, Cornwall, who received an award for her campaign for compulsory tuberculosis (TB) testing of alpacas has contracted the illness. She had 8 of the animals put down in 2008-09 when they tested positive for bovine TB. She said she believed she contracted the disease from the animals and was undergoing 9 months of treatment.

She received an award from the British Alpaca Society (BAS), which promotes the welfare of alpacas and llamas for the campaign.

Bovine TB is believed to be primarily passed from one animal to another by breathing in bacteria. It is a notifiable disease, which means there is a legal requirement to report it if it is present -- or suspected in a herd -- but there is currently no legal requirement for animals to be regularly tested. Alpacas have little resistance to TB and can die within 6 months of catching it, the BAS said. There are currently 1500 alpaca owners of an estimated 35 000 animals registered with the British Alpaca Society. The animals, which originally come from the high plains of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile in South America, are normally bred for their wool.

[_Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) is a member of the "_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex", along with other genetically closely related species: _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), the BCG bacillus, _M. africanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and M. canetti. Mtb is the usual cause of tuberculosis in humans and Mb is the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis. Although the disease caused by Mb is commonly called bovine tuberculosis, Mb has a broad host range that includes humans, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials, rabbits, sheep, horses, and deer.

Mb is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an essential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to treat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation of Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as epidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical microbiology labs just identifies the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex". Mb can be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests, such as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions, and resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.

Humans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking contaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb is present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air via an infectious aerosol when a person or other animal with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes.

Alpacas (_Vicugna pacos_) are camelids, which resemble small llamas in appearance. They live herds and are indigenous to the highest regions of the Andes of southern Peru, northern Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile at an altitude of 3500 meters (11 500 feet) to 5000 meters (16 000 feet) above sea level (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca). They are bred specifically for their wool in South America, as well as in other countries in Europe, the UK, US, Australia, and New Zealand.

Camelids are known to be susceptible to infection due to MTC, including Mtb, Mb, and _M. microti_ (http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/5/1960.full). Infected alpaca can develop extensive necrosis and cavitation of the lung, as well as disseminated disease (http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/5/1960.full). The cavities contain high numbers of mycobacteria that drain into the trachea and are likely expelled as aerosols into the environment (http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/5/1960.full and http://bovinetb.blogspot.com/2009/07/transmission-alpacas.html). Transmission thus could occur not only to other domestic or wild species, but also to humans in contact with an infected alpaca for example exhibited at an agricultural fair or petting zoo. The patient mentioned in the above news report likely inhaled aerosolized respiratory secretions of an alpaca with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Alpaca are thought to have been infected with Mb by contact with either infected alpaca, cattle, or local wildlife species, or via infected milk. In the UK, TB has affected herds of all sizes, all well as alpaca kept as pets (http://www.alpacatb.com/). Areas in the UK at high risk for alpaca TB are shown on a map at (http://www.alpacatb.com/). TB cases have also been reported in alpacas from different European countries (http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/5/1960.full).

Redruth is a town in Cornwall, England, with a population of 12 352; it is 18 miles (29 km) north east of Penzance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redruth). A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the UK can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1fj0. - Mod.ML]
