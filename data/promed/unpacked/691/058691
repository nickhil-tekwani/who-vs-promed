Yesterday [6 Aug 2008], The Secretariat of Health of the Federal
District [DF] confirmed the 1st death by a hantavirus [infection] in
2008.

A 46-year-old resident of Lago Oeste died on 27 Jul [2008] after
developing symptoms including high fever, muscle pain, and pulmonary
bleeding.

This is the 3rd confirmed record of the disease in the federal
capital this year [2008]. The 2 others are people who [contracted a
hantavirus infection], and were admitted to one of the network of
public hospitals, but were cured of the disease.

The 1st occurrence of a hantavirus [infection] in humans this year
[2008] was an army sergeant. He worked in the Integrated Center of
War Electronics, in a rural area of Sobradinho. He recovered and is
now well. There are no details on the 3rd [2nd?] case.

For now, the numbers in 2008 are minor in comparison with last year
[2007]. In 2007, the Secretariat of Health of the DF recorded 7 cases
of hantavirus [infection], of which 2 people did not resist the attack
[died] of the virus [infection].

An outbreak occurred in 2004, when there were 30 cases and 15 deaths.
Sao Sebastian was the city with the most [hantavirus] infections.

[The suspected hantaviruses in this and previously reported Brazilian
cases this year (2008) are not given in this report. The ProMED-mail
report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008 (ProMED-mail archive no.
20080223.07412) indicated that hantaviruses circulating in Mato
Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the _Calomys callosus_
rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had previously been found
in Para state, but without a known host there. Field research found
that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was the host
of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. A brief description of other
hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and their rodent hosts is given in
ProMED-mail archive no. 20080702.2020.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information about the
confirmation of the etiological agent(s) involved in these 3 cases.
