From January up to the last week of April [2010], 5 cases positive
for hantavirus [infections] have been detected in 4 municipalities of
the departments of Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Tarija. This disease
is a pathological condition that is rare but extremely serious,
caused by a family of viruses that is transmitted to human beings
when [virus-] contaminated air by urine, excreta of saliva of
[infected] rodents is breathed. Also, the bite of [infected] rodents
can transmit hantavirus[es]. An infected person cannot transmit [the
virus] to another person [with the exception of Andes virus. - Mod.TY]

The epidemiological report of the Centro Nacional de Enlace [National
Focal Point] and the Epidemiological Unit of the Ministry of Health,
confirmed 5 laboratory-positive cases of the disease up to 28 Apr
[2010]. The positive cases were found in Cochabamba (a person in the
Villa Tunari municipality), in Santa Cruz (a case in Pailon and
another in San Julian), and in Tarija (in the municipality of
Padcaya, where there were notifications for 2 positive cases). [The
number of] suspicious cases of hantavirus [infection] to date has
reached 14, and a 39-year-old woman in San Julian died at the
beginning of the year [2010].

The most frequent symptoms of the disease are myalgia, fever,
headache, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, the
main symptom of the disease is respiratory difficulty caused by the
accumulation of fluids in the lungs, a situation that may lead to
respiratory arrest [which is why the disease is termed hantavirus
respiratory syndrome (HPS). - Mod.TY]

Faced with these symptoms it is necessary to apply some preventive
measures such as constant house cleaning, avoiding entry of rats [and
mice] into homes, and sealing up all the openings.

Currently, there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by
hantavirus [infection]. Early intensive care in the hospital is the
only recognized measure.

[Apparently Padcaya municipality, capital of the 1st section of Arce
province (in Tarija department) has been an active focus of
hantavirus infections this year (2010). Of the municipalities listed
above, only Padcaya is in an inter-Andean mountain valley, and the
hantavirus involved in these cases was reported to be Andes virus
(see ProMED archive no. 20100402.1050). The other municipalities are
in the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, and the possible hantaviruses
(and their rodent hosts, from a list kindly provided by Dr Jim Mills)
that might be involved in these HPS cases are Laguna Negra (_Calomys
laucha_

_C. callosus_
