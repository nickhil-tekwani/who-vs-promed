Khalid I, Alraddadi BM, Dairi Y, et al. Acute Management and Long-Term Survival Among Subjects With Severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Pneumonia and ARDS. Respir Care. 2015 Dec 23 pii: respcare.04325.

BACKGROUND:
Data on the management, clinical course, and outcome of critical patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus are scarce. We report here our experience and long-term outcome of such patients.

METHODS:
Subjects intubated for management of ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pneumonia and ARDS during the April-May 2014 outbreak were included. Their characteristics, ICU course, management, and outcome were evaluated.

RESULTS:
14 subjects, including 3 health-care workers, met study criteria. Besides 2 health-care workers, all subjects had comorbidities. Predominant symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. The worst median PaO2 /FIO2 ratio of 118 post-intubation was seen on the 3rd day, and median APACHE II score was 27. All subjects received lung-protective ventilation and 1 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone infusion for ARDS. 11 subjects received ribavirin and peginterferon alpha-2a. Subjects had a critical ICU course and required neuromuscular blockade (n = 11; 79 per cent), required rescue therapy for respiratory failure (n = 8; 57 per cent), developed shock (n = 10; 71 per cent), and required renal replacement therapy (n = 8; 57 per cent). Declining C-reactive protein levels correlated with clinical improvement despite continued positive real-time polymerase chain reaction results. 9 subjects died in ICU. 5 subjects, including 3 health-care workers, were discharged from hospital and were alive after 1 y.

CONCLUSIONS:
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pneumonia with ARDS has high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. The mainstay of treatment is meticulous ARDS management. Those who survived the acute infection and its complications remained well after 1 y in our study. The role of ribavirin and interferon warrants urgent further evaluation.

[As little is known about the prognosis and outcome of MERS patients, this study is informative, albeit rather limited in size with only 14 in the study group. In addition, the study cohort appears to have included only patients with comorbidities. It would be helpful to follow those without comorbidities as well. Although not explicitly stated, it is assumed these patients are from Saudi Arabia. - Mod.LK]
