West Nile virus positive crow found in North Carolina
-----------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: On Sat 20 Oct 2000 U.S. government researchers revealed that
they had found West Nile virus in a dead crow in North Carolina, the
farthest south the virus has been found. The U.S. Geological Survey said the
infected crow was found in Chatham County, near the town of Moncure, about
40 miles southwest of Raleigh.
West Nile virus naturally infects birds and is spread by mosquitoes. When
they bite people, it can create a mild flu-like illness but in rare cases it
can go on to cause encephalitis. The encephalitis can kill the elderly or
people with weak immune systems, and it can leave healthy elderly victims
crippled or debilitated. Experts have predicted that, now that it is in the
United States, West Nile virus will spread widely. There is no way to kill
off all the mosquitoes that spread it, although health officials say local
pesticide spraying when infected birds are found can greatly reduce the risk
that people will become infected. The virus stops spreading when
temperatures fall below 55 degrees F and mosquitoes become dormant, but it
can spread again when the insects become active in spring and when birds
carry it with them when they migrate.
