Flooding hits homes, raises fears of dengue
-------------------------------------------
Flash flooding caused by heavy rains has damaged more than 20 homes in
Kampot province and sparked concerns about a spike in dengue fever in
the capital, officials said Monday [7 Sep 2009].

Ros Se, director of Kampot's provincial information department, said
the province had been hit by 5 days of rain. Mao Hak, director of the
National Department of Hydrology and River Works, said flooding had
also occurred in Kratie, Stung Treng, and Kampong Cham provinces.

Ngan Chantha, head of the National Anti-Dengue Programme, said the
flooding made anti-dengue precautions more important, adding that 24
children had died of the disease this year [2009].

[Dengue is caused by a virus, which is transmitted most often by the
day-feeding mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_. As a mosquito-borne
illness, epidemics of dengue can be influenced by flooding. Flooding
in dengue-infested areas will naturally produce large pools of
stagnant water, which in turn can result in the spread of and an
increase in numbers of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes
(see <http://www.ehow.com/about_4595783_cdc-dengue-fever.html>).

From the newswire above, there have been 24 deaths due to dengue
virus infection since January 2009. According to the National Center
for Malaria (NCM) as of 18 Aug 2009, 7227 people in Cambodia were
infected with dengue virus and 19 people died in the 1st 31 weeks of
2009 (see prior ProMED-mail posting Dengue/DHF update 2009 (34)
20090823.2977).

Regarding annual reported cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and
dengue deaths in Cambodia from [ProMED], the largest outbreak of
dengue in Cambodia during the past 5 years (2005-2009) occurred in
2007 with [nearly 40 000] cases and 407 dengue deaths (see ProMED 2008
archive listed below)].

According to WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO)
available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there
were 9542 cases and 65 deaths of dengue fever in Cambodia in 2008, and
2431 cases and 7 deaths in the 1st 22 weeks of 2009.

In Arakan [currently Rakhine] State, 3 children died with dengue fever
in the 1st week of August [2009], according to a report of the journal
Weekly Eleven. Among the victims are 2 children from Sittwe, the
capital of Arakan, and another child from Kyaukpru, the 2nd largest
city in the state.

The number of dengue fever infections in Arakan State was up to 329 in
the 1st week of August [2009], the government health department is
quoted as saying. The towns of Sittwe and Kyaukpru have been most
affected by dengue, but other areas in Arakan State have also seen the
number of people falling ill with dengue twice what it was last year.

According to a local source, the medical facilities for dengue fever
patients are very poor in Arakan State. At the same time, many
hospitals are facing a shortage of medicine to treat the illness. The
condition of affected children in rural areas of the state is most
serious due to lack of treatment and medicine. In addition to a lack
of medicine, patients have not been receiving treatment from hospitals
systematically.

A medical doctor from Sittwe said the number of dengue fever patients
in Arakan State may be higher than the reported figure of 329 because
in some rural areas it is difficult to get an accurate count due to
lack of communications. Many poor families in Arakan State cannot send
their dengue affected children to the hospitals because the fee for
medical treatment in Arakan is more than they can afford.

The number of dengue cases has risen to 25 606 while 249 people have
died of the disease in Sri Lanka so far, the Epidemiological Unit of
the Health Ministry said on Friday [11 Sep 2009]. The Epidemiological
Unit said in its latest statistics report that of the 25 606 cases,
the highest number of patients were reported from June [2009],
totaling 7048. It is followed by July with 6872 cases being reported.
The island has recorded 2988 dengue cases in August, according to the
report. This represents a sharp increase as only 4156 dengue cases and
85 deaths were reported for the whole year of 2008. Health officials
said the majority of these cases have been reported from the areas of
Kandy, Kegalle, Colombo, Gampaha, and Kurunegala.

The rapid rise in the level of the epidemic has forced the health
authorities to carry out an extensive public awareness campaign to
eradicate the mosquito-based epidemic. Households have been warned to
keep the environment free of mosquitoes. Those who allow the
mosquitoes to breed by allowing stagnant water face prosecution, with
a special hotline being made available for public information.

Dengue fever appears to be popping up in the lakeshore area, with
Chapala health authorities registering the year's [2009] 1st confirmed
case of the disease last week [week of 1 Sep 2009]. The municipal
government immediately responded to the incident by sending out a task
force to launch a junk cleanup and collection program in the upper
Chapala neighborhood where the dengue victim resides. Residents are
being encouraged to dispose of any unused containers and objects that
may fill up with rainwater and provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes
that transmit the virus.
