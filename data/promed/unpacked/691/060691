Taiwan SARS Responsive Level Escalated to Level A
------------------------------------------------
In response to 2 suspected SARS cases reported in China, Taiwan Department
of Health has announced today that starting 24 Apr 2004, the SARS
responsive level will be escalated from "SARS and other emerging infectious
diseases preparedness phase" to level A, which is defined as when the 1st
confirmed case of SARS is reported globally.
According to the press releases from WHO and Department of Health, Hong
Kong, 2 suspected SARS cases in Beijing and Anhui respectively have been
reported. Please refer to <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_04_22/en/> and
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm> for further information.
Therefore, the Department of Health has resumed "SARS control and
prevention committee" meetings to improve our level of response to SARS.
The following precautionary measures have been adopted:
1. All incoming passengers are required to fill in the "SARS and other
communicable diseases survey form" and to have their body temperature taken
by an infrared thermal camera.
2. Tourists or businessmen who departed from Beijing and Anhui are required
to fill a "Tourists from Beijing and Anhui Survey Form" for follow-up.
3. Self-health management required for incoming tourists or businessmen who
departed from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
Although no suspected SARS case has been identified in Taiwan, Taiwan CDC
would like to remind the public to keep good personal hygiene (e.g.
hand-washing, temperature monitoring) as well as to avoid going to work
and/or school when fever develops to prevent future re-emergence of SARS.
[From a newswire also submitted by Dr. Chang:
<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2004/04/24/2003137874>
The Taiwan CDC yesterday raised its SARS response level to A from 0. Level
0 indicates that there are no cases of SARS worldwide, level A the
detection of SARS cases in other nations, level B the detection of SARS in
Taiwan, and level C, numerous cases of SARS in Taiwan.
As a result of the move, the CDC began increasing border surveillance
efforts at midnight last night [23 Apr 2004]. Su explained that travelers
to Taiwan from Beijing or Anhui Province would be required to fill out
forms confirming their health. They will also be required to conduct
personal health management, which would include keeping records of daily
temperature readings. CDC officials will make follow-up phone calls for 10
days to verify health conditions. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Australia response - newswire

Australia on SARS alert
---------------
Australia's health system has been put on alert following a new outbreak of
SARS-like illness in China.
Chief medical officer John Horvath today said he had held a teleconference
with the Communicable Diseases Network to discuss the risk that someone
infected with SARS might bring the disease into the country.
Prof Horvath said the risk of a person infected with SARS entering
Australia was low, but precautions had to be taken. "While there is a low
risk of a person arriving in Australia with SARS, it is prudent for
Australian health authorities to actively monitor the situation in China
and take appropriate precautions," he said. "Hospitals in all Australian
states and territories have been advised to enact SARS infection control
procedures on patients who have recently arrived from Beijing or the Anhui
province of China who have a temperature of over 38 Celsius and are showing
the symptoms of SARS." Prof Horvath said Australia was well prepared for
any SARS outbreak. He said health and border authorities would remain on alert.
"To protect Australia from imported cases of SARS, all arriving
international passengers currently receive a health advice sheet prior to
disembarking," he said. "This sheet ensures a high level of awareness is
maintained about SARS and other communicable diseases and advises
travellers to alert the health system in the event of illness, and to
notify doctors of their travel history."

[The occurrence of additional suspected cases of SARS in close contacts of
the current "probable" cases of SARS is not surprising. This moderator has
chosen to use the term "probable" for those cases for which preliminary
laboratory findings are consistent with evidence of SARS coronavirus (Co-V)
infection, but confirmation by an independent international reference
laboratory is still pending.
During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the primary mode of viral transmission
was to close contacts when respiratory precautions were not
taken. According to the information available, the 2 probable cases (the
index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for her in a Beijing
hospital) were not treated as suspected cases of SARS for some time prior
to the implementation of infection control procedures that would have
minimized the spread of the SARS Co-V. The index case had onset of illness
on 25 Mar 2004, her mother on 8 Apr 2004; the 1st indication of
classification as suspected case(s) of SARS appears to be 19 Apr 2004 upon
the death of the index case's mother. The date of onset of illness in the
nurse was 22 Apr 2004, and that of the additional postdoctoral student
working in the laboratory with the index case was 17 Apr 2004 (he was
classified as a suspected case when initially seen). Hence, it appears
that in the period 25 Mar 2004 through 19 Apr 2004, the index case and her
mother were clinically ill with probable SARS CoV infection, and were
potentially infectious to others in their contact environment, including
during travel on trains between Beijing and Anhui province, and during
hospitalization in general clinical care wards without isolation.
The challenge will be to identify and isolate those individuals who were
infected through close contact with the above-mentioned cases so as to
interrupt further transmission of the SARS Co-V. - Mod.MPP]
