Here in Belo Horizonte we're living a real epidemic of Dengue Fever. The
numbers of cases are just increasing and only yesterday we've got 369 new
cases confirmed. The risk of Yellow Fever that occurs in nearby states and
the fear of the hemorrhagic type of Dengue is forcing the State to organize
an war-like operation against _Aedes aegypti_.
In the ER's we're admitting about 3-4 (10%) suspected cases per doctor per
day.
Until now, there are 2943 confirmed and 4687 suspected cases in the city
and the disease that began in a few restricted areas is just spreading
through all the town.
