Over 1052 birds have so far been culled in Panda Development Area of
Nasarawa State in the wake of avian influenza (bird flu) that affected the
area just as the people of the area were commended for reporting early
signs of the flu.
UNICEF (UN Children's Fund) field officer for avian influenza, Alhaji Bala
Hassan, who visited the affected area from their headquarters in Bauchi
said the efforts of the people of the area in reporting cases of sick or
dead birds as well as their contributions towards the depopulation exercise
was commendable.
Bala who was in Nasarawa weekend [sic] and visited Kondoro and Panda
district areas where the incident occurred, cautioned the people against
taking sick or dead birds for granted and [to] ensure that poultry meat and
eggs are properly cooked before consumption.
He particularly advised parents to keep their children away from sick or
dead birds and advised them to always imbibe the culture of washing their
hands whenever they come in contact with sick or dead birds to avoid the
spread of the flu.
Presenting posters, pamphlets, and other educative materials on avian
influenza to the district head of the area as well as the people, Bala
called on them to spread the message among themselves and outside their
communities so as to create awareness that would lead to the prevention of
the disease.
The UNICEF focal person on avian influenza control in the Ministry of
Information, Mallam Abubakar Tanko, who also accompanied the UNICEF field
officer to the area, advised the people to keep away from using poultry
droppings as manure following the dangers associated with the confirmation
of H5N1 virus in the area.
The district head of Kondoro, Alhaji Muha-mmeadu Habu, [thanked the UNICEF
officers] for their philanthropic gestures in curbing not only the flu but
in the area of child survival and other programmes. He also called on the
state government to come to their aid in the payment of compensations due
to the birds they have lost.

[News about an H5N1 outbreak in poultry was reported in May 2007 from
Nigeria's northern state of Zamfara (see ProMED-mail 20070526.1680);
earlier, in January 2007, Nigeria reported west Africa's 1st human bird flu
death.
Nigeria's last follow-up report on avian influenza to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health) was
submitted on 2 Apr 2006. A summary of the H5N1 in Nigeria during 2006, with
map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4494>.
A new update is anticipated.
