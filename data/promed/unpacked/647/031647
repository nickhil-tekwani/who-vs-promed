Dozens of people have been made ill after eating British eggs contaminated with one of the most dangerous forms of _Salmonella_, the Bureau can reveal, despite government assurances that the risk had been virtually eliminated. There have been at least 100 cases recorded in the past 3 years, and 45 since January [2019], in a major outbreak that health officials have traced back to contaminated eggs and poultry farms.

Despite outbreaks of this strain occurring for more than 3 years, the government has issued no public warnings about the safety of hens' eggs. In 2017, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) told the public that it was safe for vulnerable people, including pregnant women, the elderly, and children, to eat raw, runny, or soft-boiled eggs. At the time, the head of the FSA said, "The risk of _Salmonella_ is now so low you needn't worry."

Internal records obtained by the Bureau show that 25 egg-laying poultry flocks in the UK have tested positive for _Salmonella_ in 2019. Seven were contaminated with the most serious strains of the bacteria, including _Salmonella_ Enteritidis, the strain behind this major outbreak. Two
egg-packing factories -- one of which supplies leading supermarkets -- have also been contaminated. _Salmonella_ bacteria are found in the guts of livestock, including chickens.

Eggs from the infected flocks were kept from sale and either sent for processing to kill the bacteria or disposed of, while the birds were culled. However, contaminated eggs still reached the public, with Public Health England (PHE) confirming 45 people had been poisoned since January 2019. The exact route to the public is unclear. PHE told the Bureau it was not aware of any deaths.

An egg business that supplies major supermarkets is among those contaminated by the bacterium. One of Fridays Ltd's egg-packing factories was temporarily closed this year [2019] to deal with _Salmonella_, which has also been found on 3 farms that supply the business. The company, which produces 10m eggs a week, confirmed it had removed the farms from its supply chain and disinfected the factory.

Fridays said in a statement: "Like all responsible UK egg farmers and egg packers, we carry out regular testing of our firms and those of our suppliers ... _Salmonella_ occurs naturally in the environment. However, with regular precautionary testing, vaccination of hens, and rigorous control procedures, its prevalence in farming can be minimized."

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
