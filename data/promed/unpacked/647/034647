In Dagestan, the 2nd case of transmission of anthrax to a person in the past 10 months was reported by the regional department of the Ministry of Health. This time, the disease was confirmed in a 52 year old resident of the village of Kakashura, the ministry said in a statement. The resident was hospitalized in an infectious diseases hospital. Doctors confirmed that he had a skin form of this disease which is easier to tolerate than the pulmonary and gastrointestinal forms. Currently the condition of the patient is assessed as moderate.

The department noted that the hospitalized man was engaged in butchering cattle after slaughter. Doctors are now monitoring the well-being of those who have been in contact with the patient.

After the incident with the transmission of the disease to humans [was confirmed], an interdepartmental commission was created in the region to investigate the causes and source of infection, as well as to find out the circle of people who else could have been exposed and become infected.

In October last year [2020], transmission of the disease to humans was confirmed in the village of Kakamakhi, Karabudakhkent region, where 5 people were hospitalized with suspicion of anthrax.

Anthrax is a particularly dangerous infectious disease of farm animals caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax from sick animals can also infect humans. In humans, the disease presents with fever, the formation of red spots, bubbles and ulcers on the skin, and increase in lymph nodes. In the acute course of the disease, a lethal outcome is possible on the 2nd or 3rd day after the initial clinical signs.

[Our thanks to Mahmoud, yet again, for this report.

Dagestan is an autonomous republic of Russia. It is small -- 19 400 square miles and 2.9 million people -- on the north west Caspian Sea coast and adjoins Azerbaijan, Chechnya, and Georgia. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan.

Latterly, OIE has reported limited outbreaks in 2005, 2010, and 2012, but nothing since. Because of the civil unrest in the country, we may presume that the disease is underreported, though sporadic. This apparently singular case resulted yet again from the careless butchering of a bull that had died of anthrax. I would not be surprised if there had not been other livestock dead from anthrax in this village at the same time. - Mod.MHJ
