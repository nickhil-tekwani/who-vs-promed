[The UK Department of Health web-site has been revised and the monthly new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now appended to the
table "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK by Calendar Year (since 1990)"
which can be accessed at
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/94/42/04109442.pdf>
The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and, the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of
Health web-site, or, by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693)
The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, abbreviated CJD (new var.)
or vCJD in ProMED-mail, in the UK appears to have plateaued, or perhaps to be
in decline. Therefore, since many of the reports appearing in the update are
only peripherally related to the situation in the UK, the opportunity is being
taken to drop the designation UK from the title of this thread.
Also data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and GSS) are
now included where they have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of
vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of 3 Jun 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today issuing the latest information about the
numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease. This includes cases of
variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD] - the form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The
position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 107
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 150
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 155
(The next table will be published on Mon 4 Jul 2005)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Tue 3 May 2005, the
total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD remains unchanged at
150. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has increased from 5 to 6.
Therefore the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead
and alive) has increased by one from 155 to 156. - Mod.CP]
[Total Creutzfeldt-Jakob Cases in the UK for 2005
-------------------------------------------------
As of 3 Jun 2005, so far in the UK for the year 2005 there have 40 referrals
of suspected CJD; and there have been 13 deaths from sporadic CJD, one from
GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), one from familial CJD, one from
iatrogenic CJD and 2 from vCJD. Data for years since 1990 can be accessed at

[2] UK: Delayed disclosure of contaminated blood donation

An 18-year-old boy died from vCJD in March 1997 -- one of 4 victims in a
cluster of cases in the Yorkshire village of Armthorpe. What the public never
learned was that the Edinburgh-based National vCJD Unit knew before the 18-
year-old's death that he was a registered blood donor. His father told doctors
as his son lay in coma but was ordered to keep quiet so that Government
inspectors could investigate the cluster without scaring the public.
A year later, the father learned the authorities had traced at least 7 people
who had been given his son's blood -- but that none of them would be told. For
7 years those known to have received the boy's tainted blood were kept in the
dark until scientists decided last September [2004] that they should be
informed.
They are among 14 people in Britain known to have received vCJD-tainted blood.
They have not been identified, but all have been offered counselling. The
decision to contact them came only after the 1st case emerged of a patient
possibly dying from vCJD contracted through a blood transfusion.
Last night the boy's father said that: "I have carried this awful secret
around for 7 years, knowing my son might have unwittingly sentenced these poor
people to death. I never agreed with their policy but was forced to go along
with it. I was told that if I went public it would spark panic across the
country. To hear that none of the people they had traced was going to be
warned was absolutely devastating and not what my son would have wanted. It
was as though these people weren't humans at all. I want to see a public
inquiry launched into this now -- it is the least these 7 people deserve. I
also want to know how they can also be so sure that only 7 people were
affected."
Thousands of people can be infected by one contaminated blood product --
depending on the way it is used and dispersed. Blood products are used in
countless procedures: Injections to rehydrate burn victims, for example, can
contain elements derived from blood. Following its change in policy, the
Department of Health in 2004 wrote to more than 6000 patients who may have
received vCJD-contaminated blood. The cover-up is confirmed in the Minutes of
a meeting of the Doncaster Health Authority on 9 Nov 2001. They reveal how the
National vCJD Unit kept a secret log of people given blood from the boy and
other donors infected with vCJD. The Minutes, obtained by Jim Oldfield, editor
of the Armthorpe Community Newsletter, say the recipients would not be
informed and explain that if they later donated blood, it was to be thrown
away. At this meeting was Doctor Ken Allen, the consultant in Communicable
Disease Control in Doncaster, who led the Armthorpe CJD investigation. Dr
Allen, who is now retired, said: "It was national policy to not pass on
information to blood recipients, so our hands were tied. You have to consider
what impact it might have had on these people. It could have ruined their
lives."
[I believe the thinking at the time was why worry the recipients unnecessarily
when the incubation period was likely to be years and some of them might turn
out not to have been infected after all. - Mod.JW]
The so-called "new-variant" Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease emerged in Britain in
1995, and is attributed to contaminated meat products. There are 146 known or
probable deaths from vCJD, and 5 people live with the disease. Last night a
spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it was "satisfied" with the
Armthorpe inquiry, adding: "Throughout our handling of the issue of vCJD we
have adopted a highly precautionary approach based on the best available
expert opinion, taking a series of steps as new evidence became available to
maximise the protection of the public."

Emerging Infections: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Update Report
------------------------------------------------------------
This 6-monthly update on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) includes reports of
activities involving CJD of all types, including variant CJD [abbreviated as
CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], that are coordinated by the CJD
Section of the Department of Emerging Infections and Zoonosis at the Health
Protection Agency's Centre for Infections (CfI) (1).
For numbers of CJD case reports, readers should consult data provided by the
National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU), in Edinburgh (2). The latest
quarterly analysis of vCJD reports (onsets and deaths) may also be found on
the NCJDSU website (3).

Public health advice and activities on the prevention of iatrogenic
transmission of CJD and vCJD
----------------------------
The CfI provides the secretariat for the CJD Incidents Panel (4), supports
local investigations of CJD incidents (i.e. events where there is potential
for transmission of CJD between patients through invasive clinical
procedures), and coordinates notifications of individuals identified as at
risk of CJD or vCJD. Incidents involving surgery that were reported to the CJD
Incidents Panel during the first 4 years of operation (up to 31 Aug 2004) are
summarised below.
Table 1 shows the number of CJD surgical incidents reported to the CJD
Incidents Panel since it was established in August 2000 up to 31 Aug 2004.
Surgical incidents occur when instruments that are considered potentially
contaminated with the CJD agent during use on an index patient have been
subsequently re-used on other patients. 183 surgical incidents were reported
to the Panel during its first 4 years. 47 percent of these involved an index
patient with sporadic CJD, 28 percent involved an index patient with vCJD, 19
percent involved other types of CJD and patients at risk of CJD. For 7 percent
of reports CJD was suspected but eventually ruled out as the index patient's
diagnosis.
Table 1 CJD Surgical Incidents reported to the CJD Incidents Panel between 27
Aug 2000 and 31 Aug 2004, by year and diagnosis of index patient
Final diagnosis of index patient / Total
Sporadic CJD (possible, probable or definite) / 86
Variant CJD (possible, probable or definite) / 61
Other types of CJD, or 'at risk' of CJD, or CJD type unclear / 34
Not CJD / 12
Total / 183
Surgical incidents often involve a number of procedures from different
specialties. Table 2 shows the numbers of reported procedures by speciality.
Table 2 Procedures reported to the CJD Incidents Panel between 27 Aug 2000 and
31 Aug 2004, by year and speciality. [In the case of both tables the original
document should be referred to for the annual totals. - Mod.CP]
Speciality / Total (Percent)
Gastroenterology / 68 (18)
Obstetrics and gynaecology / 27 (7)
Neurology/Neurosurgery / 27 (7)
Orthopaedics / 40 (11)
Ophthalmology / 28 (8)
Ear nose and throat / 26 (7)
Dentistry / 28 (8)
Other / 122 (34)
Total / 364 (100)
Investigation of past surgical incidents occasionally resulted in advice to
remove from surgical use on patients other than the index patient (to
quarantine or destroy, or donate for research) instruments considered to be
potentially contaminated with the CJD agent. Such advice was generally only
given for instruments that had not undergone more than 10 cycles of use and
decontamination since their use on certain index patients. During the last
reporting year (year 4, 2003-2004) the Panel advised that instruments be
removed from use on other patients following use on an index patient with, or
at-risk of, CJD in 2 incidents.
For reports to 31 Aug 2004, advice has been given to contact and inform 7
patients who were involved in 10 surgical incidents of their potential
exposure to CJD via surgical instruments. Such advice was generally only given
for patients who were definitely exposed to potentially contaminated
instruments immediately after the instruments had been used on certain index
patients. It was advised that these patients should be considered to be
potentially at risk of CJD for public health purposes and asked to take
certain precautions (i.e. not to donate blood or other tissues, and to inform
their medical and dental carers prior to any invasive procedures) in order to
reduce the potential risk of onward transmission of the CJD agent by possible
iatrogenic routes.
Geographically associated cases of vCJD
---------------------------------------
The geographic distribution of vCJD cases across the United Kingdom (UK) may
reflect the path by which they became infected. This may be similar over wide
geographic areas, or be associated with localised factors. In 2000, a cluster
of 5 cases of vCJD was investigated in Leicestershire. Statistically, these
cases were unlikely to have arisen by chance, and extensive enquiries revealed
factors that may have augmented the risk of acquiring vCJD in the local
population: the consumption of beef purchased from butchers where there was a
risk of cross-contamination of carcass meat with BSE-infected bovine brain.
Following this investigation a standard public health approach to the
investigation of any geographically associated cases (GAC) of vCJD has been
adopted. This requires the sharing of information gathered with consent from
the families of the cases involved in a multi-disciplinary investigation lead
by the local department of public health, with support from the National vCJ!
D-GAC Investigations Steering Group. Unlike the Leicestershire investigation,
statistical evidence of clustering (i.e., that a geographical association is
unlikely to have arisen by chance) is not a pre-condition for investigation.
The aim of these vCJD-GAC investigations is to help to identify risk-factors
for transmission and possible ongoing risk. Investigations focus primarily on
the identification of dietary and medical links between cases and of exposures
to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent, or the possibility of
iatrogenic transmission between cases that could plausibly explain their local
occurrence. Other explanations are also considered. By the end of March 2005,
154 cases of probable or definite vCJD had been reported in the UK. 5 of the
154 cases were part of the Leicestershire cluster. A further 35 cases had been
involved in 12 subsequent vCJD-GAC investigations across the UK.
National Anonymous Tonsil Archive
---------------------------------
The National Anonymous Tonsil Archive (NATA) is a national unlinked anonymous
survey of tonsil tissue that will be used in studies on the prevalence of
abnormal prion protein, the agent believed to be responsible for infection
with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) (6). A distinctive feature of
vCJD is the distribution of abnormal prion protein in the peripheral lymphatic
system, particularly tonsil tissue, which may be detected during the pre-
clinical phase of the disease during which infection may be transmitted.
Through testing tonsil specimens, the study offers an opportunity to measure
the population prevalence of asymptomatic infection and to refine projections
of vCJD incidence to help plan interventions to limit the impact of infection,
and to plan care-provision for those who may develop the disease.
NATA began at the end of 2003 and aims to collect 100 000 pairs of tonsils
from over 100 NHS hospital trusts during the next 3 years. The study is
managed by the Health Protection Agency and sponsored by the Department of
Health and the Medical Research Council. Tonsils are being collected from
people of all ages during routine tonsillectomies. Only tissue not required
for patient care that would normally be discarded is included, and patients
are given an opportunity to object to their tissues being used in the archive.
The number of tonsil pairs received per month between January 2004 and April
2005 has reached a total of 9970 by the end of April 2005. The number of
tonsil pairs received each week should continue to increase as more hospitals
are recruited into the study. The number of collection forms that have been
completed but against which no tonsil tissue was collected is 431 (369 due to
patient objection and 172 due to clinical pathology being requested on the
specimen as part of the patient's care). By April 2005, 59 of the 100 NHS
hospital trusts that perform over 200 tonsillectomies each year in England
were regularly sending tonsil pairs to NATA. A further 41 hospitals trusts
received a recruitment visit and are expected to begin collecting tonsils
shortly. Recruitment of hospitals continues, with the expectation that the
target recruitment rate of 500 tonsil pairs per week will be met. Currently
approximately 50 000 tonsillectomies are performed annually in England.

UK: Brain Surgery May Have Exposed 50 Patients to CJD
-----------------------------------------------------
As many as 50 patients may have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) following brain surgery during the 1980s. Attempts by doctors in
Edinburgh to track down their former patients have been hampered because,
according to NHS Lothian, the medical records of many of the people at risk
have been destroyed. During a 10-year period from 1982 to 1992, the affected
patients underwent a surgical procedure that was subsequently linked with the
infectious agent, the human equivalent of BSE or Mad Cow Disease.
Doctors say up to 5 patients a year could have undergone grafts within that
period. Most of the operations would apparently have taken place at the
Western General Hospital where the Neurosurgery Department is still based.
During the neurosurgery a material manufactured from human cadavers was used
as a "patch" for the thick outer layer of the brain, the dura. The material,
Lyodura, was withdrawn from the market 9 years ago following links with CJD.
The current scare follows the inquest into the death of a 34-year-old man in
England who contracted the infectious agent from a contaminated Lyodura graft.
In an effort to reassure the public, officials at NHS Lothian insisted
yesterday there was no need for concern, as the risks of anyone being affected
were small. They say they are awaiting advice from the Department of Health's
CJD Incidents Panel about notifying patients who may have received the grafts.
Dr Charles Swainson, medical director of NHS Lothian, says the CJD
surveillance unit in Edinburgh is monitoring the situation and providing
evidence to the Coroner, but many patients who may have been affected will
have had their records destroyed in line with national policy on the retention
and destruction of records. According to a leading scientist from the
surveillance unit the risk of any patient having contracted the disease
was "very low".
Professor Robert Will, consultant neurologist at the Western General Hospital
and the founder of the surveillance unit, gave evidence at the inquest into Mr
Stratford's death. He said that Lyodura has been used in thousands of
operations worldwide and there have only been 168 recorded cases of CJD,
mostly in Japan, and only 6 or 7 in the UK. However, Frances Hall, trustee of
the Human BSE Foundation, a support group for families and victims of the
virus, says tracing the former patients was vital, as one of the biggest
dangers is that these people may have been transmitting it by donating blood
or organs and unknowingly passing on the virus.
