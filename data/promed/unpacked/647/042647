An important new apricot disease in Spain is associated with _Hop stunt
viroid_ infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The province of Murcia (Murcia Region) is the one of the most important
apricot growing regions in Europe. In recent years, a fruit disorder named
by growers as "degeneracion" has been detected in apricot commercial
orchards of this region, mainly in the variety Velazquez Fino.
Affected fruits are characterized by changes in their external appearance
involving rugosity and a loss of organoleptic characteristics, which leads
to an unmarketable product. In order to identify the causal agent of this
disorder, the presence of the most important viruses affecting stone fruit
trees and _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) was tested. While negative results were
obtained for all viruses analysed, the viroid was detected in all the
symptomatic trees.
Within a single tree, the viroid was restricted to branches bearing fruits
with the characteristic symptoms but was usually absent from the rest of
the tree. Sequence analysis of several isolates of HSVd obtained from these
affected trees revealed the presence of 2 variants previously detected in
other apricot cultivars. Taken together, these results suggest that
degeneration is associated with HSVd.

[HSVd (genus _Hostuviroid_, family _Pospiviroidae_) was 1st described as
the causal agent of hop stunt disease in Japan. It has since been found
worldwide, infecting a wide range of both woody and herbaceous plants
including citrus, stone fruit species, grapevine, and pomegranate with
symptoms ranging from latent to severe in different hosts. Specific
sequence variants have been isolated from hop, almond, apricot, citrus,
cucumber, grapevine, peach, pear, and plum. Three major phylogenetic groups
have been suggested, namely plum-type, hop-type, and citrus-type isolates.
Recombinants of these have also been identified.
_Citrus cachexia viroid_, _Cucumber pale fruit viroid_, _Peach dapple
viroid_, and _Plum dapple viroid_ are economically important pathogens
related to HSVd, but are classified as separate species in the same genus.
HSVd causes the economically serious dapple fruit disease in plum and
peach, but was previously described as latent in apricot. In plum and
peach, HSVd susceptibility was found to vary widely between species and
cultivars. The situation observed in apricot may be similar.
Most viroids have been shown to be transmissible by mechanical means, and
it has been suggested that contaminated pruning tools may play a role in
the spread of viroids in commercial orchards.
