Local authorities may have covered up outbreaks of a disease that has
killed tens of thousands of pigs in China, the nation's chief vet
said yesterday [19 Aug 2007], but insisted there was no cause for panic.
The highly infectious blue ear pig disease has killed 68 000 pigs
across China and led to another 175 000 being slaughtered, Jia
Youling, chief veterinary officer at the Ministry of Agriculture,
told reporters.
Some Western press reports have said the number of infected pigs is
much higher than disclosed government figures, citing as evidence the
dramatic spike in pork prices in China this year [2007].
"Although there may be some cover-ups (by local authorities), it is
absolutely impossible (that) the figure could be as big as...
millions or 10 million as reported by the media," Jia said.
"Panic was caused because people didn't know (it was) blue ear
disease and had no idea how to deal with it. But it doesn't mean the
number of infected pigs is huge."
Jia said that an effective blue ear vaccine had been developed and
distributed to the regions most seriously hit, and that the spread of
the disease was now under 'preliminary control.' He said more than
100 million pigs had been vaccinated. "So far, no blue ear disease
has been found in places that have done the vaccination."
Jia said China last year [2006] had 500 million pigs, the staple meat
in most Chinese diets, in stock.
A China-based adviser to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation [FAO], Guo Fusheng, told AFP that the official tally of
infected pigs was probably not accurate, but that there was little
risk to humans.
"Since in the 1980s, when the disease was found in America, Europe
and other places in the world, not a single case has been found to
have spread to human beings," Guo said. "And no other animals have
been infected by the blue ear disease except pigs."

China rejected criticism that it had downplayed an outbreak of a
disease in pigs, saying Monday [20 Aug 2007] it had been "open and
transparent" with the international community.
As of Sunday [19 Aug 2007], blue ear pig disease had spread to 26
Chinese provinces, killing 68 000 pigs and prompting officials to
destroy an additional 175 000 pigs, said Jia Youling, chief
veterinary officer with the Ministry of Agriculture.
China has so far vaccinated 100 million pigs against the disease,
which is also known as highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome [PRRS], he said. The disease does not affect
people but can be fatal for pigs.
"We have currently seen initial success in controlling the outbreak
of highly pathogenic blue ear pig disease," said Jia. He added that
China had been "open and transparent" about the disease and had
provided regular updates to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization [FAO].
"This has prevented unnecessary suspicion and misunderstandings and
helped the international community understand the situation," said Jia.
A New York Times article last week [13-19 Aug 2007] said Beijing had
failed to share tissue samples of affected pigs with the
international community and that China's lack of transparency about
the disease was creating fears of a global pandemic [see ProMED-mail
posting 20070816.2679].
Jia said the ministry was prepared to provide such samples but that
no international body had so far made such a request.
Guo Fusheng, a technical advisor with the FAO, confirmed that the
organization had not yet asked China for tissue samples.

[Hopefully, internationally reputable diagnostic and/or research
centres will express their willingness to receive representative
samples from China and offer their services for comparative studies
with PRRS virus strains from other sources including Viet Nam,
pertaining to infectivity, pathogenicity, serology, and genetic
profiling, and to check the possible involvement/interaction with
other pathogens. ProMED-mail will gladly publish such offers. - Mod.AS]
