International organizations have come together to launch a new One Health High-Level Expert Panel to improve understanding of how diseases with the potential to trigger pandemics emerge and spread.

The panel will advise 4 international organizations -- the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Health Organization (WHO) -- on the development of a long-term global plan of action to avert outbreaks of diseases like H5N1 avian influenza, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and, possibly [see comment], COVID-19. Of all emerging infectious diseases, 3/4 originate in animals.

[The panel] will operate under the One Health approach, which recognizes the links between the health of people, animals, and the environment and highlights the need for specialists in multiple sectors to address any health threats and prevent disruption to agri-food systems.

Key 1st steps will include systematic analyses of scientific knowledge about the factors that lead to transmission of a disease from animal to human and vice versa, development of risk assessment and surveillance frameworks, identification of capacity gaps, as well as agreement on good practices to prevent and prepare for zoonotic outbreaks.

The panel will consider the impact of human activity on the environment and wildlife habitats. Critical areas will include food production and distribution, urbanization and infrastructure development, international travel and trade, activities that lead to biodiversity loss and climate change, and those that put increased pressure on the natural resource base, all of which can lead to the emergence of zoonotic diseases.

The panel will guide development of a dynamic new research agenda and draw up evidence-based recommendations for global, regional, national, and local action.

[On 29 Mar 2021, the 4 mentioned international organizations (coined "the partners") published a "Joint Call for Experts - One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP)"; the deadline for submission was 16 Apr 2021 (https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/call-for-experts-one-health-high-level-expert-panel-(ohhlep)).

The joint call was accompanied by "Terms of Reference" [TOR] for the OHHLEP; see at https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/food-safety/call-for-experts/call-for-experts-onehealth-tor.pdf?sfvrsn=6e157c0f_38.

According to the TOR, "the OHHLEP will have up to 20 experts who shall serve in their personal capacities to represent the broad range of disciplines relevant to One Health, and in science and policy-related sectors and disciplines relevant to the tasks of the OHHLEP, and in particular in the following fields:
- emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses;
- viral diversity, surveillance, and risk assessment for emerging pandemic threats;
- infectious disease epidemiology, prevention, and control;
- biodiversity, wildlife and ecosystems health;
- health systems policy and practice and pandemic preparedness;
- food systems and their interlinkages with health;
- social, economic, and behavioural sciences relating to One Health;
- disciplines in informatics, modelling, prediction, and foresight relevant to assessing impacts of environmental and other changes on emerging diseases and health;
- climate and environment."

The launching of the expert panel seems to be an outcome of the selection and nomination of the experts who were expected to submit candidacies by 16 Apr [2021]. In case affirmative, information about their identities and respective fields of expertise will be welcomed.

COVID-19 and, in particular, its origin, deserves to become a prioritized subject to be addressed by such an international high-level experts panel; the prefix "possibly" may reflect behind-the-scenes discussions, requiring clarification. - Mod.AS]
