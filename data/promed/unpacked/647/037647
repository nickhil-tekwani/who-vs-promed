A fresh infectious poliomyelitis case has been detected in Afghanistan, bringing the number of confirmed cases of polio virus to 15 so far this year [2018], the Afghan Public Health Ministry said [Wed 26 Sep 2018].

"A new polio virus case was registered in Bagh-e-Shahr neighborhood, of southern Kandahar province recently," the ministry said in a statement. According to the statement, the paralyzed 2-year-old girl's family lives in an area where some locals do not allow health workers to conduct polio vaccination.

On [Mon 24 Sep 2018], the ministry launched a 5-day polio vaccination campaign in 27 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, which will wrap up [Fri 28 Sep 2018].

The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country, according to the Health Ministry.

[As stated in the above media report, this is now the 15th case of polio confirmed in Afghanistan during 2018. Presumably this is a WPV1 associated case, but confirmation of the virus type responsible for this case will come when the case is officially reported through the global updates.

Kandahar province has been a location with known WPV1 circulation as seen by the period positive environmental sampling for polioviruses in the country. It borders with Pakistan.

[3] Pakistan - violence with fatality, security personnel

Gunmen have shot and killed a police officer assigned to protect polio workers in northwestern Pakistan, officials say. The office of the deputy commissioner for the Bajur tribal district said that the police officer was on his way to a health center in the village of Dabra on [Mon 24 Sep 2018] when he was shot.

A local government official, Anwarul Haq, said that a number of suspects were detained following the attack in Bajur district, which borders Afghanistan.

Taliban militants have killed scores of anti-polio workers in Pakistan in the past decade because they believe vaccination campaigns are part of a Western conspiracy and claim that it will sterilize Pakistani children.

No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the latest killing, which came amid a weeklong, nationwide campaign aimed at vaccinating 38.6 million Pakistani children under the age of 5.

A 3-day anti-polio drive was launched in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the 7 tribal districts on [Mon 24 Sep 2018], during which more than 6.5 million children were expected to be vaccinated.

Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria are the only countries in the world where polio is still endemic.

A UN-funded vaccination campaign has helped Pakistan to control the spread of the disease. The number of newly affected children came down to only 4 so far this year compared to 306 in 2014.

[It is a sad commentary of the current political and social situation in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, where violence against workers conducting polio vaccination activities continues. Note that in part [1] the newly confirmed case lives in a neighborhood where "some locals do not allow health workers to conduct polio vaccination", and in part [2] a vaccinator is injured in Pakistan and in part [3] a security person protecting the vaccinators is murdered.

A sobering statistic in the August 2018 Situation Report on the Polio Eradication effort is that the number of districts with positive environmental samples through end of August 2018 was 22, compared with 18 during the same time frame in 2017, suggesting that the WPV1 continues to find susceptible individuals to infect and continue the transmission cycle in a larger geographic area during 2018 when compared with 2017 (see https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Pakistan-Polio-Update-August-2018.pdf for details). - Mod.MPP
