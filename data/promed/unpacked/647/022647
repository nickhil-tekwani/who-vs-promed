The first case of yellow fever (YF) contracted in the Federal District of
Brasilia has been confirmed by the State Health Secretariat. The victim was
a 22 year old man who had twice refused vaccination. He contracted the
infection in the rural region of Planaltina, a satellite town of Brasilia,
& died on 25 Mar 2000. The disease is thought to have been brought there by
monkeys coming from neighboring Goias State. 3 other suspect cases of
sylvan YF from satellite towns in Goias have been hospitalized in Brasilia.
So far this year (2000) there have been 48 cases with 24 deaths, and 16
additional suspect cases are pending confirmation. According to the
National Health Foundation, from 100-200 cases of sylvan YF occur annually,
mainly in the the North (Amazonia) & West-Central regions, & mostly during
the rainy months of January-April, but this year the number of cases in
Goias & Mato Grosso States & the Federal District are above average.
YF vaccination began on 4 Apr 2000 in the 99 municipalities of Northwest
Sao Paulo State; 600 000 doses will be delivered. There has been one death
& 2 suspect cases of YF in that region.
