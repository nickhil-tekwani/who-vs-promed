From: Scott McBurney <smcburney@Upei.CA>

To address a few points:
1. The neuronal changes and myelin degeneration associated with
copper deficiency (i.e., enzootic ataxia), and described in various
species of mature deer, were not observed in the CNS of the moose
affected by this neurological condition.
2. Microscopic changes consistent with a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy were also not present.
3. A few of the affected moose were infected with _Dermacentor
albipictus_ (winter tick), but, to my knowledge (and I stand to be
corrected), this particular tick has not been associated with tick
paralysis.
4. Tissues from the affected moose will soon be sent for
immunohistochemisty to test for rabies (terrestrial rabies is not
endemic in Atlantic Canada, although we have had sporadic cases of
rabies in terrestrial mammals involving the bat strain of the virus),
West Nile Virus (also not endemic in Atlantic Canada but there is
ongoing surveillance for the virus) and other arboviruses.
