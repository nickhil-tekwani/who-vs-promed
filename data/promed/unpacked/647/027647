Meat is the main route of transmssion of toxoplasma
----------------------------------------------------
Eating raw, undercooked or undercured meat is the main risk factor for an
infection that can lead to brain damage in unborn babies, the British
Medical Journal reported Friday. In a study of 1 000 pregnant women across
Europe, doctors found that eating undercooked pork, lamb and beef
contributed to between 30 percent and 63 percent of the parasite infection
toxoplasmosis.
The single most important health message for pregnant women...is to avoid
eating any meat that has not been thoroughly cooked, the study reported.
Though the infection is common and relatively harmless across the general
population in Britain, about 25 percent of women who initially contract it
during pregnancy are likely to transmit it to their babies, said Ruth
Gilbert, one of the study's authors and a senior lecturer in epidemiology
at University College, London [Institute of Child Health]. She said the
rise of organic farming was worrisome because animals reared in outdoor,
unhygienic conditions were more likely to contribute to the infection. The
authors also found that contact with soil as well as travel outside of
Europe, the United States and Canada were significant risk factors.

[The study is found in today's issue (15 Jul 2000) of the British Medical
Journal (Cook et al. Sources of toxoplasma infection in pregnant women:
European multicentre case-control study. BMJ 2000,312:142-47). This is the
first study that provides data on the relative importance of _Toxoplasma_
infections from meat and cat feces. The results show that - at least in
Europe - there is a 5 to 10 times higher risk of being infected from meat
compared to soil (oocysts shed from cats). Countries like Austria, Denmark,
France and the New England states of the US screen for congenital
toxoplasmosis, and it now seems likely that the majority of congenital
infections are food-borne. This shows that _Toxoplasma_ infection in meat--
especially pork and lamb-- should be a consideration for the meat industry.
