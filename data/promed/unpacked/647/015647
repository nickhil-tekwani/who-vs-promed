A deadly skin-eating fungus is threatening the fire salamander population in the Netherlands.

It has driven the creature to the brink of extinction in the region, though it's still unknown whether other countries have seen similar declines.

Recognisable by their vibrant yellow and black skin, fire salamanders dropped to a population low of 10 animals before a protection programme began.

The findings, in PNAS [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] journal, explain what caused their decline.

Once researchers observed the near catastrophic decline, the animals were taken into captivity.

A treatment programme was developed and youngsters have now been born. The team plans to reintroduce them into the wild once numbers are back to a sufficient level.

A team of international scientists was able to isolate the fungus after analysing dead salamanders. Its Latin name, _Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans_, means "salamander-eating".

"We need to act urgently to determine what populations are in danger and how best to protect them," said Matthew Fisher from the Imperial College London.

A related fungus, _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (Bd) has already threatened over 200 species of reptiles.

"In several regions, including northern Europe, amphibians appeared to be able to co-exist with Bd.

"It is therefore extremely worrying that a new fungus has emerged that causes mass mortalities in regions where amphibian populations were previously healthy," said lead author An Martel from the University of Ghent.

She added that other countries did not have similar salamander monitoring programmes, so it was unclear whether populations have declined outside the Netherlands.

"This is not the only species that would be susceptible. The problem is you cannot detect it if you don't have a good monitoring programme.

"If the fungus is introduced into other populations, a lot of animals will die. We are encouraging others dealing with amphibian health monitoring programmes to test for the fungus," Professor Martel told BBC News.

The authors showed that _B. salamandrivorans_ causes erosive skin disease and rapid mortality in experimentally infected fire salamanders, and was present in skin lesions of salamanders found dead during the decline event. Compared to Bd, the new fungus has a lower thermal growth preference.

As with Bd, explaining the origin of this pathogen will be challenging. One of the hypotheses to explain the emergence of Bd is that the pathogen was taken out of Africa by wildlife trade of _Xenopus_ spp and propagated after finding suitable hosts. However, evidence indicates that this fungus is not the single cause of the worldwide amphibian decline (it is not necessary nor sufficient to cause population declines). Prevalences to various pathogens (other than chytrid fungus) were greater in declining amphibian populations than in non-declining ones (an indication that pathogens are affecting amphibian populations). It has been shown that global warming can degrade toads' condition and that frog declines caused by the chytrid fungus were preceded by periods of increasing stress (an indication that poor condition is implicated in population declines). In addition, it was found that the severity of the infection by chytrid depends on the vigour of the individual infected. Moreover, amphibians have also declined in areas where the fungus is absent, and the fungus is sometimes present for long periods of time without causing disease. Thus, a 2nd hypothesis worth considering is that impoverished conditions resulting from environmental changes may be triggering vicious cycles (in which the chytrid fungus may be implicated) that are decimating amphibian populations.

The emergence of the pathogenic _B. salamandrivorans_ chytrid fungus is worrying and warrants close monitoring of salamander populations worldwide.
