Yellow fever in Burkina Faso
----------------------------
WHO has received reports of an outbreak of yellow fever in the district of
Gaoua in the southwest of the country, near the border of Cote d'Ivoire.
One case has been laboratory-confirmed by Centre Muraz, Burkina Faso and by
the WHO Collaborating Center for Yellow Fever, the Institut Pasteur, Dakar,
Senegal. Additional samples are being tested.
A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO quickly investigated the
outbreak. The Crisis Committee of Gaoua met, and a rapid vaccination
campaign was carried out covering all those over 6 months old living in a
20-kilometre [radius] around Gaoua. Surveillance has been intensified.
