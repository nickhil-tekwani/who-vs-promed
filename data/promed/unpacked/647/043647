Researchers are closely monitoring cereal crops in Victoria after the detection of a new virus species, Barley virus G, first identified in South Korea. Closely associated with yellow dwarf viruses, it was discovered in Australia for the first time early in 2018.

Agriculture Victoria's Narelle Nancarrow says researchers noticed yellow leaf symptoms along with potentially disease-carrying aphids among volunteer cereals. Testing for barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDV-PAV and BYDV-MAV) and cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV), they discovered instead Barley virus G. "It took us by surprise," Ms Nancarrow says. "It was interesting and concerning."

Little is known about Barley virus G, including how long it may have been in Australia, its epidemiology, distribution, whether a particular type of aphid transmits it, what its relationship is with yellow dwarf viruses or how it affects crops. Researchers are monitoring for re-emergence in both commercial and volunteer cereals and testing further. In the meantime growers are advised to conduct business as usual. Volunteer crops in affected paddocks were sprayed out before the 2018 season.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) viruses are members of the family Luteoviridae. The novel virus tentatively called Barley virus G (BVG; name not yet approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) was described in 2016 from barley crops in South Korea (see link below). Based on full length genome sequencing, it is considered to be a potential new member of the genus _Polerovirus_ in the Luteoviridae.

BYD viruses are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

BYD disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae), including a range of cereal crops. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors.
