From: Peter Roeder <Peter.Roeder@fao.org>

Please allow me to clear up a misunderstanding that seems to be
developing here. FAO issued a press release last week to publicize the
fact it was providing assistance to the government of Iraq under its
Technical Cooperation Program.
The assistance is to carry out some serosurveillance activities to
ensure the situation in Iraq with respect to Rift Valley Fever (RVF)
is clearly understood. Obviously there is some cause for concern that
RVF, once introduced into the Arabian Peninsula (as became clear last
year [2000), could move farther into areas of irrigated farming and
marsh land, both of which might provide suitable vectors for its
maintenance.
I must stress that FAO has no suspicion the virus is present in Iraq
or indeed any Arabian country other than Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It is
purely a precautionary measure. The Iraq authorities have behaved very
sensibly in seeking assistance to ensure the country remains free from
RVF.
It is to be hoped that other countries in the Arabian Peninsula will
similarly undertake studies to demonstrate freedom.
