The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus was found in the blood of a person who died on Sunday [13 Apr 2014] in Turkey's Istanbul.

According to information given to an AA correspondent, a 56-year-old man, who ranches in Kavak village of Boyabat district [Sinop province], removed ticks on his bovine animal on 4 Apr [2014]. On the following day, he was given serum [IV fluids?] after he went to hospital with complaints of weakness and vomit. He went to a hospital again in Kastamonu city, then he was sent to Istanbul with suspected CCHF. However, he lost his life despite all efforts.

The man's blood samples were sent to a laboratory, [found the CCHF virus in it]. Sinop Public Health Director Dr Tahsin Gokhan Telatar told AA that the test results of the blood samples show that the man died due to CCHF.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. Cases have occurred sporadically in Turkey. CCHFV is tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. CCHFV can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent.

Mod.CP (see ProMED-mail archive 20130501.1684736) cited information summarized from a review in The Lancet by Talha Khan Burki (Lancet 2012; 380(9857): 1897-8. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62097-2; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62097-2/fulltext). In its immature form, the tick feeds on small mammals. Later, the adult tick attaches itself to cattle, sheep, goats, or human beings. Livestock show no overt signs of disease, and farmers and slaughterhouse workers have little idea they have been infected until they start expressing symptoms: dizziness, muscular pain, and stiffness, and of course the signature bleeding. Whereas infection in birds mostly tends to be abortive, ostriches are important hosts. In the mid 1990s, South Africa saw a CCHF outbreak at an ostrich abattoir. About 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have reported CCHF. The tick ventures no further than 50 deg north latitude, which cuts across Russia, Ukraine, central Europe, and France; the latter 2 regions are not considered to be at any immediate risk, the _Hyalomma_ spp ticks are present but there is no serological evidence of CCHF. The distribution of known cases across the Middle East and Africa is patchy -- ticks are present in the whole of this region but in many countries it seems harmless. In Africa, only South Africa, and from time to time Mauritania, face ongoing outbreaks; countries such as Tanzania and Uganda have not reported any recent outbreaks; and countries such as Angola and Algeria seem not to be at risk.

Changing patterns of agriculture and flood control may also have played a part. In Turkey affected parts of central Anatolia had been more or less abandoned in the late 1990s due to terrorist activity. Hunting and farming resumed in 2001, and ticks were able to fasten onto the influx of cattle and sheep. The following year [2002], Turkey confirmed its 1st case of CCHF and numbers have steadily increased ever since (which may simply be due to the increased surveillance).

Only 4 countries report more than 50 cases per year: Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (although, it could easily be the case that these countries simply have particularly efficient surveillance systems backed by proper diagnostics).

Boyabat is a district of Sinop Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Sinop province can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2413017,38602. - Mod.TY]
