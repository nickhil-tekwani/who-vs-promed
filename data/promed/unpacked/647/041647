No, we do not have any ORV [Oral Vaccination programs going at this time.
Several places have inquired about it, but since I suspect that funding
will have to be primarily a local concern it has not gone very far.
Some of the ORV programs in the US have done pretty good. What is expected
to be accomplished depends upon the presence/absence of the virus at the
time of administration, terrain, host animal, etc. For various reasons TX
has been extremely effective at containing and then removing the disease in
the coyote population.
Since the disease is over most of NC, given our host animal and terrain, if
ORV were to occur in NC I believe that what we would expect to accomplish
is an amelioration of the effect of rabies rather than a total elimination
of the virus from the wildlife population.
Again, thanks for allowing me to help explain the current situation in
western NC as it relates to the history of the epizootics in the eastern US.
