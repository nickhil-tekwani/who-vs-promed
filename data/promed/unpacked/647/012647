[In response to my inquiry about apparent diffences in dengue/dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) among adults and children in different parts of the
world, Bruce Innis wrote a long and thoughtful response. Others have also
written to try to educate me. I include below the useful ones, including
another from Bruce, who is doing his best to get me up-to-speed. - Mod.CHC

Reading the good note from Bruce on ProMED-mail may leave readers with the
impression that severe dengue in Thailand in adults is a rare disease among
local residents. This is no longer true. I have seen 1-3 adult Thai
patients every month on ID rounds at Chulalongkorn Hospital with serology
proven dengue fever who have had complications such as: renal failure (one
to the extent that we thought he had hantavirus disease or
leptospirosis), severe jaundice and LFTs that were 10X normal, one case of
GBS [Guillain-Barre syndrome that followed classical dengue fever and
simply high fever, myalgias, thrombocytopenia (down to 15,000) and shock.
We did not [isolate viral strains from these patient and the diagnosis was
based on the clinical picture and serology. Our patients come from all
segments of society (one was a deputy minister of health) but most are poor
city dwellers of from rural areas nearby.

Dr. Calisher asked: 1) why most reported dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in
the recent outbreak in Cuba occurred in adults, and 2) why adults in Cuba
sustained dengue disease from secondary infections but adults in SE Asia
where dengue is endemic rarely do.
One hypothesis is that a cohort effect is responsible for the
unusual responses to infection, in particular the absence of DHF among
children.
Cuba reported only rare cases of dengue after 1981, therefore
children less than 16-17 years of age escaped the last major outbreak of
DEN (type 2) in 1981 or the earlier outbreak of DEN (type 1) in 1977. This
means that kids in Cuba during the 1997 outbreak lacked the major known
risk factor for DHF, sensitization by prior infection with a heterologous
type. I predict that children in Cuba in 1997 sustained dengue infection,
that it was clinically inapparent or mild (especially in the very young,
less so in adolescents), and that all infections were primary.
On the other hand, previous serosurveys done after the 1981
outbreak in Cuba suggested that the adult cohort there is comprised of
persons with the following susceptibilities:
% of pop. DHF risk
Susceptible to DEN 1-4 Immune to no DEN Most No
Susceptible to DEN 2-4 Immune to DEN 1 Some Yes
Susceptible to DEN 1, 3-4 Immune to DEN 2 Some Yes
Susceptible to DEN 3-4 Immune to DEN 1-2 Fewest Low?
If one accepts the sequential infection hypothesis that DHF
can be elicited by multiple different infection sequences (as seems to be
the case in with SE Asian DEN virus types), then widespread circulation of
any of the DEN serotypes may have been possible (given the cohort's
susceptibility), could have led to secondary infections of Cuban adults,
and may have elicited DHF. Most adults in SE Asia are immune to >3 types
of DEN because of infections sustained in childhood. Some experts have
hypothesized that broad immunity resulting from at least 2 prior dengue
infections would render a 3rd or 4th DEN infection inapparent or quite mild.
Were virus isolations made in Cuba in 1997? It is my
understanding that all 4 DEN types are now present in the Caribbean region,
as DEN-3 was identified some months ago in Puerto Rico.
In 1995, a substantial epidemic of DHF affected urban centers of
northern India, particularly Delhi. Then too, adults were affected in
large numbers, although there was no cohort effect and children also were
stricken with DHF. I have seen no data on the DEN serotypes involved in
India in 1995; for many years before 1995, multiple DEN serotypes had been
endemic in India.
Dr. Calisher is very correct in highlighting the extraordinary
occurrence of DHF in adults in Cuba. These 2 instances (Cuba and India)
alert us that one may be unable to predict a population's risk for DHF
based purely upon past patterns of DEN exposure. Exposure to a
heterologous DEN infection even after a long interval may be more risky for
DHF than commonly estimated. Additional information from India and Cuba
outbreaks about the risk factors for severe disease and death (and
information on the viruses implicated) would be quite useful in guiding
those of us interested in dengue vaccines.

I have just now seen your plea for enlightenment. As you may have learned
from other sources, the 1997 Cuban epidemic is once again clarifying our
understanding of the secondary infection/DHF phenomenon. First, with no
documented transmission since 1981, the introduction of DEN 2 virus in 1997
resulted in infections in an epidemiologically unique (well, not so unique,
the immunity status in Singapore is almost identical) situation: persons
below age 16 were flavivirus naive; and below age 20 were without
antibodies to DEN 1 virus. That is, only persons 20 and older were immune
to DEN 1 virus. In 1997, these persons were infected with DEN 2 virus and
experienced secondary dengue infections. It is this age group, precisely,
which experienced severe disease. Classical DHF predominated. So, we have
learned that enhanced dengue disease can occur at an interval of 20 years
and from this we must presume that the sensitizing interval can be a
lifetime.
Next, if we could get access to clinical records and serological
results, the scientific community should be able to tease out the clinical
differences between primary DEN 2 illnesses and secondary DEN 2 illnesses
in adults. In some outbreaks, i.e, New Delhi, 1996, gastrointestinal
bleeding seemed to be a major clinical sign. Although I visited New Delhi
and spoke with physicians who provided clinical care, it was not clear
whether bleeding followed leaky capillary syndrome or was an independent
phenomenon. Closer study of the Cuba outbreak may help us understand more
precisely the pathophysiology of severe dengue infections in adults.

[So, people who have had multiple experiences with multiple dengue viruses
(types) are immune to reinfection with these viruses but are the very
people who are at risk for DHF (unless they have had all four types).
Therefore, the young children of Cuba, those who had no experience with
prior dengue infections, could only have presented with primary dengue, and
the older people in Cuba who did have prior experience(s) with dengue, were
at risk for DHF. In addition, in SE Asia, where all dengue types
circulate, adults are no longer susceptible to dengue virus infections.
Given that the four dengue types now circulate in at least some areas of
the Caribbean and that wider distribution, perhaps hyperendemicity, of
these viruses can be expected, it follows that we can now expect to see
more DHF in children and proportionally less DHF in adults in this part of
the world. I am enlightened but not the least bit comforted. Thanks to
Henry, Bruce, Scott and others who sent these remarks. - Mod.CHC
