Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) - Yemen
----------------------------------------
On [22 Nov 2021], the International Health Regulations national focal point (IHR NFP) for Yemen notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in stool samples from 2 children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Yemen.

The 1st case, a 9-year-old girl, from Thubab district, Taiz governorate, south-western Yemen, experienced onset of paralysis on [30 Aug 2021]. The child had not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool samples were collected on [31 Aug 2021] and [2 Sep 2021], and VDPV2 was confirmed on [22 Nov 2021], with 10 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.

The 2nd case, a 26-month-old girl, from Marib district, Marib governorate, north-east of Sana'a city, experienced onset of paralysis on [1 Sep 2021]. The child had also not been vaccinated against polio. Two stool specimens were collected on [4 and 5 Sep 2021], and VDPV2 was confirmed on [22 Nov 2021] with 11 nucleotide differences from the Sabin type 2 poliovirus vaccine strain.

The 2 districts do not share a border and are approximately 430 km [267 mi] apart. The 2 VDPV isolates are genetically linked, and therefore, classified as cVDPV2. This is a new emergence and the viruses detected are not related to other known cVDPV2s globally.

The confirmation of cVDPV2 comes in the context of an ongoing outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), which has to date paralyzed 35 children (3 in 2021, 31 in 2020, and 1 in 2019).

The last VDPV2 case in the country was reported in June 2016 in Aden governorate, southern Yemen, and was classified as ambiguous[1] VDPV2 (aVDPV2). According to the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage, polio vaccine 3rd dose (POL3) coverage was reported to be 66% in 2020.

Public health response
----------------------
The Ministry of Health, supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, conducted a field investigation, and started implementing the polio outbreak preparedness and response plan. In addition, AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced.

WHO risk assessment
The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from 2 governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.

Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.

The Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) convened a meeting in November 2021 on the international spread of poliovirus in multiple countries. As per the report released, the Emergency Committee expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2 to many countries and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently high [report available at https://www.who.int/news/item/23-11-2021-statement-of-the-thirtieth-polio-ihr-emergency-committee].

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of the Emergency Committee, the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk is strongly encouraged. Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict travel of individuals at the point of departure if not vaccinated or cannot prove their vaccination status.

[Unfortunately, Yemen is a good example of the impact of civil unrest combined with the COVID pandemic both seriously reducing vaccination activities in a country. cVDPV1 was 1st identified in an AFP case in 2019, spreading significantly in 2020 with a few residual cases confirmed in 2021. cVDPV2 was identified in late 2021 for the 1st time, not related to an importation as the genetic profile is unique. (https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/weekly-polio-analyses-cVDPV-20211207.pdf). Disturbing is the distance the virus has travelled in the country as the 2 districts are distant from one another (https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/yemen-map.htm).

[2] Comment - transmission, iatrogenic polio
Date: Fri 10 Dec 2021
From: T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]


Ref: ProMED Archive No. 20211210.8700170
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, childhood immunisation activities under EPI have functioned sub-optimally in many countries, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, during 2020 and 2021. Logically we would expect increasing numbers of polio cases, but there is a paradoxical fall in numbers that deserve the question why.

Wild poliovirus (WPV) cases during 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 (till [10 Dec 2021]) were 21, 29, 56 and 4 respectively in Afghanistan and 12, 147, 84 and 1 in Pakistan. Cases due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV-2) were 0, 0, 308 and 43 in the same years in Afghanistan and 0, 22, 135 and 22 in Pakistan. What is striking is the very low numbers of WPV cases in 2021, just 4 and 1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2021 till now. Considering the large numbers of cVDPV cases in 2020, the fall in 2021 is also steep. Perhaps surveillance quality may have declined to partly explain this drop, but an epidemiological explanation is also probable.

There are two schools of thought about the transmission route of WPV and the wild-like cVDPV -- a majority believes it as faecal-oral, but others including me, believe it as respiratory. In developing countries, the basic reproduction number (Ro) of WPV is about 40, with children saturated with infection by age 5, and all cases confined to age 5 and below, which is consistent with respiratory transmission but not faecal-oral. What the pandemic may have contributed is reduced respiratory transmission of all agents on account of mask-wearing and reduced frequency of social contacts.

Obviously, cVDPV-2 polio is the larger problem in both countries; it is clinically indistinguishable from WPV polio. The currently used bivalent OPV contains Sabin types 1 and 3 only; so cVDPV-2 is breeding by itself. As iatrogenic polio goes against the ethics of public health, children in both countries deserve to be vaccinated with at least 2, preferably 3, doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), against which there are no local cultural objections. IPV is both completely safe and exquisitely effective -- with 100% protection against polio due to WPV and cVDPVs.

[It's always a pleasure and thought-provoking to read comments submitted by Prof. T Jacob John. I for one have always felt there was a respiratory route of transmission of the virus and have been a strong supporter of a push to transition to the killed IPV away from the OPV that is responsible for the overwhelming majority of polio related AFP cases. The value of the OPV has been diminished by the surging cVDPV related cases. - Mod.MPP
