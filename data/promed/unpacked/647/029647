[1] Liberia, 2nd new case
Date: 1 Jul 2015

Liberian officials confirmed a 2nd Ebola case on Wed [1 Jul 2015] in the same town where the disease was detected days earlier on the corpse of a teenager, 7 weeks after the country was declared Ebola-free. The infected person was moved to Monrovia, said deputy health minister Tolbert Nyenswah.

Between 100 and 200 Ebola centre workers stormed the Ministry of Health in eastern Monrovia on Wednesday [1 Jul 2015] demanding hazard pay that they said they haven't received since the country was declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization on 9 May 2015. Protesters turned off the building generator, an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, told The Associated Press. "We are all held hostage in the building," the official said, adding that police in the compound were not doing much to quell the protests.

Hard-hit by 1st outbreak
------------------------
Health minister Bernice Dahn said Liberia has paid hazard benefits to "99 per cent" of people who worked in the Ebola treatment units in addition to their regular salaries. She said if there are people who feel they have not been paid, "they should come forward" and make their case with the ministry.

Also on Wed [1 Jul 2015], workers exhumed the body of the 17-year-old male student whose infection, detected after his death, sparked fears of the return of Ebola to Liberia. The country was the hardest hit in the region, with 4800 deaths, before it contained transmission. The new tests will help determine the mode of transmission to the boy, said an official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak about the matter.

Experts warn that Ebola remains a threat to West Africa until it is eradicated from Guinea and Sierra Leone, where it stubbornly hangs on.

Hours after Liberia reported its 1st Ebola death since 9 May 2015, 2 more people tested positive for the disease. An urgent contact tracing operation is underway.

Two more people have tested positive for Ebola in Liberia 7 weeks after the country was declared free of the virus by the World Health Organisation. They were tested after a 17-year-old male they lived with, who died on Sun [28 Jul 2015], was discovered to have had Ebola. The town where he lived, 50 km to the east of the capital Monrovia, has been quarantined, and the ministry of health is conducting an urgent contact tracing operation to see who the teenager was in touch with in the past 21 days.

The re-emergence of Ebola is of deep concern to Liberians and others trying to combat the disease in West Africa. In May 2015, WHO announced Liberia had had no new cases of the disease in the previous 42 days, twice the incubation period of the virus.

The Ministry of Information tweeted news of the 2 new cases on Wed [1 Jul 2015]. The authorities were investigating whether the dead man had contracted the disease as a result of travel.

Numbers of victims have dramatically declined in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Guinea, but the disease is persistent in coastal border districts. However, there have been no recent cases of Ebola in any of the regions bordering with Liberia.

"Although disheartening, the case of Ebola in Liberia is no cause for panic," said Birte Hald, the team leader for Ebola coordination at the International Federation of Red Cross.

The IFRC announced it was expanding its operations in the 3 countries in a bid to stamp out the virus now that the case numbers have been reduced to between 20 and 27 a week, compared to hundreds a week at the disease's peak. "These countries will not be able to begin to fully recover until they get to zero cases and stay there," said Hald. - more

["Other people with symptoms who have been in contact with the boy are under investigation. Over 100 people are listed as contacts and all are being monitored closely," said WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris in an email to Reuters.... Health officials in Nedowein were working to identify the contacts of the boy, who had attended school and visited a local clinic in the week before his death. [Reuters].

"Liberian health officials confirmed that 2 more people have become infected with Ebola after coming into contact with a 17-year-old boy who died from the virus on Sun [28 Jun 2015]... Cestus Tarpeh, a spokesman for the health department in Margibi County, told Agence France-Presse that they are still waiting for additional blood tests but that 2 people who had physical contact with the boy had contracted the virus. The teen became sick on 21 Jun 2015, according to the World Health Organization, which added that health officials have identified at least 102 people who had contact with the boy. That number is expected to rise, the organization said." [Washington Post].

There is some confusion in the media as to whether there are one or 2 new cases in addition to the 17-year-old, but whichever it is, it is bad news. - Mod.JW

[4] WHO situation report 1 Jul 2015
Date: Wed 1 Jul 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-1-july-2015


Summary
--------
There were 20 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 28 Jun 2015, the same as the previous week. Weekly case incidence has been between 20 and 27 cases for 5 consecutive weeks. In Guinea, 12 cases were reported from 3 prefectures: Boke, Conakry, and Forecariah. All 3 prefectures reported cases the previous week. In Sierra Leone, 8 cases were reported from the same 3 districts as the previous week: Kambia, Port Loko, and the district that includes the capital, Freetown. Challenges tracing and monitoring contacts continue to hamper efforts to end transmission, with a proportion of cases not detected until after death, increasing the risk of further transmission.

On 29 Jun 2015, routine surveillance detected a confirmed case of EVD in Margibi County, Liberia, the 1st new confirmed case in the country since 20 Mar 2015. The case is a 17-year-old male who 1st became ill on 21 Jun 2015. After presenting at a local health facility, the patient was treated for malaria and discharged. He died on 28 Jun 2015 and received a safe burial the same day. An oral swab taken before the burial subsequently tested positive twice for EVD. 102 contacts have been identified, although that number is expected to increase as investigations continue. At this stage, the origin of infection is not known. The case reportedly had no recent history of travel, contact with visitors from affected areas, or funeral attendance.

All 3 Guinean prefectures that reported cases in the week to 28 Jun 2015 have reported cases for the past 4 weeks or more, although the area and nature of transmission within those prefectures continues to change. In the northern prefecture of Boke, which borders Guinea-Bissau, 9 of 10 cases were registered contacts. One of these cases is a health worker. The remaining case from Boke is from the coastal sub-prefecture of Kamsar. This case is also a health worker and has generated a substantial number of high-risk contacts. The single case reported this week from Conakry came from the Dixinn commune (municipal district) of the city and arose from an unknown source of infection. Dixinn is the 3rd commune of Conakry to report a case in the past 4 weeks, the others being Matam and Matoto. The remaining case was reported from the prefecture of Forecariah and was a registered contact of a previous case.

Transmission in Sierra Leone remains concentrated in several chiefdoms of Kambia and Port Loko districts, and a single neighbourhood of the capital, Freetown. Half (4) of the 8 cases reported from Sierra Leone arose in the densely populated Magazine Wharf area of Freetown, all of whom have a known link to a case reported from the area the previous week, although the origin of that case is not yet known. Both of the cases reported from the district of Kambia came from quarantined homes in the chiefdom of Tonko Limba. The remaining 2 cases were reported from 2 chiefdoms in the district of Port Loko. One of these cases, which was reported from the chiefdom of Masimera, is linked to the Magazine Wharf chain of transmission.

Ten of the 12 cases reported from Guinea and 4 of the 8 cases reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 28 Jun 2015 were registered contacts of previous cases. Five of the 20 cases reported were identified after post-mortem testing of community deaths.

Two new health worker infections were reported from Boke, Guinea, for a 2nd consecutive week. No new health worker infections were reported from Sierra Leone. There have been a total of 874 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 509 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 443 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 28 Jun 2015, with 11 220 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 12 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 8 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 28 Jun 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

A total of 874 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 509 reported deaths (table 5).

[5] HHS launches National Ebola Training and Education Center
Date: 1 Jul 2015
Source: HHS.gov [edited]
http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2015pres/07/20150701a.html


To ensure that U.S. health care providers and facilities are prepared to safely identify, isolate, transport, and treat patients with Ebola and other emerging threats, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services today [1 Jul 2015] launched a National Ebola Training and Education Center.

A collaborative effort among HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 3 academic institutions, the program supports further training of health care providers and facilities on strategies to manage Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases.

Through the effort, ASPR and CDC will provide USD 12 million over the next 5 years to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia; University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska; and Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City, New York, which together will co-lead the National Ebola Training and Education Center.

"The National Ebola Training and Education Center contributes to our nation's health security by developing and teaching evidence-based practices of experienced providers and health care institutions in caring for patients with Ebola and other serious infectious diseases," said Dr. Nicole Lurie, HHS' assistant secretary for preparedness and response. "While this training starts with Ebola, it also will help the health care community deal with other serious infectious diseases in the future."

Emory University and Nebraska Medical Center have been working with CDC since Dec [2014] to train more than 460 health care workers from 87 health care systems, including 37 designated Ebola treatment centers, on all aspects of infection control and patient care for individuals with Ebola. Emory University and Nebraska Medical Center are offering additional training opportunities this summer for up to 400 staff from Ebola assessment hospitals.

The new National Ebola Training and Education Center will expand on the success of this initial work and offer state health departments and health care facilities additional access to the clinical expertise and training capabilities offered by these institutions.

"The ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa is proof that a threat anywhere can be a threat everywhere; the United States must continue to prepare," said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. "Hospitals are often the 1st place where a new disease threat is recognized. This new center will help our hospitals and healthcare workers prepare to handle new threats and safely care for patients."

HHS recently announced 9 regional Ebola treatment centers that are part of a national network of 55 Ebola treatment centers, but will have enhanced capabilities to treat a patient with confirmed Ebola or other highly virulent disease. Ebola treatment centers are staffed, equipped and have been assessed to have current capabilities, training and resources to provide the complex treatment necessary to care for a person with Ebola while minimizing risk to health care workers.

For more information on how to access the expertise through the National Ebola Training and Education Center, contact <hpp@hhs.gov>. To learn more about Ebola, visit http://www.cdc.gov/ebola.

30 Jun 2015: Liberia's puzzle: How did the new Ebola patient become infected?
http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2015/06/liberias-puzzle-how-did-new-ebola-patient-become-infected
[The deceased, a 17-year-old young man, died on 28 Jun 2015 [see ProMED-mail post Ebola update (83): back in Liberia 1 month, 20 days after 'free' declaration 20150630.3473496]. Health officials initially missed the Ebola diagnosis because the deceased tested malaria positive, which may have kept health workers from testing for the Ebola virus.

A sample was taken from the body after death, an Ebola test was done, and when it came back positive, a team was dispatched immediately to conduct a safe burial. ...

The deceased's home is also an extended distance away from the border regions with Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the Ebola virus is still spreading, and there is no history of the deceased traveling to the border areas of those 2 countries. Traveling within Liberia would not explain the new Ebola infection because Liberia is officially Ebola-free.

There is a possibility that the Ebola virus was reintroduced to Liberia and that the deceased came in contacted with unreported infected persons. If so, this is a worrisome situation because it would mean there is/are Ebola-positive person/s potentially spreading the disease.]

Port Loko DERC Coordinator, Raymond Kabia stated that new measures included a 6-month imprisonment for anyone found violating the Ebola health measures. The measures include no unauthorized burials, no lodgings to a stranger, treating the sick at home, and other measures.

More funds to the District have been available and, as a result, the DERC coordinator has recruited 260 village surveillance officers including youth, village men, and others to help in the eradication of Ebola in the district.]

30 Jun 2015 Liberia: U.S. latest rights on Liberia - Govt officials engage in corrupt practices with impunity
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506301534.html
[The General Auditing Commission (GAC) is Liberia's government auditing office and anti-corruption watchdog. A report by the GAC for the period from August to October 2014 analyzed more than USD 13 million spent by the National Ebola Trust Fund (NETF). The funds mostly came from foreign donations.

According to the GAC report, "The conduct of the affairs of the NETF was marred by financial irregularities and material control deficiencies," read the report, published on the GAC website. Funds allocated for the disease control cannot be accounted for as the Liberian Government attributes it to the situation on ground. The government said in a statement that it welcomed the report and pledged to take appropriate corrective measures, including possible prosecutions and tighter spending controls."

According to the United States Department of Human Rights Report on Liberia for 2014, Liberian government officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity. The World Bank's most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators showed corruption was a serious problem.

It is the responsibility of the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) and the Ministry of Justice to MOJ expose and combat official corruption. The LACC refers cases of corruption to the Ministry of Justice. The MOJ has 90 days to decide whether it will prosecute. If the MOJ does not prosecute, the LACC can then prosecute.

During 2014, the LACC received 26 cases, investigated 11 cases, and recommended 7 cases for prosecution. The LACC recommended to the MOJ for prosecution 13 current and former government officials including the former managing director of the Liberian Petroleum Refining Corporation, the former board chair of the National Oil Company of Liberia, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry, the superintendent of Sinoe County, the publisher of Flash Point newspaper, and the public relations officer at the Ministry of Public Works.]
