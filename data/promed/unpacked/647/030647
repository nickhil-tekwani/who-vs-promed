[Results of the 2002 Canadian national survey for the aphid-transmitted plum
pox virus (PPV), which infects _Prunus_ spp. including peaches, nectarines,
plums, and apricots, indicates that the virus remains confined to Ontario
and Nova Scotia. In Ontario, PPV was not detected outside the quarantine
area and was not detected in any sources of budwood to be used for
propagation. Several infected fruit trees were detected in isolated areas in
Blenheim, Stoney Creek, and Fonthill areas. In Nova Scotia, no PPV has been
found since the original infection in 2000 that was subsequently eradicated
in 2001. The incidence of PPV-infected trees is decreasing in the affected
provinces. No PPV has been detected in British Columbia or
Quebec fruit trees.
In the United States national PPV survey for 2001 (excluding Pennsylvania,
the only known state containing PPV-infected fruit trees), 215 322 samples
were tested in 35 states but none contained PPV.
A useful reference for the US survey:
