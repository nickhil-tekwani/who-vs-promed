6 dead, 10 hospitalized in southern Taiwan
-----------------------------------------------
6 people died and 10 others were hospitalized in Tainan and
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, after contracting melioidosis, also
called Whitemore's disease, 11-29 Jul 2005, the Center for Disease
Control [Taiwan] (CDC), under the Cabinet-level Department of Health,
announced at an emergency press conference held yesterday evening, 30
Jul 2005.

CDC officials said there were 9 such cases reported in Kaohsiung
County, 4 in Tainan City, 2 in Kaohsuing City and one in Tainan
County. Of them, 6 have died, 3 are under intensive care, and 6 are
hospitalized in ordinary wards.
CDC received reports from hospitals in southern Taiwan that 16 people
suffered from fever and frequent vomiting, and some of them died
suddenly. Judging from the symptoms of the patients, doctors found
they had contracted melioidosis, which is an infectious disease
caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_.
The bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and
soil and are spread to humans and animals through direct contact with
the contaminated source. As 14 of the patients lived near the Erhjen
Creek in southern Taiwan, CDC officials said the disease is likely
associated with water pollution.
"Typhoon Haitang, which caused widespread flooding in mid-July 2005,
could have played a role in the illness," said Wu Ping-hui, a section
chief at the CDC. Wu continued that "it is very likely that the heavy
rain washed bacteria out of the soil, which then polluted the water."
CDC officials urged residents in the Erhjen Creek area to be on guard
and avoid contaminated water. Residents are also urged to go to
hospitals and tell doctors where they live immediately after they
suffer from fever.
Premier Frank Hsieh also noted melioidosis is not a notifiable
disease, and said the public doesn't need to panic, urging them to
observe personal hygiene and not to touch contaminated water if they
have open wounds.
CDC officials said people with open wounds and weak immune systems
are susceptible to the bacterium after touching flood debris, sewage
and contaminated soil. They usually die of sepsis.
Melioidosis is predominately a disease of tropical climates, and is
endemic in Southeast Asia.

7th person dies from melioidosis, officials say
-----------------------------------------------
One more melioidosis patient died in southern Taiwan yesterday [31
Jul 2005], bringing the death toll to 7, with 3 remaining in
intensive care units and 9 others in the hospital after contracting
the disease in the wake of a recent typhoon and flooding, the
Department of Health said.
Between 11 and 31 Jul 2005, a total of 19 cases were reported,
compared with 22 since early in 2005.
[Another news report yesterday raises the number of cases to 26.

Also known as Whitmore's disease, melioidosis is an infectious
disease caused by the _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ bacterium. The
bacterium is usually found in contaminated water or soil and is
spread to humans and animals through direct contact. As the majority
of the patients lived along the heavily polluted Erjen Creek that
runs through Tainan and Kaohsiung counties, the health department has
urged the public to be on guard and avoid contaminated water or soil.
Health officials also warned people with diabetes, weak immune
systems or open wounds not to expose themselves to polluted water or
soil. If they do and get a fever, they should immediately seek
medical attention.

[The clinical aspects of the cases are not described nor is the clear
bacteriologic confirmation of the diagnosis.
The use of the word "contaminated" can be somewhat confusing in this
context, since the water and/or soil is not contaminated in the sense
that water can be contaminated with cholera bacilli after exposure to
sewage. _B. pseudomallei_ is commonly found in the soil in focal
areas of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Most cases occur
during the rainy season. A majority of severe cases of melioidosis
occur in diabetes and other immunocompromised groups. Melioidosis, a
category B bioterrorism disease, may be more severe in normal
individuals if a higher inoculum of exposure occurs, at least in a
rodent model. - Mod.LL]
