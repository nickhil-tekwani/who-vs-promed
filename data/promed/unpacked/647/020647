[In ProMED-mail "Prion disease update 2008 (05) 20080408.1285" the
Moderator commented with regard to the 2 recently reported suspected
cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in Spain that more
precise information is awaited on the ages ["youngsters" in the 1st
report] of the patients and their possible exposure to BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy)-contaminated meat, and any links by travel
or occupation with the UK. The following report provides an alternate
version of the situation. - Mod.CP]

Spain reports 2 mad cow deaths
------------------------------
Officials said Monday [7 Apr 2008], 2 people in Spain have died of
the human variant of mad cow disease, in the 1st such fatalities
since 2005. The victims were ages 40 and 51; one died in December
[2007] and the other in February [2008], said Jose Javier Castrodeza,
director of public health at the regional government. Until now
Spain's only fatality from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease came in 2005
with the death of a 26-year-old woman in Madrid.

Officials appealed Monday [7 Apr 2008] for calm and insisted it is
safe to eat beef in Spain. The Castile-Leon regional agriculture
minister, Silvia Clemente, said the 2 new victims apparently
contracted the disease prior to 2001 and health controls on livestock
and meat production are much tighter now than they were then. The
deaths were only reported now because post-mortem testing and Spanish
bureaucratic procedures for recording such fatalities take a long
time, Castrodeza told a news conference.

Mad cow disease was first reported in Britain in the mid-1980s. It
has been blamed on farmers adding recycled meat and bone meal from
infected cows into cattle feed. Authorities believe eating meat from
infected animals can cause the human variant of the fatal
brain-wasting disease. Spain has reported more than 700 cases of mad
cow disease [in cattle] since it was first detected in this country
in 2000, according to health ministry figures.

[In contrast to the traditional forms of CJD, vCJD has affected
younger patients (average age 29 years, as opposed to 65 years), has
a relatively longer duration of illness (median of 14 months as
opposed to 4.5 months). Consequently the phrase "youngster" in the
previous report, as opposed to the ages of 40 and 51 in this report,
would be more in keeping with a diagnosis of vCJD. The questions of
any links of the patients with the UK by travel or occupation remains
to be addressed. It is still unclear whether the diagnosis of vCJD is
supported by laboratory investigation. Additional information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
