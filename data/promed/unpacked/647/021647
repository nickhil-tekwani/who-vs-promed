Delta surges worsen, WHO challenges push for vaccine booster doses
------------------------------------------------------------------
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) today [Mon 12 Jul 2021] warned that the pandemic is worsening with the delta (1617.2) variant spreading at a scorching pace, and chided countries and drug companies for pushing for 3rd vaccine booster doses when many countries don't have enough to protect their health workers and other vulnerable groups.

Meanwhile, in promising vaccine supply developments, the WHO said it has licensed 2 more AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine manufacturing sites--one in Japan and the other in Australia. Also, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced today [Mon 12 Jul 2021] that it has signed purchase agreements with China-based Sinopharm and Sinovac, which will make 110 million doses available to the COVAX program.

WHO: delta surge exposes vaccine inequities
-------------------------------------------
At a briefing today [Mon 12 Jul 2021], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said global COVID-19 cases rose for the 4th week in a row, with deaths now rising, following a 10-week decline. "The delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and death," he said, noting that the variant has now been detected in 104 countries and will likely soon become the world's dominant strain.

In countries with high vaccination coverage, delta spread is impacting unprotected people and putting pressure on health systems. But the situation is particularly bad in low vaccine-coverage countries, where the variant is driving catastrophic waves with high numbers of cases and deaths.

He likened the spread to a forest fire that the world needs to battle together to extinguish, with health workers on the frontlines and older people and at-risk groups the most vulnerable to the flames. "The priority now must be to vaccinate those who have received no doses and protection."

Tedros said current data show vaccination offers long-lasting immunity against severe disease and death, and he urged Moderna and Pfizer to--instead of focusing on boosters for high coverage countries--go all out to channel vaccine supply to COVAX.

"Tens of millions of vaccine dose donations are starting to come through, but we need more and we need them faster," he said.

Vaccine supply developments
---------------------------
The WHO's emergency use listing of the AstraZeneca production sites in Japan and Australia raise the total making the vaccine to 5. "This gives the green light for COVAX to buy vaccines from these additional facilities, and enables countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and roll out vaccines," he said.

AstraZeneca has led on licensing the vaccine around the world to more quickly boost vaccine production, Tedros said, adding that the world needs other manufacturers to follow suit.

Regarding Gavi's announcement on the advance purchase agreements with Sinopharm and Sinovac, the companies will begin making 110 million doses immediately to COVAX participants, with options for more doses. The deal with Sinopharm adds 60 million doses between July and October [2021], with an option to buy 60 million more in the 4th quarter of the year and 50 million more in the first half of 2022. The agreement of Sinovac consists of 50 million doses between July and October [2021], with an option for 150 million more in the 4th quarter of 2021 and 180 million more in the first half of 2022.

Seth Berkley, MD, Gavi's chief executive officer, said, "Thanks to this deal, and because these vaccines have already received WHO Emergency Use Listing, we can move to start supplying doses to countries immediately." Gavi's COVAX portfolio now includes 11 vaccines and vaccine candidates.

[2] Long COVID
Date: Sun 11 Jul 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/11/their-childhood-has-been-stolen-calls-for-action-to-tackle-long-covid?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other


A growing cross-party group of MPs and peers is demanding an urgent overhaul of the services offered to sufferers of long COVID amid warnings that thousands of new cases will emerge every day as coronavirus restrictions are lifted this summer.

Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been urged by the group of more than 60 parliamentarians to revise the lockdown-lifting plans because of the expected surge in long COVID cases, which experts warn could disproportionately affect the young.

The group, which includes former Tory minister Dan Poulter as well as Labour, Lib Dem, Green and SNP MPs, states that lifting restrictions when case numbers are rising and the impact of the vaccine on long COVID is not known "risks placing a large and unsustainable burden on the health service".

"We are concerned that the government's decision to lift most remaining coronavirus public health measures from [19 July 2021] risks exposing many more people to long COVID, including younger age groups who aren't yet fully vaccinated," writes the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, led by the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran. "This condition leaves many unable to work or carry out their regular daily activities, with severe consequences for our NHS and economy."

"The rehabilitation services providing support to long COVID patients are already overstretched and under-resourced, and the current increase in case numbers will increase waiting lists even further."

Just under one million people in the UK were living with long COVID in June [2021]. Around 700 000 were of working age and 33 000 were children. The number with the condition for a year or more has increased to 385 000, according to official statistics.

Serious cases of long COVID among the young have also been emerging. C.H. said her daughter G. was a bright and successful pupil at her school in Northumberland until July last year [2020]. Since then, the 11-year-old has not managed to complete a week in the classroom. "She's lost a lot of weight, and the fatigue kicked in," C.H. said. "She's had horrible headaches, rushes, pains. When she stands up, her heart rate doubles. And she gets brain fog. Some days she can't get out of bed because she feels dizzy. Just having a shower is impossible."

Part of the work at long-COVID clinics is helping sufferers discover their physical limits because overexertion one day can lead to days or weeks in bed. That's much harder for G., her mother said. "Now, if she wants to walk to the park and see her friends, you know that a couple of days later she's not going to be able to get out of bed for 2 days. It's heartbreaking."

Fran Simpson of Long COVID Kids said: "Children who've got long COVID - it's completely destroyed their lives for some of them. They've gone from being children going to school, seeing their friends, having hobbies, to not being able to school. Some are not well enough to walk - they're using wheelchairs. Others are not eating properly because of the impact on taste and smell. It feels like they've had their childhood stolen." About 7% to 9% of children who become infected with COVID go on to develop some long-COVID symptoms, according to Office for National Statistics data.

The group of MPs is demanding that, as a minimum, the government should be collecting regular data on the number of long-COVID cases and estimates of how these will be affected by the government's decision to drop the remaining restrictions. It wants long COVID to be considered a major factor in such decisions, alongside hospitalisations and deaths.

Meanwhile, Javid has also been contacted by the Long COVID Support group, made up of more than 40 000 sufferers, pleading for more help and to "act now to prevent further suffering". The group warns that the huge variety of potential symptoms may be underestimated, citing potential for organ damage.

"Regardless of the severity of their initial illness, many of our members have been incapacitated and unable to undertake their work, education or caring responsibilities for more than a year, with no prognosis," it writes.

The government had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.

[3] Vaccine booster
Date: Fri 9 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/cdc-fda-contradict-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-booster


CDC, FDA contradict Pfizer on COVID-19 vaccine booster
------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late yesterday [Thu 8 Jul 2021] contradicted vaccine makers Pfizer-BioNTech on their assertion that people who received the 2-dose mRNA vaccine will likely need a 3rd booster dose of vaccine within 6 to 12 months of initial administration.

Pfizer said it was working on developing a new mRNA vaccine that targets rising variants of concern, including delta (B1617.2). They also said initial small trial results show a 3rd booster dose of the current vaccine, raised antibodies to variants, including delta and beta.

"While Pfizer and BioNTech believe a 3rd dose of BNT162b2 has the potential to preserve the highest levels of protective efficacy against all currently known variants including delta, the companies are remaining vigilant and are developing an updated version of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that targets the full spike protein of the delta variant," Pfizer-BioNTech said in a press release yesterday [https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2021-07/Delta_Variant_Study_Press_Statement_Final_7.8.21.pdf? IPpR1xZjlwvaUMQ9sRn 2FkeP cBiRPGqw].

In an interview with Reuters, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, MD, PhD, said recent evidence from Israel shows waning protection 6 months after vaccine recipients had completed their 2nd dose of the vaccine.

"It's a small data set, but I think the trend is accurate: 6 months out, given that delta is the most contagious variant we have seen, it can cause infections and mild disease," Dolsten said of the evidence from Israel. He said his company would be submitting data to the FDA by the end of the month to request authorization of a booster dose.

But late yesterday [Thu 8 Jul 2021] afternoon CDC and FDA issued their own statement [https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/08/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-vaccine-boosters.html].

"Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time," the federal agencies said. "We continue to review any new data as it becomes available and will keep the public informed. We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed."

Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News, said he personally and professionally supports the message from the CDC and FDA, but he wishes companies and government agencies could better coordinate messages in the future.

"The events of the past day only add to the public's confusion about whether we in the public health community and vaccine communities have our act together, and that's terribly unfortunate because it only undercuts our ability to promote these vaccines," he said.

"This is not a matter of inconvenience; this is a matter of public credibility."

States tackle delta rise
------------------------
The United States reported 20 061 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [Thu 8 Jul 2021], and 257 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases].
In Missouri, which is one of the country's biggest delta hot spots, Gov. Mike Parson said he doesn't want government employees going door-to-door to encourage people to get vaccinated, the Associated Press reports. Earlier this week President Biden said the federal government would be focused on smaller, community efforts to vaccinate hesitant Americans, including knocking on doors
[https://apnews.com/article/mo-state-wire-michael-brown-health-coronavirus-pandemic-600303954d6364c69d080f6bd75cd363].

"I have directed our health department to let the federal government know that sending government employees or agents door-to-door to compel vaccination would NOT be an effective OR a welcome strategy in Missouri!" he tweeted. Missouri is averaging more than 1000 new cases per day, up from 650 in June [2021].

Local health officials say Los Angeles County is seeing exponential growth of COVID-19 cases as the delta variant takes over as the dominant strain, according to CNN. The case rate in the county jumped from 1.74 to 3.5 cases per 100 000 people in one week [https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/09/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html].

Other US developments
---------------------
- Pressure is growing for the FDA to grant full approval to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to help convince more Americans to get their shots, Politico reported [https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/08/calls-for-fda-endorse-covid-vaccine-delta-498886].

- Today [Fri 9 Jul 2021] in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report are 2 reports on adolescents and COVID-19. The first details an outbreak caused by the delta variant at an Oklahoma gymnastics facility in April [2021] and May [2021]. The outbreak included 21 laboratory-confirmed delta cases and 26 epidemiologically linked cases, with overall facility and household attack rates of 20% and 53%, respectively. [Dougherty K, Mannell M, Naqvi O, Matson D, Stone J. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant COVID-19 outbreak associated with a gymnastics facility -- Oklahoma, April-May 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 9 Jul 2021. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7028e2external icon.

- The 2nd study was on vaccine uptake in adolescents. In April [2021], 52% of unvaccinated adolescents aged 13 to 17 years and 56% of parents of unvaccinated adolescents aged 12 to 17 years reported intent for adolescent COVID-19 vaccination. Concerns about safety and side effects were the biggest barriers to vaccination. [Scherer AM, Gedlinske AM, Parker AM, et al. Acceptability of adolescent COVID-19 vaccination among adolescents and parents of adolescents -- United States, April 15-23, 2021.

[It seems important at this stage of the pandemic to put more effort into increasing the proportion of the population who are fully immunized rather than diverting effort to booster shots. The latter will only increase the inequities among countries that call out for attention. Once the proportion of people fully immunized is spread beyond high-income countries to low and middle-income countries, then a booster shot seems more appropriate. And during this time, more data will become available on the persistence of protective antibodies to the variants from the initial vaccine doses. - Mod.LK]

[4] Guillain-Barré

J&J vaccine tied to Guillain-Barré
---------------------------------
Roughly 12.8 million Americans have received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine, and now officials from the FDA are expected to announce the vaccine has been linked to 100 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare nerve disorder.

The benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks, the FDA is expected to say, according to the Washington Post. The vaccine will now have a warning label about the risk.

The cases have been reported 2 weeks after vaccination and mostly in men, many aged 50 and older. Annually, the United States usually sees an estimated 3000 -- 6000 cases, or 60 -- 120 per week. The syndrome often follows viral or bacterial infections.

This is the latest setback to the J&J vaccine, which was once predicted to be a pandemic game changer. The vaccine was paused in April [2021] after it was linked to rare clotting events. More recently, the company had to toss 75 million doses of the vaccine after contamination was found at Emergent BioSolutions, the Baltimore-based manufacturer of the vaccine.

The AstraZeneca vaccine, a 2-dose adenovirus vaccine used widely in the United Kingdom and Europe, has also battled associations with Guillain-Barré, but no official warning exists.

Only 38% of young adults vaccinated
------------------------------------
New data in the Wall Street Journal show young Americans are the group least likely to get vaccinated and were one of the main reasons the White House did not meet its goal of vaccinating 70% of adults with at least one dose of vaccine by [4 Jul 2021] [https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-americans-arent-getting-vaccinated-jeopardizing-covid-19-fight-11625995802].

Public health experts said this group feels little urgency to get vaccinated because of the low risk of severe COVID-19 and are more likely to get vaccine misinformation from social media.

Southern, conservative communities also continue to battle vaccine hesitancy. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told ABC News this weekend he was willing to accept federal help in his state to encourage vaccinations. Arkansas has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country--around 35% [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/arkansas-governor-working-hard-overcome-vaccine-hesitancy-amid/story?id=78774861].

"There shouldn't be a partisan divide, first of all, but clearly a conservative is more hesitant about government authority," Hutchinson said. "We've got to overcome that mistrust because Republicans, Democrats, we all suffer the same consequences: the delta variant gets us if we're not vaccinated." Both Arkansas and neighboring Missouri have the highest level of new cases detected in the last 7 days, at more than 100 new cases per 100 000 people.

The United States reported 6164 new COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths yesterday [Sun 11 Jul 2021], according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]. New daily reported COVID-19 cases rose 49.3% in the past week, according to data from the Washington Post. Deaths fell by 1.7%, and COVID-related hospitalizations rose by 17% [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/].

["The Food and Drug Administration warned on (Mon 12 Jul 2021) that Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine can lead to an increased risk of a rare neurological condition known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, another setback for a vaccine that has largely been sidelined in the United States.

"Although regulators have found that the chances of developing the condition are low, they appear to be 3 -- 5 times higher among recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine than among the general population in the United States, according to people familiar with the decision. The warning was attached to fact sheets about the vaccine for providers and patients.

"Federal officials have identified 100 suspected cases of Guillain-Barré among recipients of Johnson & Johnson's one-dose shot through a federal monitoring system that relies on patients and health care providers to report adverse effects of vaccines. As many as 95% of those cases were considered serious and required hospitalization, the Food and Drug Administration said. The reports are preliminary.

"In a statement, the agency said that while "the available evidence suggests an association" between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, "it is insufficient to establish a causal relationship."

"The agency added that it "continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks" of the vaccine.

"About 12.8 million people -- or about 8% of the fully vaccinated population in the United States -- have received the Johnson & Johnson shot. By contrast, about 146 million have been fully vaccinated with Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines, both of which require 2 doses.

"Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs when the immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and occasional paralysis, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Several thousand people -- about 10 out of every million -- develop the condition every year in the United States. Most recover from even severe symptoms.

"Guillain-Barré syndrome has previously been linked to other vaccines, including the 1976 swine flu vaccine and other flu vaccines. Some studies suggested that people were more likely to develop Guillain-Barré from the flu than from flu vaccines, which are monitored every year by the CDC for any associations with the condition. The Food and Drug Administration warned this year (2021) that GlaxoSmithKline's shingles vaccine, Shingrix, could also increase the risk of the disease."
