A chikungunya outbreak in Sukarame I village, Sukarame sub district, Bandar
Lampung city, is reported to be affecting more and more people after the
disease was said to have also occurred in other sub districts. According to
some Sukarame village residents, many of their fellow villagers, including
whole families, were suffering from the disease, which is marked by high
fever and pain in many parts of the body.

The infected villagers were being treated at their homes as well as the
local community health center, and health authorities had conducted fogging
operations in an effort to mitigate the pandemic. But the villagers were
still hoping local health authorities would be more pro-active in their
efforts to halt the spread of the disease in Bandar Lampung, which forces
sufferers to cease their normal activities for weeks. Some of the infected
villagers were also trying to seek cure through traditional medicines.

Meanwhile, people in Bandar Lampung are also worried about the incidence of
dengue fever which, like chikungunya, is also transmitted by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito.
