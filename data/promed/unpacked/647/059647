The death toll in the food poisoning case at a temple in Chamarajnagar district has gone up to 15, with traces of substances dangerous to humans found in the prasad (offering) served to the affected, deputy chief minister G Parameshwara said.

Samples of prasad were collected and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory, and traces of organophosphate and monocrotophos that are dangerous to humans have been found in the food, Parameshwara said. Parameshwara, who holds the Home portfolio, told the assembly session in Belagavi that 7 people had been taken into custody in connection with the incident. "Who did it, the motive behind, will come out, and the investigation is on. I believe in one or 2 days, truth will come out," he said.

The tragedy occurred at Sulawadi village, where special pooja was conducted at the Maramma Devi temple for the groundbreaking ceremony. Later, prasad was distributed, and those who consumed it started complaining of stomach pain, diarrhoea-like symptoms, and vomiting. They were rushed to hospitals in Bengaluru, Mysuru, as well as neighbouring towns. At least 150 people were hospitalised, sources said. "Immediately, those who were ill were rushed to hospitals nearby. Eleven people died, while 125 are undergoing treatment. Two died later in the hospital, and one more last night. Now the total death toll stands at 14," Parameshwara added.

The opposition BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa said it looks like a "planned conspiracy". Meanwhile, police are probing suspected foul play in the incident.

[It is important to realize there are 125 people in the hospital. Hopefully they will be treated successfully.

Monocrotophos is an organophosphorus insecticide and acaricide that works systemically and on contact. It is extremely toxic to birds and is used as a bird poison (1). It is also very poisonous to mammals. It is used to control a variety of sucking, chewing, and boring insects and spider mites on cotton, sugarcane, peanuts, ornamentals, and tobacco (2,3). The EPA classifies monocrotophos as class I toxicity, or highly toxic. Products containing monocrotophos bear the signal word "danger" (6). Monocrotophos is available in other countries as a soluble concentrate or an ultra-low volume spray (3).

Monocrotophos is a direct-acting cholinesterase inhibitor capable of penetration through the skin (10). The dose that kills half of the test animals, the LD50, is 17-18 mg/kg for male rats and 20 mg/kg for female rats. The LD50 for dermal exposure is 126 mg/kg for male rats, 112 mg/kg for female rats, and 354 mg/kg for rabbits (3, 7). The concentration in air at which half of the test animals die, the LC50, is 0.8 mg/l air. Monocrotophos is not irritating to skin and eyes (2).

Symptoms of monocrotophos poisoning are similar to those of other organophosphate compounds. Its cholinesterase-inhibiting activity causes nervous system effects. Cases of human poisoning are characterized by muscular weakness, blurred vision, profuse perspiration, confusion, vomiting, pain, and small pupils. There is a risk of death due to respiratory failure (8,11).

Organophosphates and carbamates are common insecticides that inhibit cholinesterase activity, causing acute muscarinic manifestations (for example, salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, emesis, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, miosis) and some nicotinic symptoms, including muscle fasciculations and weakness. Neuropathy can develop days to weeks after exposure. Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes with a trial of atropine, measurement of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase level, or both. Bronchorrhea and bronchospasm are treated with titrated high-dose atropine. Neuromuscular toxicity is treated with IV pralidoxime.

Organophosphates and carbamates cause similar initial findings characterized by acute muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic toxidromes. Muscle fasciculations and weakness are typical. Respiratory findings include rhonchi, wheezing, and hypoxia, which may be severe. Most patients have bradycardia and, if poisoning is severe, hypotension. CNS toxicity is common, sometimes with seizures and excitability and often with lethargy and coma. Pancreatitis is possible, and organophosphates may cause arrhythmias such as heart block and QTc interval prolongation.

Organophosphates and carbamates, although different structurally, both inhibit cholinesterase activity. Some are used medically to reverse neuromuscular blockade (for example, neostigmine, pyridostigmine, edrophonium) or to treat glaucoma (echothiopate), myasthenia gravis (pyridostigmine), and Alzheimer disease (tacrine and donepezil) (see https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/injuries-poisoning/poisoning/organophosphate-poisoning-and-carbamate-poisoning).

The combination of the 2 chemicals, especially with monocrotophos in the mix and with similar symptoms and extremely rapid onset, makes it difficult to completely distinguish between these 2 compounds.

It seems possible that this tragic situation arose through an intentional and perhaps targeted act, but It may be that someone either could not or did not read the label, or perhaps the substance was mistaken for some seasoning. While this does not seem likely, it is important to let the investigation come to a conclusion. - Mod.TG
