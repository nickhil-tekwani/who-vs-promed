The Director of Health, Carlos Galvez, announced this Tuesday night [4 Mar 2014] that 2 new hantavirus [infections] were reported in the Guarare and Los Santos areas [Los Santos Province], respectively.

This situation involves 2 women, one in the Guarare area who has a mild virus infection and one in Los Santos, a 56 year old patient, who is in serious condition. Both live in essentially agricultural areas, causing Galvez to exhort the community to take [preventive] precautions, using gloves and masks, and store grain in special containers with covers that prevent access by rats to these food materials.

[This brings the total number of reported cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Panama to 11. The area in which these cases occurred, the Azuero Peninsula, is endemic for hantaviruses.

Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. It is fortunate that the younger women of thee 2 cases had mild disease and is recovering, unlike the older woman who is in serious condition in the hospital.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
