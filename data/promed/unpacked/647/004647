The San Antonio Express-News has reported that the exotic shrimp disease
"white spot" has been reported in native (wild) Texas Gulf shrimp. Larry
McKinney, senior official for aquatic resources at the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department has confirmed that one pink shrimp from the wild in
Brownsville, Texas was found [to be infected] in the Gulf of Mexico.
McKinney said that while the disease might be established in the wild shrimp
population, the likelihood of an epidemic that would decimate Texas's $600
million a year shrimp industry is low. "There is no cause for panic,"
McKinney stated.
The disease has been ravaging farm raised shrimp in the US and Asia, and is
believed to have originated in China. White spot is one of four diseases
known to cause high mortality in farm raised shrimp. So far, no other
disease has been detected in wild shrimp in the Gulf. White spot was
discovered in a gulf shrimp caught late last year shortly after the state
began testing for exotic diseases. More intensified sampling
has failed to turn up any other infected shrimp, according to McKinney.
McKinney stated that the agency has implemented safeguard programs to speed
up detection of exotic diseases and require shrimp farm operators to report
any outbreaks. He has warned shrimp farmers against trying to dodge
reporting outbreaks or knowingly putting native stock at risk.
