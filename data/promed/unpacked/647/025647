16 Manatees Die of Exposure To Red Tide
------------------
Marine scientists say 16 manatees have been killed by the recent red tide
outbreak in the Gulf of Mexico off southwest Florida. The carcasses have
been recovered since Friday in Charlotte, Lee, Manatee and Sarasota
counties according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission. The animals have tested positive for exposure to red tide toxin
in lab tests.
A red tide formed in the Gulf of Mexico about 30 miles off Tampa Bay in
early January. Satellite imagery shows the algae bloom still present
alongshore from Pinellas County to northern Lee County.
Red tide is formed when microscopic algae reproduces at an explosive rate,
forming a bloom. The algae emit a neurotoxin that can paralyze or make
breathing difficult for fish, manatees, or even humans that inhale or
ingest it.

[This red tide started up this January and has already taken a toll of
manatee; see previous posting. Unfortunately, by remaining off shore, it is
now culling the manatee that had been over-wintering in the Florida rivers
and are returning to the coast.
In the previous report, my more knowledgeable colleague Mod.TG wrote:
"Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it
is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes
shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on
both the east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several closely
related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for
persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish,
but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish
larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that
discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface.
Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency
of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in
relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic
nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused
by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentration can
make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the
respiratory system of fish and other marine life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people
from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide
irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes,
scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal
consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and
dizziness and may last for several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_,
but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new
name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_. Karenia was chosen in honor of
Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida
Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, FL.
