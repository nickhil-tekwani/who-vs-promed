At least 35 people have died and 400 others are critically ill from cholera in
Nigeria's latest outbreak, the local press reported Monday. The city hardest
hit appears to be Kano in the north, where the Health Ministry reported 20
deaths and 350 seriously ill. Government spokesmen said the outbreaks, which
began 12 days ago in the central state of Kwara, were caused by polluted
drinking water. Oba Oladipuo Kolawole, a local leader, said drought had forced
the region's inhabitants to resort to contaminated sources.

Cholera has killed more than 200 people since last Wednesday in
Dinsor town in Somalia's southwestern region of Bay, local authorities
said Tuesday. The main traditional leader of the town, Ugas Sidow Hajji
Mohamed, told Xinhua via VHF radio that his people are incredibly dying
in great numbers and that the situation is alarming. According to the local
authorities, the average death rate is 20 people per day and the disease
is especially rampant in eight villages and the town of Dinsor itself, where
people are falling ill from the disease in dozens everyday.
The spread of the disease has further been facilitated by the new influx
of refugees arriving in Dinsor and its surrounding areas within Bay and
Bakol regions.
The local health authorities in Dinsor town said the World Health
Organization offered them 40 crates of the anti-dehydration solution
besides the American IMC which provided chlorine for purifying the
potable water in the town.

A total of 7860 cases with 233 deaths has been reported since the beginning of
the current epidemic which started in December 1998. Areas where cases were
still being registered at the end of March and first half of April are
Mogadishu, Kismayo, and Baidoa. The disease is still appearing in new areas --
Bay, Lower Shabelle, Upper and Lower Juba -- which are difficult to access and
figures are not available. WHO is continuing to make supplies available and
supporting the health authorities in strengthening cholera preparedness plans
since more outbreaks are expected later in the year following the seasonal
pattern.

Quiche: A death due to an outbreak of cholera
---------------------------------------------------------
One death and 20 more infected persons were the result of
an outbreak of cholera in the jurisdiction of Sacapulas, Quiche,
according to an alert announced by the authorities.
The above information was given by the departmental governor, Claudio
Quinonez, who announced that they were sending health brigades, composed of
Cuban and Guatemalan doctors and nursing personnel, in order to block continued
propagation of this epidemic.
In addition, he explained that one of the causes of the epidemic is the
contamination of the Rio Negro de Sacapulas due to a fiesta.
Dr. Fredy Velasquez, epidemiologist of the Health Area,
explained that the epidemic began at a marriage feast held on Friday
23 & Saturday 24 Apr 1999, in this jurisdiction, where "they suppose"
that the foods were contaminated, given that of the 21 cholera cases,
20 had attended the celebration.

20 cases of cholera detected in the Sierra de Libertine

20 persons of Sinsicap district, Otuzco province, contracted cholera this past
weekend.
A local official mentioned that the affected individuals were farmers from
Collambay, who were repairing a road to the farm. "Those affected
contracted the disease, it seems, by drinking water without purification
and without boiling" he said.
The district of Sinsicap is located at 95 kms to the northeast of Trujillo,
which is on the Pacific coast of Peru, north of Lima. The district has a
medical post where those affected by this disease, which caused
