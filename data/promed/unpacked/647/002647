Man with suspected anthrax admitted to hospital
------------------------
A person suspected to be suffering from anthrax was admitted to the
Medical College Hospital here today [21 May 2007]. Kannan of
Peruvambu in Palakkad District was admitted to the Palakkad District
Hospital 3 days ago with fever and "malignant pustule" on his hand.
It was reported the patient had helped bury cattle which died of
anthrax few days ago making him contract the disease, hospital sources said.
As the hospital authorities could not confirm whether the patient was
infected with anthrax, they referred the case to the Thrissur Medical
College Hospital for further investigations. Medical college hospital
sources said the blood samples had been sent for detailed tests and
the results could be available only day after tomorrow [23 May 2007].
Only then could it be confirmed if the case was anthrax or not, the
sources added.
Meanwhile, Kerala Health Minister P K Sreemathy, at a function in
Pathanamthitta, disclosed that a case of human anthrax had been
reported from Palakkad.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[As a ministerial statement is not necessarily the same as scientific
confirmation, it would be appreciated if any of our Indian members,
medical and veterinary, can confirm that the cattle and the man had
been afflicted with anthrax. As any prior treatment with antibiotics
before a human sample is taken can result in the latter having no
viable organisms, the human presumptive diagnosis may depend on the
veterinary laboratory confirmation on the cattle deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
