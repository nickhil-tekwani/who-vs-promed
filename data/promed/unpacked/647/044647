Check on citrus canker outbreaks
----------------------------
Queensland agricultural authorities will investigate another
potential outbreak of citrus canker in the Emerald region.
Grower John Pressler said today he had found suspicious lesions on 5
trees on his property about 2 km from where the last outbreak
occurred, "but it is in another area on another of our farms." To
date more than 90 000 trees have been destroyed on Mr Pressler's
properties. The initial outbreak was discovered in July last year on
Evergreen Farms, resulting in the removal and destruction of 230 000
trees.
Mr Pressler has called for all citrus trees in the area to be
destroyed, with growers receiving $50 [USD 39] in compensation for
each tree killed. He said if the march of the disease continued it
could threaten Australia's $600-million [USD 469 million] citrus
industry.
The Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI) Plant Health
general manager, Chris Adriaansen, said inspectors would be visiting
Mr Pressler's property. "This property has been under quarantine
since the 1st detection of citrus canker on another property in July
2004," he said. "In October 2004, citrus canker was identified on
this property and it has been locked down since then. Citrus
canker has not been detected on any other property in Queensland --
not in Gayndah-Mundubbera, not on the other Emerald properties and
not in the rest of Queensland." Mr Adriaansen said diagnosis of the
samples was expected to be completed within a week.

farm is very discouraging. - Mod.DH]
