Avian flu confirmed in Cypress County
-------------------------------------
Avian influenza has been detected at a Cypress County property, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed. The agency has not provided numbers of birds infected, but described the flock as 'small.' The property is classified as 'non-poultry.'

"We had communication last week between the affected landowner and Cypress County, advising us there might have been a possibility of this," Jeffrey Dowling, director of municipal services for Cypress County, told the News. "They were in touch with the federal government and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and submitted some samples to the laboratory for confirmation.

"Cypress County was informed over the weekend, the situation was positive for the H5N1 pathogen. As far as we know, at this point, the situation is isolated to a single location, west of Medicine Hat, in the western part of Cypress County. And it does involve poultry and chickens."

Outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported across Canada. As of [19 May 2022], Alberta has the greatest number of outbreaks reported (28 properties) and birds affected (948 000). In total, 85 Canadian properties are experiencing outbreaks, with 1.8 million birds infected.

The CFIA is reminding producers to practise good bio-security habits, such as ensuring birds remain in a fenced-in area, enforcing controlled entry and exit points, changing footwear or providing foot coverings, frequent hand-washing, among others.

While humans are susceptible to H5N1, the CFIA maintains risk of transmission between humans and birds is low. The agency says there is no evidence to suggest consuming infected poultry leads to human infection.

Outbreak in B.C.
----------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza in a small flock in southern British Columbia.

A statement from the agency says the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was identified on Sunday [22 May 2022] among birds in the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen in B.C.

The B.C. case came 1 day after 4000 turkeys on a Fraser Valley farm were due to be euthanized as avian flu was verified last week on 2 commercial poultry farms in B.C.'s poultry producing hub of Abbotsford.

Data from the food inspection agency shows the outbreak is the 12th recorded in B.C. since the province's 1st case on [13 Apr 2022].

The agency warns the so-called bird flu is spreading globally and outbreaks have been confirmed in every province except Prince Edward Island. However, only B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec have recorded new cases in May [2022].

A wildlife centre in central Alberta said last week it was caring for 4 young foxes which likely picked up avian flu after eating carcasses of birds having died of the illness, and there was concern more scavengers could become ill.

The food inspection agency said no human cases of avian flu have been detected.

USA
[1] Minnesota: multiple county update
Date: Tue 24 May 2022

https://www.wctrib.com/news/local/with-four-additional-sites-minnesota-passes-3m-birds-affected-by-avian-flu


Four new sites have been added to the Board of Animal Health's list of confirmed cases of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, bringing the state's total to 79 sites in 28 counties.

Two new confirmations -- a backyard flock of 24 birds in Clay County and a commercial flock of 4744 turkey breeder toms in Kandiyohi County -- were announced Thursday [19 May 2022] in an update from the state Board of Animal Health. The site in Clay County is the 1st from that county; the Kandiyohi County site marks the 1st time a flock of breeder turkey toms has been affected.

Two additional sites -- a backyard flock of 46 birds in Polk County and a 57 000-bird commercial turkey meat operation in Dakota County -- were announced Monday [23 May 2022], marking the 1st sites in both affected counties.

The Board of Animal Health tally as of Tuesday [24 May 2022] shows 3 008 799 affected birds. Infected flocks are depopulated.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines depopulation as "when large numbers of animals must be destroyed in response to an animal health emergency."

The 2 main methods are water-based foam for floor-raised birds and carbon dioxide gas for caged birds. USDA says they are the most humane and effective options available in an emergency situation involving mass numbers of birds.

The vast majority of infections in Minnesota have been in commercial meat turkey operations. Other production types with confirmed diagnoses, according to the Board of Animal Health, have been 4 commercial turkey breeder hen flocks, 3 located in Kandiyohi County and 1 in Stearns County; 2 commercial chicken operations in Morrison County -- 1 broiler flock and 1 egg layer flock; and 18 backyard producers.

The board's web page devoted to avian flu response in the state -- <bah.state.mn.us/hpai> -- is updated at noon each weekday with the information known about infection sites. Data from previous days also may be updated by quality control staff if more accurate information is gathered later.

The 1st Minnesota cases of the disease -- which is fatal to domestic poultry -- were confirmed [25 Mar 2022].

A total of 28 counties in the state have been impacted so far. The other affected counties are Anoka, Becker, Benton, Big Stone, Blue Earth, Carver, Chisago, Crow Wing, Dodge, Grant, Lac qui Parle, LeSueur, Lyon, Meeker, Morrison, Mower, Otter Tail, Renville, Rice, Stearns, Swift, Todd, Waseca and Yellow Medicine.

[2] Washington (King County): back yard flock

Bird flu detected in King County
--------------------------------
Two backyard flocks in King County are the latest to test positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), or bird flu, on Tuesday [24 May 2022].

The Washington State Department of Agriculture was notified of sudden deaths and signs of lethargy among the small flocks.

The 1st case of bird flu in Washington was announced [5 May 2022]. The latest 2 bring the total to 11 backyard flocks in 8 counties.

All infected flocks were backyard flocks having substantial contact with wild waterfowl.

Officials suggest bird owners should withdraw from exhibitions at fairs until at least the end of June [2022].

"If we can just hang in there until the end of June [2022], hopefully, we can get through the worst of it," state veterinarian Dr. Amber Itle said. "It is all about reducing risk. Bringing birds from different flocks together definitely increases opportunities for this virus to spread and impact more birds."

Bird owners can also wash their boots or shoes before entering and when leaving chicken coops, sanitizing equipment and wearing clean clothing around the birds.

If your flock is experiencing sudden death or illness of multiple birds, contact the WSDA Sick Bird Hotline.

More information can be found on the WSDA Bird Flu webpage [https://agr.wa.gov/departments/animals-livestock-and-pets/avian-health/avian-influenza/bird-flu-2022].

[Avian influenza continues its migration or march of destruction, if you will, across North America. With the Yukon being affected now, it seems there is no place safe from this virus and possibly no region which has not been affected. I know poultry producers are ready for this horrible situation to abate, as are veterinarians, regulators, and the euthanasia teams.

Please do not take any chances with your birds. Protect them!! Isolate them, guard them, bring them inside, or whatever you need to do for the protection of your birds. - Mod.TG
