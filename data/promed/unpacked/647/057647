Data from BSE Progress report November 1995:

154592 confirmed BSE cases up to 3 Nov. 1995 in 32906 herds.
35.6 % of these herds have had only 1 case.
70.2 % of these herds have had four or less cases.


These data imply the following distribution of cases
between a) herds with only one case, b) herds with 2-4 cases
and c) herds with more than 4 cases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
a) 11715 1 11715 7.5
b) 11385 2-4 22770 - 45541 14.7 - 29.4 (*)
c) 9805 > 4 97336 - 120107 63.0 - 77.7 (*)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
total 32906 >1 154592 100
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) The data in the Progress report allow only intervals to be
calculated for group b) and c).

Anyhow:
Appr. 70 % of the confirmed BSE cases occurred in 9800 herds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The BSE County Summary from same Progress report suggests, that
herds with many cases are predominantly located
in Eastern, South West and South East England:


average number of confirmed
confirmed cases per cases
Regions: affected herd
South West England 6.2 57530 **
Midland & Western England 4.4 31384 **
South East England 7.1 17172 *
Northern England 3.4 15987 **
Wales 3.0 14589 **
Eastern England 6.8 10501
Scotland 2.4 7429
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total 4.7 154592
----------------------------------------------------------------------
selected counties with high
number of cases/affected herd:

Norfolk (Eastern England) 9.3 3807
Sussex W. (South East England) 9.1 3125 *

----------------------------------------------------------------------
37 % of confirmed cases occurred
in South West England, mainly in
Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Devon 5.1 13588 **
Somerset 7.0 12102 *
Cornwall 5.4 9667 **
Dorset 8.7 9213 **
Wiltshire 7.1 6891
Gloucestershire 5.3 3164

Excerpts from MAFF 1989 warble surveillance report:

"A comparison of the 1989 results with those of the more limited
1988 survey shows that, despite the greater number of sera tested
fewer seropositive herds were found in the northern and eastern counties,
the eastern half of the country being now virtually free of serological
evidence of the disease. Contributory factors to this result probably
include continued voluntary treatments, and the use of ivermectin on a
wide scale for helminth control"
"On the other hand, the counties in Mid and west Wales reveal an apparent
extension of the area affected, with one seropositive farm as far west
as Carmarthen.<..> Without additional measures to ensure full coverage
of prophylactic treatment, these infestations will probably persist
and may spread by stock sold-on to farms in other areas."
"The results from the west country show little change from the previous
season. The lack of seropositive animals from west Cornwall could be due
to the fact that many herds were treated after the 1988 survey"
"The low levels of the disease indicated by this survey should not
be a cause for complacency <..> It is to easy to conclude
that prophylactic treatment is no longer necessary"
"This survey demonstrates that one obstacle to the eradication of
warble fly is the assumption that a failure to detect signs of warbles
on cursory inspection is an adequate basis for the belief that
autumn dressing is no longer necessary."
(Sinclair et al. Vet.Rec.(1990) 126, 327-329)

This is not something that is more than an observation I have noticed.
No references, statistics or backing at all. Just a comment from a man
at the firing line.

Those people who complete diet fed, or who fed low quality feed, or who
fed no feed to their milking cows or breeding animals still has cases of
BSE. This is because for a brief period calves were weaned on bought in
weaner pellets. In this case the animals were exposed to infected feed
for only a couple of months at most, starting at about 6 weeks old. I
believe that M&B meal was included in these rations primarily as a
source of highly digestible calcium and phosphorus for the rapidly
growing animal. This is what I meant by one episode of infection. From
our own experience I would suggest an infection rate around 3% to 5%
although in 1987 this suddenly rose to 10%, presumably because by then
the M&B meal was getting rather infective. We have had no cases in
animals born since then, but knowing our luck at any minute .....

Some herds, particularly dairy herds, fed high quality cake during the
cow's subsequent lactation and some complete diet feeders fed a 'protein
balancer concentrate' which may well have contained M&B meal. Here the
animals would have been exposed to infected feed when they were older
and for extended periods. I don't know the pattern of infection for
these herds as it is a sore point for those in that position and it
would be untactful to be too nosey. I get the impression that we are
talking figures of perhaps double this, but I am not at all confident of
these guesses.

The worst affected herd I have heard about (rank hearsay this) is 50
cases in a herd of 100 cows. Bearing in mind that in this sort of case
higher levels of replacements would have been required so we might well
be talking about a total of 250 replacements+ over a ten year period or
a 20% infection rate. This farmer keeps a lot of pigs, I understand.
This case (the information came from a vet, by the way) was considered
very significantly the worst he had come across.

Well, this piece is plenty long enough.

Subject: Some Stats

Report of the Working Party BSE, Feb 1989.
**Note this is very early on in the spread of the disease.**

This shows a remarkable distribution of the % of dairy herds infected.

Guernsey and Berks: 17.2 & 17.6 % !!!!!
Hants, Kent, Surrey, W,Sussex, Cambridgeshire: 11-14%
The rest of S. UK (give or take): 5-9% mostly at ~6%
The north: <2%

Just in passing I seem to remember that Guernsey never had warbles
anyway.

Given some oddities, such as W.Sussex: 13.6% and E.Sussex: 5.6% it has
all the feel of feed distributed by individual feed companies. Where a
company(s) is strong there are a lot of cases, where weak, far fewer. It
ought (for interests sake) to have been possible to identify, at least
to some extent, what shipments went to both Guernsey and Berks to
produce this high infection rate.

===============

BSE & the protection of animal health. MAFF Feb 1996

I have taken this from a graph, so please allow some leeway,
particularly for the smaller figures.

Peak of confirmed cases of BSE with known dates of birth. (Monthly)
Data valid at 2nd Feb 1996. Note that one should expect there to be
increases, possibly significant, in 90 onwards.

1981 <50
1982 200
1983 1000
1984 2000
1985 2800
1986 4500
1987 8200
1988 3400 (Peak post July 88 feed ban)
1989 2000
1990 450 (Peak pre Sept 90 SBO ban)
1991 200
1992 onwards not readable or nil.
[- de Baer made an error here but later corrected. The corrected figures
have been inserted. MHJ]

Even allowing for some more cases to me this looks like a most
substantial reduction. It is hard to believe that cases for 1991 will be
much over say 330 which gives a reduction of 25 times from the peak.

This might suggest that perhaps something in the order of a fourfold
reduction in cases due to the '88 feed ban in 89 if you take all these
cases as due to feed cross contamination, or 1:20 if you take the 1990
figures. Personally I would place the reduction between 89 and 90 mostly
on feed that was on farm being consumed since farmers would have
expected this food to be uninfectious due to the '88 ban.

I, for one, find this reduction most encouraging.

The distribution is certainly remarkable, Oz.

Guernsey has a cattle population at appr. 4000, and have had more than
350 BSE cases. I believe you are right, the channel islands have
not had warble infestation for ages. And prophylactic treatment
(although possible) thus not probable. As the Guernsey cluster was
known very early it could and should have been studied in great detail.

A stray thought, provoked by the geographical position of Guernsey
and the distinctive BSE distribution of % herds affected
in England, seemingly with the hot centre close to Southampton:

Is import of contaminated feedstuffs from the continent a possibility?

Actually I have to apologise. When I went into the OP possibility many
years ago, I did come across the Guernsey contra-indication. However
it's never brought up by the proponents of this hypothesis and I forgot
about it in the intervening years before it came up again. I should have
remembered it. I am pretty sure that no OP's were used on Guernsey.

It should have been studied in great detail. However I suspect that feed
mills were under a different department in those days and one must
remember that this was considered merely a cattle problem. I suspect
that threats of being sued for loss of business ......

As Torsten knows I have suggested the source of BSE (since it is most
unlikely to have come from scrapie) as one of two routes. Both are, of
course, hypotheses.

1) A natural and normal low level sporadic level of BSE has always
occurs in cattle. This is typical of TE's in general. This level was
never enough to produce a high enough infectivity in the M&B meal to
trigger clinical disease, so no spread ever occurred. By chance TWO
clinically infected BSE animals contributed to a batch of M&BM and this
WAS enough to trigger clinical infection in a number (possibly a few
tens, or hundreds) of cattle. From there the disease could grow. This is
easily modelled mathematically.

2) I came across a statement that B&BM was imported from Africa, with at
least one shipment arriving at the critical time. Now I have no records
of where I saw this, so you will have to regard this as hearsay. However
I note that the largest diversity of ruminant species and environments
occurrs on the African continent. It is not so unreasonable to postulate
that BSE might occur in some species in a similar way to scrapie such
that it IS transferred horizontally. The use of carcasses of these
animals as one ingredient for M&BM is not so unlikely, particularly
given the parlous economic situation in the continent. The fact that zoo
animals in this group have turned out to be equally suceptible is
suggestive. Indeed the importation of an animal incubating the disease
which then went off to the knacker must aslo be considered. Kudu seem to
be easily infected for example.

Anyway, a thought.

I would suggest, that knowledge of the origin of the weaner pellets
their composition, additives, contaminants could be worth a study
(if it was not a sad fact, that it probably would lead nowhere,
because the knowledge would prove unavailable).

The observation you suggest, that there could be a correlation between
BSE cases during the latest years and pig farming could be a lead for
another study.

Apparently one survey has been done. It reported higher levels in areas
with high pig populations. I hope a more definitive statistical analysis
is under way.
