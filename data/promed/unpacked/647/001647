The Sarawak Health Department has urged the public to be cautious after confirming that Japanese encephalitis (JE) is endemic in the state, with 2 new cases discovered in the last 2 months.

The Borneo Post Online reported Sarawak health director Dr Jamilah Hashim as saying that one case was recorded each in May and this month [June], bringing the number of JE cases in Sarawak to 5 since January this year [2018].

Throughout last year [2017], 10 cases were recorded.

With the confirmation, health officials are surveying children aged 15 years old and below for JE vaccination.

"The Health Department is currently taking action in order to prevent the Japanese encephalitis infection from spreading.

"One of the steps taken is engaging the community in order to identify those who fit the criteria for vaccination and have never received previous JE vaccinations," she told The Borneo Post yesterday [Thu 28 Jun 2018].

The survey will be done within areas in Sri Aman, namely Kampung STC, Taman Mewah, Taman Alamanda, Taman Azba, Kampung Sabu Cina, Taman Sri Jaya, Taman Desa Indah, Taman Sing Sing, Taman Makmur, Taman Salam, Taman Suria, Taman Vistagrow, Taman Sabu, Taman Gamang, Kuarters Perubatan, Kuarters Persekutuan Jalan Sabu, Kedang Cina and Kampung Kedang.

The 5 cases this year [2018] were recorded Kota Samarahan, Lawas, Julau, Kuala Baram and Sri Aman.

Staff from the Sri Aman divisional health office will visit houses within the areas, and have been doing so since [Tue 26 Jun 2018]. Visits are from 5 pm to 8 pm on weekdays and 8 am to 5 pm on weekends

"Families with children aged 15 years and below are required to prepare documents such as identification cards, birth certificates and child health cards or clinic cards," Dr Jamilah said.

JE is a type of viral brain infection that can affect both humans and animals, and is passed to humans from infected animals through the bite of an infected _Culex_ mosquito.

An infected person develops inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and suffers symptoms such as sudden onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, tremors and convulsions, muscles weakness and even coma.

There is currently no cure for JE, making the vaccine the best defense against the virus.

[Because sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occur in Sarawak, vaccination is the best preventive measure. South East Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Sarawak is well within the JE virus endemic area. Control of vector mosquitoes is difficult. Elimination of breeding sites around buildings and avoidance of mosquito bites are prudent preventive measures. However, because vector mosquito control over large areas is difficult and expensive, vaccination is perhaps the most effective measure to prevent cases of JE.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts.

Sarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo. Located in northwest Borneo, Sarawak is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo, to the south, and the independent country of Brunei in the north.
