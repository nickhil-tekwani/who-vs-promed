A Bat-associated Case of Human Rabies In Corrientes, Argentina
------------------------------------------
A 13 year-old boy presented with muscular pain, fever, abdominal pain, and
difficulty in walking and swallowing. Six days later, on 5 Apr 2001, he was
admitted to a ward at the "Juan Pablo II" Pediatric Hospital in Corrientes,
Argentina, suffering from respiratory distress, sensory depression, and
abundant pharyngeal fluid. As a first aid measure, he was given immediate
mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic support.
Lumbar puncture revealed no cells with 56% proteins and no [infectious
agents. NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance/also known as MRI, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging) showed a spinal cord fully and diffusely affected, and
base nucleus, thalamus and brain cortex not compatible with Guillain-Barre'
Syndrome. For these reasons his physicians suspected an acute viral
encephalitis.
The boy died 11 days after admission to hospital. A CNS biopsy was sent to
the "Centro antirabico" in Resistencia City in the nearest state, Chaco,
which reported a positive diagnosis of rabies by immunofluorescence and
mouse inoculation tests.
Bats in the areas were identified by Dilab Cenasa in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, using monoclonal antibodies as the species _Tadarida
brasiliensis_ var 04 (an insectivorous bat). Biological material from the
[child was sent to the Malbran National Institute of Epidemiology.
Retrospective information demonstrated the boy, who lived in a rural area
near San Luis del Palmar (located 100 Km from the state capital city,
Corrientes, in northeastern Argentina), had contact in February 2001
(nature of contact unknown) with a bat in an endemic rabies zone (where a
significant number of horses and cows have died with rabies-compatible
symptoms).
The last rabies case in Argentina was reported in "Isla del Cerrito",
Chaco state (about 150 Km from the new case location) in 1997, and was
associated also with the same bat variety.

[Although the nature of the contact is not known, the aspect of horses and
cattle dying of suspected rabies is probably linked to a rabies outbreak.
Farm animals should be vaccinated against this disease as well. Apparently
this bat variety and this strain of rabies has been reported previously in
areas of Argentina. It is tragic that a child dies of a preventable
disease. - Mod.TG
