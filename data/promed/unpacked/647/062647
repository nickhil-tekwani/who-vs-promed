Overview
-------------
The total number of probable, confirmed and suspected cases (see Annex 1) in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa reported up to 28 September 2014 is 7178, with 3338 deaths. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Figure 1 shows the total number of confirmed and probable cases in the three high-transmission countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) reported in each epidemiological week between 30 December 2013 (start of epidemiological week 1) and 28 September 2014 (end of epidemiological week 39). For the second week in a row the total number of reported new cases has fallen. It is clear, however, that EVD cases are under-reported from several key locations. Transmission remains persistent and widespread in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with strong evidence of increasing case incidence in several districts. There are few signs yet that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control... - more

The United Nations mission in Liberia announced on Wednesday the 1st suspected victim among its employees of the deadly Ebola epidemic ravaging the impoverished west African nation. "It is a sad reminder of the ever-present risk, and sobering for us as a mission and as the UN family," she said, giving no further details on the staffer. "UNMIL [UN Mission in Liberia, a military & police mission] will continue to strengthen the measures we put in place to protect our staff, and to remind them to protect themselves and their families outside working hours." Landgren said the mission had taken steps since then to educate personnel and help them protect themselves against the virus, describing staff safety as her "top priority"... - more

Canada vaccine shipped to Geneva, U.S. hospitals as precaution
------------------------------------------------------------
Canada has shipped small amounts of its experimental vaccine for the Ebola virus to hospitals in Geneva [Swizerland] and Atlanta, Georgia USA for possible use by exposed health care workers, Canadian chief public health officer Greg Taylor said on Wed [24 Sep 2014].

Taylor said Canada "pre-shipped" some vaccine to Geneva some time ago, but that its donation to the World Health Organization of 800-1,000 doses remains in a Canadian government lab. Canada also shipped some vaccine to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and is considering shipping some of the vaccine to Canadian hospitals as a precaution as well.
