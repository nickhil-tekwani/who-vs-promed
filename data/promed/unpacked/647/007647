This is not North Korea's 1st experience of the highly contagious disease. According to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), over 10 000 pigs and 1000 cattle were infected in late 2010 in Taechon County, North Pyongan Province; Sangwon, Sinpyong, and Hwangju counties in North Hwanghae Province; and Geumgang County in Gangwon Province.

[A 45-year-old] former resident of Taechon County, North Pyongan Province, told Daily NK on [27 Feb 2014] that, "Inoculation [vaccination] does occur but it's not consistent. There are many instances when it just doesn't happen at all. The only thing you can do is to burn a fire with rice straw and spread the warm ashes on the floor on the pigsty. You also have to make it so that the sunlight can come through easily and ventilation improves. Frankly speaking, even if a pig that you raised dies of a disease it's still thought of as an investment. You had to feed it after all. This kind of mindset is hard to abandon," she continued, before adding, "People either eat the dead pigs or cows or sell the meat cheaply at the market."

However, others believe it unlikely the North will see widespread damage as a result of this most recent outbreak due to the limited number of pig farms in the North and the regime's tight control over the movements of its people.

Senior researcher at the Korea Rural Economic Institute Kwon Tae Jin told Daily NK, "In [South] Korea, pig farms are run by individuals but in the North they are managed by the state. These operations are fairly small in nature, so it seems it won't be too difficult to prevent (the spread of the disease). Any contagion would occur slowly. Even though the North doesn't have equipment such as air conditioners like the South does, and even though they lack the quantity of medicine needed to contain the disease, mortality was still only around 20-30 percent in 2010," he explained. "The North Korean authorities deny travel permits to those who reside in the areas where there is an outbreak, and no one from the outside can enter, either. Fortunately these kinds of restrictions have a positive impact in terms of limiting the spread of contagious disease."

Meanwhile, North Korea has sought assistance from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to help combat the outbreak. They have yet to respond to overtures from the South Korean government to hold working-level talks on the matter.

[The same source reported on 26 Feb 2014:
"North Korea has sought assistance from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to counter a recent outbreak of FMD.

Assistance was requested in relation to preventative and eradication measures last Sunday, Radio Free Asia reported on 26 Feb 2014. This was followed by a face-to-face meeting with FAO officials in Rome during which it was agreed that a team would be dispatched to the North to assess the current situation. Preventive vaccines will be provided should the North request them, FAO further confirmed. Around USD 800 000 worth of FMD vaccines were provided to the North in early 2012, with funds provided by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).

This most recent FMD outbreak was first detected at the Pyongyang Pig Factory, Chosun Central News Agency announced on [21 Feb 2014]. North Korean authorities have yet to respond to South Korea's subsequent offer of working-level talks aimed at containing further spread of the disease (see at http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&num=11571).

On 19 Feb 2014 North Korea notified OIE of the outbreak, which started on 8 Jan 2014. A follow-up report is anticipated. - Mod.AS
