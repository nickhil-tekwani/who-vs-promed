A case of glanders disease in horses has been reported [in Himachal Pradesh]. The state government on Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] notified it as a scheduled disease in view of the risk of glanders disease in horses after the blood sample of a horse in Kullu was tested. These samples were sent to the lab in Hisar and the report has come back positive.

The Animal Husbandry Department has declared glanders disease as a scheduled disease in the region under various provisions of the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Cattle Act, 2009. Kullu has been declared a containment zone.

Horses suffering from this disease are allowed to be killed in the act. There is a provision to give compensation up to INR 25 000 [USD 313.33] to the owner of the horse.

[Kullu is a municipal council town that serves as the administrative headquarters of the Kullu district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

"Glanders is an infectious life-threatening disease that mainly affects horses, donkeys and mules, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. It can be transmitted to humans. Susceptibility to glanders has also been demonstrated in camels, felines living in the wild, bears, wolves, and dogs.... The disease causes nodules and ulcerations in the respiratory tract and lungs in animals. A skin form, known as 'farcy,' also occurs. In humans, the disease can take different forms, such as nasal, localized with nodules and abscesses, pulmonary, and septicaemia with disseminated or chronic infection. A cure is possible if cases are treated rapidly with antibiotics; however, fatality rates for untreated infections are very high. The disease has been eradicated in North America, Australia and Europe through testing and then eliminating any infected animals, coupled with import control measures. However, glanders remains sporadically reported in a number of Asian, African, Middle Eastern, and South American countries. Glanders is a disease listed in the WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported by Members according to the WOAH Code."
