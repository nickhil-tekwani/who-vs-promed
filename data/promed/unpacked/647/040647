The American Samoa Department of Agriculture has suspended importing of all taro and taro shoots from Samoa. The director, Filifaatali Mike Fuiava, said that he received information of an unknown virus breakout in Samoa affecting taro crops in the islands of Upolu and Savai'i. The disease is such that the taro shoot looks mature but when uprooted, the taro tuber itself has rotted away.

He said he had to take every precautionary measure to make sure this unknown virus would not enter American Samoa. He did not want to experience another epidemic like the taro leaf blight of 1993-1994. Lifting the suspension would depend on test results.

A potential hurdle has emerged for Samoa's taro crop recovery from leaf blight fungus with a new unknown virus found in seedlings. A ban has been put on the transporting of taro shoots from Upolu to Savai'i while the crop division of the Ministry of Agriculture investigates plantations affected on Upolu.

Tolo Iosefa of the Pacific Community [SPC] said samples have been sent to Germany for testing. "Even if it is known from the first that it is a new strain or a virus, I don't see it as a problem," he said. "Taro production is now coming back."

[Cultivated taro is classified as _Colocasia esculenta_ (family Araceae), but the species is considered to be polymorphic with several variants grown in different regions. It is an important tropical crop worldwide and a staple food in many poor areas. Corms are used for starch, but processing is required due to the presence of oxalates, and leaves can be eaten as a vegetable. Other crops in the family include giant swamp taro (_Cyrtosperma_ species) in the Pacific and dasheen (_Xanthosoma_ species) in southern America. These crops are often regarded as a food "bank" since they can continue to grow in the ground for many years and be available when other crops may have failed.

Leaf blight (as mentioned above), caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora colocasiae_, is one of the most important diseases of the crop in the Pacific region. It can destroy entire leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis, loss of plant vigour and serious yield losses. The disease was first reported in Java in the early 1900s and is now present in various parts of Asia and the Pacific. Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the suggestion that different strains of the pathogen may exist, in addition to differences in susceptibility of local crop varieties. Disease management using an integrated approach has been successful in the Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides as sprays or treatments for seed tubers, phytosanitation, and use of cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility. Programmes specific to different areas for the assessment of taro blight resistance levels of local cultivars have been set up by some countries (ProMED-mail post 20101216.4451), including Samoa, where new resistant varieties are being used in the recovery of the national taro production.

A major outbreak of taro leaf blight occurred in Samoa in 1993 (referred to above in item 1). The new disease reported here is speculatively called a 'virus'. However, serious problems of taro due to several fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens have been reported from Oceania (for examples see ProMED-mail post 20100514.1572) as well as Asia and Africa. Until molecular diagnosis of the samples that were sent off is completed, an viral cause is only one of the possibilities. The optimistic statement in item 2 that this new disease will not affect national taro production may not be justified and appears rather baffling.
