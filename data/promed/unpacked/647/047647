Poultry disease wipes out 2.8 million chickens
-----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of a highly contagious poultry virus that swept through
West Java's 2 major chicken suppliers have killed 2.8 million young
chickens in the first quarter of this year, an official at the West
Java husbandry agency said on Wed 06 Jun 2002.
Head of the agency's veterinary division Musny Suatmojo said his
office had isolated the virus, which caused the incurable Marek's
disease, to prevent it from spreading to other regencies from Ciamis
and Tasikmalaya.
Experts assured the public that the disease does not affect humans.
"This is the biggest case ever in the history of agriculture here. We
are still examining the factors that cause it as we usually only have
one or 2 cases," Musny told a hearing with the West Java Provincial
Legislative Council's Commission B for economic affairs. "Several
chickens are still infected, but the number of cases is rapidly
decreasing," he added.
Ciamis and Tasikmalaya are the centers for chicken breeding, which
produce over 19 million broilers weekly, mostly for the Jakarta
market.
Marek's disease produces cancer in poultry and is characterized
especially by the proliferation of lymphoid cells and is caused by a
herpes virus. The disease was named after Joszef Marek, a Hungarian
veterinarian who first discovered the illness in 1907. The disease,
Musny said, entered Indonesia about 1960 when chickens were imported
into the country.
Infected animals have a loss in appetite, are lethargic and have a
high body temperature [an exceptional observation - body temperatures
are not known to be taken in chickens - Mod.AS]. It usually infects
poultry between the ages of 3 weeks and 4 months, whose immunity is
low because of bad weather, commonly during the transitional periods
between the dry and rainy seasons. Chickens are usually sent to
markets when they are one-and-a-half months old.
Musny assured the public that the disease was not a zoonosis one,
meaning it could not be passed on to humans. He said that his office
had instructed breeders to burn every infected chicken and sterilize
the coops for 50 to 90 days to isolate the virus.
In an attempt to prevent further spread of the virus, which does not
have a vaccine yet, the husbandry agency has distributed vaccines for
Newcastle disease as well as Gumboro's disease.
Chairman of the West Java chapter of the Association of National
Chicken Breeders (PPAN) Dedi Dermawan said that there was limited
spread of the virus although there is a possibility of its return. He
said the disease had caused Rp 19 billion (21 million US dollars) in
losses to breeders.

[The magnitude of the losses described in this and other press items
from Indonesia does not fall in line with common experience with
Marek's disease (MD), a List B poultry disease found in most
countries where chickens are maintained. MD occurs at 3-4 weeks of
age or older and is most common between 12 and 30 weeks of age. In
the classical form of the disease, characterised by mainly neural
involvement, mortality rarely exceeds 10-15 percent and can occur
over a few weeks or many months. In the acute form, in which there is
usually lymphoma formation in the viscera, a disease incidence of
10-30 percent of the flock is not uncommon and outbreaks involving up
to 70 percent can occur; birds are often severely depressed and some
may die without showing preceding signs. Mortality may increase
rapidly over a few weeks and then cease, or can continue at a steady
or slowly falling rate for several months. MD is prevented by
vaccination with monovalent or multivalent live virus vaccines of
various types. Vaccination greatly reduces clinical disease, but not
persistent infection by MD virus. The vaccine viruses are also
carried throughout the life of the fowl. According to OIE's data --
based upon Indonesia's reports -- the disease seems to be endemic
there, but no vaccination is reported to be applied.
Data from veterinary colleagues in Indonesia on the age of the
affected birds and any other clinical and laboratory information that
might help us understand the epidemiology of this outbreak will be
very much appreciated.
For additional information on MD, the reader is referred to the OIE
Manual of standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2000, chapter
2.7.2.
