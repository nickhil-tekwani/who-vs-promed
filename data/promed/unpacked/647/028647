28 cases of FMD in cattle in the Amur area
----------------------------------------
28 cases of Foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been recorded in cattle in
the village of Busse in the Amur region. According to the authorities in
Svobodnenskogo, all affected animals have been slaughtered and buried in an
enclosed burial site. The diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests
at the Vladimir Scientific Research Institute for the Protection of Animals
[the national FMD reference laboratory of Russia], indicating that the 28
head of cattle from Busse have been infected with FMD serotype Asia-1,
which is new to Russia.
According to the Far East regional center of the Russian Ministry of
Emergency Measures, 7000 doses of a polyvalent FMD vaccine [which
serotypes?] have been supplied and vaccination of all cattle in the village
undertaken.
Measures to prevent the spread of FMD continue throughout the southern part
of the Russian far-east region. These include round-the-clock control
activities preventing the movement of meat and of milk that has not been
heat-treated. Movement of farm animals such as cattle, small ruminants and
pigs has been banned.

Busse, where the FMD outbreak took place, is a border village on the Amur
River.
Svobodnii is the nearest large town (a regional centre), situated to the
east of Busse and a small port on the Zeya River, which enters the Amur
River at Blagoveshensk, the capital of Amurskaya Oblast (Province).
