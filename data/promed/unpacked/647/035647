Health authorities in Luanda, Angola, are investigating a disease, still undiagnosed, that in just a few days killed 21 children between the ages of 9-12 years.

This information was presented this Friday [8 May 2015] to Lusa [News Agency of Portugal] by the Cacuaco Municipal Administrator Carlos Cavquila, confirming that this is the area of Angolan and Cuban physicians to investigate the situation and that an operation for pest control and cleanup is already taking place in the Mulundo neighborhood in the Funda community.

"We went to the area today and await the experts to inform us what is going on. The disease presents with symptoms similar to malaria, but more severe. We have now distributed bed nets and we are carrying out pest and rodent control in that area," the Cacuaco Administrator explained.

Between 30 Apr to 5 May [2015], 21 children in that neighborhood died after presenting with high fever and abdominal pain, among other symptoms -- a clinical picture that, according to the populace, becomes severe "very rapidly," progressing to death.

Yellow fever, dengue, malaria and chikungunya are some of the [etiologic] hypotheses that the Angola health authorities -- with help of a specialist of the WHO delegation in Luanda -- are trying to figure out.

"We are making house visits because this is a scary number. Today we could only go to 5 houses, where there were 6 deaths," the Cacuaco Municipal Health Director, Catarina Uatanha, told Lusa.

According to the responsible authority, no new fatal cases have been registered since 5 May [2015], but 6 patients are hospitalized in a Barra do Dande health unit.

"For now, it is too early to draw conclusions. We need to look around on the ground, with collection of various elements such as water, in order to see what is happening," added Catherine Uatanha.

[The symptoms reported are too general to speculate on what the etiological agent involved in these unfortunate cases might be. No mention is made of what the autopsy findings were, if any were made. Nor is there mention made of patient samples being taken for laboratory testing. Dengue, malaria and chikungunya all occur in Angola. Yellow fever would be of particular concern. Chikungunya virus infections are an unlikely cause of these deaths, given that the case fatality rate for this infection is quite low, and older individuals, often with underlying medical problems, are most at risk of death from this virus. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information as it becomes available.
