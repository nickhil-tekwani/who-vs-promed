The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is urgently reminding the
public that contact with baby turtles can pose a serious health risk
to infants, small children, and adults with impaired immune systems,
as the turtles can be natural hosts to _Salmonella_, a group of
bacteria that can cause severe illness and death. Recently, a
4-week-old infant in Florida died of infection traced to _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Pomona, a bacterium that was also found in a pet
turtle in the home.
_Salmonella_ is the genus name of a number of bacteria commonly
associated with food poisoning from contaminated or under-cooked
foods, and salmonellosis is the disease the bacteria can cause. The
bacteria can be found on the outer skin and shell surfaces of the
turtles, causing salmonellosis for those handling turtles without
properly washing their hands after handling the animals.
The FDA is reminding parents and others who care for children of the following:
1. The sale of turtles with a shell less than 4 inches long is
illegal. Exceptions to FDA's regulation include sales of these
turtles intended for export only or for bona fide scientific,
educational, or exhibition purposes;
2. Salmonella infection can be caused by contact with turtles in
petting zoos, parks, child day care facilities and other locations;
and
3. It is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after
handling or touching turtles and their housing.
In the early 1970s, it was determined that pet turtles, particularly
red-eared sliders, were responsible for an estimated 280 000 cases of
salmonellosis each year in the USA. In 1975, FDA banned the sale of
turtles with a shell less than 4 inches long as a necessary public
health measure. FDA has repeatedly emphasized the risks of
turtle-associated salmonellosis, because of a resurgence in the sales
of such turtles in the last 4 years. The public health impact of
turtle-associated salmonellosis in humans is an estimated 74 000
cases in the USA per year.
Salmonellosis can be transmitted either directly from contact with
the turtle or its feces or indirectly through the animal's water.
Turtles carrying the organism usually do not appear to be sick. Their
feces do not always contain the bacteria, therefore a single negative
test does not prove they are _Salmonella_-free.
Although anyone can acquire a salmonellosis infection, the risk is
highest in infants, young children, the elderly, and others with
lowered natural resistance to disease. Pregnancy, cancer,
chemotherapy, organ transplant, diabetes, and liver problems pose
particular risks. Gastrointestinal symptoms following Salmonella
exposure begin in 6 to 72 hours (usually 12 to 36 hours) and
generally last for 2 to 7 days.

[Acquiring potentially serious and sometimes fatal enteric illnesses
can be unavoidable but certain behaviors, such as buying these
turtles and drinking unpasteurized milk, are things that can increase
this risk.
