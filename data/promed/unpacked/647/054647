Subject: Botch-up over horse virus
Source: Sunday Star - Times, 1 Aug 1999 (edited)

A MAF botch-up has resulted in a potentially devastating equine virus
spreading around the country, putting the country's multimillion-dollar
horse breeding industry at risk.
EVA, or equine viral arteritis, which has caused widespread abortions in
mares overseas, had all but been eradicated here after years of strict
control.
But the sole surviving stallion which still sheds the virus infected
another sire at a South Auckland stud and, through MAF inaction, its semen
sent around the country un-checked for the past 2 breeding seasons. Vital
blood test results that would have alerted the industry to the stallion's
infection became lost during MAF restructuring, a lapse industry leaders
say could have had disastrous consequences.[In all likelihood, the virus
was acquired by the second stallion (sire) by breeding an infected mare
that had previously bred to the first infected sire, or by respiratory
contact.]
Investigations show MAF knew of Sands A Flyin's EVA infection 12 months
before it acted to prevent spread of the virus. For the past few months MAF
has been in a costly damage control operation, attempting to trace where
the horse's semen was sent and blood-testing all stallions who might have
come into contact with infected mares.
Six of 22 sires tested have come up EVA-positive in blood tests and
industry chiefs are now holding their breath, says Equine Health
Association chairman Bruce Graham, while tests are completed to confirm
whether any are EVA shedders.

[Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is an acute, contagious, viral disease
characterized by fever, depression, dependent edema (especially of the
limbs, scrotum, and prepuce in the stallion), conjunctivitis, nasal
discharge, and abortion.
Equine arteritis virus, the causal agent of EVA is an RNA virus that has
been classified in the genus _Arterivirus_ in a newly proposed family, the
Arteriviridae. Strains of the virus appear to vary in their ability to
produce disease, including abortion.
The natural and experimental host range of equine arteritis virus appears
to be restricted to equids. Based on serologic evidence, the virus is
distributed in horse populations throughout the world. However, outbreaks
are uncommon and frequently associated with the movement of horses.
The two most important routes of transmission of the virus are respiratory
via the acutely infected horse and venereal via the acute or chronically
infected stallion. Aerosol transmission is the principal means of spread of
infection among horses closely congregated such as at racetracks, shows,
and sales. Venereal transmission by an infected stallion is frequently
responsible for dissemination of the virus on breeding farms. Indirect
spread of the virus through contact with contaminated fomites (e.g.,
shanks, twitches, apparel, and personnel) is of minor significance during
outbreaks. Congenital infection of foals due to exposure of mares late in
gestation has been infrequently recorded.
A significant percentage of stallions become carriers after exposure to the
virus. These stallions transmit the virus venereally and play a major role
in maintaining infection in horse populations from year to year. Attempts
to establish the carrier state in mares, geldings, and sexually immature
colts have been unsuccessful.
No specific antiviral treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment
(antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretics) is indicated. Good nursing
are and rest with a gradual return to normal activity are desirable. There
is no known medical means of eliminating the carrier state in the stallion.
EVA can be prevented and controlled by sound management practices and
selective use of a commercial, modified live virus vaccine. While the
vaccine is both safe and immunogenic for stallions and non pregnant mares,
it is not recommended for use in pregnant mares, or in foals less than 6
weeks old.
Prevention and control programs are aimed at curtailing dissemination of
the infection. This minimizes the risk of virus-related abortions and helps
prevent development of the carrier state in stallions. - MOD.TG]
