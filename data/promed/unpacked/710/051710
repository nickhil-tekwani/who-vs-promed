[I would recommend that those interested in better understanding the
challenges when individuals don't cooperate, disobey the export
regulations intentionally, and when such individuals are regulated by
a system which is badly flawed, examine this series of postings
carefully, starting with
Equine infectious anemia - Romania: control deficiencies 20100914.3313.

Clearly, untrustworthy individuals handle and trade animals in every
country all over the world and this has happened since the beginning
of history. However, ineffective animal disease control systems as
demonstrated by this ongoing situation, is always costly in so many
ways.

Individuals who ignore the importance of the health status of their
animals and then try to export them can cause a chain of disease
events that are not only frustrating because they should never have
occurred in the 1st place, but also keep truly innocent farmers
suffering losses and disease control officials fighting unnecessary
disease control battles in times of limited resources. In this case,
we can chalk up another sick and subsequently euthanized equine, this
time in France. Only time will tell how long this sad saga will
continue and how many more cases will be found. - Mod.PC]
