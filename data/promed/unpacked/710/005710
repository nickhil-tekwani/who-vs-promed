In Cuttack, 8 youths from Balasore suffering from an unknown disease were today [17 Jul 2018] admitted to the SCB Medical College and Hospital (SCBMCH) after 2 of their mates succumbed to the disease at Goa last week.

All of them hailing from Nimatpur in Bhograi area of the district were employed at a restaurant in Goa, sources said. After their return from Goa, the patients were 1st admitted to the Balasore District Headquarters Hospital (DHH) and later shifted to the SCB with the help of district administration.

According to reports, the affected youth have been complaining of fever and stomach ache. "Some 2 weeks ago, one of them fell ill, following which he was rushed to a hospital in Goa. He returned after treatment but again fell ill and succumbed to the disease on his way to the hospital," said a relative of one of the youths. Similarly, another youth fell ill a few days back and was rushed to hospital but was declared dead by the doctors, he added.

Though the exact reason of the disease is yet unclear, it is being suspected that Nipah virus might be the reason behind the illness.

"I had fever a few days back and got healed after taking medicine. However, now I am suffering from cough. We were living in Goa together and fell ill one after another. It could be due to some kind of virus," said an ailing youth.

"The patients claim that 2 of their mates died due to anthrax in Goa. However, they do not possess any documentary proof to establish the same. They are suffering from normal fever and cough, and no symptom of anthrax was found in any of the patients," said Premkant Mohanty, a doctor at the DHH.

The blood samples of the patients have been collected and sent for medical examination at SCB, sources said.

[Symptoms mentioned in the above cases are too non-specific to hazard a guess as to what the etiology of their illness might be. The basis for suspecting Nipah virus infection is not mentioned. Perhaps the recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala has raised a certain level of suspicion, although Kerala and Goa states are quite distant from each other.

ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the laboratory results and any additional cases that might occur. - Mod.TY
