Additional information on the H7N7 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus
--------------------------------------------------
Following our ProMED-mail posting of March 3 2003 [see ProMED-mail
post: "Avian influenza - Netherlands (04) 20030304.0540"] on the
"Characterisation of the Virus Causing the Current Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza (HPAI)Outbreak in the Netherlands", we now have
completed the sequence analyses of parts of the internal genes of the
H7N7 virus. For each of these genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS),
between 600 and 900 nucleotides were sequenced. Searches in public
sequence databases and construction of phylogenetic trees revealed
that each of the genes is of (Eurasian) avian origin.
These findings, and the fact that H7 viruses have caused only
sporadic mild disease (conjunctivitis) in humans in the past, suggest
that it is unlikely that the H7N7 virus currently circulating in
poultry in The Netherlands will pose a risk to public health.

[The data describing the partial sequencing of the 6 internal genes
of the H7N7 avian influenza virus responsible for the outbreak of
HPAI in the Netherlands provide reassurance that this virus has not
acquired genes that would enable it to cause significant disease in
humans, nor allow it to spread from person to person. Again, these
authors are to be congratulated on the speed with which they have
obtained these important data. - Mod.CP]
[A brief literature search has produced the following (selected) data
from the chronology of H7N7 (references are available):
1. An H7N7 influenza virus was identified in migrating starlings
(_Sturnus vulgaris_) in Israel in 1979. The isolate was antigenically
similar to FPV/Dutch/27 virus and was found to be avirulent.
2. In 1980, the serotype H7N7 was isolated in Belgium from a flock of
laying hens, with a drop in egg production and a flock of broilers
with respiratory disorders.
3. An H7N7 influenza virus was isolated in 1985 from a poultry farm
with high mortality in Victoria, Australia. The virus was highly
pathogenic in chickens and turkeys but produced no clinical disease
in ducks. An antigenically similar virus was isolated from starlings
and serological evidence of H7N7 virus infection was found in
sparrows. Studies produced evidence for transmission of virulent
influenza viruses between domestic poultry and passerine birds.
4. The H gene of the duck-origin H7N7 virus that caused
conjunctivitis in a human in the UK in 1996 had 98.2 percent homology
with an H7N7 virus isolated from turkeys in Ireland in 1995. - Mod.AS]
