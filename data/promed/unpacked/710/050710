Progress Toward Interruption of Wild Poliovirus Transmission ---
Worldwide, January 2010--March 2011
-----------------------------
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched in 1988.
By 2006, transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) was
interrupted in all but 4 countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and
Nigeria) (1). Subsequently, 39 previously polio-free countries
experienced outbreaks following importation of WPV, and transmission
became reestablished in Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), and Sudan (2,3). This update summarizes progress toward polio
eradication during 2010 and the 1st quarter of 2011. Worldwide, 1291
WPV cases were reported in 2010, a 19 percent decrease from 2009; WPV
type 3 (WPV3) cases decreased 92 percent, but WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases
increased 145 percent. During 2010, 232 (18 percent) WPV cases were
reported from the 4 polio-endemic countries; 159 (12 percent) cases
were reported in Angola, Chad, and DRC; and 900 (70 percent) cases
were reported in 13 countries, including 2 countries with outbreaks
continuing from 2009 and 11 with new importations. During 2010, WPV
cases in India and Nigeria decreased greater than or equal to 94
percent compared with 2009. Outbreaks in Tajikistan and the Republic
of the Congo (Congo) accounted for 2/3's of cases (842) in 2010 (4,5).
All new outbreaks in 11 polio-free countries in 2010 were stopped or
were on track to being stopped within 6 months of outbreak
confirmation. During January--March 2011, substantially more WPV cases
occurred in Chad, DRC, and Pakistan than during the same period of
2010. To further progress toward polio eradication and achieve the
2012 target of ending all WPV transmission, significant increases in
resources and political commitment are needed.

2010--2012 GPEI Strategic Plan
In May 2008, to overcome barriers to interruption of WPV
transmission, the World Health Assembly sought to develop new
strategies to eradicate polio. A year-long assessment led to
development of the 2010--2012 GPEI Strategic Plan (6). The plan
includes the following milestones, which will be assessed quarterly:
1) stopping WPV transmission following importation in countries with
outbreaks in 2009 by mid-2010 and stopping WPV transmission in
subsequent outbreaks within 6 months of confirmation, 2) stopping WPV
transmission in countries with reestablished transmission* by the end
of 2010, 3) stopping WPV transmission in at least 2 of the 4
WPV-endemic countries by the end of 2011, and 4) stopping WPV
transmission in all countries by the end of 2012.

Routine vaccination
In 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, global
routine vaccination coverage of infants with 3 doses of trivalent
poliovirus vaccine by age 12 months (Pol3) was estimated to be 83
percent and varied by World Health Organization (WHO) Region: 72
percent in the African Region; 91 percent in the Region of the
Americas; 86 percent in the Eastern Mediterranean Region; 96 percent
in the European Region; 74 percent in the South-East Asia Region; and
97 percent in the Western Pacific Region. ** In 2009, estimated
national Pol3 coverage was 85 percent in Pakistan, 83 percent in
Afghanistan, 67 percent in India, and 54 percent in Nigeria, but
coverage in individual high-risk states/provinces was considerably
below the national average.

Supplementary immunization activities
In 2010, a total of 309 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)
*** using OPV were conducted in 49 countries (130 national
immunization days, 140 subnational immunization days, 11 child health
days, and 28 mop-up rounds). Of these SIAs, 87 (28 percent) were
conducted in the 4 polio-endemic countries (38 in India, 20 in
Pakistan, 12 in Afghanistan, and 17 in Nigeria), 94 (30 percent) in 16
previously polio-free countries affected by outbreaks following
importation, 56 (18 percent) in countries with reestablished
transmission (Angola, Chad, DRC, and Sudan), and 72 (23 percent) in 25
countries without confirmed cases of WPV during 2010. An estimated
2.21 billion doses of OPV were delivered to approximately 400 million
persons, most of them children aged less than 5 years. Of the doses
administered, approximately 33 percent were trivalent oral poliovirus
vaccine (tOPV), 23 percent were monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1), 4
percent were monovalent OPV type 3, and 40 percent were bivalent OPV
types 1 and 3 (bOPV).

Poliovirus surveillance
The quality of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is
monitored by performance indicators, including the nonpolio AFP rate
and the proportion of AFP cases with timely collection of adequate
stool specimens (7). **** Of 20 polio-affected countries during 2010,
13 (65 percent) achieved greater than or equal to 2 nonpolio AFP cases
per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years and greater than or
equal to 80 percent of AFP cases with adequate specimens; only 12 (60
percent) of these countries had at least 50 percent of the population
in states/provinces meeting both surveillance indicator targets (7).

During 2009, sampling of sewage for WPV (environmental surveillance)
in India (one city, 3 sites) and Pakistan (2 cities, 10 sites)
detected WPV in the absence of WPV-positive AFP cases (7). In 2010,
environmental surveillance in these 2 countries was expanded to 5
other cities and 13 additional sites (India: one city, 5 sites;
Pakistan: 4 cities, 8 sites), for a total of 26 sites in 8 cities (7).
Environmental surveillance in many of these new sites in 2010 again
detected WPV in the absence of WPV-positive AFP cases. Although no WPV
cases have been reported in Sudan since June 2009, WPV1 genetically
linked to WPV1 transmission in north Sudan during 2009 was isolated
from a sewage sample collected in December 2010 in Aswan, Egypt.
Longstanding environmental surveillance in Egypt supplemented AFP
surveillance before the last indigenous WPV case there in 2004, and
since then has detected WPV intermittently that originated from
outside Egypt until this finding, most recently in 2008 (8).*****

Incidence of WPV-confirmed AFP
As of [19 Apr 2011], a total of 1291 WPV cases with onset of
paralysis in 2010 had been reported worldwide ([see Table at above
given URL link for this article]), a 19 percent decrease compared with
1604 WPV cases reported in 2009. Outbreaks in Tajikistan and Congo
accounted for 840 (70 percent) WPV1 cases, which contributed to a 145
percent increase in WPV1 cases, from 492 in 2009 to 1204 in 2010. WPV3
cases decreased 92 percent, from 1122 cases in 2009 to 87 cases in
2010. In the 1st quarter of 2011, 102 WPV cases (93 WPV1 and 9 WPV3)
were reported, compared with 95 WPV cases in the 1st quarter of 2010
(55 WPV1 and 40 WPV3) ([see table at above given URL]).

Polio-endemic countries: India reported 42 WPV cases with onset in
2010 (18 WPV1 and 24 WPV3), a 94 percent reduction compared with 741
cases reported in 2009 (79 WPV1, 661 WPV3, and one mixed WPV1/WPV3).
Until 2009, the majority of polio cases in India occurred in, or were
directly related to cases in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar. No WPV cases have been confirmed from Uttar Pradesh since [21
Apr 2010] (WPV3), and none from Bihar since [1 Sep 2010] (WPV1).
During the 4th quarter of 2010, 2 WPV1 cases occurred at a focus of
persistent transmission in northern West Bengal and adjacent
Jharkhand, and one WPV3 case in Jharkhand. During January--March 2011,
one WPV1 case was reported near Kolkata in West Bengal.

Nigeria reported 21 WPV cases with onset in 2010 (8 WPV1 and 13
WPV3), a 95 percent decrease compared with 388 cases reported during
2009 (75 WPV1 and 313 WPV3); however, 12 WPV cases occurred during the
4th quarter of 2010. In the 1st quarter of 2011, 8 WPV cases were
reported (6 WPV1 and 2 WPV3), compared with 2 WPV3 cases reported
during the 1st quarter of 2010. As of April 2011, WPV3 originating
from Nigeria was detected in a case in Mali and a case in Niger; in
Cote d'Ivoire, WPV3 from cases in 2011 was distantly related to WPV
isolated from cases in Nigeria in 2009.

Afghanistan reported 25 WPV cases with onset in 2010 (17 WPV1 and 8
WPV3), a 34 percent decrease from 38 WPV cases reported in 2009 (15
WPV1 and 23 WPV3). Among the 25 WPV cases, 21 (84 percent) (13 WPV1
and 8 WPV3) were reported from districts in the conflict-affected
south region, and 4 WPV1 cases in districts of the east and northeast
regions followed importation from Pakistan. In the 1st quarter of
2011, one WPV1 case was reported compared with 7 WPV cases (one WPV1
and 6 WPV3) in the 1st quarter of 2010.

Pakistan reported 144 WPV cases with onset in 2010 (120 WPV1 and 24
WPV3), a 62 percent increase from 89 cases reported in 2009 (60 WPV1
and 28 WPV3, and one mixed WPV1/WPV3); 100 (69 percent) cases were
reported from conflict-affected areas, including 73 cases from the
northwestern Federally Administered Tribal Areas and 23 cases from
Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa Province. In the 1st quarter of 2011, 26 WPV1
cases were reported, compared with 12 WPV cases reported in the 1st
quarter of 2010 (3 WPV1 and 9 WPV3). In 2010, WPV1 from Pakistan was
imported into Afghanistan.

Countries with reestablished transmission: No WPV cases were reported
from Sudan in 2010. Angola reported 33 WPV1 cases with onset in 2010,
a 14 percent increase from 29 WPV1 cases reported in 2009; in the 1st
quarter of 2011, 2 WPV1 cases were reported, compared with one WPV1
case in the 1st quarter of 2010. In 2010, WPV1 spread from Angola into
DRC and Congo, and subsequently to Gabon in 2011 (3,5).

Chad reported 26 WPV cases with onset in 2010 (11 WPV1 and 15 WPV3),
a 55 percent decrease from 58 WPV cases (all WPV3) reported in 2009; a
new WPV1 outbreak in late 2010 followed importation from Nigeria (3)
([see Figure at above given URL link for article]). During
January--March 2011, 20 WPV cases (18 WPV1 and 2 WPV3) were reported,
compared with 7 WPV cases (all WPV3) during January--March 2010.

DRC reported 100 WPV1 cases with onset in 2010; no WPV cases were
reported in 2009 (3). Of the 100 WPV1 cases, 6 cases from the
southeastern province of Katanga were linked genetically to the
reestablished transmission of WPV1 circulating during 2006--2008. The
other 94 WPV1 cases were linked to an outbreak beginning in early 2010
in Kasai-Occidental, a southwestern province bordering Angola,
following an importation from Angola; the outbreak subsequently
involved 3 other western provinces ([see Figure at above given URL
link]). In the 1st quarter of 2011, 36 WPV1 cases were reported in
western provinces, all related genetically to the 2010 importation
from Angola.

Countries affected by outbreaks: Three countries (Mali, Mauritania,
and Sierra Leone) with ongoing transmission since 2009 had onset of
the last case and stopped transmission in 2010. Imported WPV cases
were reported in 11 countries during 2010 and 4 in 2011 ([see Table at
above given URL link]), including an outbreak with 458 reported WPV1
cases in Tajikistan genetically related to WPV circulating in 2009 in
India, with subsequent spread to Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and the
Russian Federation (4). Congo provisionally has reported 382 cases in
2010 and one in 2011 (5). Outbreaks in 9 countries in 2010 have been
stopped (greater than or equal to 6 months have passed since the
latest reported case under surveillance approaching performance
indicator targets). Outbreaks in 2 countries (Congo and Uganda) in
2010 and in 4 countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Mali, and Niger) in
2011 are on track to being stopped within 6 months of confirmation,
although the civil disorder in Cote d'Ivoire has delayed response
immunization activities.

MMWR Editorial Note:
In 2010, progress toward polio eradication included 1) a greater than
or equal to 94 percent reduction in reported cases (with record lows)
in India and Nigeria compared with 2009, 2) success in interrupting
all outbreaks following importations in 2009, 3) success in or being
on track for interruption of new outbreaks in 2010, and 4) the lowest
level of WPV3 cases worldwide ever reported. During 2006--2009, mOPV1
was the predominant vaccine used in SIAs. The introduction of bOPV has
contributed to the reduction in WPV3 cases by increasing the number of
SIAs with type 3--containing OPV (1). Both India and Nigeria devoted
significant domestic resources to polio eradication, and mobilized all
levels of government, along with traditional and religious leaders, to
oversee and support eradication efforts (1,9,10).

Although 102 WPV cases were reported in the 1st quarter of 2011,
compared with 95 WPV cases in the 1st quarter of 2010, trends in
previous years indicate that total annual WPV cases are driven
primarily by the seasonality of WPV cases (peaking mid-year) and the
occurrence and extent of any polio outbreaks. In 2010, outbreaks in
Tajikistan and Congo accounted for 842 (65.1 percent) of all WPV
cases. Nonetheless, in India, only 6 WPV cases (5 WPV1 and one WPV3)
have been reported since [1 Sep 2010], following an aggressive SIA
schedule and 2 years of intensified immunization activities targeting
migrant populations. With this progress, India has the best
opportunity ever to interrupt transmission in 2011. Prospects are less
promising in some other countries. In Nigeria, an increase in WPV
cases from the end of 2010 to March 2011 and the continued circulation
of WPVin several states indicates a leveling of progress made in the
preceding 18 months (from early 2009 to 3rd quarter of 2010). Data
from the end of 2010 and the 1st quarter of 2011 indicate that urgent
actions need to be implemented to address this limited progress in
Nigeria and uncontrolled WPV transmission in Pakistan, Angola, Chad,
and DRC.

A recently established Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) is
overseeing progress toward achieving 2010--2012 GPEI strategic plan
milestones and country response plans. ****** At its March 2011
meeting, the IMB noted that Pakistan represents the greatest overall
risk for the GPEI. The Pakistani National Emergency Action Plan was
developed by national health experts at the request of Pakistan's
president, with international consultation, and launched in January
2011. A national task force will oversee implementation of the plan,
and the IMB will evaluate the plan's progress. Emergency action plans
also have been developed for Angola and DRC, and, with full support
from political and health leaders at all levels and with strong
support from GPEI partners, urgently need to be implemented. IMB also
concluded that continuing reestablished WPV transmission in Chad,
compounded by a new outbreak, represents a public health emergency
that lacks an adequate corrective action plan and needs more partner
support. The IMB indicated that a considerable surge in efforts is
needed for Nigeria to reach its potential to interrupt transmission by
the end of 2011. Although progress toward polio eradication was
substantial during 2010, IMB judged the milestone of halting all wild
poliovirus transmission globally by the end of 2012 to be "at risk"
based on current trends. Keeping GPEI on track for stopping WPV
transmission by the end of 2012 will require governments to react
promptly with increased resources and political commitment.

Polio this week - As of Wedn 11 May 2011

- Despite the recent progress seen in Afghanistan, India and Nigeria,
there is only one less case worldwide than was seen at this time last
year. Similarly, there are now only six fewer infected districts
globally than there was at this time last year [2010].
- Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) and Chad
account for the overwhelming majority of cases, together tallying 124
cases out of the global total of 145 cases. All othe r countries have
case counts in the single digits.
- On [21 Apr 2011], environmental sampling started at 3 sites in the
city of Patna in Bihar, India, as a supplementary tool to detect
poliovirus transmission in the state.

Data in WHO as of 11 May 2010 for 2010 data and 10 May 2011 for 2011
data
* The 2010 total for Congo includes 317 cases with inadequate
specimens that have been exceptionally classified as confirmed polio
based on their association with the WPV1 outbreak.

Additional country specific information:

Afghanistan
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains one. The most recent case was wild poliovirus
type 1(WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [11 Jan 2011] in Kandahar
province in the south of the country.
- The National Immunization Days (NIDs) held from [2-4 May 2011] took
place without major incident, despite security concerns. Children
across the country were vaccinated with tOPV and given vitamin A.
- Access to the southern region is much improved. During the recent
NIDs there were only minor access problems, except for Zabul province
where the NID did not take place due to continued disagreement on
selection of NID field staff between the provincial health department
and anti-government elements. However, negotiations continued after
the round was conducted, and it now looks possible that a window of
opportunity will soon open up. As soon as such an opportunity arises,
2 rounds will be conducted in quick succession (using the Short
Interval Additional Dose or 'SIAD' strategy).

India
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The country's 1st and
only case of WPV reported for 2011 (WPV1) had onset of paralysis on
[13 Jan 2011], in Howrah district, West Bengal.
- A Regional Review Meeting of the northern region is taking place
this week involving surveillance medical officers, sub-regional team
leaders and regional team leaders. The meeting will look at the
ongoing improvements in Delhi and identification of further
improvements in supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) and
surveillance needed for Punjab and Mewat, Haryana.
- Mop-up vaccination campaigns in key areas of West Bengal took place
from [1 May 2011], and further Sub-national Immunization Days (SNIDs)
using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) are planned to begin on [22
and 29 May 2011] in several key high-risk districts.
- The national government and the state government of Bihar have
agreed to set up immunization stations at 11 key railway stations and
popular crossing sites on the border of India and Nepal. These sites
will be open and providing polio vaccination every day for the rest of
the year. Children moving through Bihar to other parts of the country
will be vaccinated, helping to prevent spread of the virus.
- On [21 Apr 2011], environmental sampling started at 3 sites in
Patna city in the state of Bihar, India, as a supplementary tool to
detect poliovirus transmission. Current environmental surveillance
sites in India include 3 in Mumbai and 6 in Delhi - none of which has
detected any WPV since November 2010. There are plans to set up
environmental sampling also in the city of Kolkata, West Bengal.

Nigeria
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 8. The most recent case was due to WPV1, with
onset of paralysis on [18 Mar 2011], from Sokoto, in the northwest of
the country.
- Next week, a national Maternal and New-Born Child Health Week
(MNCHW) will be conducted in all states of Nigeria. At fixed posts
around the country, expectant mothers and children less than one year
of age will be offered an integrated package of health interventions
including tetanus vaccine for women and Vitamin A, deworming tablets
and other routine immunizations for children. All children coming to
the health post will receive a dose of trivalent oral polio vaccine
(tOPV). In 8 of the highest risk states all children under 5 will be
immunized with an additional dose of bOPV, using the house-to-house
strategy.
- In preparation for the MNCHW, a major awareness campaign is being
conducted through the media, including public service announcements
and op-eds by influential individuals.

Pakistan
- Three cases were reported in the past week - all WPV1. The total
number of cases for 2011 is now 36. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [20 Apr 2011] (WPV1 from Frontier Region Kohat (Federally
Administered Tribal Areas), in the north-west of the country).
- NIDs using bOPV were held from [9-11 May 2011]. The campaign
received much media coverage, due to launches by high-level government
figures including the Governor of Sindh, the Chief Minister of KP and
the Chief Minister of Punjab.
- The security concerns in the wake of the death of Osama bin Laden
have subsided, and the effect on the recent NIDs was minimal. Despite
restrictions on the mobility of both international and national WHO
and UNICEF staff, they continued to effectively support Ministry of
Health staff in SIA preparations and implementation.

Angola
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 2. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of
paralysis on [4 Feb 2011].
- Angola carried out synchronized campaigns with neighbouring DR
Congo and the Republic of Congo from [28-30 Apr 2011]. A second
synchronized round with DR Congo and the Republic of Congo is planned
for [26-28 May 2011].

Central Asia and Russian Federation
- This region has not reported a case of wild poliovirus in more than
6 months. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2010]
in the Russian Federation.
- Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan carried out NIDs using tOPV from [18 Apr
2011]. Uzbekistan carried out NIDs using tOPV from [19 Apr 2011].
Turkmenistan carried out NIDs using tOPV from [25-28 Apr 2011]. The
Russian Federation carried out SNIDs using tOPV last week [?week
ending 6 May 2011].
- This week, a surveillance review will take place in Kazakhstan, and
a national polio meeting will be held in the Russian Federation,
involving representatives from all oblasts.
- A surveillance review will be conducted in Tajikistan from [13 to
20 Jun 2011].

Chad
- 16 new cases were reported in the past week - 15 WPV1 and 1 WPV3.
The total number of cases for 2011 is 41. The most recent case had
onset of paralysis on [6 Apr 2011] (WPV1 from Doba, Logone Oriental,
in the country's south).
- Staggered SNIDs using bOPV were held on [15-26 Apr 2011], and the
next NIDs are planned for [15-30 May 2011].

Congo and Gabon
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains one in the Republic of Congo (WPV1 with onset
of paralysis [22 Jan 2011]); and one in Gabon (WPV1 with onset of
paralysis on [15 Jan 2011]).
- The Republic of Congo vaccinated children in the southern provinces
using bOPV from [28-30 Apr 2011], as part of a synchronized round with
Angola and DR Congo.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
- One new case was reported in the past week. This brings the total
number of cases for 2011 to 47. The most recent case was due to WPV1
and had onset of paralysis on [13 Apr 2011] in Biyela, Kinshasa.
- DR Congo participated in synchronized campaigns with Angola and the
Republic of Congo on [28-30 Apr 2011], vaccinating children across the
nation with bOPV. A 2nd synchronized activity is planned for late [May
2011].

Horn of Africa
- No cases have been reported from this group of countries this year.
However, a single positive environmental sample collected in December
2010 from Aswan, Egypt has been genetically linked to virus
circulating in Sudan (Khartoum, northern Sudan, and Jonglei, southern
Sudan) in early 2009, indicating prolonged undetected circulation in
an area.
- Investigations continue to identify the most likely area where
transmission was missed; however, response SIAs are being planned in
parts of southern and northern Sudan, as well as in Upper Egypt.
- The Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG), met last week in
Nairobi. The TAG's key recommendations were for the countries of the
sub-region to act to stop ongoing WPV and circulating vaccine-derived
poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks, to reduce the risk of outbreaks
following new importations, and to strengthen surveillance throughout
the sub-region to ensure any residual transmission is identified and
any new importations are rapidly dealt with.
- The most recent SIAs were SNIDs conducted in Somaliland and
Puntland, Somalia from [24 Apr 2011]. Access to large parts of central
and southern Somalia continues to be severely restricted due to
threats from Al-Shabaab.

West Africa
- Two new cases (both WPV3) were reported in Mali this week. A total
of 7 cases have been reported in the region for 2011 (3 WPV3s from
Cote d'Ivoire, 3 WPV3 from Mali and one WPV3 from Niger). The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Mar 2011] (WPV3 from Mali).
- Coordinated multi-country SIAs were launched in 13 countries from
[29 Apr 2011]. The planned activity in the infected province of Bass
Sassandra, Cote d'Ivoire, has been postponed due to insecurity. This
province will be included in the full NIDs in late May and April
[2011] and will be targeted for further activities depending on
epidemiology.

[From the above summary reports/updates, a worrisome factor for the
global eradication effort seems to be the undetected circulation of
WPV in endemic countries in 2009 and 2010 (and perhaps in 2011),
signaling probable deficiencies in surveillance activities. The
identification of WPV in late 2010 in Egypt genetically similar to
that identified in 2009 in Sudan is an additional worrisome sign that
there is probably continued undetected WPV circulation in non-endemic
countries as well. One can't help but wonder if the next major step as
part of the polio eradication efforts will include an expansion of the
environmental sampling efforts in order to enhance WPV surveillance in
areas no longer reporting WPV positive acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)
cases. This may very well be a necessary step that carries a
significant financial implication as part of the "end-game" strategy.
As a reminder, the last WPV isolate from a paralytic case in Uganda
was genetically related to a WPV that had been last identified a year
earlier in Kenya, suggesting there had been undetected WPV circulation
in the area for a year (see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis -
worldwide (23): Uganda 20101027.3900).
