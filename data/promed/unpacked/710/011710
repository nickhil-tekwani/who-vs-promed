----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have some concerns with the statement that meloxicam is a "safe"
NSAID for these birds to ingest. The tests run on these birds to
assess for kidney damage -- uric acid levels -- are extremely crude
indicators of kidney disease in birds, often not elevating until 70
percent + of total kidney function is compromised. It may be more
meaningful to perform more advanced assessments of kidney function
through endoscopic biopsy or renal scintigraphy. Or as hard as it is
to lose any of these birds, one should sacrifice high-level-exposed
birds and perform pathological assessments. My concern is that
"recommending meloxicam" as safe -- then finding later that it causes
a long slow renal function decline impacting successful reproduction
and survival of other health conditions -- may be counter-productive.

Each bird species is different in their response to this drug, so
pharmokinetic studies would also be useful to assess the properties
of this drug in these species. They also did not look at the effect
variation on age, perhaps nestlings being fed by parents
regurgitating the drug may be prone to renal failure.

Unless there is unpublished peer-reviewed data out there to support
safety, perhaps it would be better to state "meloxicam seems to be a
safer NSAID for these vultures to ingest, assuming some form of this
class of pharmaceuticals needs to be used." One needs only look at a
drug like acetaminophen (not an NSAID) or rofecoxib (Vioxx) in humans
to see where these drugs can seem safe but whose safety
recommendations change over time.

[I am concerned that the comment above has not taken into
consideration the implication of capture/endoscopic examination of
these sensitive and wild birds. While the writer indicates a more
sensitive way to access disease, the logistics of this manipulation
in wild birds deserves caution. Though the approach undertaken by the
authors of the discussed paper may, perhaps, not be optimal, it may
be more logically feasible. - Mod.TG]
