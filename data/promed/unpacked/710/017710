A patient with listeriosis probably caught it by eating a sandwich
from a contaminated batch that was recalled from hospitals, officials
said. The sandwiches, made by Kent-based Anchor Catering, had been
distributed across Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Essex, Middlesex, and Greater London.
On Mon 26 Mar 2007, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the
hospital patient had the same strain of listeria as the Anchor
products. The HPA said the strain was uncommon and the cases were
likely to be linked.
"An individual with a weakened immune system, who reported eating a
likely-to-be-Anchor sandwich in a hospital supplied by Anchor, has
tested positive for the same strain of _Listeria_ as the one found at
Anchor Catering," an HPA statement said. The HPA has not said which
hospital the patient was in, or released details about his/her condition.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) recalled the sandwiches on 16 Mar
2007. At that time, no cases of listeriosis had been reported, but
the FSA said symptoms could take up to 90 days to appear. The
sandwiches, with use-by dates from 21 Feb to 14 Mar 2007 and labeled
either Anchor or Pomegranate, had also been supplied to schools and
businesses across the South East. Warnings came from the FSA that
"large numbers" might have been eaten before the problem came to
light during routine tests on samples by Ashford Borough Council.
After the alert, Anchor voluntarily suspended production at its
sandwich factory, and recalled the products.
The FSA, which is investigating how the contamination happened, said
most illness caused by _Listeria_ can usually be treated with
antimicrobial agents. Those most at risk from the infection are
pregnant women, the elderly, young babies, and people with weakened
immune systems. Initial symptoms include fever, a flu-like illness,
or diarrhea.

[ProMED-mail has been following this story since the announcement of
the recall. Except for botulism or unusual circumstances, ProMED-mail
does not report recalls unless clinical cases occur. Given the
occurrence of a clinical case, this report and the original alert
from HPA are now posted.
Because of the risk of listeriosis from sandwich cold meats, one
might think that their distribution as part of a menu in locations
where particularly at-risk individuals such as health care settings
is not a good idea. - Mod.LL]

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Health Protection Agency (HPA)
are alerting consumers about certain sandwiches that may have been
contaminated with _Listeria_ and supplied to establishments in London
and the South East of England by Kent-based Anchor Catering. The HPA
is not currently aware of any reported cases of listeria infection as
a result of eating these sandwiches.
The sandwiches, which had use by dates from 21 Feb to 14 Mar 2007,
were supplied to a range of establishments in Kent, Sussex, Essex,
Middlesex, Surrey, and Greater London including schools, hospitals,
and local authorities before the problem became known. The majority
of the sandwiches were labelled as Anchor products and some others
were labelled as Pomegranate.
Ashford local authority identified the problem after a very small
number of samples tested positive for _Listeria_ during routine
sampling. The risk of listeriosis from eating these sandwiches is
very low but as a precautionary measure, the FSA and HPA are alerting
consumers about the possible contamination. Vulnerable groups such as
pregnant women, the elderly, and those with lowered immunity are more at risk.
Dr Graham Bickler, Regional Director of the HPA South East said,
"Most people will not suffer any ill effects but some groups of
people are more at risk and will need prompt treatment if they
develop the infection. This group includes pregnant women, the
elderly, young babies, and people whose immune systems are
compromised -- for example people with HIV or those undergoing chemotherapy.
"We are not aware of any infection at present but want people in
those vulnerable groups to be aware that if they have eaten
sandwiches from this company during the period in question and become
ill within 2-3 months they must seek medical advice. We also want
doctors and healthcare workers to be aware of the signs and symptoms
of listeria infection so the correct treatment can be offered promptly."
Andrew Wadge, Chief Scientist at the FSA said, "Listeria doesn't pose
a threat to the vast majority of the population but it can be serious
for some vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. We are working
closely with the company and the local authority to discover how this
happened. Although the company took prompt action to notify customers
and withdraw the product, large numbers of sandwiches may have been
consumed before the problem was detected."
On discovery of contamination, Anchor Catering voluntarily suspended
production and has informed HPA that it contacted the establishments
supplied with the sandwiches to withdraw them from sale. The FSA and
local authority are working with Anchor Catering to identify the
source of the contamination and production at the factory remains suspended.
Although there are many other causes of these symptoms, anyone in one
of the vulnerable groups who may be worried that they have been
exposed and develops these symptoms, should take advice from their
physician or hospital consultant. The illness can usually be
effectively treated with antibiotics.
