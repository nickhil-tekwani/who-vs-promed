A total of 11 people at 2 Queensland properties have been exposed to the potentially fatal Hendra virus in the 1st outbreaks of the "high-risk" winter period as scientists await approval for the "emergency use" of a new horse vaccine.

Authorities yesterday [30 May 2012] conducted health assessments on the owners and treating veterinarians of 2 horses that died after contracting the deadly flying fox-borne disease in separate cases more than 800 km [500 mi] apart.

Officials also assessed other horses, cats, and dogs on the properties where the horses died -- one in the far north Queensland town of Ingham on Sunday [27 May 2012] and the other outside central Queensland's Rockhampton on Saturday [26 May 2012]. Quarantine exclusion zones were established.

Queensland chief veterinary officer Rick Symons warned that the state was entering the "high-risk" Hendra period, but said the virus could occur any time throughout the year, citing a case in Townsville in January 2012.

But he said it was unusual for 2 cases to occur at almost the same time in different regions. "They are at virtually the same time and we don't know whether that is a coincidence or an indication of things to come," he said. "Every Hendra case concerns us because it's a risk to horses and it's a risk to people."

Queensland's chief health officer, Jeannette Young, last night [30 May 2012] said public health experts had determined all 11 people exposed in the latest outbreaks had a "low level" of risk.

Hendra virus was declared endemic across Queensland and NSW last year [2011] after the worst reported outbreak, in which 22 horses died and a dog was euthanized.

It is transmitted from asymptomatic flying foxes to horses, and can then spread to humans in rare cases. 4 of the 7 confirmed human cases since 1994 have been fatal.

Small trials of a CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]-developed Hendra vaccine are under way. Australian Animal Health Laboratory veterinary pathologist Deborah Middleton said the agency was working with a commercial manufacturer in the hope of achieving a widespread release of the vaccine next year [2013].

The Queensland Liberal National Party government has committed to allowing communities with pest flying fox populations to move them on, amid fears of Hendra outbreaks.

But Environment Minister Andrew Powell warned that it was "not open season on bats" and said approvals were not yet established.

A horse died near Rockhampton on Saturday night [26 May 2012]. Then on Sunday, another horse, near Ingham, died.

Re: Hendra virus horse vaccine research
---------------------------------------
CSIRO maintains a significant program of research on bat-borne viruses, including Hendra virus research.

To date the infection pathway of humans with Hendra virus has been from bats to horses, then from horses to humans -- there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission or of direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans. Given this scenario, CSIRO believes the best opportunity for intervention in the human infection pathway is to vaccinate horses to prevent the disease in horses and reduce virus shedding; both of these are critical to reduce the risk of spread of the virus to people.

We are currently undertaking studies to evaluate the level and duration of protection and the level and duration of virus shedding -- if any -- from vaccinated horses, with a focus now on determining for how long after vaccination horses are protected. This data will guide the frequency at which booster vaccinations should be given to keep protection at its peak.

CSIRO is now working with a commercial partner to gear up large scale production of the vaccine for wide spread use. Prior to its release for general application a registration package will need to be prepared that will include data on safety, efficacy, duration of protection, and small scale application in the field to ensure the vaccine performs with the same level of efficacy in the field as under experimental conditions.

If the vaccine should prove unsuccessful at any stage of the evaluation process (efficacy, safety, or field trial) the approach will need to be revaluated. Small scale field trials of the vaccine are currently underway, and an application to support possible use of the vaccine under permit has been made by the commercial partner and is currently under review. The current target for a fully registered vaccine, if the trials and evaluations are successful, remains 2013.

The CSIRO is still trying to develop a Hendra virus vaccine, amid 2 simultaneous outbreaks of Hendra virus in Queensland this week. 2 horses died from the disease last weekend [26-27 May 2012] at properties near Rockhampton in central Queensland and Ingham in the state's north.

However, the CSIRO says the latest outbreaks does not mean there has been an escalation in the disease.

Professor Martin Jaggo, the director of the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, says more research is need before scientists can says if there is a pattern to the outbreaks.

"It'll be about around the distribution of the bats, but also climate conditions, and it may well be related to the habitats they have in Queensland and it may even be what they feed on," he said.

"We really don't know what the trigger is for bats shedding virus." However, he says scientists are making excellent progress developing a vaccine.

Professor Jaggo says the horse vaccine is expected to be available early next year [2013]. He says it is working with a commercial company to meet the regulatory requirements for safety and effectiveness. "We've got to make sure the vaccine doesn't cause any harm to the horses, but at the same time, protects the horses from diseases," he said.

"We're collecting that data now to meet those regulatory requirements. If we look at how normally it goes with this sort of work, we would certainly be hoping the vaccine would be available early next year."

[For people this disease is very frightening. The disease could take the life of an owner's horses, dogs, cats, and potentially even their own. It is reported in some sources that some veterinarians are now refusing to work with horses. Certainly horses can be a challenge and that is made more difficult with personal protective equipment (PPE). While the PPE may prevent the virus from affecting the veterinarian, I do not know how easy it is for the veterinarian to move around in the required PPE or if it frightens a horse or puts the vet in some danger from movement of the horse.

Certainly all affected owners are anxious for the vaccine, but it is especially good news to hear of the excellent progress. Special thanks to Emma Wilkins and Dr Martin Jaggo for reaching out personally and providing accurate information on the vaccine [item 2 above].
