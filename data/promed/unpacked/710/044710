Since the beginning of the year [2022], 205 people have suffered from tick bites in Qyzylorda. Of these, 3 residents of the city were examined for suspected Crimean-Congo fever, Kazinform's correspondent reports.

"The diagnosis of the first patient was revealed through laboratory, epidemiological and clinical studies. The diagnoses of the other 2 patients have been changed due to the fact that the results of laboratory tests were negative," commented Aiman Zhanakhaeva, spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of the Qyzylorda region.

Earlier it was reported that more than 80 children sought medical help after being bitten by ticks in North Kazakhstan region. More than 800 children were bitten by ticks in the Almaty region, and one probable case of Crimean-Congo fever was registered in Shymkent on [16 May 2022].

One probable case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was registered in the city of Shymkent on [16 May 2022], Kazinform reports with reference to the Telegram channel of the International Control Commission for non-proliferation of COVID-19.

According to the Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control, a 46 year old resident of the Baidibek district of the Turkistan region was admitted to the regional clinical hospital with severe gastrointestinal bleeding. On the same day [16 May 2022], the patient was transferred to the Shymkent City Infectious Diseases Hospital with a diagnosis of "probable case of CCHF".

To date [17 May 2022], the general condition of the patient is severe, due to intoxication and hemorrhagic syndrome. The woman is isolated and is in the intensive care unit of the Shymkent city infectious diseases hospital.

A total of 15 contacts were identified, 9 of them medical workers. All of them have been taken under medical supervision. In order to prevent an epidemic, a combination epidemiological, zooparasitological and veterinary preventive measures is being implemented.

Shymkent is one of the disadvantaged regions in terms of the incidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever -- last year [2021] there were 2 cases of infection. This year [2022] to date [17 May 2022], 284 residents of Shymkent have sought medical help due to tick bites. In the corresponding period of 2021 there were 94 cases. This represents a 3-fold increase.

In order to prevent the reproduction of ticks and to register the incidence of CCHF among people in Shymkent, anti-tick treatment continues. To prevent the disease, specialists of the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of the city and its territorial departments regularly carry out sanitary education and explanatory work.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a particularly dangerous disease transmitted through tick bites, caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. If the patient does not seek medical help in time, the patient may die. The incubation period is 1-14 days, the duration of this period depends on the route of infection of the virus.

CCHF starts with a rapid rise in temperature to 39-40 degrees [C; 102.2-104 deg F], severe headaches, redness of the eyes, face, neck and upper body, pain in the muscles of the neck and lower back, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, then a rash appears, bleeding from the nose, gums, uterine and gastric bleeding, hematomas are formed at the injection sites.

Ticks are the main sources and vectors of infection. Infection of people occurs mainly through the bite of a tick, the ingestion of the blood of engorged ticks. The disease is also transmitted through contact with blood and bloody secretions, and the biological fluid of CCHF patients. It can be transmitted through contaminated medical instruments if they contain the CCHF virus.

In order to prevent the disease, it is necessary to carry out anti-tick treatment of animals, livestock buildings and residential premises of settlements located in natural foci. When caring for animals in natural foci and when shearing sheep, in order to protect against attack and contact with blood, it is necessary to use special suits (overalls with a hood, trousers tucked into socks, boots and rubber gloves). When going out into nature, it is recommended to wear light-colored clothes (on which it is easier to detect ticks), inspect clothes and skin for ticks, and apply repellents for skin and clothes. In order to prevent a particularly dangerous infection transmitted from tick bites, it is necessary to use means that protect against tick attacks.

According to media (in Turkish) on 14 May 2022, a person has died of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the town of Sivas, in the northern part of central Turkey. It is also reported that 3 people are currently being treated for CCHF in Tokat in the same part of the country. There have been 27 cases of CCHF in Turkey from 1 Jan 2022 to 16 May 2022.

CCHF is an infection spread by tick bites that can cause a severe viral illness accompanied by bleeding. It is found in over 30 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern/Southern Europe.

Advice for travellers
-------------------
CCHF is extremely rare in travellers. The risk is higher if you are travelling to an area where the infection occurs and will be:
- at increased risk of tick bites (for example whilst camping, hiking, visiting farms or animal sanctuaries)
- involved in the care or slaughter of animals
- a health care worker who may be exposed to infected patients

If you are travelling to a high risk area, you need to be aware of the disease and how to prevent becoming infected by:
- avoiding tick bites
- following appropriate infection control procedures if you are working in a health care setting
- wearing gloves and other protective clothing if you are involved in the care or slaughter of animals.

[The transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among health care providers in areas with potential circulation of CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with haemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should only be conducted under appropriate biological containment conditions. - Mod.UBA
