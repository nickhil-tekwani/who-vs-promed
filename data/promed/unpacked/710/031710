Last year [2010] nearly 30 000 Americans were diagnosed with Lyme
disease and Pennsylvania leads the nation in the number of confirmed
cases. According to Allegheny County Health Department spokesperson
Guillermo Cole, the number of cases among Allegheny County residents
has been hovering in the 20-30 a year range for some time but how the
disease is being contracted is changing.

In the past, the infections were mainly acquired on trips outside our
region but in recent years more and more infections are being acquired
locally," said Cole. He is not surprised, "The tick that transmits
Lyme disease, which is the deer tick, is now the most commonly found
tick on people and pets here in Allegheny County." The Centers for
Disease Control confirms that the illness continues to spread. In 2009
there were 4950 confirmed cases of Lyme disease in Pennsylvania.

Lyme disease can usually be treated with antibiotics with the patient
suffering no long-term effects but if not treated while in its early
stages it can have lasting impacts on the central nervous system. Cole
says many people with Lyme disease originally believe they have a mild
case of the flu until the telltale red "bullseye" rash begins to
appear.

People usually come in contact with deer ticks while walking through
high grasses or through leaf litter. Cole says staying on paths or in
clearings will help to avoid contact with the ticks. Applying insect
repellant containing 20-30 percent DEET will also help as well as
tucking long pants into socks and wearing long sleeve shirts when
hiking through areas where the tick may live. Most Lyme cases are
reported from late May through August.

As the weather gets warmer, more people have the itch to be outside.
But local health departments want you to be on the lookout for a
certain kind of bug.

Cases of Lyme disease, which is caused by deer ticks, are up in the
state [Wisconsin]. The number of cases statewide in 2010 rose to 2511,
up from 1948 in 2009. Locally, both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties
saw an increase in the number of Lyme disease cases. Eau Claire County
went from 158 cases in 2009 to 196 in 2010. The jump was even greater
in Chippewa County where 125 cases were reported in 2010; there were
[only] 79 cases in 2009.

A bigger deer population, more people living near wooded areas and
greater awareness about Lyme disease could be reasons for the higher
numbers. "They're coming in earlier I think or we're just seeing an
increase in people coming in and having us remove the tick for them,"
says Vicky Buhr, a Mayo Clinic Health System nurse practitioner.
"They're coming in and having the tick removed because they're afraid
they're going to get Lyme disease."

Buhr says a tick bite will usually appear in the form of a
red-colored bullseye. The person can also have flu-like symptoms. A
blood test is then used to determine if someone has Lyme disease. [The
diagnosis of Lyme disease at the early stage of erythema migrans is
clinical, based on the history of a tick bite in an endemic area and
the distinctive "bullseye" or target-like appearance of the skin
lesion. A serology test for Lyme disease at this early stage of the
disease is not the standard of care]. "If it's done early on, you may
get a false negative," says Buhr. "The antibodies will typically be
present at 4 to 6 weeks, [when] you can get an accurate test."

Not all tick bites lead to Lyme disease. "If the tick has been
attached [for] greater than 72 hours, you have about a 25 percent
chance of developing Lyme disease," says Buhr. "Less than 72 hours you
have a zero to one percent chance of getting it."

Buhr says you don't need to be in high grass to get a tick bite. Some
patients have found a tick bite after mowing the lawn. If you plan on
being outdoors wear tick repellent and check for ticks often. The
greatest risk for developing Lyme disease is during June and July.

[From the US CDC
---------------
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm):

"Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and
is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks
(_Ixodes_ spp.). Early manifestations of infection include fever,
headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema
migrans. Left untreated, late manifestations involving the joints,
heart, and nervous system can occur. ……..With approximately 20 000
new cases reported each year, Lyme disease is the most common
vectorborne disease in the United States. Cases occur most commonly in
northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states and among persons
aged 5-14 years and 45-54 years. Cases peak during summer months,
reflecting transmission by nymphal vector ticks during May and June.
Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991, the annual
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase likely
is the result of several factors, including a true increase in disease
incidence and enhanced case detection resulting from implementation of
laboratory-based surveillance in several states."

Climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding
wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer as well as of the
white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for
Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of the
disease. _Ixodes scapularis_, the primary vector for Lyme disease in
the northeastern US, travels into new areas on wildlife and birds.

Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is
considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania & Rhode
Island) and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin & Minnesota); 93 percent of
the total cases reported to the US CDC during 2003-2005 were reported
from these 10 states
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm).

1089-134.

"For prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, routine
use of antimicrobial prophylaxis or serologic testing is not
recommended (E-III). A single dose of doxycycline may be offered to
adult patients (200 mg dose) and to children 8 years of age and older
(4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) (B-I) when all of the
following circumstances exist:

a. the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or
nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached
for more than 36 hours on the basis of the degree of engorgement of
the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the
tick;
b. prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the
tick was removed;
c. ecologic information indicates that the local rate of infection of
these ticks with _B. burgdorferi_ is 20 percent or greater; and
d. doxycycline treatment is not contraindicated. The time limit of 72
hours is suggested because of the absence of data on the efficacy of
chemoprophylaxis for tick bites following tick removal after longer
time intervals. Infection of 20 percent or greater of ticks with _B.
burgdorferi_ generally occurs in parts of New England, in parts of the
mid-Atlantic States, and in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, but not
in most other locations in the United States."

"Erythema migrans is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the
United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical
diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation. In a patient with
a compatible epidemiologic and clinical history, the preferred means
of diagnosis is visual inspection of the skin lesion. Serologic
testing is too insensitive in the acute phase (the 1st 2 weeks of
infection) to be helpful diagnostically…..Patients should be treated
on the basis of clinical findings."
