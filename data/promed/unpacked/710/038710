An outbreak of the West Nile virus in California's Orange County has infected more than 90 people so far this year [2014], 7 times as many as were diagnosed in all of 2013, and public health experts say the region's prolonged drought may be a factor.

Not only has the number of human infections reported in the Southern California county since January [2014] dwarfed the 12 cases documented for all of 2013, but the prevalence of West Nile in birds, which harbor the virus, and in the mosquitoes transmitting it has also spiked.

The 94 confirmed human cases in the county, 3 of them fatal, represent about half of the 180-plus documented statewide so far this year and nearly a quarter of the 400 cases reported nationally.

Local health officials say they face a tough challenge in educating the public about the threat and persuading people to safeguard themselves against insect bites.

"Getting people in Southern California, which is not a particularly buggy place, to think about covering up and using bug repellent is an uphill battle," Deanne Thompson, a spokeswoman at the Orange County Health Care Agency, said on Tuesday [9 Sep 2014].

But the reason why Orange County has been so hard hit is still a mystery, experts said. Los Angeles and Fresno counties each have reported about 2 dozen cases this year.

Possible Drought Impact
-----------------------
Mosquito populations in Southern California this season are below normal, owing in part to a persistent drought that has dried up much of the standing water where the insects breed.

But scientists believe those same dry conditions have driven more birds into populated areas in search of water, concentrating numbers of the virus' preferred host and the mosquitoes that feed on them closer to people.

Outbreaks tend to flare up during warm weather, and the proportion of mosquitoes carrying West Nile [virus] this summer is much higher than usual.

The virus has turned up in 80 per cent of mosquitoes [pools] tested in Orange County this year [2014], the highest rate detected in California since the disease 1st surfaced there in 2004, said Jared Dever, spokesman for the county's vector control agency.

The percentage normally testing positive for West Nile averages about 20 per cent, he said.

Moreover, nearly 260 dead birds have tested positive so far this year, compared with 40 for all of 2013 and 109 during California's last sizeable outbreak in 2012.

About 80 per cent of people infected by West Nile show no signs of the disease and about 20 per cent become ill, typically with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea and swollen glands, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

About one in 150 infected people develops severe illness, including a neuroinvasive form of the disease that can lead to tremors, convulsions, disorientation, coma and death, the CDC says. Neurological effects can also be permanent.

Most of the Orange County cases were diagnosed because patients became sick: 63 with neuroinvasive disease -- including the 3 who died -- and 21 who developed mild fever, Thompson said. She said that 9 were identified through routine blood screening and were otherwise unaware they had been infected.

[It seems counterintuitive the West Nile virus transmission would increase under conditions of extreme drought and a decrease in the population of vector mosquitoes. The explanation offered above -- birds seeking water in populated areas where hosts, vectors and people are present -- seems reasonable. Since West Nile virus became endemic in the USA and was no longer an emerging pathogen, ProMED no longer reported case numbers except under unusual circumstances, such as focal outbreaks. This situation in Orange County, California, is one of those focal outbreaks, similar to the one that occurred in 2012 in the Dallas, Texas, area (see ProMED-mail post West Nile virus - USA (12): (TX, OK) 20120905.1282592). In the report above, no mention is made concerning attempts at vector control through insecticide spraying. Since the area is still within the usual transmission season, one can reasonably expect more cases to occur for at least 2 months more.
