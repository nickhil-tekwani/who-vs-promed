Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division, in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined.

Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by County staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.

Update no. 3: hepatitis A virus outbreak in San Diego County
------------------------------------------------------------
This health advisory updates local healthcare providers about recent hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections disproportionately affecting homeless and illicit drug-using individuals in San Diego County. Updated recommendations and resources on HAV are provided.

Situation
---------
As of 30 May 2017, 133 confirmed or probable HAV cases have been reported in an ongoing local outbreak in San Diego County. The cases had symptom onsets between 24 Nov 2016 and 26 May 2017. 106 (80 percent) of the cases have been hospitalized and 3 patients (2 percent) have died. The cases range in age from 21 to 82 years (median = 42 years), and 85 (64 percent) are male, with one (1 percent) self-identifying as a man who has sex with men. 84 (63 percent) of the cases are homeless, and 85 (64 percent) reported injection or non-injection illicit drug use; some cases have both risk factors. Of the cases with test results available for review, 28 of 106 (26 percent) have evidence of hepatitis C infection, and 7 of 107 (7 percent) have hepatitis B infection.

The CDC has confirmed HAV RNA in serum samples of 86 outbreak cases. Viral sequencing indicates that 2 unique, closely related strains of HAV genotype 1B are involved. These strains are different than those associated with the ongoing HAV outbreak in southeastern Michigan and the outbreaks linked to frozen strawberries in 2016 and pomegranate seeds in 2013.

There are several clusters of epidemiologically associated cases, although no specific common food, beverage, or drug sources have yet been identified. 27 cases reported receiving client services from a single homeless provider in downtown San Diego. 4 cases (3 clients, 1 volunteer) are associated with a homeless services provider in El Cajon. 6 cases are residents of a board and care facility in El Cajon. 6 cases are individuals who became symptomatic while incarcerated in a jail facility, but they were most likely exposed to the virus while homeless in the community. 2 secondary cases in jails have occurred, though each declined post-exposure prophylaxis during their exposure periods.

Although most cases have been from the El Cajon/La Mesa area and downtown San Diego, cases have also been confirmed in individuals who were only in North County during their exposure periods. Recent HAV cases include a healthcare worker at a facility where many HAV cases were treated, and an employee of an agency that provides services to the homeless. These individuals have no identified risk factors for HAV other than their employment. The likelihood that these cases are occupationally related is a strong reminder of the importance of standard precautions in healthcare and the need to vaccinate individuals who work closely with the at-risk populations.

Investigations of the confirmed and probable cases, as well as 2 dozen suspect cases, are ongoing.

[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase, now over a 6 month period.

Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)
--------------------------------------------------------------
5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)
4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)
31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)

There have been 53 more cases over about 4 weeks and 94 more cases over 8 weeks. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to been significantly higher.

It is not clear if the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. An epidemiologic curve showing dates of onset over time would be useful in sorting out the possibilities. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear if the fatalities occurred in those individuals.

Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors while homosexual practices is not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading. - Mod.LL
