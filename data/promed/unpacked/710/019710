Yesterday [18 Jun 2007] Municipal Epidemiological
Surveillance totaled the number of dengue cases
since the start of last week [10 Jun 2007]. From
the data provided, the [municipal] health units
recorded an additional 15 victims [clinically
diagnosed as dengue] plus the 6 that had
laboratory diagnosis by the Adolfo Lutz Institute.
These data bring to a total of 1809 cases of this
disease this year [2007]. In the first days of
the month [Jun 2007] 21 [cases] were registered,
the same number [of cases] as were announced
yesterday.
In the last week of May [2007] there were 61
cases, in the previous [week] 75, and before that
84 and 153. The progressive decline in the
numbers of cases indicate that the epidemic is
easing and may be drawing to an end.
Of the total cases up until the present, 972 were
laboratory diagnosed (serology) and 837
clinically by physicians, based on symptoms.
Despite the dry season, which does not favor the
accumulation of water, essential for the
proliferation of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_,
the vector of dengue [virus], the population must
remain on alert.
"As temperatures go higher, that is positive for
_Aedes_ breeding. As people permit water to
accumulate, the numbers of dengue cases diagnosed
will continue," affirmed the coordinator of the
Municipal Secretariat of Health, Danilo Bigeschi.

[There is an old saying that characterizes
persons [living in] poverty: "they sell their
lunch in order to buy dinner." This is how public
health [addresses] dengue control, counting
case-by-case and the accompanying trends as
though there were a stock market. One case more
or one less does not make a difference -- what is
important is that every 3 or 4 years we will live
through another [dengue] epidemic. - Mod.LJS,
trans. from Portuguese Mods.TY/JW]
[It is extraordinarily difficult to get the
public to continue to eliminate _Aedes aegypti_
breeding sites long after the dengue epidemic
ends, to prevent recurrence of dengue virus
transmission and a new outbreak.

Cases of dengue fever have been reported in the
Lethem area, but while authorities are seeing
many persons with signs and symptoms they have no
kits to test them, Acting Regional Health Officer
(RHO) Eugene Xavier says.
When contacted, Xavier confirmed that there was a
number of cases. He said up to last week Friday
[15 Jun 2007] they had kits and they had
confirmed some 11 cases, but the kits have run
out. Since then, they have seen a number of
persons with signs and symptoms who have come up
negative for malaria when tested. He said this
means that more than likely, those persons have
dengue fever, but there is no way to prove this.
Contact was made with Director of Disease Control
Services, Dr. Shamdeo Persaud, who told Stabroek
News that he had not heard any such reports. He
said usually the ministry would contact RHOs and
collect data on a weekly basis and it had not
received any such reports. He expressed surprise
that officials could say definitively that it was
dengue fever, since, according to him,
confirmatory tests for dengue had to be done by
the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC).
He said the kits to which Xavier referred were
used to test for antibodies. If a person was
exposed to any of the viruses that cause dengue
fever previously, the antibody would show up. As
a result one should wait until the definitive
test was done by CAREC to diagnose dengue.
Persaud explained that if his department was
informed it would have advised the region's
officials on vector control measures since there
was no specific medication for treating dengue
fever. The public would be advised to cover their
water supply since the _Aedes_ mosquito, which
transmits the disease, thrives in fresh water.
Also, the public would be advised to use insect
repellent and mosquito nets to minimize being
bitten by mosquitoes. Dr. Persaud had promised to
contact the regional officials and had advised
this reporter to call him back but when calls
were placed to his office he was not there.
According to Xavier, no one was hospitalised at
the moment, but the situation was worrying. He
said persons were treated for some of the
symptoms and since most of them live in Lethem
they were being monitored. He said that the
neighbouring Brazilian town, Bon Fim, did not
have a dengue outbreak. On Wednesday [20 Jun
2007] he met the town's Chamber of Commerce head
who informed that while there were cases of
malaria there was no dengue fever. The
authorities there were said to be in the process
of fogging the area. The acting RHO expressed the
need to have the Lethem area fogged as well.

[ProMED requests additional information on this
suspected dengue outbreak as it becomes
available. A diagnosis based on serology done on
single samples not involving IgG capture is not
adequate to establish dengue virus etiology of
these suspected cases. Flaviviruses, the family
to which dengue virus belongs, are notoriously
cross-reactive in serological tests.

Authorities have decreed a preventive alert in
the capital and in 4 departments [state of
province equivalents - Mod.TY] due to the
increase in dengue cases and announced that
campaigns to eradicate the mosquito vector of the
disease [virus] would be launched immediately.
This state of alert, which activates the entire
emergency system of Public Health will be applied
in the capital, San Vicente and La Paz, in the
central region of the country, La Libertad, in
the south and Santa Ana, and in the east of the
country. Public Health statistics indicate that
72 percent of the [dengue] patients [are found in
these areas].
Although [fatal] victims have not been recorded,
just between 9 and 19 Jun [2007] 134 dengue cases
have been confirmed, among whom 2 [cases]of the
dangerous hemorrhagic variant [occurred].
It was announced that health brigades would
initiate a house-by-house search which would
complement the tasks of household fumigation and
destruction of mosquito breeding sites. In the
Cuscatancingo municipality, in the outskirts of
the capital, _Aedes aegypti_ larvae were found in
55 houses of 100 inspected.

Thiruvananthapuram: More dengue cases have been
reported in the Thiruvananthapuram district with
the laboratory confirmation of 8 serum samples
that had been collected earlier. On Wednesday [20
Jun 2007] 4 fever cases reported are also
suspected to be dengue.
This apart, one case of imported malaria and 31
fever cases suspected to be chikungunya were also
reported from the district on Wednesday [20 Jun
2007]. So far, 532 suspected cases of chikungunya
and 98 confirmed cases of dengue have been
reported in the district this year [2007]. The
dengue cases, which had been on a low till May
[2007], went up following pre-monsoon showers.
Dengue has been endemic in the district for quite
a few years. Over 60 percent of the total dengue
case load in the State is being reported from
Thiruvananthapuram since the past 3 or 4 years
now. Of the 8 confirmed cases of dengue, 5 are of
children under treatment at SAT hospital.

The number of dengue cases in Singapore has
reached epidemic levels for the 1st time since an
outbreak of the disease infected thousands in the
city-state in 2006, as shown by government
statistics. During the past week [week of 10 Jun
2007] 401 cases were recorded, which exceeds the
level for an epidemic as defined by the local
administration.
The current outbreak has caused 2 deaths, evoking
local leader's memories of the 2005 epidemic, in
which 25 people died and thousands of persons
were infected in a population of 4.5 million
inhabitants.
Health authorities are checking habitations,
looking for breeding sites of the mosquito vector.

A fresh outbreak of dengue in Burma's [Myanmar's]
former capital Rangoon has raised new fears among
residents with at least 3 to 4 people being
admitted to hospital daily. There have been a
number of deaths from the fever.
While the fever, which is a recurring problem in
Burma come monsoon, has spread across the city,
the hardest hit according to Dr. Daw Tin Aye
Myint, head of Insein Township general hospital,
are Insein, Ahlone, Kyi Myin Dine and Shwe Pyi
Thar townships.
"I cannot tell you the exact number of patients.
There are about 3 to 4 and sometimes about 5 to 6
patients being admitted daily. And there are a
number of children as well," Dr. Myint told
Mizzima.
While avoiding terming it as 'serious', she
confirmed that there have been a few deaths
caused by the fever.
"Its more like recurring and there is nothing to
be alarmed about� The child patients become more
serious and there are already a few children who
have died because of the fever. But I cannot tell
you the numbers," Dr. Myint added.
Medical experts said dengue, which is caused by
mosquito bites, is common in Burma during the
monsoon, which sets in by May and continues till
August. Children and elders are among the most
vulnerable group.
The emergency ward of the Rangoon general
hospital has been filled by children suffering
from dengue. However, the hospital officials
declined to say the number of patients that are
there. Burma's Ministry of Health in an effort to
combat the outbreak has reportedly conducted a
clean drive in Rangoon and surrounding townships
and begun a dengue fever awareness campaign.
Statistics reported by a local newspaper suggest
an average of over 10 000 children suffer from
dengue every year with 300 to 400 deaths.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported
this summer's first indigenous case of Dengue
fever yesterday [25 Jun 2007]. The patient is a
21-year-old male resident of the Annan district
of Tainan County. According to a CDC press
release, the patient fell sick on 9 June [2007]
after exhibiting symptoms including fever and
joint soreness.
"The patient did not have the hemorrhagic type of
dengue," said CDC deputy chief Lin Ting. "As of
the 21st [Jun 2007], he had left the hospital."
"The Breteau index is at level 4, meaning that
the outbreak was a matter of time," Lin said. The
Breteau index is a larval index that estimates
the number of [_Aedes aegypti_ larvae- and
pupae-. Mod.TY] infested containers per number of
inspected houses.
Although 16 other indigenous dengue fever cases
have been confirmed by the CDC this year [2007],
they occurred before March [2007], making them
the last cases of the previous year's [2006]
dengue fever season. Historical trends indicate
that the 1st cases of indigenous dengue fever of
the year usually occur in September in Taiwan.
However, the 1st cases last year and this year
have occurred in June.
"The earlier the first indigenous case occurs,
the worst the season is likely to be," Lin said.
The CDC believes that the latest indigenous case
was the result of a virus reintroduced by
travelers from abroad rather than an overwintered
virus from last season.
"The gap of 3 months between the last case of
last season and this case means that the virus
did not overwinter," Lin said, adding that an
overwintering virus, either due to a mild winter
or inadequate mosquito control, usually means a
dengue season of epidemic proportions.
The CDC has documented 40 cases of dengue fever
patients who entered Taiwan so far this year.
"But there could be more that we have not identified," Lin said.

[It is possible that dengue virus carried over
from 2006 to 2007, producing so few cases that it
was essentially undetected. Genetic analysis for
comparison of dengue viruses isolated in 2006 and
2007 might provide evidence of endemic
persistence, reintroduction, or both.

The CHO here was able to monitor 35 cases from
the period January to June this year [2007] with
5 recorded deaths.
Of the deaths, 2 were recorded in January and one
each in February, April and June [2007]. A
6-month old baby girl from Arevalo is the
youngest casualty while a 10-year old boy from
Zone 2-San Juan is the eldest.
Other casualties are 2-year old boy from Molo
Boulevard, 9-year old girl from Bakhaw,
Mandurriao, and another 4-year old boy from
Veterans Village, City Proper.
Health officer Dr. Urminico Baronda declared the
situation alarming, adding that the cases are
higher this year when compared with the same
period last year [2006]. From January to June
2006, the CHO has recorded 26 cases with 3

Fears of dengue epidemic in American Samoa
----------------------
A 20-year-old who died after being admitted to
the LBJ Hospital in American Samoa in the
advanced stages of dengue fever has raised alarm
bells at the territory's Health Department.
The death, according to a Department of Health
report, is believed to be the first from dengue
in several years.
The Department has stepped up it's awareness
efforts, with communicable disease surveillance
nurse Charmaine Edwards saying the situation will
get worse before it gets better.
"I've seen a lot of cases come through the ER as
suspected dengues, and I'm actually now up to 29
confirmed cases with more cases pending with
results coming in, so that's another reason we're
stepping up our campaign to really make the
public aware that dengue is here and it's
prevalent on the island."
Charmaine Edwards says there could be an epidemic
if the situation is not nipped in the bud.
