[The description of the 4 new cases in Jiangsu is consistent with the general pattern: sporadic occurrence, confirmation of H7N9 diagnosis by molecular methods, variable association with poultry trade, severity of illness, and lack of evidence of human to human transmission of infection. - Mod.CP]

[Also regional proximity. Jiangsu province borders both Shanghai municipality & Anhui province on the north -- not to be confused with Jiangxi province on the southern border of Anhui.

Cases have now been reported from Zhejiang province (southeast of Anhui & south of Shanghai)-- check ProMED later today.
