On [13 Oct 2022] there were 4 new #Ebola cases reported, all from Mubende, the most affected district. 3 of the 4 cases were known contacts of a case who were being monitored. That means 1of the 4 is someone who the contact tracers didn't know about. That is dangerous.

The #Ebola response reports that some communities are still not cooperating & that response staff are facing hostility in some places. And apparently, some of the village health teams do not believe in Ebola. (This information comes from a government situation report.)

Uganda reports more Ebola cases, steps up control measures
----------------------------------------------------------
Over the weekend [15-16 Oct 2022], Uganda's health ministry reported 2 more confirmed Ebola cases, as officials announced a 3-week lockdown for 2 of the affected outbreak districts.

The new cases lift the number of lab-confirmed cases to 60. So far, 24 deaths have been reported among the patients with confirmed infections. Uganda also has 20 suspected cases from earlier in the outbreak, all of them fatal.

On 15 Oct 2022, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni announced a 3-week lockdown for Mubende district, as well as neighboring Kassanda district, according to the BBC. The measure includes a curfew and the shuttering of bars, nightclubs, churches, and entertainment venues. Movement in and out of the districts has also been restricted, except for cargo trucks.

In a televised address, Museveni -- who had earlier ruled out a lockdown -- said temporary measures were needed to control the spread of Ebola. The president has also forbidden traditional healers from managing Ebola cases, and the government is urging people with Ebola symptoms not to use taxis to seek medical care.

Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero, MBChB, MPH, has also warned the public not to hide someone who has been in contact with an Ebola-infected person, given the risk of further spread.

New isolation unit, vaccine news
--------------------------------
In other developments, Ocero today [17 Oct 022] announced that a new isolation facility in Madudu, built by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) with support from its partners, has been commissioned and is now admitting suspected Ebola cases.

Also, the Serum Institute of India is planning to make 20 000-30 000 doses of a candidate vaccine to protect against the outbreak Sudan Ebola strain to allow trials to begin in Uganda, according to Reuters, which cited the vaccine's developers and company sources.

Developed by researchers at Oxford University, the vaccine prompted an immune response against both the Sudan and Zaire Ebola strains in phase 1 trials. Vaccine makers are waiting on approval from Ugandan regulators for trials of the vaccine to begin in the outbreak area.

Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments approved to battle Sudan Ebola. There is one other Sudan Ebola vaccine in clinical trials, developed by the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Last week [week of 10 Oct 2022], Uganda's health ministry said that they will try the 2 vaccines. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said a clinical trial could start within weeks.

["Oxford University, which developed a COVID-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca, has an Ebola vaccine that has been shown to induce an immune response to both the Sudan and Zaire strains in Phase 1 trials.

"Its developers said they were working with the Serum Institute to manufacture doses that could be deployed in Uganda as part of a clinical trial once the authorities there gave regulatory approval.

"...the Ebola vaccine doses would be supplied free of cost.

"There are at least 6 vaccines in development for the Sudan strain, including 3 with Phase 1 data, according to WHO.

"One of those was developed by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C. A Sabin spokesperson said the institute believed its vaccine was "farthest along in the pipeline" and that it was working with WHO and other organisations about how it can help respond to the outbreak.

"The Oxford researchers voiced frustration that their vaccine was not ready to be rolled out when the outbreak hit, saying governments around the world had not made investing in vaccines enough of a priority in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The vaccine has been in development for several years but its progress through clinical trials has been slowed by funding shortfalls, they said.

"With better investment, the world could easily have ready-made vaccines sitting in vials for this and a number of other diseases," said Sandy Douglas, an associate professor at Oxford.

"We're spending a couple of months now playing catch up on work that could have been done ahead of time."
