[Now that the incidence, in the UK, of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or, at least of having reached a plateau, the Department of
Health's full table of definite, and probable, CJD deaths and referrals
will no longer be reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of
variant CJD statistics will be posted, unless there is a substantial change
in the situation. The full table, updated monthly, can be accessed at the
Department of Health web-site:
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definition of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases and the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of
Health web-site, or, by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) -

Monthly Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics as of Mon 1 Nov 2004
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 1 Nov 2004] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - Deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 105
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 39
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 2
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 146
Summary of vCJD cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
------
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 151
(The next update will be published on Mon 6 Dec 2004)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 4 Oct 2004, the
number of deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation
pending) has increased by 2, raising the total number of deaths from
definite or probable vCJD to 146. The number of probable vCJD cases still
alive remains at 5. Therefore the overall total number of definite or
probable vCJD cases now becomes 151. - Mod.CP]

Second Suspected Blood Donation Related Death in UK Causes Alarm at US FDA
--------------------------------------------------
A 2nd U.K. resident most likely acquired the human variant of mad cow
disease through a tainted blood transfusion, federal health advisers were
told Thursday. A Food and Drug Administration official called the
development troubling. Dr. David M. Asher, head of an FDA laboratory that
studies contaminants in blood and tissues, said the new information
suggests that the risk of transmission through blood should be
re-evaluated. An FDA advisory committee was considering whether safety
measures are still warranted -- or whether additional measures are needed
-- to prevent the transmission of the human variant of mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, through blood. The agency already bars
blood donations from people who lived more than 3 months in the U.K. or who
received transfusions there after 1979.
In both confirmed U.K. infections, recipients got blood from donors who
were young and apparently healthy when they gave blood. The chances that 2
confirmed infections among people who received blood was caused instead by
eating mad-cow tainted beef were remote -- 1 in 80 000 to 1 in 1 billion,
the panel was told. Getting the human form of mad cow disease through
tainted blood "is a reality. And we've got to treat it like that," said
Steven Anderson, an FDA risk assessment expert.
The new case involves an elderly woman who died from an unrelated medical
condition, according to Dr. Robert Will, a member of the U.K. BSE
surveillance team. Because she had received a blood transfusion in 1999
from a donor who later died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the
human equivalent of BSE, the woman's doctor did a more thorough analysis
after her death. The woman had no outward signs of neurological disease and
her brain, spinal cord, tonsils and appendix were normal, Will told the
panel. In her spleen and cervical lymph nodes, however, the woman harbored
malformed, infective prion proteins.
The illness occurs when normal proteins found in the brain, known as
prions, change shape and prompt adjacent healthy prions to do the same.
When enough prions are altered, they deposit a plaque on the brain and
surround the mark with spongy holes, killing the victim. By testing 14 964
appendices of normal surgical patients in the U.K., researchers learned
that 3 were tainted with the infective proteins. That implies 237 people
per million U.K. residents -- or 3808 people age 10 to 30 -- could silently
incubate mad cow, Will said.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance in the UK - 12th Annual Report 2003
--------------------------------------------------
[The 12th Annual Report (2003) of the UK CJD surveillance Group has been
compiled by The National CJD Surveillance Unit, Western General Hospital,
Edinburgh, EH4 2XU and the Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases,
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E
7HT. The following is the summary of the Report, the remainder can be read at
<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/twelfth/rep2003.htm>. - Mod.CP]
The national surveillance programme for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in
the UK was initiated in May 1990. In 1999, the National CJD Surveillance
Unit (NCJDSU) became a WHO Collaborative Centre for Reference and Research
on the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Human Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies (TSEs). In September 2001 the National Care Team was
formed, comprising 2 care co-ordinators, a neurologist (part-time) and a
secretary. The National Care Team is based within the NCJDSU and was formed
in response to concerns regarding the care of CJD patients.
The information provided in this twelfth report continues to provide
evidence of a high level of case ascertainment. Detailed clinical and
epidemiological information has been obtained for the great majority of
patients. The methodology of the case-control study for risk factors of CJD
has been altered in an attempt to overcome some logistic problems in its
conduct. The post mortem rate for patients with suspected CJD is high,
although there is ongoing evidence that this rate continues to decline, in
line with autopsy rates in the UK. This is reflected in the reduced number
of brain specimens examined in the neuropathology laboratory this year,
particularly for variant CJD.
In 1990-2003 mortality rates from sporadic CJD in England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland were, respectively, 0.86, 0.84, 1.08 and
0.57/million/year. The difference between the rates in each country is not
statistically significant (p>0.2). These rates are comparable to those
observed in other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world, including
countries which are free of BSE. There was some variation in the observed
mortality rates between the different regions within the UK but this
variation is not statistically significant (p>0.2). The highest and lowest
mortality rates from sporadic CJD were observed in the South West (SMR=129)
and Northern Ireland (SMR=79).
Up to 31 Dec 2003, there have been 139 deaths from definite or probable
variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK. Of these, 104 were confirmed by
neuropathology. The clinical, neuropathological and epidemiological
features of all these cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent
with our previous descriptions. Analysis of the incidence of vCJD onsets
and deaths from January 1994 to December 2003 shows evidence that the
epidemic may have reached a peak or a plateau. While this is an
encouraging finding, incidence of vCJD may increase again, particularly if
different genetic subgroups are found to be affected.
Risk factors for the development of vCJD include age, residence in the UK
and methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein gene -- 123
cases of vCJD with available genetic analysis have been methionine
homozygotes. The incidence of vCJD across the UK continues to show a
"North-South" difference (though slightly less than previously reported),
with a higher incidence being maintained in the North of the UK. The
underlying reason for this finding is not clear. The only statistically
significant geographic cluster of vCJD cases in the UK was in
Leicestershire. All geographically associated cases of vCJD are considered
for investigation according to a protocol which involves the NCJDSU,
colleagues at the HPA, SCIEH and local public health physicians.
The activities of the NCJDSU are strengthened by collaboration in other
surveillance projects, including the Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology
Review and the study of Progressive Intellectual and Neurological
Deterioration in Children. The collaboration of our colleagues in these
projects is greatly appreciated; the effectiveness of this collaboration
allowed the identification in 2003 of a case of variant CJD associated with
blood transfusion. The success of the National CJD Surveillance Project
continues to depend on the extraordinary level of co-operation from the
neuroscience community and other medical and paramedical staff throughout
the UK. We are particularly grateful to the relatives of patients for their
help with this study.
