Epidemiological comments: an active surveillance for avian influenza in 5 targeted provinces of Northern Laos started in [July 2014] with financial support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As of 15 Sep 2014, the laboratory diagnostic results from the National Animal Health Laboratory (NAHL) have revealed that a poultry farm where were introduced one-day-old chicken and ducks was positive for H5N6 as confirmed by real-time PCR. It is now planned to send the positive samples to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory for sequencing.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, zoning, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[In March of 2014, Laos reported to the OIE an occurrence of HPAI H5N6. The source of infection for that event was also indicated in that report as "introduction of new live animals" and "legal movement of animals." It would again be appropriate to ask what moderator AS asked in his comments in ProMED-mail post 20140509.2461275: "What was the origin of the introduced affected birds reportedly causing the outbreak? Were they introduced from another location within Laos or was their introduction inter-boundary? In case the latter is the case, where from? Authorised or otherwise?"
