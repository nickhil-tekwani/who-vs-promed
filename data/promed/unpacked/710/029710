Some 134 cases of suspected acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) have been reported since May 2016 in Sortony, North Darfur, according to the state Ministry of Health, Médecins Sans Frontières-Spain (MSF-E), WHO, and the Sudanese organization Anhar for Peace Development Organization. The overcrowded site near the Unamid [United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur] base in Sortony hosts more than 21 000 people who were displaced from Jebel Marra following hostilities earlier in 2016. 7 samples sent for analysis tested positive for hepatitis E virus. The North Darfur Health Ministry has declared an outbreak of hepatitis E in Sortony, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest weekly bulletin [https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Sudan/Reports/OCHA_Sudan_Weekly_Humanitarian_Bulletin_Issue_31_(25_-_31_July_2016).pdf].

Hepatitis E is an epidemic-prone, waterborne disease transmitted by the fecal-oral route through contaminated water. Jaundice outbreaks mostly occur in areas where people live in cramped conditions, with poor water supply and insufficient sanitation and hygiene facilities, such as Sortony. The current rainy season is likely to contribute to the unsanitary conditions.

Efforts by the state Health Ministry and humanitarian health, water, and sanitation partners aim at containing the outbreak. They include health promotion-related activities and improving the water quality through chlorination. In addition, water quality surveillance and vector control activities have been strengthened, and active case finding is ongoing.

Drugs and medical supplies to cover 2 months were provided to health clinics run by MSF-E and Anhar organization, with support from WHO, the UN Children's Fund (Unicef), and the ministry.

During the 1st 7 months of 2016, close to 81 000 people were newly displaced across Darfur, according to the UN and partners. Up to an additional 170 000 people were also reportedly displaced, of whom 50 000 have reportedly returned, but the UN and partners are unable to verify these figures due to a lack of access to the relevant locations.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). - Mod.LL
