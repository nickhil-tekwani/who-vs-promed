In the week that Viet Nam reported its 1st outbreaks of African swine fever [ASF], the news broke as well that the virus had reached 2 of the last non-infected provinces on the Chinese east coast: Shandong province and Guangxi autonomous region.

[This] means that all coastal provinces from north to south now at least reported one outbreak of the virus ever since ASF was first detected in China in August 2018.

In total, on the basis of figures shared by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the total amount of pigs that was on farms found with ASF is 460 000. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) already 950 000 pigs had to be culled in an attempt to hold the spread. According to recent official figures, China is home to 461 million pigs.

The outbreak in Shandong province does not come unexpected, as there had been rumours for some while about allegedly infected meat packages coming from this province. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) reported on 20 Feb 2019 that the virus had been found on a farm in Laiwu district of Jinan city. The facility had 4504 pigs, of which 17 had contracted the virus and 3 had died.

With regard to the outbreak in Guangxi autonomous region, reported on 19 Feb 2019, MARA shared that it had found the virus on 2 farming communities with in total 23 555 pigs. In total 924 animals had been killed by the virus.

The distance between the Guangxi outbreak and the affected Vietnamese provinces near Hanoi is between 300 and 350 km [about 186-218 mi], measured in a straight line.

News agency Reuters also reported that major Chinese frozen food producer Sanquan Food recently informed that it had recalled products that might have been contaminated with ASF. This happened after media reports about some of its dumplings testing positive for the virus.

Sanquan said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange that it has recalled all products suspected of contamination, citing reports of contamination in 3 batches of pork dumplings. The company said it is cooperating with local authorities on an investigation into the reports.

Reuters mentioned that Sanquan had not confirmed or denied the reports in the statement.

China's agriculture ministry said on [Wed 20 Feb 2019] it has confirmed the 1st African swine fever [ASF] outbreak in Shandong province, a major region for livestock production in the country's east.

The highly contagious disease was found on a farm with 4504 pigs in the provincial capital Jinan, infecting 17 of the animals and killing 3 hogs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement.

China, home to the world's largest hog herd, has reported more than 100 [outbreaks] of African swine fever since August 2018.

The Shandong case came after Guangxi region in China's south reported its 1st African swine fever outbreak on [Tue 19 Feb 2019].

Further to the south, neighboring Viet Nam also confirmed it had detected its 1st cases of the virus.

Shandong produced 47 million pigs in 2017, about 7 percent of the total hogs sent to slaughterhouses in the same year in China, official data showed.

Jiangsu and Henan provinces, both neighboring Shandong, reported cases of the disease as early as last August [2018].

China has restricted transport of live pigs and banned kitchen waste in feed, in an effort to control the spread of African swine fever.

A major Chinese frozen food producer said on [Mon 18 Feb 2019] that it recalled products that may be contaminated with African swine fever, following media reports that some of its dumplings tested positive for the virus.

[Shandong, in eastern China (map at https://tinyurl.com/y3efcx6f) and Guangxi in south-east China, bordering north Viet Nam (map at https://tinyurl.com/yxez65k2) have become China's 26th and 27th primary administrative divisions officially reported as ASF-infected, since the start of the event, reportedly, 1 Aug 2018. The current list includes the 20 provinces Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Yunnan, Hunan, Guizhou, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Guangdong, Gansu and Shandong, the 4 municipalities Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing as well as 3 Autonomous Regions: Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, and Guangxi.

As indicated in item 1 above, the report on ASF in Shandong is not surprising. On 24 Jan 2019, Taiwan's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ), reported that ASF virus was detected in a postal courier package, received on 14 Jan 2019, which contained ham sausages produced in China's Shandong province. It was the 1st time pork products in a courier package tested positive for ASF, the BAPHIQ said, adding that this shows the virus could enter Taiwan through multiple channels, including the postal system (20190126.6279425).

On 23 Aug 2018, when ASF was reported from China's 4th province (Zhejiang), it was stated that the infected animals made their way from the north-eastern Liaoning province to the southern province Zhejiang, a distance of more than 2000 km (about 1243 mi), "through the pig-producing provinces of Hebei and Shandong."

On 9 Apr 2019, an International Symposium on ASF will be held in Beijing, China. - Mod.AS
