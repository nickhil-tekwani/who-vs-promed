Deer plague?
------------
Experts still can not explain the cause of mortality of red deer on the grounds of the Dokshitsky Belarusian hunting Society near the village Komaysk [Vitebsk province]. During the recent months, more than 70 red deer have reportedly died. What is the reason of such a mass death of the deer? Several possible causes have been raised:
1. An oversight of local rangers who did not care about proper diet and animals starved. This seems unlikely.
2. Poisoning. Suspected materials have been detected and are under police investigation, in addition to samples of stomach contents and other samples from the dead animals.
3. Infectious diseases. According to information from the Department of agriculture, anthrax and other infectious agents have been ruled out, but the investigation continues.

At present, the most likely cause seems to be a poisoning; but final results are not yet available. Efforts to move the remaining animals to a safer plot seem to be promising.
