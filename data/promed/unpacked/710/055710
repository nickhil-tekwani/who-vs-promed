The number of suspected cases of botulism tied to a church potluck has increased slightly as Ohio health officials work to test more than 20 samples of food to pinpoint the outbreak's source. The Ohio Department of Health said Fri 24 Apr 2015, that 26 people are suspected of having botulism after a potluck dinner Sun 19 Apr 2015, at Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church in Lancaster [Fairfield County]. Tests have confirmed botulism in an additional case. A 55 year old from Rushville [Fairfield County] died from a suspected case of the illness Tue, 21 Apr 2015.

Health officials are testing 21 homemade and store-bought food samples including canned pickles, potato salad, coleslaw, and other items to determine the source. A botulism antitoxin arrived in Ohio earlier this week [week of 20 Apr 2015] from the CDC to treat those who are ill.

Although botulism can be confused with a variety of neurological illnesses, when a cluster of similar illnesses occur, there are few other entities other botulism that would cause them. Although usually connected with tainted food, often due to inadequately prepared home canned foods, wound botulism clusters may occur from contaminated black tar heroin or from uncontrolled "Botox" use.

Most USA ProMED botulism postings relate to an alert that a particular commercially prepared food was not adequately made, which would increase a risk of intoxication with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin, and in most of these instances, no clear evidence of botulism is found in the food product. When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared. It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested rather than disease being produced with ingestion of spores. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) are caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_.

Botulinum, the most toxic of known toxins, is produced by the Gram positive spore forming anaerobic bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, found in soil worldwide. Botulism is caused by the consumption of contaminated products containing spores. Spores produce toxin when they germinate in the product or in the digestive tract. Humans are most often intoxicated by consumption of the preformed toxin in such things as home-canned vegetables or even baked potatoes left un-refrigerated. As little as 0.001 microgram per kilogram of body weight may be lethal. The time from ingestion of the toxin until clinical signs are observed will vary with the amount of toxin ingested. The onset of clinical signs may be as short as a few hours but is seldom more than 24 hours. A very small amount of material containing the toxin can cause symptoms. Signs can develop rapidly, and death can occur in as little as 6 hours after initial onset. Clinical signs may begin in human beings between 12-36 hours after ingestion of the toxin. The clinical signs and symptoms in human beings include ptosis [drooping eyelid], blurred vision, diplopia [double vision], dry mouth and throat, dysphagia [difficulty swallowing], and dysphoria [feeling unwell or unhappy]. These are a result of cranial nerve palsies. These early signs are followed by symmetrical flaccid paralysis, with generalized weakness and progression to respiratory failure. - Mod.LL]
