A musk oxen die-off at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Large
Animal Research Station (LARS) has researchers scratching their heads
for answers.

During a one-month period between September and October [2010], 7
musk oxen died and the remaining 29 animals in the herd are being
closely monitored. At least 8 other musk oxen have exhibited signs
similar to the animals that died.

"We've designated the entire herd under concern," said wildlife
biology professor and nutritionist Perry Barboza, who works at the
LARS.

Researchers and veterinarians are still searching for clues as to why
the animals are getting sick at a time -- heading into winter -- when
they should be their most robust. Their diets have not changed and no
signs of disease have been found.

"We've been monitoring diet and diet quality," Barboza said. "The
mystery is the diets are coming in at the specifications we set.
We're kind of stumped."

UAF veterinarian John Blake performed necropsies on the animals that
died and sent tissue samples to the Washington Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory at Washington State University to be analyzed.

All the dead animals, as well as several others in the herd, were
underweight and lacking important trace minerals such as copper,
selenium, and cobalt, which are needed to help musk oxen metabolize
the food they eat, Blake said.

"We knew pretty quickly we had a trace element problem," he said.
"With mineral deficiency, as the metabolic processes get disrupted
they start to go into liver failure."

Several of the animals that died had liver failure, and others were
in such poor shape they had to be euthanized, Blake said.

"Most of these elements we're talking about, they require very small
amounts, but if you don't have them it causes problems," he said. "It
affects everything from the nervous system to the gastrointestinal
system to the immune system to reproduction. Once you get down to a
certain point it puts them off their food and they'll stop eating.
Once that happens it's very difficult to pull them back."

Diet supplements
----------------
All of the musk oxen that died were 1 or 2 years old, an age when the
animals are usually "bulletproof," Barboza said. 5 were males and 2
were females. The deaths occurred between 20 Sep 2010 and 16 Oct 2010.

The musk oxen at UAF are fed locally grown hay, and their diet is
supplemented with grain pellets that are supposed to provide the
trace minerals they need because hay grown in the Interior tends to
be low in those minerals, Blake said.

"The hay we're feeding this year [2010] is good hay, but it isn't as
high quality as we've had in the past," he said. "We're wondering if
the trace elements in the hay dropped to the level where it wasn't
being compensated by the pellets."

As soon as the deficiency in trace minerals was detected, researchers
began injecting the animals with copper, selenium, vitamin B12
(cobalt), and vitamin E. They also increased the ration of grain
pellets and began giving them a goat mineral supplement.

"Most of them have started to turn around and put some weight on
again," Blake said, adding that that as of Wednesday [17 Nov 2010] 4
musk oxen remain of particular concern.

Though the weights of cows at LARS are recorded weekly, staff didn't
detect a significant weight loss in the animals until it was too
late, a situation Blake blamed on understaffing at the research
facility during the summer.

"Nobody was looking at the longer weight trends over several months,"
he said. "That's partly why some of this wasn't recognized until some
animals were down low."

In the wild, musk oxen store critical trace elements while feeding in
the summer and use that reservoir in the winter, when fewer minerals
are available. The musk oxen at UAF, however, are fed trace minerals
year-round to avoid those fluctuations, Blake said.

Researchers are trying to figure out if the minerals are simply
lacking in the animals' diets or if something else in their diet is
interfering with the absorption process so they are not making use of
them. "With trace element issues it tends to be complicated," Blake
said.

Research animals
----------------
The UAF musk ox herd was established at the LARS in 1979 with animals
captured from Nunivak Island. The animals are used for research and
production of qiviut, expensive musk oxen wool used to make scarves,
hats, and mittens.

A similar die-off occurred at UAF in 1991 when 5 bull musk oxen died
in a short period of time, Blake said. The animals' diets weren't
being supplemented with trace minerals back then, he said. "That's
when we recognized the low levels of copper and cobalt in these
animals," he said.

The mystery illness may not be contained to UAF musk ox, either.
Barboza said he recently visited facilities in Anchorage and Palmer
that have captive musk ox and found out they have had similar
problems. 2 musk oxen recently died at the Anchorage Zoo under
similar circumstances as those at UAF, he said.

Musk oxen in the wild also struggle with mineral deficiencies, said
veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen with the Alaska Department of Fish and
Game in Fairbanks. She pointed to a decline in the population of musk
oxen on the eastern North Slope as an example.

"We feel there is a trace mineral imbalance that's affecting the
health of that population and contributing to the decline," she said.
"They're copper deficient but they have too high of zinc and iron
levels that can affect the absorption process."

Musk oxen, she said, "seem to be very sensitive to trace mineral
deficiencies, especially copper."

UAF researchers, meanwhile, are poring over weight and reproductive
records from past years "to see if the herd has been slipping into
marginal status and something happened to tip them over this year
[2010]," Blake said.

Researchers weren't conducting any active research on the UAF herd at
the time of the deaths, Barboza said.

No problems have been detected with caribou or reindeer being held at
the facility, either.

"The bad news is this puts us on hold doing research on musk oxen
until we figure out the problem," he said. "The goal is to try and
figure out what they've got or how we can manage it so we can move
on."

[The musk ox or muskox (_Ovibos moschatus_), a member of the Bovidae
family, is a mammal of the Arctic region noted for its strong odor
and thick coat. The strong odor is given off by the males primarily
and is used for attracting females during mating season. Generally
this animal lives in the Arctic regions of North America but there
are populations of the animal in Norway, Sweden, and areas of Siberia.

The musk ox has developed several adaptations to such an extremely
cold climate. The most useful adaptation has been its coat (Gray
1990). The coat is made of 2 layers. The outermost is a thick shaggy
coat, possibly the longest of all the animals (Scholastic 2008). They
also have a hairy under layer called the qiviut. The qiviut has
financial value due to its cashmere texture and ability to trap in
heat (Lent 1988). Musk oxen shed their under wool in spring and by
the end of summer have a new qiviut layer (Lent 1988). As well as
practical winter wear, the thick fur of musk oxen is useful in the
summer. The long hair provides defense against the mosquitoes, making
it so the only flesh vulnerable is on the nose (Scholastic 2008). The
hooves are also well suited for the climate that the musk ox
inhabits, the sharp rims are ideal for cutting into snow and the
broadness of the heels serves as sufficient traction when climbing
snowy ridges (Tener 1965). Musk oxen are adapted to the weather down
to their tail. The tail is thought to be short to help maintain
warmth in the winter because shorter appendages take fewer calories
to keep warm (Tener 1965). The tail is short also because it is not
needed to swat away mosquitoes (Tener 1965). Musk oxen also have
sharp chins that they can use to break through ice and snow in the
winter to find suitable vegetation (Gray 1986).

Musk oxen are generally large and relatively fearsome animals,
weighing between 400 and 800 pounds [180-360 kg] and standing about 5
feet [1.5 m] at the shoulder. While that is smaller than many beef
breeds of cattle, the hair makes them seem much larger. During
breeding season the bulls are quite aggressive, even charging birds
that may be too close to their personal space.

They are a social creature, often found in herds of 10-20 of both
males and females, except during breeding season when there may be
small groups of bachelor or unsuccessful bulls as the stronger bull
will run all others from the herd.

Mineral deficiencies are well documented in other bovidae animals, so
it seems quite reasonable that these creatures may be similar. The
specialized hair is likely going to require a different balance than
other bovidae.

Hopefully a good nutrition lab can analyze the forage and feed and
supplements and start getting them on the right track. Likewise, with
a research herd in captivity for this many years, hopefully they have
established 'normals' of the biological parameters to help determine
how these animals are recovering.
