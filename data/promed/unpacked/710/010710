Congo virus hits western Pakistan (Baluchistan Province)
--------------------------------------------------------
QUETTA, Pakistan: Viral haemorrhagic disease in Pakistan's western
Baluchistan province has claimed at least 6 lives in the past week, a
newspaper report said on Thu 21 Sep 2000. Victims of the disease, commonly
known as Congo Virus [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, included women and
children, health officials said. "After receiving the report of one death
caused by viral haemorrhagic disease, we immediately dispatched medical
teams to the affected Loralai district to ascertain the facts," stated the
director general of the health department Dr. Niamtullah Gichki. Loralai
district is about 200 km north of the provincial capital Quetta [My atlas
shows it as east of Quetta. - Mod.ES.
Symptoms of the disease are high temperatures, bleeding from the mouth, ears
and nose and from urinal track, and ultimately the patient dies. "As many as
20 cases of haemorrhagic fever have been reported during the last week, and
6 have died", a doctor said.
