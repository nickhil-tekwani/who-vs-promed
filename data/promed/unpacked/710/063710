Press Release
---------------
Statement by John Clifford, Deputy Administrator Animal & Plant
Health Inspection Service:
3 Aug 2005
"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa has determined that the
non-definitive test result reported on 27 Jul 2005 is negative for
BSE. Tests conducted by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in
Weybridge, England, are also negative for BSE.
NVSL and Weybridge conducted the additional testing after a
non-definitive IHC test result was received last week. The initial
non-definitive result was caused by artifactual (artificial or
untrue) staining and, while this staining did not resemble BSE, we
felt the prudent course was to conduct the additional tests.
Needless to say, we are very pleased with these results. I do want to
emphasize that the most important protections for human and animal
health are our interlocking food-safety protocols. Our enhanced
surveillance program is designed to provide information about the
level of prevalence of BSE in the United States, which, by any
measure, is extremely low."
