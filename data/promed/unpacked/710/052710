Manaus [Amazonas, Brazil] is suffering a virus outbreak [clinically]
similar to dengue and there is a real risk that it will spread in the
country, managing to become adapted to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito,
the vector of dengue [virus], which is present in high densities in
many of the urban environments. These are the principal conclusions
of a study by the infectious disease physician Luiz Tadeu Moraes
Figueiredo, coordinator del Center for Virology Research of the
University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, in collaboration with the
Institute of Tropical Medicine of Amazonas. The study will be
published at the end of this year [2011] in the journal Vector Borne
and Zoonotic Diseases.

The study tested 600 blood samples from Manaus residents with high
fevers. In 33 cases, the presence of Mayaro virus was confirmed
[serologically? by virus isolation or by PCR?], according to
Figueroa. 4 patients presented with mild bleeding. "This has never
been described until now for Mayaro fever," he said.

In Brazil, 210 different types of arboviruses [arthropod-borne
viruses] circulate that are transmitted by mosquitoes and other
arthropods. Mayaro virus is the 4th in the number of people infected,
after dengue, yellow fever and Oropuche (also in the Amazon region),
according to the Instituto Evandro Chagas, in Para [state].

The 1st report [of Mayaro virus cases] was in 1955, in an epidemic in
Para state. To date, thousands of cases of Mayaro fever are reported,
[but] never before in metropolitan areas. This year [2011], Mayaro
fever is included in the list of the Ministry of Health of diseases
for obligatory reporting that must be reported before being
[officially] suspected.

Although there are no reports of deaths from Mayaro virus
[infection], the symptoms in some cases cause more suffering for the
patient than [does] dengue fever.

The Ministry of Health indicated, up to now, that the cases of Mayaro
[virus infection] are still restricted to the Amazon region and that
for now, they do not see a risk that [this virus] will spread
throughout the entire country. In Sao Paulo, the Instituto Adolfo
Lutz has no evidence of the presence of Mayaro virus [in the state?]
according to the Ministry of Health.

[Mayaro fever is a zoonosis produced by an arbovirus. Mayaro virus
(MAYV), of the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family, [is] endemic in
tropical areas of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guayana,
Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela). The transmission cycle is very
similar to yellow fever virus, utilizing primates as reservoirs and
_Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors. Human cases are associated with
recent exposures to humid forest environments that the vectors
inhabit. Unfortunately, in the periodical article cited in the
report, no information is provided about previous exposure of the
confirmed cases to non-urban forest environments.

Although to date no urban outbreaks of Mayaro fever have not been
described, MAYV is capable of replicating in _Aedes albopictus_ cells
[C6-36 cells] in culture. Also, it is possible to infect _Ae.
aegypti_ under laboratory conditions after ingestion of a moderate
[virus] dose orally and later transmit the infection [virus] to
hamsters. It is estimated the the capacity for MAYV urban
transmission depends in large measure on the magnitude and duration
of viremia in humans in relation to the susceptibility of _Ae.
aegypti_ to the virus. However, no data are available for these
critical aspects. - Mod.JT]

[Because of the clinical similarities of MAYV and dengue virus
infections, one cannot help but wonder how many MAYV infections in
the South American tropics are incorrectly attributed to dengue virus
in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Are we seeing the tip of a
large iceberg?
