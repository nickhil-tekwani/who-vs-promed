An outbreak of foot and mouth disease recorded in East Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In the East Kazakhstan village Karashilik, an outbreak of foot and
mouth disease [FMD] has been recorded, reports Kazakhstan Today.

"The entire affected village in East Kazakhstan has been quarantined.
The number of destroyed animals is counted in hundreds," said the
channel "CTC."

According to local residents, the village has burned 600 heads of
cattle and small ruminants. Allegedly, no one had paid attention to
FMD cases in a farm near the village, leading to a situation which is
deteriorating day by day.

Meanwhile, employees of a local akimat (a municipal district) argue
that the loss of cattle in the village stopped since several days.

On top of animal movement restrictions and other quarantine measures,
emergency vaccination, to protect the remaining healthy animals, has
been undertaken.

"Until now, infection is affecting cattle in spite of the steps. There
are farms in which all cattle are infected," said Asset Nurdybaev, a
villager from Karashilik.

[An initial report on the FMD outbreak in Karashilik (was included in
Kazakhstan's immediate notification to the OIE of 22 Aug 2011 (see 20110823.2560). It stated, that the outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype
O, had started on 11 Aug 2011 and was confirmed 12 Aug 2011.
Reportedly, the susceptible animal population included 770 cattle and
2337 sheep. Clinical cases were seen only in cattle (33 cases),
without mortality. The number of destroyed cattle was said to be 69.
No explanation for this number was given. The notification further
said that vaccination, in response to the outbreak, was applied,
involving 735 cattle and 2337 sheep. The vaccine applied was,
reportedly, "polyvalent vaccine (A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3)."
This unusual composition deserves to be explained.

Kazakhstan stopped vaccination against FMD in several of its provinces
in order to obtain the status of "free from FMD without vaccination",
enabling exports of live cattle and/or beef. During 2010, large areas
such as Akmolah, Pavlodar and Northern Kazakhstan remained
unvaccinated.
