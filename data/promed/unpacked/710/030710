The State Department of Health (Sesau) issued, on Monday [2 May 2022], a statement of risk for meningitis. The alert comes after the discovery of a case in a Venezuelan baby. According to the document, the discovery of the disease took place on [29 Apr 2022]. Born on [11 Nov 2021], the child is only 5 months old and lives in a shelter in Boa Vista.

The note also mentions that the child's family (father, mother, and siblings) are from the mining region of El Dorado, a small town in eastern Venezuela. They entered Brazil on [5 Apr 2022], staying for a period of 15 days in the shelter in Pacaraima. Their coming to the capital of Roraima was on [18 Apr 2022].

The document also points out that the child's 1st symptoms (fever, stiffness in the back of the neck, difficulty in flexing the knees, and abdominal pain) manifested themselves on [21 Apr 2022], but her hospitalization at the Santo Antônio Children's Hospital was only made on [25 Apr 2022]. The patient continues to be monitored in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

Risk of contagion and the importance of immunization
----------------------------------------------------
Meningitis has as its main characteristic the inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain, and can affect both children and adults. If not immunized, the person can have serious sequelae and even progress to death.

According to the General Coordination of Health Surveillance (CGVS), the child had only the 1st dose of vaccines against hepatitis B. The same applies to pneumococcal 10V, VIP, and COVID-19 [?]. However, the child had not received the Meningo C [meningococcal group C] vaccine in the right period (3rd and 5th months of age).

"[The child] is hospitalized, undergoing treatment, being monitored, and observed and the entire epidemiological part, which in this case is the active search; medication is also used for people who have had contact with this patient and all actions have already been carried out through the Municipal Surveillance team", highlighted Valdirene Oliveira, coordinator of the CGVS.

The Municipality of Boa Vista reported that after the confirmation of the case, the measures were immediately adopted by the Department of Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance (DVE), in partnership with the Hospital Epidemiological Surveillance Center of Hospital da Criança Santo Antônio, Operation Health Center. Welcome and Strategic Information Center on Health Surveillance (CIEVS) in Boa Vista.
- Notification and opening of investigation;
- Collection of samples (waiting for CSF culture results);
- Prophylaxis of HCSA [Hospital da Criança Santo Antônio/Pediatric Hospital] professionals who had contact with the patient;
- Communiqué to the health authorities -- DVE-Estado and CIEVS Roraima;
- Active search for other people who had contact at the place of residence (temporary road shelter);
- Checking the vaccination status of others;
- Chemoprophylaxis of those who had contact with the patient at home.

The diagnosis of meningitis is performed with clinical findings compatible with the symptoms of the disease, however, the etiology (causing agent) is only confirmed after laboratory diagnosis (bacterioscopy, culture, complementary exams).

Today, all basic health units in the city hall, which have a vaccination room, provide the immunization. The prefecture reinforces so that parents and guardians look for a closer unit and vaccinate their children, at the right time, protecting them against the disease. It also emphasizes that the 3 doses must be administered until the 1st year of life.

[The news report above says that a 5-month-old child, who is a Venezuelan refugee living in a shelter for the past month in the northern Brazilian city of Boa Vista, has been diagnosed as having meningitis, but we are not told the microbial etiology. Presumably, the diagnosis is meningococcal meningitis.

Pediatric bacterial meningitis is most common in children younger than 4 years of age, with a peak incidence in those aged 3-8 months (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/961497-overview#a5). The overall rates of bacterial meningitis have been declining since the introduction of vaccines against the 3 most common meningeal pathogens that occur after the neonatal period (_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Neisseria meningitidis_) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901656/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505629/.

The child is said to have received the 1st dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, which is a vaccine that is combined with _Haemophilus influenzae_ B, and pneumococcal vaccine (the 1st doses of both vaccines are given at 2 months of age). The affected child was said not to have received the meningococcal C vaccine "in the right period (3rd and 5th month of age)". However, according to WHO, Venezuela's childhood vaccination schedule does not include a meningococcal vaccination; meningococcal vaccines B and C are used only to control outbreaks from 2 years of age in Venezuela (https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/schedule-by-country/ven.html). In Brazil, meningococcal C conjugate vaccine is given at 3, 5, and 15 months of age.

Roraima (pop., 631 181 residents in 2020) is one of the 26 states of Brazil, located in the country's North Region, bordered by the state of Pará to the southeast, Amazonas to the south and west, Venezuela to the north and northwest, and Guyana to the east; Pacaraima is a city located in the northwest of the state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacaraima) and
Boa Vista is the capital and largest city in Roraima (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roraima). A map showing the location of Roraima can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+Roraima,+Brazil. Hospital da Criança Santo Antônio is a children's hospital in Boa Vista (https://boavista.rr.gov.br/noticias/2020/08/saude-hospital-da-crianca-santo-antonio-completa-20-anos). - Mod.ML
