A 3-year-old horse from Gloucester County was euthanized on 20 Oct
2011 after contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious,
mosquito-borne illness in horses.

"With an increase in the state's mosquito population due to rain
storms in the last couple of months, horse owners must be vigilant in
protecting their animals from diseases spread by mosquitoes," said New
Jersey secretary of agriculture Douglas H Fisher. "Horse owners should
contact their veterinarians to have their animals vaccinated against
these illnesses."

This deadly disease is easily prevented by vaccination. Effective
equine vaccines for EEE and another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile
virus (WNV), are available commercially. Horse owners should contact
their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on
their vaccinations against both EEE and West Nile virus.

The Gloucester County stallion's vaccination status against EEE is
unknown with no report of vaccination in 2011.

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly
higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection. West
Nile virus is a viral disease that affects horses' neurological
systems. The disease is transmitted by mosquito bite. The virus cycles
between birds and mosquitoes with horses and humans being incidental
hosts. EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for
human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be
"dead-end" hosts for the virus.

Earlier this month [October 2011], the 1st case of West Nile virus in
a horse was reported in Monmouth County. The 11-year-old mare was
treated for the disease.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection reports that the
exceedingly high levels of precipitation experienced statewide due to
Hurricane Irene and subsequent rainstorms resulted in much higher than
normal mosquito populations. They said the immense amount of
floodwater throughout the state created habitat for those species of
mosquitoes which utilize semi-permanent, standing water for larval
development.

In 2010, New Jersey had 1 case of EEE and 2 cases of equine WNV. All 3
animals were euthanized. [It is also likely all 3 animals were
deficient in their vaccination status. - Mod.TG]

For more information about EEE and West Nile virus in horses, visit
the New Jersey Department of Agriculture website at

EEE and West Nile virus, like other viral diseases affecting horses'
neurological systems, must be reported to the state veterinarian at
609-292-3965 within 48 hours of diagnosis.

[The east coast has had a lot of water which is perfect for the
breeding of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are the carrier of this viral
disease. Vaccinations are cheap and easy compared to the agony of
enduring the loss of your pet. Especially with such things as
Hurricane Irene this year (2011) it is difficult to imagine why owners
have not already vaccinated.

Clearly it is still warm and the mosquito threat is still prevalent.
Owners are encouraged to vaccinate their horses. - Mod.TG]
