A project has just been accepted by the European Commission (DG V, public
health) on alveolar echinococcosis. This project will focus on
surveillance and will try to organize a standardized definition and will be
able to provide us with information on prevalence of the disease. The aim
is to collect, analyse and disseminate relevant information on this disease
in different countries of the European Union, by setting up a registry.
This project will also liaise surveillance in humans and in animals. The
scientific coordinator [will be: Dr Vuitton, Unité de Recherche
Santé-environnment Rural in Besançon (University of Franche-Comté,France)
