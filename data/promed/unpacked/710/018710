The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish confirms rainbow trout from one
of the state's most prized streams have whirling disease. Laboratory tests
found whirling disease spores in all 3 lots of samples taken from the San
Juan River in northwestern New Mexico. Whirling disease, which affects the
nervous system of young trout by devouring cartilage and destroying the
spine, has infiltrated several rivers in southwest Colorado.
In addition to the San Juan, the disease has been found in half of New
Mexico's hatcheries, which supply a little less than half of the trout to
state waters. Officials said because the San Juan relies mostly on
fisheries for its trout stock, the disease should not affect the river's
status as one of the nation's top 10 trout rivers.
Trout caught in the San Juan are often referred to as footballs because of
the girth many of them obtain in the nutrient-rich waters flowing from the
bottom of Navajo Lake.
"It impacts naturally reproducing populations," Fisheries Division Chief
Jack Kelly said Wednesday. "Our job will be to produce whirling-free fish
from our hatcheries. We'll continue to stock the San Juan."
The department in December sampled fish from Navajo Dam to Rainbow Lodge
several miles downstream from the end of the Quality Waters.
Fish from all 3 lots tested positive for the disease, with fish in the
upper reaches of the "Quality Waters" showing a heavy infestation of the
whirling disease spores.
Kelly said the high level of spores suggests the disease has been present
in the San Juan for some time. Finding whirling disease in the San Juan
isn't a surprise for those who have followed Colorado's battle with the
disease, Kelly said. Nearly every river upstream of the San Juan and many
others in southwest Colorado, including the Animas, Dolores and Pine
rivers, have tested positive for whirling disease. Many trout waters have
yet to be tested, including Farmington Lake, Jackson Lake and the Animas
River in New Mexico.
Three hatcheries in New Mexico -- Lisboa Springs near Pecos, Parkview near
Chama and Seven Springs near Cuba -- tested positive for whirling disease
last fall.
As for Lisboa Springs, the leading suspected source for the spread of the
disease in New Mexico, results released Wednesday showed the hatchery to be
free of the disease.
Later this month, department biologists will meet with the public to
discuss future management policies to keep the disease in check. The
department also plans to work with New Mexico State University to set up a
diagnostic center in Las Cruces to test fish.
In the meantime, tests will continue around the state. New Mexico fisheries
"will not contribute to the spread of whirling disease," Kelly vowed.
