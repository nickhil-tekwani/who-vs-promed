[Equine encephalosis, an orbivirus transmitted by _Culicoides_
species, is a febrile illness of all equids and sometimes elephants.
It is generally a somewhat high morbidity, low mortality event.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, if you want to know more about
this disease please see the excellent commentaries by Mod.AS in
ProMED-mail Equine encephalosis - Israel: 2008 20090401.1254 and an
earlier report by Drs JT Paweska, Dr T Gerdes & Mr R Meiswinkel in
ProMED-mail Equine encephalosis - S. Africa (Port Elizabeth)
19990428.0708. - Mod.PC]

[This outbreak, in the fall of 2008, was initially diagnosed as
equine viral arteritis and duly notified as such to the OIE (see
ProMED-mail postings 20081108.3515 and 20081111.3547). Commendably,
the Israeli authorities forwarded samples to an OIE reference
laboratory, eventually leading to the identification of EEV [equine
encephalosis virus] as the actual causative agent. There are no
previous publications on its presence in the region.

It may be assumed that the Israeli horses have served as sentinels to
this _Culicoides_-borne orbivirus, most probably circulating in other
countries in the Middle East/Eastern Mediterranean area. This virus
deserves to be included in serosurveys in the region. If serological
investigations have been performed, in local equines or in horses
transported by racing clubs in the Near East, their results should
become publicly available. - Mod.AS]
