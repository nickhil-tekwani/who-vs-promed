Ecuador reported 43 new confirmed cases of monkeypox on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], bringing the country's total confirmed cases to 185.

Of the 185 patients, 67 have been discharged from hospital, while the epidemiological barrier for 308 contacts is maintained, the Ministry of Public Health said in a statement.

There are 16 Ecuadorian provinces that have been affected by monkeypox, with Pichincha, Guayas, and Azuay ranking top with 63, 61, and 19 cases respectively.

The health ministry has maintained surveillance throughout the South American country and taken prevention and control actions, calling on Ecuadorians to use masks in certain places and go to the nearest health centers in case of showing symptoms.

Ecuador confirmed its 1st monkeypox case on 6 Jul 2022 in the city of Guayaquil, capital of the southwestern province of Guayas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We enrolled 136 patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from 4 Jun-31 Aug 2022, at the University Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, France. The median patient age was 36 years (interquartile range 31-42 years). Of 136 patients, 125 (92%) were men who have sex with men [MSM], 15 (11%) reported previous smallpox vaccinations, and 21 (15.5%) were HIV-positive. The most frequent lesion locations were the genitals (68 patients, 53%), perianal region (65 patients, 49%), and oral/perioral area (22 patients, 17%). Lesion locations largely corresponded with the route of contamination. Most (68%) patients had isolated anal, genital, or oral lesions when they were 1st seen, including 56 (61%) who had ≥1 positive site without a visible lesion. Concurrent sexually transmitted infections [STIs] were diagnosed in 19 (15%) patients, and 7 patients (5%) were asymptomatic. We recommend vaccination campaigns, intensified testing for sexually transmitted infections, and increased contact tracing to control the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.

Discussion
----------
In conclusion, the ongoing human monkeypox outbreak features unusual characteristics, such as the predominant involvement of MSM who have isolated anal, genital, or oral lesions. The high proportion of concomitant STIs showed transmissibility of monkeypox occurred through local inoculations during sexual activity. Testing specimens from multiple sites in persons with relevant exposure history could be relevant, regardless of the presence of visible lesions. Furthermore, asymptomatic carriage of MPXV suggests that some monkeypox cases might remain undiagnosed, and testing and quarantine of only symptomatic patients might be insufficient to contain transmission. Undiagnosed infections might play a role in overall disease transmission during the outbreak among MSM who have a dense sexual network that includes anonymous contacts, which hampers efficient contact tracing. Physicians should be aware that monkeypox symptoms might overlap with those of other STIs, more specifically in MSM with at-risk sexual activity. Prevention, including vaccination campaigns targeting at-risk groups, are ongoing in multiple countries and should be expanded. Intensified testing for all STIs at different sites (pharynx, rectum, genital, and skin) and in urine and increased contact tracing might also be helpful to control the outbreak.

This report reinforces previous reports that indicate that MSM is the main monkeypox-infected cohort. Other reports have indicated that behavioral changes in MSM have been an important component of the reduction in transmission. Continuation of that tendency will depend on effective communication with that community coupled with vaccination. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report a case of monkeypox in a physician after an occupational needlestick injury from a pustule. This case highlights risk for occupational transmission and manifestations of the disease after percutaneous transmission: a short incubation period, followed by a solitary lesion at the injured site and later by systemic symptoms.

The 2022 multicountry monkeypox outbreak has been linked primarily to intimate sexual contact. Although there are reported cases among healthcare workers (HCW), most are described to have been acquired in the community setting. We report a case of monkeypox after an occupational needlestick injury.

The study
---------
In late July 2022, a healthy 29-year-old male physician from the Infectious Diseases Department of a tertiary hospital in Portugal had a needlestick injury in the left index finger with a needle used to collect a fluid sample from a man who had a pustular rash, later confirmed to be monkeypox. The physician punctured a pustule with the needle because he was unable to obtain material by swabbing it. He was wearing the recommended personal protective equipment; the gloves appeared intact to him, and there was no wound or bleeding. Thus, he did not report the incident as an occupational exposure accident or considered it for postexposure vaccination. No other risk factors for monkeypox were present.

Figure 1 [images]. Progress of monkeypox lesion on the finger of a previously healthy male physician in Portugal after occupational needlestick injury from pustule. A) Index lesion on the 4th day of illness. B) Index lesion on the 6th day of illness. C) Index lesion on the 18th day of illness. D) Necrotic scab underneath the devitalized tissue of the index lesion on the 24th day of illness.

A vesicle appeared on the pricked finger (Figure 1, panel A) 4 days later, and monkeypox virus (MPXV) was identified in its fluid by PCR, showing a cycle threshold (Ct) of 28. The HCW was sent on sick leave, with indication for the institution of contact and droplet isolation measures at home.

No other lesions or symptoms developed during the next 5 days. PCR results for MPXV in the samples collected from the oropharynx and blood were negative on the 7th day after exposure. The case-patient was considered not eligible for postexposure prophylaxis with the modified vaccinia virus Ankara Bavarian Nordic vaccine (https://www.bavarian-nordic.com) because the HCW already had a lesion that contained MPXV.

Figure 2 [images]. Monkeypox signs in a previously healthy male physician in Portugal after occupational needlestick injury from pustule. A) Tender, indurated, erythematous, and well-delimited linear streak from the left finger to the armpit, on the 7th day of illness. B) Aggravated lymphangitis on the ninth day of illness.

On the 6th day of illness, fever (temperature 38.4 deg C [101. 1 deg F]), chills, and malaise developed and lasted for about 48 hours. The finger lesion became pustular and painful and showed surrounding erythema and swelling (Figure 1, panel B). A tender, indurated, erythematous, and well-delimited linear streak from the left finger to the armpit appeared on the 7th day (Figure 2, panel A), without regional adenopathy. MPXV PCR was repeated in samples from the oropharynx and blood; again, results were negative.

On the 8th day and for the next 3 days, vesicles developed on the scalp, neck, forearm, 1st finger from both hands and 5th left finger, scrotum, and ankle. A painless right cervical adenopathy also appeared. Despite the absence of leukocytosis or elevation of C-reactive protein level, a bacterial superinfection was assumed because of worsening of the inflammatory signs of the left index finger and of the arm lymphangitis (Figure 2, panel B), and a course of 5 days of oral flucloxacillin was administered. The patient showed clinical improvement. Treatment with tecovirimat was discussed but considered unnecessary given the benign evolution (no mucosal involvement, <10 lesions) and the absence of concurrent conditions.

By the 18th day of illness, all skin lesions, except the one on the left index finger, had evolved through the pustular stage into crust. The index lesion became necrotic (Figure 1, panel C) and was debrided on the 24th day of illness, showing a necrotic scab that had a diameter of 0.5 cm [0.2 in] underneath the devitalized tissue (Figure 1, panel D). An MPXV PCR result was still positive in the crust and showed a Ct of 23, but viral culture was negative.

Conclusions
-----------
Several aspects of this case should be emphasized. First, it clearly exemplifies the risks of using sharp instruments for monkeypox testing, which is not recommended. Samples should be collected by vigorously swabbing the surface of lesions or by removing crusts with a forceps or other blunt-tipped sterile instruments. Unroofing, aspiration of lesions, or otherwise use of sharp instruments before swabbing is not necessary or recommended because of the risk of injury from sharp instruments. The presence of material on the swab surface is indicative of an adequate collection, although it might not always be visible. For this case-patient, the physician was not certain of an adequate collection after swabbing the lesion, which led him to use a needle for sample collection. If sharp instruments are deemed fully essential for testing, their use, as an exception, should be performed with extreme care, and sharps should be discarded into an adequate container.

Second, this case should remind HCWs about the need to report needlestick injuries and other exposures promptly, regardless of a self-notion of absence of risk, to avoid missing opportunities for postexposure prophylaxis. Penetrating injury is considered a high-risk exposure and an indication for postexposure prophylaxis.

Third, the case alerts us to a possible different manifestation and evolution of monkeypox. This difference is especially true when the transmission route is percutaneous. In this case, a solitary lesion developed at the injured site after a short incubation period, followed a few days later by systemic symptoms and the characteristic rash.

Fourth, because of this different evolution, more evidence is needed for decision-making on the timing of postexposure vaccination and use of tecovirimat in similar cases. Despite its benign course, monkeypox might lead to prolonged work absenteeism because international guidelines recommend precautions remain in place until lesions have crusted, scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath, which might take several weeks. Thus, it might be reasonable to consider these therapeutic options to prevent or modify the disease course. In this case, when postexposure prophylaxis was discussed, the HCW was not considered eligible for postexposure vaccination because a lesion containing MPXV was already present, which is in accordance with the UK Health Security Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. However, more evidence is needed in this field.

Fifth, it is useful to study the infectiousness of the scabs because their dropping off is considered a determinant for deisolation criteria. Pittman et al. verified that monkeypox scabs contained large quantities of viral DNA until and including when they fell off, but viral infectivity of specimens was not determined. In the case we describe, despite the positive PCR result, with an even lower Ct than the original lesion, the viral culture was negative. Therefore, persistence of positive PCR results might not be a reliable indicator of contagiousness and might lead to prolonged and unnecessary isolation.

Sixth, this case increases awareness of the need for accelerating production of vaccines and increasing their preexposure and postexposure availability. This activity is especially useful for HCWs who deal with monkeypox cases to provide adequate protection and security.

In summary, we report a case of monkeypox in an HCW after a needlestick injury. HCWs should be aware of the risk for transmission of MPXV while infected patients are being evaluated and tested, should report needlestick or other injuries promptly, and should take advantage of available preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
A global monkeypox outbreak began in May 2022. Limited data exist on specimen type performance in associated molecular diagnostics. Consequently, a diverse range of specimen sources were collected in the initial weeks of the outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Our clinical evaluation identified skin lesions as the optimal diagnostic specimen source.

The rapid emergence of monkeypox in nonendemic regions of the world during 2022 has health systems on alert. Monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) (genus _Orthopoxvirus_ [OPXV]). MPXV forms 2 distinct clades: clade I (formerly the Congo Basin/Central African clade), associated with higher virulence and greater mortality rate, and clade II (formerly the West African clade), which is responsible for the current global outbreak.

The rapid increase in monkeypox cases in nonendemic areas has challenged clinical laboratories. MPXV shedding and transmission are poorly understood, and relevant data to support clinical management and public health response are lacking. Human-to-human transmission occurs by respiratory droplets, direct contact with skin lesions of infected persons, or contact with contaminated fomites. Skin lesions, when present, are presumed to be the primary source of viral shedding. Thus, testing of lesion swab specimens by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is believed to be optimal for diagnosis. MPXV can also be detected in other sites, such as throat, nasopharynx, blood, urine, saliva, and semen.

We investigated detection of MPXV among different clinical specimen types. These specimens were submitted to the provincial reference laboratory for testing in the early weeks of the 2022 outbreak in Ontario, Canada.

The study
---------
The Public Health Ontario Ethics Review Board determined that this study did not require research ethics committee approval because it describes analyses that were completed at the Public Health Ontario laboratory as part of routine clinical testing and surveillance during the monkeypox outbreak in Ontario [Canada]. Therefore, this study was considered to be public health practice and was exempt from this requirement.

This retrospective study was conducted on patient specimens submitted to Public Health Ontario's laboratory, the reference microbiology laboratory in Ontario, and MPXV testing location, during the initial weeks of the provincial surge (May-June 2022). All specimens were collected from symptomatic patients with suspected monkeypox infection. Specimen types were categorized as blood, skin lesions, nasal or nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens, and oropharyngeal (throat) swab specimens. Urine, semen, and saliva were infrequently submitted. We extracted clinical data submitted on the laboratory requisition, including demographic variables, clinical information, and enterovirus laboratory test results if available.

We extracted DNA from clinical specimens using either the automated total nucleic acid method (NucliSENS easyMAG; bioMérieux, https://www.biomerieux.com) or the manual method (QIAamp DNA Minikit; QIAGEN, https://www.qiagen.com). We conducted testing by using 1 of 2 assays developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the Laboratory Response Network pan-Orthopoxvirus (OPX) RT-PCR and an MPXV-specific RT-PCR endorsed by the World Health Organization. Both assays were validated in-house for clinical testing. The OPXV assay primer/probe set was supplied by CDC for restricted use through the Canadian Laboratory Response Network. The MPXV RT-PCR consists of a generic MPXV GR2-G target (MPX), an MPXV clade II-specific target, and RNaseP extraction control.

Using the QuantStudio5 RT-PCR system and TaqPath ProAmp Multiplex master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com), we amplified a 10-μL reaction containing 4 μL DNA, 0.5 μmol/L primers, and 0.2 μmol/L probe. Thermocycling conditions were 60 deg C [140 deg F] for 30 s, 95 deg C [203 deg F] for 5 min, and 45 cycles at 95 deg C for 5 s and 60 deg C for 30 s. Cycle threshold (Ct) values ≤38 were reported as detected, 38.01-39.99 as indeterminate, and ≥40 as not detected for MPXV DNA.

The testing algorithm shifted from the OPXV RT-PCR to the MPXV RT-PCR once the MPXV assay was validated. Some specimens were tested by both assays during validation. RT-PCR results, including Ct values, were evaluated by specimen type among patients who had multiple specimens collected during the same testing episode. Parallel testing for enterovirus by RT-PCR was conducted for pediatric (age <18 years) patients as the most likely differential diagnosis in this age group and for adults (age ≥18 years) upon request.

We tested 1063 specimens from 372 patients (mean age 33.8 years, range >1-88 years); 71.2% were male. MPXV was detected in 81 (21.8%) patients, all adult males who had a mean age of 38 years (range 19-65 years). Specimen positivity rate was 23.4% (249/1063); 2.8% (29/1063) of all specimens tested had indeterminate results.

Among specimens submitted from the 81 MPXV-positive patients, skin lesions displayed the highest positivity rate (177/213, 83.1%), followed by oropharyngeal (31/46, 67.4%), nasal or NP (20/36, 55.6%), blood (29/67, 43.3%) and urine (6/21, 28.6%) (Table). MPXV was also detected in 2/5 semen specimens and 1/1 saliva specimen submitted from known MPXV-positive patients.

Across all positive specimens, the MPXV GR2-G target mean Ct (26.2) was 2.7 lower than that of the OPXV assay (29.9), and the clade II target mean Ct (26.3) was 2.6 times lower. The MPXV assay also had lower Ct values than the OPXV assay across all specimen types (Table), indicating higher analytical sensitivity. Skin lesion specimens were detected multiple cycles earlier, indicative of higher viral loads. Oropharyngeal samples had the 2nd lowest Ct means.

Among 78 monkeypox confirmed case-patients with skin and NP or throat swab specimens submitted for testing, 72/78 (92.3%) had ≥1 positive skin specimen, and 38/78 (48.7%) had ≥1 positive NP or throat swab specimens. MPXV was only detected in skin specimens in 34/78 (43.6%) patients. All patients with a positive blood specimen had ≥1 other positive specimen type. Among 15 monkeypox confirmed case-patients who had both NP and throat swab specimens submitted, 8 had concordant (53.3%) positive and 2 (13.3%) had concordant negative results. One case-patient had a negative NP swab and positive throat swab specimens, and 4 discordant case-patients had 1 sample type indeterminate and the other negative.

Enterovirus was detected in 25 (71.4%) of the 35 children tested. It was also detected in 7 (46.7%) of the 15 adults tested.

Conclusions
-----------
In this study, MPXV was detected in specimens from multiple sites. Skin lesions most often tested positive, as observed in 92.3% of laboratory confirmed case-patients who had ≥1 skin specimens tested. This finding indicates that this is the most clinically relevant specimen when skin lesions are available. Positivity rates for other specimen types suggest their use as alternatives if skin lesions are not available. However, the high clinical sensitivity (83.1%) of single skin specimens for MPXV detection suggests that 2 (or 3) appropriately collected specimens from open skin lesions should be adequate for testing. Including additional specimen types probably provides limited value in patients who have lesions. The CDC recommendation of collecting 2 swab specimens from each skin lesion might not be required when >1 skin lesion can be swabbed, which will assist with use of laboratory resources should testing demands increase.

Because of our findings, Public Health Ontario advises that specimens other than skin lesions are not required if patients have multiple skin lesions that can be swabbed. However, blood should always be submitted along with NP or throat swab specimens for patients without open skin lesions (e.g., fever without rash or only macular/papular rash). Children are an exception to this strategy because collecting alternative specimens (such as NP swab specimens) enables investigation of other likely etiologies of rash and fever (e.g., respiratory viruses including adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus).

According to epidemiologic summaries for Ontario, the most common symptoms reported among monkeypox-confirmed case-patients (all tested at the Public Health Ontario laboratory) were rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, oral/genital lesions, and fatigue. Limitations of this study include lack of detailed clinical information (e.g., symptom onset date) for many patients when not described on the test requisition. Therefore, test performance could not be correlated with disease progression. Further evaluations of different specimen types with detailed temporal data is warranted.
