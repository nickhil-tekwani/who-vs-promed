Vaccinating Birds May Help to Curtail Virus's Spread
-----------------------------------------------------
Fearful that a deadly flu epidemic could be brewing in Asia, some
countries are stockpiling drugs, preparing pandemic flu plans, and
ratcheting up vaccine production. As these efforts kick into
overdrive, animal experts are grappling with the other half of the
bird flu equation: the birds. Specifically, they are debating whether
a relatively untested strategy of mass vaccination of chickens and
other poultry against avian flu will do more harm than good in
warding off a human pandemic.
Since the appearance in 1997 of H5N1, global health experts have
worried that the strain will combine, or reassort, with a human flu
virus to produce an easily transmissible strain with H5N1's
lethality. To avert such a disaster, last winter and spring 7 Asian
countries slaughtered more than 100 million birds, decimating the
poultry industry. But the virus has resurfaced and appears to be
endemic in the region. And the more virus in circulation, the greater
the chance of a deadly reassortment.
Animal health officials agree that the best ways to curtail H5N1 are
increasing surveillance and improving biosecurity, which includes a
host of measures intended to prevent diseases from spreading among
flocks and to the public. But now, after years of debate, consensus
is building that vaccination of at-risk poultry could also be a
critical tool in averting a human pandemic. Indeed, in Sep 2004,
alarmed at the spread of H5N1, the Paris-based World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) strengthened a previous recommendation encouraging
consideration of vaccination in conjunction with other control
methods.
But there's a catch, explains Alex Thiermann, a veterinarian at OIE:
"If improperly done, vaccination could be dangerous." It could enable
the virus to circulate undetected among birds, perhaps spurring its
evolution.
So far, Hong Kong requires vaccination of all poultry. Thailand
forbids it. China and Indonesia are selectively vaccinating in
regions where the virus has appeared.
The clear benefit of vaccination is its ability to reduce the amount
of wild virus in circulation. Although vaccination does not always
prevent infection -- just disease -- it takes a much higher dose of
virus to cause infection, and vaccinated birds that do become
infected shed far less virus than unvaccinated birds. As an added
precaution, animal health experts agree that vaccinated birds that
become infected should be culled. "By reducing the amount of virus in
the environment, you reduce the possibility of the virus spreading to
a new flock, and you reduce the risk to humans," says David Suarez of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Southeast Poultry
Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia.
For a country to undertake vaccination safely, it first must ensure
the quality and efficacy of the vaccine. It must be targeted to the
virus in circulation, properly inactivated, and tested to determine
the adequate dosage.
Then there's the problem of distinguishing vaccinated birds from
birds infected by the wild virus. If the vaccine is derived from the
circulating virus, both infected and vaccinated birds would appear
positive in antibody tests. This problem has limited the use of avian
flu vaccines in the past because it prevents epidemiologists from
tracking the circulating virus. It could also make it hard to prove
that flocks are disease-free so exports can resume once the disease
is stamped out.
Long-term experience with an avian vaccine in Mexico has raised other
concerns [Chang-Won Lee, Dennis A. Senne & David L. Suarez, 2004.
Journal of Virology, 78 (15), 8372-8381]. Farmers in Mexico have been
immunizing chickens against a low-pathogenicity H5N2 virus with the
same vaccine for 7 years. Over time, the virus has mutated, in a
process called antigenic drift. Although the vaccine still prevents
clinical disease, it no longer reduces the amount of virus shed by
the chickens. Suarez believes that widespread vaccination probably
contributed to the virus becoming endemic not only in Mexico but in
neighboring Guatemala and El Salvador as well. To avoid this, the
virus must be monitored and the vaccine updated periodically.
Despite these hurdles, sentiment began to shift in favor of adding
vaccination to other avian flu control measures several years ago.
With the increased scale of modern poultry farms, culling in a buffer
zone around an infected flock was killing enormous numbers of healthy
birds. Some farmers and animal health officials began arguing that
vaccination in a buffer zone, instead of slaughter, might be more
humane and cost-effective.
In addition, studies done at the USDA lab in Georgia and reported in
[the journals] Avian Pathology in 1999 and in Vaccine in 2000 showed
that a vaccine based on one H5 virus subtype might provide
cross-protection against several others. If so, vaccinating with a
strain that differs from the circulating strain could solve the
problem of differentiating vaccinated-but-uninfected birds from
infected birds. More recently, researchers at the Tai Lung Veterinary
Laboratory, Hong Kong, tested a vaccine based on an H5N2 strain
against the H5N1 strains that caused outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997
and 2002. Trevor Ellis, senior veterinary officer at the Tai Lung
lab, says the vaccine "protected against clinical disease and
produced greater than 1000-fold reduction in virus excretion in birds
given heavy virus challenge doses."
More convincing than the lab studies was Hong Kong's experience.
During an outbreak in December 2002 and January 2003, a number of
farms were infected. On 3 of these farms, chickens in infected sheds
were culled, but chickens in other sheds were inoculated with a
vaccine based on the H5N2 strain. The virus spread to additional
sheds on 2 of these farms, killing some of the recently vaccinated
chickens. But as Ellis and his colleagues reported, 18 days after
vaccination, when immunity had developed, there were no new cases of
disease among the vaccinated birds; intensive monitoring found no
evidence of asymptomatic shedding.
In early 2003, Hong Kong added universal vaccination to its control
measures. Unvaccinated "sentinel" chickens are placed within each
flock, and there is regular serologic and virologic testing. When
H5N1 swept through neighboring China early this year, Hong Kong
remained virus-free.
Last winter, both South Korea and Japan identified H5N1 outbreaks
quickly enough to contain them with limited culling, still the
preferred approach. But where stamping out is impractical or
uneconomical, vaccination should be considered, says Joseph Domenech,
chief of animal health services for FAO.
Hong Kong's experience is not easily translated to other countries,
however. Hong Kong's poultry industry is limited to just 150 farms
and a handful of families raising backyard chickens. The territory is
small and has an infrastructure capable of fully monitoring the use
of vaccines. Hans Wagner, FAO's regional director, says, "It's a
substantial challenge to extend these measures to an entire country"
-- and expensive. The vaccine alone costs about 7 cents per bird, not
counting the labor of injecting or the monitoring that should
accompany it. By contrast, FAO consultants and others who have
visited China and Indonesia -- which are both vaccinating in areas
where H5N1 has been reported -- noted several shortcomings.
Several of the vaccines in use in both countries are based on the
H5N1 strain itself, making it difficult to track the disease. And the
use of unvaccinated sentinels and the serological and virological
monitoring is spotty at best.
In Thailand, which has reported more than 250 outbreaks in 45 of the
country's 76 provinces in the last 3 months, authorities have
rejected vaccination, at least for the moment. Yukol Limlamthong,
director-general of Thailand's Department of Livestock Development,
says they are worried that vaccination might enable the virus to
circulate silently among vaccinated birds, exposing farm hands and
families to infection. "We don't want to put them at risk," he says.
But flu experts elsewhere suspect that commercial concerns factored
heavily in the decision. [See commentary and the referenced
postings].
The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which governs international
trade in animals and animal products, says a country can be
considered free of avian influenza if specified levels of
surveillance do not turn up the virus -- regardless of whether it is
vaccinating. But the code is vague and places the burden of proof on
the exporting country. Johan Reyniers, a press spokesperson for the
European Commission in Brussels, says, "It would ultimately be up to
Thai authorities to demonstrate that vaccination is properly
implemented."
For now, Thai officials believe it will be easier to convince trading
partners that its poultry products are safe if the country can
control the disease without vaccination. But whether it can remains
to be seen.

[While EU requires absence of vaccination for at least 3 years,
Article 2.1.14.2 of OIE's International Animal Health Code says that
a country can be considered HPAI-free 6 months after the slaughter of
the last affected animal, provided a stamping-out policy is practised
-- "with or without vaccination against HPAI".
The considerations of Thailand's commercial poultry sector regarding
AI vaccination, which might affect the prospects of renewed exports,
differ significantly from those of the small-holders whose livelihood
could be ruined by HPAI without vaccination. EU's import policy
seems to play a major role in the Thai policy. Both sectors are
obviously driven by economical considerations; it is up to the
international community to enhance the crucial public-health aspects
of the issue.
The above-referenced overview in the journal Science provides useful
background in anticipation of the discussions between stakeholders
and policy-makers, to be held in Thailand in November (see separate
posting).
