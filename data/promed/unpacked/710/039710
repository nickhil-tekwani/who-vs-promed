Rabid foxes appear to be at the root of Cambridge Bay's [Nunavut] recent spate of sudden dog deaths. There's been an increase in the number of rabid foxes near Cambridge Bay this year [2013], and people should avoid them, said Stephen King, Cambridge Bay's senior administrative officer.

That advice came after a few tied-up dogs in the community were found strangled on their chains, likely due to rabies. Some unvaccinated dogs in the community were confirmed to have rabies, likely caught after they came into contact with rabid foxes.

"People should avoid any foxes in town and call the wildlife officer or hamlet bylaw officer to report a fox sighting," King told Nunatsiaq News. However, the hamlet is not the organization that sends the animals for tests, he said. That's done in conjunction with the Government of Nunavut's wildlife and environmental health officers.

The hamlet bylaw officer does vaccinate dogs at an owner's request, King said -- and, as well, there are vaccine clinics set up a few times a year. "If a dog owner cannot take their dog to the bylaw officer, the officer will make home visits upon request, especially in circumstances where there is increased confirmed rabies case as there have been this year [2013]," King said.

Rabies, a potentially fatal viral disease that spreads from the bite of a rabid animal to another animal or human, affects the central nervous system. It is a disease found mostly in foxes and wolves in Nunavut and most often transmitted by bites from infected animals.

Rabies signs in animals can include either aggressive and combative behaviour or listless and weak behaviour. But, in both kinds of rabies, the "furious" or "dumb" form, death occurs a few days after signs appear, usually from respiratory failure.

Foxes and wolves are the main carriers of rabies in the wild -- and when they bite dogs, rabies can spread quickly. The rabies virus, present in the saliva of an infected animal, can spread to people who are bitten or scratched by an infected dog or fox, and is [almost always] fatal in infected humans if they are not treated soon after the disease is transmitted.

Last January [2013], Igloolik [Inuit hamlet in Nunavut] was on alert for rabies after a fox tested positive for the disease.

A similar situation unfolded in Nunavik [far northern region of Quebec] in 2012, where 6 foxes tested positive for rabies.

[2] USA (Texas): canine, human exposure

A dog that was housed and on display at Abilene's animal shelter has tested positive for rabies. A worker with an animal charity confirmed he and at least 2 city workers were treated for exposure from the animal.

The puppy was found in the area south of the intersection of County Road 424 and County Road 347 east of Hawley in Jones County.

Authorities are looking for anyone who has been bitten or otherwise exposed to the saliva of the puppy from 5 May until the day it died, 24 May 2013, including those who visited the Animal Shelter on South 25th Street, between last Wednesday and last Friday [22-24 May 2013].

If bitten or exposed, please call (325)-437-4585 and leave your contact information. A member of the Texas Department of State Health Services will call you back with important information.

Christine Mann with the Texas Department of State Health Services said it's vital for people who may have been exposed to see their doctor for treatment.

"Rabies is transmitted through infected saliva. Once symptoms develop , whether in a human or an animal, the disease is almost always fatal," Mann said.

Rabies is almost always fatal; there are very few humans that have survived and sadly, there are likely no animals that have survived. Any mammal is susceptible to rabies, therefore it is extremely important to vaccinate your pets, even horses or cattle, to protect them and to build a barrier between the disease and yourself. - Mod.TG]
