Number of possible E. coli cases at Bronx day care center rises
---------------------------------------------------------------
The number of possible cases of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection at a
Bronx day care center has climbed from 18 to 26 as the center remains
closed. The For Kids Only Day Care and Nursery has been closed since Thu, 1
Jul 2004, after 3 children were admitted to hospital. 1 other child, who
did not attend the center, was also infected. Doctor Marguerite Mayers, who
treated the kids at Montefiore Medical Center, says the condition of all of
the children was serious but all were stabilized and released.
The center hired a private team to run tests in order to determine where
the bacterium came from. In addition, New York City Department of Health
inspectors say the center will be thoroughly sterilized before kids can
step foot back inside. Experts say there is really no way to protect
against _E. coli_ but add that proper hygiene can help. Health officials
say parents should be on the lookout for symptoms such as abdominal pain,
diarrhea that becomes bloody, fever and irritability. They say the
infection is caused by poor hand washing, handling of diapers and unsafe
food preparation.
If the cleaning and inspection process goes smoothly, the center may open
on Wed 7 Jul 2004.
