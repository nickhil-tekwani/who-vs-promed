Around 300 people were hospitalized on Thursday night [24 Mar 2022] in Khandwa after they suffered food poisoning. The victims, residents of Khandwa, Indore, and Burhanpur, had attended an engagement party in the district. Of the 300, 117 were admitted to district hospital, and the remaining persons, including the would-be groom, were admitted to 2 private hospitals in Khandwa.

Deputy epidemiologist at Khandwa district hospital Dr Yogesh Sharma said that all patients complained of diarrhea and vomiting after they had dinner at an engagement party organized at Shehnai Palace in Khanshahwali.

"At district hospital, 117 people including 64 women and 4 children below 5 years of age were admitted between 1:45 a.m. and 7 a.m. due to food poisoning. All patients, except 3, were discharged by Friday evening after being provided primary treatment. The remaining 3 are suffering from diabetes/hypertension. They are also out of danger but have been kept under observation for 24-36 hours," Dr Sharma said. "During the treatment, many patients complained that foul smell was coming from gulab jamun, which could be because the sweet dish was probably made of contaminated mawa or other raw materials, or the same was going stale due to increasing temperature," he said.

[Gulab jamun, or gulaab jamun, is a milk-solid-based sweet that originates from the Indian subcontinent. The national dessert of Pakistan, gulab jamun is also popular in India, Nepal, the Maldives (where it's known as gulab ki janu), Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes usually substitute dried or powdered milk for the khoya. The dessert is often garnished with dried almonds and cashews to enhance flavor.

It is not clear what the incubation period was between ingestion of the alleged vehicle and the onset of symptoms, and if fever was present. - Mod.LL
