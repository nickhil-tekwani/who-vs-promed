The 1st cases of Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever to be seen outside Saudi
Arabia are reported online in the December 2010 edition of Emerging
Infectious Diseases (1). Fabrizio Carletti and colleagues indicated that 2
people who visited a camel market in Egypt at different times during 2010
developed symptoms of the disease after returning to Italy. "The detection
of 2 independent infection events for travelers who visited the same area
in a restricted period strongly supports the hypothesis of sustained local
ALKV [Alkhurma virus] circulation," write the authors.

The virus, which is classified as a high-biosafety pathogen, infects camels
and sheep. Most human cases of Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever are seen in
butchers, who are more likely to come in contact with contaminated blood of
an infected animal. But people can also catch the virus through the bite of
an infected _Ornithodoros savignyi_ tick or by drinking unpasteurised milk.

The disease is fatal in about 25 per cent of patients. It was discovered in
the mid-1990s and named after the city where the 1st fatal case occurred.
About 40 cases have been reported since then, never outside Saudi Arabia.

The 1st case of imported disease described by the authors, a 64 year old
man, told doctors that he got bitten on the foot by what looked like a tick
while visiting a camel market in April this year [2010]. Within 2 days
after the bite, he developed a high fever, chills, and nausea among other
symptoms. On returning to Italy, his condition worsened, but he was
discharged from hospital in mid-May 2010 after successful treatment.

In the meantime, blood samples were sent for testing to discover the cause
of his illness. Initial tests ruled out dengue and West Nile viruses, but
after suspecting that a flavivirus might be involved, medical scientists
used genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR to identify genetic material
very similar to that of the Alkhurma virus.

Weeks later, blood samples from another patient also tested positive for
the virus. The 2 patients visited the region around one month apart.

Carletti and colleagues call for future research to determine how far the
virus has spread in the region, and to weigh up the risk to locals and
visitors. But the virus should now be added to the list of travel-related
pathogens under surveillance, they say, and travellers should be advised
about the risks of coming in contact with animals in endemic areas.

In the same issue of the journal, scientists probing risk factors for
Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever in the Saudi city of Najran report (2) that
some people exposed to the virus develop symptoms that are too mild to be
detected as clinical illness. Abdullah Alzahrani and colleagues say this
suggests that only severe cases may have been recorded so far, artificially
increasing the case-fatality rate for the disease.

The finding also points to the possibility that the virus may circulate
more widely than previously thought, according to the authors, in other
parts of Saudi Arabia or in other countries. "The history of the reported
disease in Makkah [Meccah] during the Hajj, when thousands of livestock are
imported to Saudi Arabia, and the existence of the outbreak in Najran,
which is at the border with Yemen, necessitate further studies in adjacent
countries."

Alzahrani and colleagues draw their conclusions from an investigation into
28 cases of the disease identified in Najran city by active surveillance
between 2006 and 2009. For each patient, they selected 2 people who had no
antibodies against the virus and compared risk factors between the 2 groups
using survey data about their exposure history, clinical features of any
illness and demographic factors.

Backing results from previous studies, the analysis found that people were
more likely to contract Alkhurma virus by having contact with animals or
getting bitten by a tick, but not through unpasteurised milk or the bite of
mosquitoes, a suspected vector for the virus. The study also suggests that
living near a farm could be an additional risk factor for the disease.

[This is the 1st report of Alkhurma virus infection outside of Saudi Arabia
and, as the above report and references suggest, this virus is more widely
spread geographically than previously thought. The virus and human cases of
encephalitis caused by it were 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 1995. There
have been several more human cases reported there since then. The virus is
a flavivirus similar to another tickborne virus, Kysanur Forest disease
virus endemic in Karnataka state, India. One hopes that surveillance for
Alkhurma virus encephalitis will be intensified in similar ecosystems in
the Middle East, where the tick vector occurs. Interestingly, the above
report discounts consumption of raw camel's milk as a major risk factor for
Alkhurma virus infection compared to tick bite or contact with infected
animals. This too warrants further study, given common consumption of raw
camel's milk by people in this region.
