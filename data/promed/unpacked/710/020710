[According to Resolution no 18 (adopted at the 82nd General Session of the OIE, May 2014), Portugal is a Member country recognized as having negligible bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk status in accordance with Chapter 11.5 of the Terrestrial Code. The complete list of BSE Risk Status of Member Countries can be found at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/.

Based on information available from the WAHID, Portugal last reported BSE in 2012. At that time, 2 cases of BSE were reported. The report indicated 138 susceptible bovines, 2 cases, 1 death and 22 destroyed. See information in Sections 1 and 3 of the January to June, 2012 6-monthly report at http://tinyurl.com/ncyhes7 and the Annual Report at http://tinyurl.com/p7vxxw7.

The WAHID "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence" section shows that between January 2005 and December 2012, Portugal had reported 136 outbreaks of BSE to the OIE: 51 outbreaks in 2005, 33 outbreaks in 2006, 14 outbreaks in 2007, 17 outbreaks in 2008, 8 outbreaks in 2009, 6 outbreaks in 2010, 5 outbreaks in 2011 and 2 outbreaks in 2012.

For more information on the disease, official OIE status recognition, and recommendations please access the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code at http://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/terrestrial-code/access-online/; Chapter 11.5 on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy: http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bovine_tuberculosis.htm.

What is the public health risk associated with this disease? "There are indications that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans could be caused by the consumption of beef products contaminated by infected nervous tissue or medical devices manufactured from infected animal tissues.

The risk linked with consumption is addressed by the requirement for routine removal of all visible nervous and lymphatic tissue (Specified Risk Materials, SRM) from carcasses during the processing of cattle as well as the removal of any suspect animals from the human food chain.

Appropriate handling of nervous and lymphatic tissue tissues from BSE-suspect animals in abattoirs and laboratories is indicated to avoid accidental exposure (ocular or oro-nasal). Milk and milk products are considered safe. The production of human and veterinary pharmaceutical products, medical devices or cosmetics should adhere to strict requirements."
