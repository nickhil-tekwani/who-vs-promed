A state bee expert says 2 outbreaks of American Foul Brood in bee
colonies in the Eastern Panhandle and northeastern West Virginia are
under control.
George Clutter, the state Department of Agriculture's apiarist said
63 cases of the disease were found in 272 colonies. The bees were
destroyed and the beekeepers' equipment was sterilized, Clutter told
the Agriculture and Agribusiness Committee during legislative interim
meetings Monday.
Clutter attributed the outbreaks to beekeepers bringing old equipment
back into service to keep up with an increasing demand for honey.
The disease is caused by a bacterium, _Paenibacillus larvae_ var
_larvae_, producing spores which can remain viable for 40 years if
equipment is not sterilized, according to the Queensland, Australia,
Department of Primary Industries' Web site.
There are 1301 beekeepers registered in West Virginia, with 14 197
colonies in 1634 apiaries, Clutter said. He said the state's
beekeepers are expected to produce 1.2 million pounds of honey this
summer.
Clutter told lawmakers the Department of Agriculture needs an
additional inspector to keep up with the industry's growth.
