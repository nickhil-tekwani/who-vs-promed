Lumpy skin disease (LSD), locally known as Go-Basant, has triggered panic among cattle owners in Ganjam district.

The disease has killed 3 cattle, while 2356 have been affected in 409 villages of 22 blocks and 33 wards of Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC), Hinjili Municipality, Chhatrapur, Kabisuryanagar, Kodala, Purushottampur, Ganjam, Belaguntha and Aska Notified Area Council (NAC), said chief district veterinary officer (CDVO), Ganjam Dr Trinath Nayak.

LSD is an infectious disease caused by capripox virus. The onset of fever occurs almost one week after infection. It is transmitted between animals by direct contact, via arthropod vectors. The virus is highly host specific and does not cause disease in humans. Unfortunately, there are no specific antiviral drugs available for treatment of LSD. The only treatment available is supportive care of cattle. This can include treatment of skin lesions using wound care sprays and use of antibiotics to prevent secondary skin infections and pneumonia.

The CDVO said 2 weekly cattle haats [unregulated periodic rural markets] at Hinjili and Belaguntha have been closed to check further spread of the disease. Blood samples of the affected cattle have been sent to laboratories at Bhopal and Phulnakhara. He said that 1981 camps have been held in different parts of Ganjam to spread awareness among people of the disease.

The disease has led to substantial production losses for the cattle farming industry owing to drops in milk yield, decreased fertility among cows and bulls, abortion, damaged skin and hides, decrease or increase in weight, and untimely deaths.

LSD has been, so far, termed by India as a "never reported" disease. In August 2019, the local media reported from Ganjam a spreading undiagnosed disease in cattle, locally coined as Go-Bahant. The information about such an exotic disease having already obtained a local, vernacular name, was rather puzzling. According to the current media report, which includes professional, science-based terms describing LSD, the clinical signs are currently being viewed by the district veterinary authorities as indicative of lumpy skin disease, a disease hitherto considered exotic and absent in India. The disease has, very likely, been circulating in India for at least 3 months.

In August 2019, LSD was reported for the 1st time from China (Xinjiang province). Xinjiang borders India's state Jammu and Kashmir.

Results of the laboratory tests are anticipated soon, followed -- if confirmed -- by immediate official notification to the OIE. - Mod.AS
