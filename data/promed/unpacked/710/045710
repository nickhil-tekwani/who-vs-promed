Equine influenza in Australia can be controlled and eradicated
--------------------------------------------------------------
Rigorous and regularly reviewed protocols for the importation of horses
into Australia have been in place for many decades. These protocols were
for example a major focus of renewed attention in the context of the
equestrian events at the 2002 Sydney Olympic Games and for the movement of
foreign horses for events such as the Melbourne Cup, one of Australia's
premier thoroughbred racing events.
Prior to the entry of the equine influenza virus into Australia, 8 Aug
2007, these protocols have been generally successful. There was a single
introduction of an exotic virus disease in 2001 when West Nile virus was
carried by an infected shuttle stallion from Canada into the Eastern Creek
quarantine station in western Sydney. The infected stallion became
seriously ill and euthanasia was considered imminent. The horse recovered
and was released from quarantine and there was no further transmission of
the virus. Such transmission would not have come from the infected stallion
since horses are considered 'dead-end' hosts for the virus. West Nile virus
is spread only by mosquitos from birds that serve as intermediate,
long-term reservoir hosts and produces encephalitis in both horses and
humans with high morbidity and high case mortality rates.
In contrast to West Nile virus, equine influenza is a self-limiting
disease. Individual horses clear the virus within 2 weeks following
infection and there is no long-term carrier status after recovery and there
are no known alternative or reservoir hosts. These features render equine
influenza eminently controllable and eradicable.
Equine influenza is endemic in most countries of the world with the
exceptions of South Africa, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. South Africa
has had 2 equine influenza outbreaks in recent years and Japan, prior to
the present outbreak, had recorded a single outbreak in 1972. The success
of South Africa and Japan in eradicating equine influneza is the path that
Australia should pursue until the last case.
There is still uncertainty about the events that allowed the introduction
of equine influenza virus into Australia. It seems that there may have been
a series of departures from generally accepted quarantine protocols. A
first matter to be explained are the circumstances that allowed the
introduction of equine influenza into Japan prior to 8 Aug 2007 where it
remained undetected until 15 Aug 2007. The outbreak in Japan has been
extensive with more than 1000 horses infected and has caused major economic
losses. The vaccination status of the Japanese horses that have been
infected is a matter of interest.
It is notable that the first diagnosis of equine influenza in Japan was one
week after the horses left Japan for Australia. There are important matters
for enquiry here. Pre-embarkation protocols for horses travelling to Japan
and to Australia should have guaranteed that no equine influenza virus
could enter either country and similarly post-arrival quarantine protocols
should have guaranteed that if the virus did enter it should not have
escaped to the general horse populations in either country.
A 2nd series of post-embarkation events appears to have allowed the
transmission of equine influenza virus from one of 13 stallions from Japan
to other horses in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Currently there
are 1183 infected premises in NSW and more than 120 infected premises in
Queensland. These numbers are rising gradually on a daily basis and are
expected to continue to increase in the coming weeks. The good news is that
all of the new infected premises so far are located within presently
defined control areas.
We generally think of influenza as being transmitted from animal to animal
via coughs and sneezes. What may emerge, as a special feature of the
Australian experience is that it was not horse movement per se that
transmitted the virus at critical points but movement of humans and
fomites. Fomites are any inanimate object on which the virus may be
conveyed and include nasal discharges, riding equipment, horses trailers
and many dozens of other items.
The equine influenza outbreak in Australia has created one of the most
significant animal disease emergencies in Australian history. The
Australian response to the outbreak has been remarkable and effective. The
Internet sites set up by the Commonwealth and the States -- particularly
the NSW Department of Primary Industries site -- provide an extraordinary
example of disease control in a modern age. These sites, preserved, will
provide a valuable record of the events and a wonderful teaching resource
for a next generation of students and for all involved in the control of
infectious diseases.
For those countries that accept equine influenza as an endemic disease the
annual costs of living with the disease are very high. Cancelled race
meetings and other equestrian events, lost performance days, treatment and
vaccine costs and in the case of Australia an imposition of restrictions on
the movement of horses to other countries including New Zealand. The
strategic use of equine influenza virus vaccine for restricted populations
at risk may be approved as an interim measure.
Widespread use of vaccine, should it become necessary, will complicate and
prolong efforts to control and eradicate equine influenza and hence should
be an almost last resort action. It is likely that all the shuttle
stallions that left Japan for Australia were vaccinated and that
vaccinations were current. Vaccination presumably masked the overt clinical
presence of equine influenza virus in those horses. It would be of interest
to know more about the detail of the events in Japan and these events like
those in Australia should be the subject of considerable further formal and
independent enquiry.
If the current, highly coordinated efforts to identify all infected
premises in Australia and restrict movements of all horses can be sustained
and there is continuing strong support and full cooperation from all
involved with the industry, particularly from all horse owners, we should
be able to achieve eradication.
The challenge for Australia is to eradicate equine influenza and restore
the equine influenza-free status that existed before the present introduction.

[ProMED-mail welcomes Professor Studdert's comments on the origin and
transmission of the virus responsible for the current outbreak of equine
influenza in New South Wales and Queensland, and the prospects for its
control and eradication. Perhaps a Japanese correspondent might wish to
comment on some of the issues discussed by Professor Studdert?
The 1st outbreak of equine influenza was recorded in Central Europe in
1956, and subsequently in the United States, and attributed to infection
with an influenza A (H7N7) virus. A 2nd influenza virus, influenza A
(H3N8), was found to be associated with equine influenza in the United
States in 1963. Subsequently the disease has been reported in horses,
donkeys and mules throughout the world, with the exception of Australasia
and Iceland until recently. Recent outbreaks have been caused predominantly
by H3N8 virus, and control by vaccination is effective since in general
little antigenic drift has been observed. - Mod.CP]
