Highlights
------
-The Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) was reconvened on 30 Jan [2020]. WHO declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The Emergency Committee has provided advice to WHO, to the People's Republic of China, to all countries, and to the global community on measures to control this outbreak. The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk.
- Today, the 1st 2 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease were reported in Italy; both had travel history to Wuhan City.
- WHO's Risk Communication Team has launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN). EPI-WIN will use a series of amplifiers to share tailored information for specific target groups. EPI-WIN began this week to establish connections to healthcare and travel and tourism sectors and will work with food and agriculture and business/employer sectors next week.

The Italy Ministry of Health declared a state of health emergency today (computer translated) over the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The decision, made by the Council of Ministers, was made immediately after WHO declared the public health emergency of international concern Thursday [30 Jan 2020].

"In light of the WHO international emergency declaration, we have activated the precautionary regulatory instruments provided in our country in these cases, as already happened in 2003 on the occasion of the SARS infection", according to Minister of Health Roberto Speranza. "On the new coronavirus . . . we want to give a message of absolute serenity. The National Health Service is very strong; we have chosen from the beginning to have a level of attention that is the highest in Europe. Right now, we are the only country that has broken off connections with China. WHO has publicly acknowledged that we are the ones with the highest level of vigilance and safeguarding [of] people."

On Thursday [30 Jan 2020], Italy reported the 1st 2 confirmed cases of infection in 2 Chinese tourists, currently hospitalized, in isolation, at the Lazzaro Spallanzani reference center in Rome.

After the cases confirmed in Italy on 30 Jan [2020], the Italian government has deemed it appropriate to terminate the connections with China.

Russia announced the 1st 2 cases of the novel coronavirus on its territory and imposed sweeping new measures to prevent the spread of the deadly new strain.

Two Chinese nationals were diagnosed with the virus in the Siberian regions of Tyumen and Zabaikalsky Krai, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova told reporters at a briefing in Moscow Friday [31 Jan 2020]. "They are under strict supervision, isolated, and are receiving the necessary help," she said.

Russia is canceling nearly 200 flights to China, while maintaining 4 routes from Moscow. The national airline Aeroflot will offer services to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, and 4 Chinese airlines will continue routes to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, she said.

Russia will also close its border with Mongolia to Chinese citizens from midnight local time. Plans are also being made to evacuate as many as 641 Russian citizens from China's Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province; they will be held in quarantine for 14 days, she said. The quarantine rules will also apply to Chinese and Belarusian nationals with permanent residency who arrive from China.

Russia's 1st confirmed illnesses from coronavirus emerged even as the government of the country of nearly 147 million people has tightened restrictions on travel from China. The deadly illness has infected nearly 10 000 people around the globe, while Russia, the US, and Japan advised citizens to avoid traveling to China.

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered a ban from 31 Jan 2020 on people crossing Russia's border with China, which stretches for 4209 km (2615 mi), though freight continues to flow. Golikova said the Kremlin is also considering a temporary ban on working visas to Chinese nationals.

The infected people, who arrived in Russia earlier this week, are in stable condition without fever, and the illness isn't at risk of spreading, Anna Popova, the head of Russia's public health watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, said at the same briefing Friday [31 Jan 2020].

A decision on whether to cancel a flagship economic forum in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi next month [February 2020] will be taken on Monday [3 Feb 2020], Golikova said.

Russia has positioned itself in recent years as a key airline hub connecting Europe and China, with Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport reporting that it ranked 2nd behind Beijing in passenger traffic as of 2018.

The Association of Tour Operators of Russia has said the ban on group tours from China could cost local travel agencies $100 million in the 1st quarter of this year [2020]. China is the biggest source of tourists to Russia, accounting for 1.3 million visitors in the 1st 9 months of 2019.

British health officials said Friday [31 Jan 2020] 2 people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, in the country's 1st confirmed cases since the deadly outbreak emerged in China and began to spread globally this month.

"We can confirm that 2 patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus," Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said in a statement. "The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection-control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus," he added, referring to the National Health Service.

Whitty said the state-funded NHS was "extremely well prepared," and officials were "working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had to prevent further spread."

"We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus, and we have robust infection-control measures in place to respond immediately," he added.

The SARS-like virus epidemic, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has so far killed 213 people and spread to at least 18 countries around the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday [30 Jan 2020] declared it an international public health emergency.

Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, has been subject to an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further. Thousands of foreigners were among millions of people confined in the metropolis, and numerous countries have begun airlifting their citizens out.

A plane chartered by Britain to evacuate its citizens and other foreign nationals on Friday [31 Jan 2020] departed the city with 110 people aboard: 83 Britons and 27 foreigners. It will land at an air force base in central England at around 1:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) local time, with returning Britons to be isolated for 14 days at a medical facility in the northwest of England.

It is understood the newly confirmed cases of the virus in Britain are not located in that region. UK health officials declined to reveal where they had occurred, citing patient confidentiality.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/30/coronavirus-state-dept-lets-non-emergency-employees-leave-beijing-embassy.html


The State Department on Thursday [30 Jan 2020] authorized a departure of all non-emergency government employees from the US Embassy in Beijing, along with their family members, as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread.

The authorization also extends to US consulates general stationed in the Chinese cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang, according to a State Department official.

"The Department of State made the decision to put the US Embassy and Consulates General on authorized departure status out of an abundance of caution related to logistical disruptions stemming from restricted transportation and availability of appropriate healthcare related to the novel coronavirus," the State Department said in a statement.

Both the US Embassy and Consulates General will continue to provide consular services across China, as resources allow, the State Department said.

The authorization, which is not an order to leave the country, came just after the World Health Organization declared the spread of the virus a global health emergency.

Since 1st emerging about a month ago, the virus has infected more than 8200 people, killed at least 171 people in China, and spread to at least 18 other countries, including the United States.

Earlier Thursday [30 Jan 2020], the United States confirmed its 1st case of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Almost 2 dozen other patients are being monitored for possible infections in Illinois.

Multiple people have contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission outside of China, according to a WHO official.

Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to China.

The State Department on Monday [27 Jan 2020] also raised its travel advisory for China from level 2 to level 3, asking Americans to "reconsider travel to China due to the novel coronavirus."

Travel advisory
----------------
Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus 1st identified in Wuhan, China. On 30 Jan [2020], the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.

Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential US government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus.

In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country. On 23 Jan 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning for all of China.

[7] Impact of 2019-nCoV
Date: Wed 29 Jan 2020
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-29/viral-sweet-spot-raises-fears-coronavirus-will-be-hard-to-stop


Ebola kills half of the people who get it. China's last worrying viral outbreak, SARS, killed 10%. The new coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan appears far less fatal, with about 2% of the 6000 confirmed cases dying. For many, the illness is about as serious as a cold or flu.

That seems like good news, but it's exactly what worries the scientists and public health experts who study infectious disease ranging from the terrifying to the mundane.

"These hot viruses are very scary and very deadly, but unless they land in the middle of Heathrow Airport or another densely populated place, they aren't likely to be long-lasting," said Jennifer Rohn, head of the center for urological biology at the University College London and an expert in pandemics. "They burn fast and burn through the population. A virus needs a host to survive."

In an epidemiological twist of fate, the coronavirus's mildness may help it spread undetected until it hits the most vulnerable people. Experts are concerned that it could find a devastating "sweet spot," mild enough that some patients will go about their normal routines and spread the virus far and wide, triggering an increase in deaths. And if some patients may spread the virus when they have mild or no symptoms at all, as Chinese officials have asserted, that would undercut efforts to halt transmission.

The coronavirus has been compared to the flu, which every year infects 10 million-50 million people in the US, leaving tens of thousands of people dead, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's a mild-mannered serial killer. The aggressive response to the coronavirus is meant to stop the new pathogen from becoming a deadlier copycat.

"A relatively mild virus can cause a lot of damage if a lot of people get it," Michael Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Emergencies Programme, said at a briefing Wednesday [29 Jan 2020]. "A virus needs a host to survive."

Behind the decisions to lock down travel for tens of millions in China, isolate suspected cases, and put the public and health workers on high alert is a simple but worrying piece of math: If the new coronavirus somehow were to infect 60 million Americans as the swine flu did in 2009 and 2010, but with the same 2% death rate reported in China for the new virus, it could kill over 1 million people.

"Even if only 1% of people who are infected die, if it can spread globally, that will be a lot of people," said Christian Althaus, a computational epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.

So far, the vast majority of the 6000 global cases of the new coronavirus, known for now as 2019-nCov, have been contained to China.

But the disease has spread inside the world's most populous nation, a major hub of travel and trade for the region, with cases emerging in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere. There are early reports of spread in other countries, as well. Four people in Germany were infected by a coworker visiting from China who didn't get sick until her plane ride back. In Viet Nam, a Chinese man from Wuhan spread the disease to his son there during a visit to the country, during a trip where the infected family traveled around the country on planes, trains, and taxis.

Inside China, the actual case count may be far higher than has been reported. One estimate says the number of infections may have hit more than 26 000 by 28 Jan [2020], according to research from Jinan University published in the biology preprint website, BioRxiv.

Within China, "what the numbers are telling us is this is a very serious situation, and the virus is spreading in a very concerning way," said Michael Olsterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. So far, it appears "it is going to be much more difficult to control than SARS."

Viruses are more or less helpless on their own. Without a living thing to make their home, they can't reproduce and spread. Often, that host may be an animal, and the virus makes the jump into people who come into contact with a natural reservoir of the disease.

When an outbreak happens, isolating people isolates the virus. Hospital gowns and masks stop it from spreading through the air or in bodily fluids. Quarantines keep sick people away from new, healthy hosts. The perfect virus makes people sick enough to spread -- sneezing up droplets of germ-laden mist into the air, or leaving a thin residue from a wiped nose on a subway pole -- without making them so sick or killing them so quickly that they never get the chance to pass it on.

"There is definitely a sweet spot," said Rohn, the University College London pandemic expert. "The minute you run out of people, it's game over for that virus. It's a balance the virus needs to strike."

Coronaviruses were long thought to mostly cause cold-like symptoms in humans. But in 2002 and 2003, the coronavirus SARS caused more than 8000 cases and killed around 800 after it emerged in southern China, a roughly 10% mortality rate. In part because most cases were severe and easily recognized, it was contained within months, despite an initial period of uncontained spread because of China's slow response.

"Public health controlled SARS because SARS let it, because you could recognize and isolate disease," said Mark Denison, director of infectious diseases and pediatrics professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who has studied antiviral drugs against coronaviruses. Health authorities have noted that the latest outbreak's death rate, now around 2%, may drop as more mild cases are discovered.

In 2009 and 2010, another new pathogen, the H1N1 "swine flu" virus, raced around the world like wildfire. It eventually infected nearly 61 million Americans, though it was so mild that many didn't know they had it. It still caused more than 12 000 deaths in the US, a number that's actually lower than what is normally seen during a typical flu season.

"We are still trying to figure out where this is on the spectrum between SARS, where the vast majority of transmission occurs from very sick people, to something like influenza," said Julie Gerberding, who was the director of the CDC during the SARS outbreak and now works as the chief patient officer at Merck & Co. "This is probably somewhere in between those 2 extremes, but where it's going to fall is a little bit too early to say. That pertains to the mortality figures as well."

In the coronavirus outbreak, more than 1/5 of confirmed patients have developed serious illnesses, according to figures from the Chinese government. Many are elderly, or have underlying health conditions, that put them more at risk. But people with milder cases may keep going to work, traveling, shopping, and spreading the virus.

"If this is a mild infection that only in rare circumstances causes pneumonia or death, many people would probably breathe a sigh of relief," said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "But it's often a trade-off. You want to have this contained."

Whatever happens with the Wuhan outbreak, it's not going to be the last time a new coronavirus emerges from bats or other animals and starts infecting people. In the last 2 decades, the world has dealt with two significant Ebola outbreaks, another coronavirus disease, MERS, in the Middle East, and SARS. People will keep bumping into new viruses, ones that humans have never before encountered and to which they have no natural immunity and have developed no drugs or vaccines.

"There is every reason to believe these events are going to continue to occur," said Mark Feinberg, a former Merck vaccine executive and president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. "We need to take them very, very seriously."
