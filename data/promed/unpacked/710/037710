Officials now concede the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ may have been present in New Zealand as early as 2004.

Late last year [2018], Ministry for Primary Industries principal scientist Dr John Roche dismissed what he described as persistent "myths" surrounding the disease. One of those was that _M bovis_ 1st arrived in New Zealand around 2004. Roche rejected the possibility, saying that by using a molecular clock and culturing the bacteria, scientists were able to see the changes in the DNA of the bacteria through time.

"Massey's epidemiology team is confident on the basis of all the samples they have, that it started here between December 2015 and January 2016, and the more samples we analyse, the narrower the window," Roche said.

The evidence to the contrary was hearsay, usually from a farmer who had "really uncontrollable mastitis" more than a decade ago.

However, the government's technical advisory group released a report on Thursday (14 Feb 2019) admitting there may have been an incursion in 2004, when a 22-month-old Dexter cattle animal, born to an imported Australian dam, died of pneumonia.

Furthermore, it said in a 2nd case in 2015 that another adult cow, which died from pneumonia, had also tested positive to _M bovis_. The diagnoses had been carried out with an immunohistochemistry technique using antibodies to detect presence of the bacteria in tissue.

However, the report played down any connection with the current outbreak, although further tests were being carried out. The main thrust of the report was on the progress of eradication and the group's optimism the programme would succeed.

These 2 IHC (immunohistochemical)-positive historical cases indicate that further investigation of imported live cattle may be warranted.

"Live cattle imports from countries other than Australia ceased in the late 1990s, and there have been no importations from Australia since 2013. As imported cattle are subject to registration and permanent identification . . . it should be a straightforward task to identify properties having imported live cattle and test them and any in-contact animals if appropriate," the report said.

MPI released a statement saying the current incursion affecting New Zealand's commercial herd is not related to the possible detection of the Dexter cow on a lifestyle block in 2004.

"There are several reasons for this conclusion, most significantly the Dexter breed is unsuitable for commercial production and the animal did not have contact with any commercial cattle. In addition, a nationwide 2007 surveillance of the commercial herd did not identify any _M bovis_ cases.

"We have also conducted extensive national prevalence surveys, which have not detected any _M bovis_ outside the network of the current incursion."

The report said genetic evidence from 88 animals from 30 infected herds indicated the current outbreak was probably caused by recent entry into New Zealand from a single source (either a single border crossing of a single _M bovis_ clone or, potentially, up to 3 border crossings of 3 very closely related _M bovis_ clones from the same source).

While the source could not be identified, the strain was likely to be European.

However, these tests results came from only about 1/3 of the known infected places, either because genetic material was not recovered prior to slaughter and/or slaughter sampling was not undertaken or was unsuccessful.

Principal consultant at AgriFood Systems Keith Woodford has maintained that _M bovis_ arrived in New Zealand perhaps a decade ago. He has maintained that the disease has been in New Zealand since before 2015, most likely between 2008-2013.

[Any cattle person who has experienced _M.bovis_ will likely find it easier to believe the disease has been there for some time, as the disease is virtually impossible to eliminate.

As any regulator will tell you, pouring enough money, energy, and time into a disease will have an impact on the disease.

The ones caught in the middle of these 2 somewhat divergent points of view are the folks who own the cattle, as well as the taxpayers who are paying for the testing and slaughtering of affected animals. The animal owner is likely not getting anywhere near what was invested in the animal or what he should make, which puts the animal owner between the proverbial rock and hard place for keeping his operation afloat, so to speak.

Determining when the disease entered the country, if it is really possible to make such a determination, may lend evidence to continue or discontinue the current eradication efforts. - Mod.TG
