As many as 22 people suffered from hepatitis A infection in San Ramón de Alajuela, and consequently the Health authorities closed a pizzeria in the area.

A source close to this media confirmed the existence of the cases which were detected since 13 Jan 2020. The cases were thought to be related to food consumption in that establishment 4 of patients were employees of the pizzeria.

In statements to the media La Nación, Azalea Espinoza of the Directorate of Surveillance of the Ministry of Health, said they intervened in the business, issued a closing health order, and proceeded to cleaning and disinfecting it.

[Although the eating establishment was identified as a pizzeria, pizza itself is not likely to be the vehicle of transmission as it is cooked before serving unless ingredients are added after the cooking process. It is unclear if the pizzeria employees were the source of, or just part of, the outbreak. With an incubation period averaging 28 but up to 45 days, more cases may occur.

The cases are not broken down in regard to age. In children, most cases of HAV infection are subclinical so it is likely that the cases reported were in adults. In the developing world, HAV is not reported much in adults as most children have been infected, and therefore immune to subsequent infection, by the age of 10. That outbreaks are occurring in the area suggests improvement in potable water so fewer children are infected and therefore still susceptible to HAV as adults. - Mod.LL
