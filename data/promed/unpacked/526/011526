SEOUL: Quarantine officials reported a new outbreak of a deadly animal
disease in central South Korea yesterday, bringing to 9 the number of
infected areas. The National Veterinary Quarantine and Research Service
said one cow in Hongsong, 100 km south of here, showed symptoms of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
The highly communicable disease broke out in Paju, around 20 Mar 2000 and
spread to other cattle farming areas in the western region. Officials said
the newly-infected cow might have caught the disease from cattle at a farm
only 700 meters away, slaughtered last month after showing symptoms.
South Korea has slaughtered about 400 cattle and pigs and inoculated 110
000 others. Most livestock markets were closed to prevent the further
spread of the disease. Japan also reported an outbreak in Miyazaki
prefecture (state) in mid-March, prompting it and South Korea to ban
imports of beef and pork from each other. So far, 19 cattle have been
slaughtered and cows and pigs throughout Japan were being tested on
Thursday for the disease. No new cases have been confirmed.
It was the first confirmed outbreak of FMD in Asia since the disease
virtually wiped out Taiwan's hog herd 3 years ago. Australia, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Singapore and China have banned imports of beef and pork from Japan
and South Korea. Infected cattle and pigs show a severe decline of appetite
with blisters on their hooves and mouths. The disease can kill entire herds
but cannot be passed to humans [Actually, there are reports of transmission
of FMD to humans. See Bauer, K. 1997. Foot- and-mouth disease as zoonosis.

TOKYO: Japan's Farm Ministry said on Monday it discovered a new case of
suspected FMD, but added the deadly livestock virus was limited to a small
area of southern Japan and was not spreading to other regions. The ministry
said it had found 16 head of cattle on a farm in Miyazaki prefecture
infected with what was thought to be FMD, marking the prefecture's third
suspected incidence of the disease in less than a month.
The ministry officially banned imports of beef and pork from South Korea,
effective immediately, after an outbreak of FMD there, delivering a serious
blow to that country's livestock industry. Japan is South Korea's biggest
pork export market. South Korea last Wednesday confirmed an outbreak of the
disease among cattle near the town of Paju, northwest of Seoul, based on
tests performed by the Institute of Animal Health in Britain.
Just one day earlier, Japan had confirmed its first case of the disease
since 1908 based on tests by the same institute. "The region where we made
the discoveries is a limited area in Miyazaki prefecture," Shiro Yoshimura,
director at the Agriculture Ministry's Office of International Animal
Health Affairs, told Reuters. "This is not an instance of an airborne
spread of the disease."
Yoshimura said the ministry is still trying to determine how the disease
made its way to Japanese soil, but said it is unlikely spring winds
carrying sand from China was a culprit in the outbreak -- a possibility
raised by South Korean officials. "It is very difficult to believe the
virus has been spread by 'yellow wind', although I cannot say it is
impossible," he said. "We are investigating all possible means by which the
disease may have been brought to Japan," he added.
In late March, the ministry ordered the disinfection of all imported straw
and hay arriving at Japanese ports from Taiwan, China, South Korea and
North Korea for use as feed or bedding, as a pre-emptive measure to help
contain the disease.
So far, 22 head of cattle have been destroyed in Japan, all from farms in
Miyazaki prefecture, and the 16 cattle at the third farm have been ordered
destroyed. Miyazaki prefecture and 2 neighbouring prefectures account for
about a quarter of all cattle and hogs raised in Japan.
But industry and government officials doubted the outbreak would inflict
major damage on Japan's livestock industry. "Cattle infected with the
disease have been limited to one prefecture. I believe the chances are slim
that the disease will spread throughout Japan," said an official at
Japanese feed maker Nichiwa Sangyo Co Ltd. Trade sources note the Japanese
industry exports only negligible amounts of beef and pork.
The Agriculture Ministry's Yoshimura said Japan has taken all necessary
measures since 25 Mar 2000 to keep the disease from spreading but does not
intend to call for inoculations, which do not necessarily prevent
infection. The disease is highly contagious among livestock.
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Taiwan in 1997 forced authorities
to slaughter a quarter of the island's 14 million pigs and decimated what
had been a $1.55 billion-a-year pork-export industry.
