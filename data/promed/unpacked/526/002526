Recently, in a press report the Minister of Health was quoted as saying
that since 1990, dengue has been on the rise where the infection rate
increased from 27.5 people per 100,000 to 38.2 in 1995. In 1998, the dengue
infection rate reached 120 people per 100,000.
There was an overall 42% increase in dengue-related cases, [which totalled
27,370 in 1998, compared to the previous year.
