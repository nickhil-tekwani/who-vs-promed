A second case of Anthrax has appeared in 2003 in South Dakota livestock.
Dr. Sam Holland, State Veterinarian, reports the disease has struck a
cattle ranch in Tripp County. The State Veterinarian was called on Wed 10
Sep 2003, specimens were collected, and the State Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory confirmed Anthrax on Thu 11 Sep 2003. [The outbreak] involves an
unvaccinated group of approximately 70 cow-calf pairs, with losses of 10
head, all cows.
The herd was scheduled to be immediately treated with antibiotics and
carcasses properly disposed of under the supervision of the Animal Industry
Board.
The cattle affected were being pastured approximately 10 miles Northwest of
Witten, in Tripp County in South Central South Dakota near the Nebraska border.
Producers are alerted to outbreaks so they can consult their veterinarians
and vaccinate their livestock if deemed appropriate. Dr. Holland says he
advised practicing veterinarians to be alert for Anthrax in his July
newsletter. Rendering companies have also been alerted so that carcasses
are not rendered but properly burned and buried on the farm.

[Tripp County is near the Nebraska border. For whatever reason, the disease
is rarely seen in calves. While some textbooks describe _B. anthracis_
germinating in wet, warm soils, there is very little evidence that this
does occur outside the laboratory. And any vegetative _B. anthracis_ cells
would not survive passage through the ruminant stomach and abomasum. It is
more certain that these outbreaks occur through the ingestion of spores
surviving from buried previous cases, where there had been ample
opportunity for sporulation, either because the animal carcass had been
necropsied or had been opened up by scavengers. Because a number of animals
will be incubating disease when an anthrax outbreak is diagnosed, it is
always wise to treat the whole herd with long-acting antibiotics, move them
to a separate pasture, wait for the antibiotic blood levels to drop, and
then vaccinate -- that is, a week to 10 days after treatment. If at all
possible, affected carcasses should be burnt, not buried. - Mod.MHJ]
