A fatal case of Lassa hemorrhagic fever was officially reported in Guinea by the health authorities this Monday, 17 May 2021. Given this situation and in the application of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the Ministry of Health today [17 May 2021] declared a Lassa fever epidemic in Yomou Prefecture, Nzérékoré Region, where the new Ebola epidemic started last February [2021].

"At a time when the Guinean Government is making commendable efforts for the dual response to the COVID 19 pandemic and the Ebola epidemic in Guinea, the country has just recorded a fatal case of Lassa fever in Yomou Prefecture during May 2021," the General-Doctor Rémy Lamah announced this Monday, 17 May 2021.

An investigation is underway in the villages concerned, and to date, 30 contacts have been identified and followed up on, said the Minister of Health, who emphasizes that the sample taken from the deceased index case is positive for Lassa fever after double confirmation by the Laboratories of Nzérékoré and that of hemorrhagic fevers of Conakry.

Faced with this emergency, the Ministry of Health has taken urgent measures to include:
- sensitization of the population and health services on universal infection prevention and control measures;
- strengthening of epidemiological surveillance; and
- management of suspected cases with ribavirin in health facilities identified for this purpose.

The Guinean government, through the Ministry of Health, calls on the national community and international partners to assist to contain the evolution of this epidemic.

[Lassa fever cases have occurred before in Guinea, although rarely. West Africa, including Guinea, is endemic for the Lassa fever virus. Although one might argue that a single case does not an epidemic make, the presence of the virus cannot be disputed. The follow-up of that fatal index case by the Ministry of Health is prudent indeed. Orientation of the population where that case occurred is an important preventive measure. Assuming that the case acquired the virus from a rodent host, keeping the household environment free of rodents is a prudent practice.
