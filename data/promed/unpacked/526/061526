Biologists at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park [Tennessee, North Carolina] have confirmed that both a tricolored and a little brown bat found in a park cave tested positive for white nose syndrome (WNS).

Previously, there was evidence of the fungus that causes WNS in a cave. Now, park managers have found bats actively affected by the disease.

White nose syndrome is a disease caused by the fungus _Geomyces destructans_ and is responsible for the deaths of millions of bats in eastern North America. It is named for a white fungus that forms on the faces of many infected bats.

While the actual cause of death due to WNS is unknown, park managers said, the disease causes bats to become restless during hibernation, moving about the cave, and burning up fat reserves or losing body water they need to survive the winter. There is no known cure for the disease.

Biologists are big fans of saving bats. They are important components of intact natural ecosystems and eat large amounts of insect pests.

The Great Smoky Mountains is home to 11 bat species, including the largest hibernating population of the endangered Indiana bat in the state of Tennessee.

Of the 11 known species that reside in the park, at least 6 of them that hibernate in park caves and mines are susceptible to WNS.

In 2009, all 16 park caves and 2 mining complexes were closed to any public entry to delay the importation of the WNS pathogen on visitor's clothing or gear. Park caves will remain closed to human access to minimize the chances of spreading the disease to other areas.

"While the confirmation of WNS in the park is not a surprise, it is still a sad day for the resource," said Smokies Superintendent Dale Ditmanson.

"By continuing to monitor bat populations in our caves and forests, we hope to minimize WNS affecting other bat habitats outside of our boundaries."

Park visitors should not handle dead bats or bats found to be acting abnormally, park managers said.

According to the National Park Service Office of Public Health, WNS does not appear to pose a threat to human health since the fungus that causes WNS only grows at temperatures well below human body temperature.

If you see a dead, sick, or injured bat within the park, call 865-436-1230; any dead, injured, or sick bats found outside of the park should be reported to state wildlife authorities.

The National Park Service says a mysterious ailment that has killed millions of bats in the eastern United States has been discovered in Maine's Acadia National Park.

Park Superintendent Sheridan Steele says he's disappointed that so-called white nose syndrome has been confirmed. The fungus is harmless to humans but is lethal to bats, which play an important role in healthy ecosystems by managing mosquitoes and other biting insects.

White nose syndrome was previously discovered elsewhere in Maine. It gets its name because infected bats have white fungus on their muzzles.

Steele says the park service is working with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the US Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center to find ways to reduce the spread in Maine's bat populations.

WNS is a disease of hibernating bats in North America and is associated with a cold-loving fungus, _Geomyces destructans_. The fungus grows on snout, ears, and wing membranes during hibernation.

The fungus was first observed in New York state in 2006, and has rapidly spread across eastern North America over the past years into New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada to the north, throughout the mid-Atlantic region into North Carolina and Alabama to the south, and as far west as Oklahoma. Information on how to help slow the spread of WNS can be found at http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/docs/apr_2009_caves_closed/white_nose_info.pdf.
