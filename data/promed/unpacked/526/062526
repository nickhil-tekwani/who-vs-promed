3rd malaria case found in Lake Worth, Palm Beach County
---------------------------------------------
Confirmation of the 3rd malaria case came Saturday, and by Monday all of
Palm Beach County was under a medical alert for mosquito-borne diseases. 6
traps west of Lake Worth and Lantana have found the malaria-carrying
_Anopheles_ mosquito -- which can travel 7 miles -- to be comparatively
rare, officials said. Only a half dozen _Anopheles_ mosquitoes have buzzed
into the traps, which can snare up to tens of thousands of mosquitoes. No
signs of them were found during the recent search for possible breeding
grounds, which focussed on the Winston Trails community after the 3rd malaria
case, Goode said. During mosquito alerts, people are advised to stay indoors
at dusk or wear insect repellent and skin-covering clothes.
When weather conditions allow, a plane dispenses microscopic pesticide
droplets of dibrom over western Palm Beach County. 6 trucks periodically
prowl the ground, pumping out ground-hugging clouds of permethrin in a 300-
foot-wide swath. 4 other trucks hit mosquito breeding areas, where workers
pour granules of bacteria [harmless to humans] to kill off mosquito larvae.
Aerial spraying can cut the adult mosquito populations by 95 percent under
ideal conditions, Bradford said. Dead-calm conditions can drop that to 25
percent.
The law prevents the county from spraying a 145 000-acre swath of the
Everglades in the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.
Trucks belching clouds of a mosquito-killing chemical were dispatched
Monday along 60 miles of roads near Lake Worth, where the 3 recent malaria
cases were concentrated, said Mosquito Control Director Ed Bradford.
Mosquito inspectors also have combed the area for weedy, stagnant-water
breeding spots favored by the _Anopheles_ mosquito -- the only potential
malaria carrier.
For now, weather has stopped a key mosquito-control tool: a DC-3 plane that
can mist up to 215 000 acres of the county in one evening with the
pesticide dibrom. Aerial spraying needs some wind to be effective. In the
largest use so far of the emergency warning system, the first of almost 500
000 phone calls went out Tuesday evening urging residents to protect
themselves against mosquito bites. The 15-second message was set to first
reach 45 000 phones between 6th Avenue South in Lake Worth to Boynton Beach
Boulevard and from the coast to U.S. 441. That zone buffers the area where 3
malaria victims live. The county's automatic calling system will continue
contacting people during the evening for the next 9 days.

[The source of infection has still not been identified. The incubation period
for _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria is usually 12-17 days, but may be longer. It
is still a possibility that the 3rd patient was infected at the same time and
place as the first 2 patients. - Mod.EP]
