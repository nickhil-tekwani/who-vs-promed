After nearly a country-wide measles epidemic left more than 500
people dead, International Medical Corps (IMC) joined forces with
other global donors and organizations to help support Zimbabwe's
Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) in launching a
nationwide immunization campaign and survey of affected areas. The
initiative was a response to the recurring measles outbreak that
began in September 2009 and quickly spread to 59 of the country's 62
districts. "Nearly 10 percent of all infections were fatal," says Dr
Marco Cernuschi, public health coordinator for International Medical
Corps in Zimbabwe. "This is a figure that far exceeds the emergency
threshold for a preventable disease like measles and exemplifies the
tremendous public health needs in Zimbabwe."

The immunization campaign covered between 83 and 100 percent of
children across all provinces. However, reports of sporadic outbreaks
still exist, particularly in areas where communities resist modern
medical treatment. While MOHCW continues to investigate the causes of
the continuous outbreaks, International Medical Corps conducted a
survey in Mbire, one of the 5 districts that suffered an outbreak
just last month [September 2010].

In its assessment, International Medical Corps found major hurdles to
ongoing vaccination campaigns. Nearly all of the clinics surveyed in
Mbire, for instance, had the full complement of vaccines needed to
immunize against measles. However, International Medical Corps found
all health facilities to be dependent on gas-operated refrigerators
to maintain the cold chain for the vaccines, something many clinics
could not afford.

"Gas is an ongoing challenge for many of these facilities and,
without it, there cannot be cold chain," says Cernuschi. "For one,
there is no reliable vehicle in Mbire district to replenish gas and
then, even if there was, it would have to travel at least 200 km [124
mi] to reach the closest fueling station." Following the survey,
International Medical Corps committed to repair and supply fuel in 2
vehicles in Mbire and Mt Darwin, another of the affected districts.
"Having functional vehicles will help Ministry staff move throughout
the area to monitor the outbreak," says Cernuschi. International
Medical Corps is also assisting in the responses to measles outbreaks
that occurred this past month [September 2010] in the districts of
Mazowe, Mt Darwin, Rushinga, and Centenary.

[The estimate that nearly 10 percent of all measles infections in
Zimbabwe were fatal is exceptional and justifies the need for
continued and enhanced assistance programmes from international
organisations such as IMC.
