Arena virus outbreak, South Africa -- Update
--------------------------------------------
This updates all previous reports and includes available data as of
24 Oct 2008. An outbreak of infection due to an arenavirus was
identified in South Africa in early October 2008. A total of 5 cases
has been reported for the period 12 Sep to 24 Oct 2008.

The primary case (case 1) had onset of illness on 2 Sep 2008. An
additional 3 secondary cases (case 2, 3 and 4) and 1 tertiary case
(case 5) have been confirmed to have an arenavirus infection by
laboratory testing. The primary case and 3 secondary cases have died.
The tertiary case is currently hospitalized. Ages of cases ranged
from 33 to 47 years. 4 cases were female and 1 male. The source of
infection is, as yet, unknown for the primary case. The other 4 cases
all had potential exposure to blood and/or body fluids of a primary
or secondary case in the health-care setting.

The primary case was a safari booking agent resident in Zambia. The
patient was flown to South Africa for medical care in a critically
ill condition on 12 Sep 2008, and died on 14 Sep 2008. Case 2 was a
paramedic who cared for case 1 during the transfer from Zambia on 12
Sep 2008 and case 3 was a nurse who cared for case 1 in the intensive
care unit from 12-14 Sep 2008. Case 2 was admitted on 27 Sep 2008 and
died on 2 Oct 2008 and case 3 was admitted on 30 Sep 2008 and died on
5 Oct 2008. On 14 Sep 2008, case 4 performed terminal cleaning of the
room in which case 1 was hospitalized. The 5th patient is a nurse who
cared for case 2 from 27 Sep 2008 to 2 Oct 2008. She became ill on 9
Oct 2008 and is currently critical but stable. Ribavirin has been
used for treatment in this case based on good evidence of efficacy in
patients with Lassa fever (an arenavirus infection). The estimated
incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset) in
secondary and tertiary cases ranges from 7 to 13 days. In 4 patients
who died, the interval from onset of illness to death ranged from 9
to 12 days (Figure 1).

Only limited clinical data are currently available for case 4, who
presented late in the course of illness with bleeding and confusion
and died soon thereafter. Clinical features of the remaining 4 cases,
for which more clinical data were available, are presented. All
patients presented initially with a non-specific flu-like illness
with symptoms of fever,headache and myalgia. The illness increased in
severity over 7 days with all 4 patients developing diarrhoea and
pharyngitis during the course of illness. A morbiliform rash on the
face and trunk was reported in 4 cases on day 6 - 8 of illness.
Facial swelling occurred in 3 patients. There appeared to be an
initial clinical improvement after hospital admission in 3 patients,
followed by clinical deterioration. Sudden and rapid deterioration
with respiratory distress, neurological signs and circulatory
collapse were terminal features in all patients who died. Bleeding
was not a prominent feature. However, one patient had a petechial
rash and another had oozing of blood from venepuncture sites. Chest
pain was reported in case 1.

At the time of admission all patients had thrombocytopenia (range:
42-104 X109/L). Liver transaminases (AST and ALT) were available for
4 of 5 cases and were variable at the time of admission, however all
4 patients had raised AST and ALT during the course of their illness.
Leucopenia was present on admission in 2 patients and 3 patients had
a normal white blood cell count on admission. 4 patients subsequently
developed leucocytosis during the course of hospitalisation. All
contacts (family members, friends and healthcare staff) are being
monitored with twice daily temperature measurements for a period of
21 days after the last exposure to a known case. In addition, safe
burial of the deceased has been supervised by environmental health
officers. Full personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation
precautions as per VHF protocols have been instituted.

The causative agent in this outbreak was initially identified as an
Old World arenavirus by immunohistochemical tests performed at the
Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA, and on autopsy liver and skin
samples taken with biopsy needles and skin punches in the Special
Pathogens Unit of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases,
National Health Laboratory Service, Sandringham (SPU-NICD/ NHLS),
South Africa, from cases 2 and 3 on 9 Oct 2008 under biosafety level
4 laboratory conditions. Subsequently, infection with an Old World
arenavirus has been confirmed in all 5 cases by positive PCR results
and virus isolation by SPUNICD/ NHLS and CDC. Analysis of sequencing
data generated at SPU-NICD/NHLS, Columbia University, New York, and
CDC, Atlanta appears to indicate that the current outbreak is caused
by a unique Old World arenavirus.

There are currently no additional suspected cases. The outbreak
appears to be contained and has been confined to individuals with
very close contact in a health-care setting. Monitoring of contacts,
active case finding and investigation and management of suspected
cases will continue as needed. Further characterization of the
causative agent is under way and investigation into the source of
infection in the primary case is required. Additional studies to
determine whether mild/asymptomatic infection occurred amongst close
contacts and other exposed individuals would be essential in better
characterizing the extent of this outbreak and clinical spectrum of disease.

Arenaviruses are a family of enveloped negative sense single-stranded
RNA viruses. Members of the family are parasites of rodents, in which
they establish chronic renal infection. High titres of virus are
present in rodent urine, which can contaminate human food or house
dust. Exposed humans may become infected as accidental hosts. The
prototype of the family is lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus
and infection of humans with this virus may present as an
influenza-like illness, aseptic meningitis or severe
meningo-encephalomyelitis. Arenaviruses which cause a haemorrhagic
fever syndrome are well documented in South America (New World
arenaviruses, including Junin, Machupo, Sabia and Guanarito viruses).
The so-called Old World arenaviruses include LCM which in fact has a
worldwide distribution, and Lassa fever virus which affects up to 500
000 people annually in West Africa, specifically in Nigeria, Sierra
Leone, Liberia and Guinea, but the virus is suspected to be more
widely distributed in that region.

The clinical spectrum of Lassa fever virus infection ranges from
inapparent, through mild febrile illness to fulminant haemorrhagic
disease, and mortality rates vary from 1-2 percent among cases in the
community at large, through 20 percent among hospitalized patients,
to >40 percent in nosocomial outbreaks. The multimammate mouse
(_Mastomys natalensis_), which is the most important host of Lassa
fever virus, has a distribution extending from West Africa across to
East Africa and from there southwards to the northeasterncorner of
South Africa. Its distribution overlaps with that of other Mastomys
species, and arenaviruses have been found in southern African rodents
in the past, but there has been no previous association of these
viruses with human disease despite sustained monitoring. Preliminary
testing indicates that the virus associated with the present
nosocomial disease outbreak is a distinct new member of the family.

[This update provides a definitive account of the recent outbreak of
arenavirus-associated disease in South Africa. A primary case (case
1) had onset of illness on 2 Sep 2008. An additional 3 secondary
cases (case 2, 3 and 4) and 1 tertiary case (case 5) have been
confirmed to have an arenavirus infection by laboratory testing. Case
5 (not previously reported) is a nurse who cared for case 2 from 27
Sep 2008 to 2 Oct 2008. She became ill on 9 Oct 2008 and is currently
critical but stable. Cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 did not survive infection.

Infection with an Old World arenavirus has been confirmed in all 5
cases by positive PCR results and virus isolation by SPUNICD/ NHLS
and CDC. Analysis of sequencing data generated at SPU-NICD/NHLS,
Columbia University, New York, and CDC, Atlanta, appears to indicate
that the current outbreak is caused by a unique Old World arenavirus.

There are currently no additional suspected cases. The outbreak
appears to be contained and has been confined to individuals with
very close contact in a health-care setting. Monitoring of contacts,
active case finding and investigation and management of suspected
cases are continuing. Further characterization of the causative agent
is under way, as is investigation into the source of infection in the
primary case.
