Raw milk, raw skim milk (non-fat), raw cream, and raw butter produced by Organic Pastures Dairy of Fresno County is the subject of a statewide recall and quarantine order announced by California State Veterinarian Dr Annette Whiteford. The quarantine order came following the confirmed detection of _Campylobacter_ bacteria in raw cream. Consumers are strongly urged to dispose of any Organic Pastures products of these types remaining in their refrigerators, and retailers are to pull those products immediately from their shelves.

From January through April 2012, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reports that at least 10 people with campylobacteriosis were identified throughout California and reported consuming Organic Pastures raw milk prior to illness onset. Their median age is 11.5 years, with 6 under 18. The age range is 9 months to 38 years. They are residents of Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Clara counties. None of the patients have been hospitalized, and there have been no deaths.

According to CDPH, symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Most people with campylobacteriosis recover completely. Illness usually occurs 2 to 5 days after exposure and lasts about a week. The illness is usually mild and some people with campylobacteriosis have no symptoms at all. However, in some persons with compromised immune systems, it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection. A small percentage of people may have joint pain and swelling after infection. In addition, a rare disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes weakness and paralysis can occur several weeks after the initial illness.

[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2kcT. The counties mentioned can be seen on the map at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/california.shtml. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

[It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw milk packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate commerce). But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the state (intrastate), and some states, such as Pennsylvania, allow it to be sold. This means that in some states, dairy operations may sell it to local retail food stores or to consumers directly from the farm or at agricultural fairs or other community events, depending on the state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people have tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing," or "cow leasing." They pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in exchange for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the milk since they are part owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned cow-leasing programs after 75 people became infected with _Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized milk obtained through such a program.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk ingestion. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with raw milk ingestion. - Mod.LL]
