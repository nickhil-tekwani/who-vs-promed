The postmortem of the tusker [juvenile] found dead on [Fri 23 Dec 2016] in the Madukkarai forest range [Tamil Nadu] revealed that it died of anthrax. The autopsy was held on [Sat 24 Dec 2016].

Chances are high that it caught the disease from cattle, said Coimbatore DFO [District Forest Officer] S Ramasubramaniam. However, he ruled out the possibility of anthrax spreading to other wild elephants, as anthrax is self-limiting, unlike foot-and-mouth disease. "We suspect that the elephant had migrated from Kerala," he added.

As the postmortem of a male elephant found dead in the Madukkarai forest range revealed that it had died of anthrax, Animal Husbandry Department officials, with help from the Forest Department, vaccinated a number of cattle in Nallur Vayal and Alandurai areas on [Sun 25 Dec 2016].

The elephant, a tusker, was dead near Karunya Nagar in Kombuthooki Amman Koil forest beat.

Chances of anthrax spreading to cattle being high, a team led by Alandurai veterinarian Dr S Vennila, with help from forester SM Sasi and forest guard Chola Mannan, vaccinated about 50 cattle on Sunday morning [25 Dec 2016]. On [Mon 26 Dec 2016], a vaccination drive would be conducted in Sadayandikoil village. "We are concentrating on the surroundings of Alandurai in view of the wild elephant death's there. Though it is not a panic situation, we are vaccinating the cattle as a precaution," said a senior official with Animal Husbandry Department.

Meanwhile, Forest staff have asked local farmers to bring their cattle for vaccination on [Mon 26 Dec 2016] to the local veterinary hospital and instructed them not to let their cattle graze in the Kombuthooki Amman Koil forest area.

[Madukkarai is a suburb of Coimbatore city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the gateway to Coimbatore city from Kerala State and is located around 12 km (7.5 mi) from the Kerala border. The park thus lies between Coimbatore and Kerala state on the north west border of Tamil Nadu (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madukkarai).

Anthrax outbreaks in Kerala are reported sporadically. On the ground, situations either side of a border tend to be adequately known through professional chat and gossip. Young animals tend to be very curious and blood has a smell and a salty taste, which makes it attractive, and thus a real risk. And vaccinating the livestock proximate to where this elephant was also makes sense. And in working the cattle, information is shared, and if any cattle had suddenly died the veterinarians get told. One of the attractions of being a veterinary field officer is the informal interactions with the locals. - Mod.MHJ
