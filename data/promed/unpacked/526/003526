Officials have new concerns Tuesday night [8 Sep 2015] about whooping cough in the Tri-State [Cincinnati tri-state area includes Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana]. The number of cases confirmed compared to just a year ago was way up, especially in northern Kentucky. Those cases were reported in both children and adults, but public health experts were especially concerned those infected will transmit the virus to babies.

Local 12 News got a report from the northern Kentucky Health Department that said compared to a year ago at the same time, there were 2 confirmed cases reported. In 2015 already in August, there were 9.

This was a big concern for those who were pregnant or taking care of young children. Local 12 News spent the day in the maternity ward at Saint Elizabeth Healthcare in Edgewood [Kentucky] to share more on what they want every new mom to know. Christina Rust, education specialist at Saint Elizabeth Healthcare, said, "By immunizing the mother during her pregnancy she can pass those antibodies on to the baby." Whooping cough is a respiratory infection which can cause serious complications. Pertussis is fatal in most cases for babies under 3 months of age. So those around [the newborn baby] must get the pertussis vaccine so whooping cough can't be transmitted to [the newborn] from someone else. "That's called a cocoon. So we are making a cocoon of immunized moms, dads, uncles, aunts around the baby," said Rust.

Adults only need to have that vaccine once and it will protect them and those around them. A quick reminder for everyone as this starts to circulate and children go back to school; hand-washing is the best defense. Whooping cough is highly contagious. The initial symptoms of whooping cough are a lot like the common cold but if parents hear that "hoop" sound they need to seek medical attention for them or anyone around them. Doctors are on high alert to diagnose this infection and are being asked to recommend the vaccine for anyone who has not had it between the ages of 10 and 60. The CDC recommended a booster vaccine called T-dap for children, at age 11 or 12. As well as for all adolescents and adults who did not receive the vaccine as a preteen. This vaccine helps to prevent whooping cough, as well as tetanus and diphtheria.

[The pertussis immunization recommendations given in the news report above are incomplete. The following is recommended by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/recs-summary.htm):

Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during EACH pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Tdap should be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should also receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML
