Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 35
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 3 Oct 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the
country's 69th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case is a 21-year-old female from East Java Province. She developed
symptoms on 19 Sep 2006 and was hospitalized on 25 Sep 2006. She remains
hospitalized.
She is the sister of a confirmed H5N1 case, an 11-year-old male who died on
18 Sep 2006. Following that fatal case, health authorities initiated
contact tracing, and on 24 Sep 2006, they received reports of symptoms in
the sister. In line with the national protocol, she was immediately given
the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, and isolated in hospital.
The source of her infection is presently under investigation. Poultry
deaths in the family's household were noted both before and during the
illness of the brother. The woman was likely exposed to these poultry as
well as to her brother.
Of the 69 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 52 have been fatal.

[This is the official WHO statement confirming the 69th case of H5N1 avian
influenza in Indonesia (described previously in Avian influenza, human
(157): Indonesia 20060929.2797 and Avian influenza, human (156): Indonesia
20060928.2777, with the supplementary information that the patient received
oseltamivir treatment on admission to hospital and survives. That the
11-year-old brother of this 21-year-old woman had died as a result of avian
influenza virus infection prior to her hospitalization suggests
transmission of infection from infected poultry rather than from
person-to-person. - Mod.CP]
