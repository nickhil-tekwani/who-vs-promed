Health experts are baffled by New Zealand's accelerating rates of
legionellosis -- the disease commonly known as legionnaires' disease.

A recently released report -- prepared for the Health Ministry --
revealed a 141 per cent rise in the number of cases of the illness
reported between 2009 and 2010.

Historically the pneumonia-like infection has been caught by inhaling
potting mix or exposure to contaminated water in plumbing systems, air
conditioning units, or cooling towers. Of 178 reported cases of the
disease in 2010 there were 5 related deaths and 136 hospitalisations.
The disease has continued to develop with 89 cases reported during the
1st 6 months of this year [2011]. At the same time last year [2010] 63
cases had been reported.

Symptoms included muscle aches, headache, tiredness, chills, shortness
of breath, loss of appetite, coughing, and stomach pain.

Public health physician and University of Otago associate professor
Michael Baker said he was surprised by the report's findings. "I'm a
bit perplexed," he said. "There certainly is a big jump in 2010. It
appears to be accelerating in the 1st 6 months of this year [2011] and
requires more investigation."

Smokers and the elderly have a higher chance of contracting the
disease, but the data did not strongly support this pattern, Dr Baker
said. The report was prepared by the Institute of Environmental
Science and Research -- the principal science advisor to the ministry.
Institute communicable disease scientist David Harte said he could not
pinpoint any clear rationale for the rise, but a possibility could be
global warming. "We don't know the reason for the increase. We are
still trying to work that one out. [It may be] simply due to warmer
weather -- or other seasonal factors we don't understand. Warm, humid
weather will allow legionellosis to multiply and survive but we
haven't got any hard evidence that this results in an increased
incidence of the disease." The disease could not spread between
people.

Patients became "accidental hosts" after being exposed to a
contaminated environmental source, commonly compost or cooling towers,
Mr Harte said. The Public Health Service recorded that 80 per cent of
patients in 2010 had previously come in contact with compost or
potting mix. Although compost and potting mix were the most recognised
source of the disease, tests on the patients' leftover compost
sometimes showed no sign of the guilty bacteria, Mr Harte said.

"Occasionally when we test the [patient's] compost we don't find
anything there, which suggests another environmental source." While
compost and potting mix posed a real risk and health warnings on the
products were not mandatory. Many suppliers labelled their product but
were often vague about the associated dangers, Mr Harte said. The
simplest way for gardeners to protect themselves was to wear a mask.
"Some labelling is a bit misleading. No one wants to sell a product
that says it is a health hazard -- that's not a good marketing ploy.

"The common transmission route for the disease is breathing in dust or
water aerosols contaminated with the bacteria. A face mask is a simple
way to prevent this from happening." The ministry said revised
guidelines for controlling legionellosis would be released this year
[2011]. Gardeners would be alerted of the dangers of using potting
mix, via media statements, following outbreaks, the ministry said.

Canterbury was worst hit by the disease in 2010 with 58 reported cases
but it was not an outbreak but a lower "cluster" classification, Mr
Harte said.

Although the disease was soaring, the death count was not at record
highs, and Mr Harte recommended seeing a doctor if you suspected you
were hosting the disease.

"There have been years where we've had 7 or 8 deaths. The death rates
are usually higher if there has been no medical intervention. We get
people who get sick and don't go to the doctor."

[ProMED-mail reported 2 outbreaks of legionellosis this year (2011) in
New Zealand, one in Marlborough and the other in Canterbury, both on
the South Island (Legionellosis - New Zealand (03): (MA) 20110530.1658, Legionellosis - New Zealand (02): (MA) 20110525.1586,
and Legionellosis - New Zealand: (CA) potting soil, alert 20110116.0189). The outbreak in Marlborough was attributed to
aerosolization of _Legionella_ from a cooling tower and the outbreak
in Canterbury was attributed to aerosolization of _Legionella_ from
potting mix and compost.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute
pneumonic form of the disease; more than 70 per cent of cases are due
to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand,
where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 per
cent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella
longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 per cent of cases (Yu VL, et al:
Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by
culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an
international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8;
http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less
severe than legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its name from
an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA.

Legionnaires' disease and presumably Pontiac fever are acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually
a building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the
contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in
groceries, fountains, and cooling towers.

However, in Australia and New Zealand, legionnaires' disease has been
associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix and compost; in
these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found in potting
mix, compost, and soil, and cultured from the respiratory specimens of
patients with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia. Cases of
community-acquired pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also have been
reported sporadically in Europe
(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497
and Legionellosis, fatal - UK (03): (Wales) 20101014.3725), the USA
(ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, potting soil - USA: May-Jun 2000 20000904.1503), and Japan (Koide M, Saito A, Okazaki M, et al:
Isolation of _Legionella longbeachae_ serogroup 1 from potting soils
in Japan. Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29(4): 943-4;
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/943.long). Non-sterilized
potting soil apparently contains a mixture of bacteria and free-living
amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic
growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley
TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J
Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).
