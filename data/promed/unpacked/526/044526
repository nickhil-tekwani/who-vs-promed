Students are most vulnerable to infection from the bacteria that cause
meningitis during their first week at college, say researchers. The
findings illustrate how important it is that students take up the offer of
vaccination against the C strain of the disease.
The government launched a campaign in September last year to vaccinate all
first year
students against meningitis C. However, a survey last month by the Primary
Care Virology Group - an independent group of GPs - found that many
students had failed to
get the jab.
Researchers from Nottingham University discovered that the proportion of
students
carrying bacterial strains of meningitis quadrupled within the first four
days of the
autumn term. The proportion of students carrying the bacteria rose from
6.9% on the first day of the autumn term to 11.2% on day two. By day four
the proportion had risen to 23.1%. In December it had reached 34.2%. It is
estimated that less than one person in 1000 who carries the meningitis
bacteria will develop the disease.
The researchers, whose study predated the launch of a mass vaccination
programme for
the C strain of the disease, found students living in catered halls were at
greatest risk. Students living in all female halls were at significantly
lower risk of acquiring the bacteria during the first term.
The researchers, whose work is published in the British Medical Journal,
studied 2500 first year Nottingham University students.
They believe the gender difference might be explained by different patterns
of social
behaviour in single sex halls. The researchers also found that the risk of
acquiring the bug was raised by: (1) going to the bar regularly; (2) going
to nightclubs; (3) smoking; (4) intimate kissing.
Lead researcher Dr Keith Neal, from the University's Department of Public
Health
Medicine and Epidemiology said vaccination was the best way to prevent
spread of the disease. But the vaccine does not protect against all forms
of the disease, and Dr Neal said it was also important that students read
up on the symptoms of the disease, as early treatment was vital.

[The UK has been experiencing an apparent increase in incidence of
meningitis caused by Group C meningococci for some time, particularly among
university students. The data presented showing a rapid rise in rates of
colonization upon matriculation are particularly interesting. The stress
associated with leaving home and living in a community environment may
contribute to susceptibility to disease, much as has been noted for
military recruits.
The original article identified the specific serogroup C strain that was
acquired most commonly after matriculation at the University as
C2aP1.5(P1.2) (21% of new colonizers). This strain is said to be of known
virulence and to have a history of association with several major outbreaks.
