The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ infections linked to contact with pig ear dog treats. _Salmonella_ strains included are Cerro, Derby, London, Infantis, Newport, Rissen, and I 4,[5],12:i:-.

As of 26 Aug 2019, a total of 143 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 35 states.

Total / 143

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 10 Jun 2015 to 30 Jul 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 90 years, with a median age of 39 years. Of the ill people, 60 (46%) are female, and of 110 ill people with information available, 33 (30%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Predicted antimicrobial resistance based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) was determined for 92 isolates: 87 from ill people and 5 from pig ears. There was no antimicrobial resistance predicted for 2 human isolates; the remaining 90 isolates had predicted resistance or decreased susceptibility to one or more of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Testing of 9 clinical isolates using standard antibacterial susceptibility testing methods by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory provided comparable results (kanamycin was not tested by this method). If antimicrobials are needed, infections related to this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medications and may require a different choice.

Investigation of the outbreak
--------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that contact with pig ear dog treats is the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal and pet food contact in the week before they became ill. Of 100 ill people, 88 (88%) reported contact with a dog before getting sick. Of 80 people with available information, 56 (70%) reported contact with pig ear treats or with dogs who were fed pig ears. Both of these proportions are significantly higher than the results from a survey of healthy people who reported contact with dogs (61%) or handling dog treats (16%), such as pig ears, in the week before interview.

Health and regulatory officials from Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and the FDA collected pig ears from ill people's homes, retail locations where ill people reported buying the products, or from suppliers and distributors to those locations. Testing identified _Salmonella_ in over 90 samples, with many different strains. A search of the CDC PulseNet database found that people had been infected with some of these strains, including _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ London, and _Salmonella_ Newport. Some of these illnesses date back to 2015. These ill people were added to the outbreak investigation. Additional _Salmonella_ serotypes Anatum, Brandenburg, Give, Livingstone, Panama, Seftenberg, Typhimurium, Uganda, and Worthington were identified. Investigators are working to determine if any human illnesses are linked to these strains.

Some of the tested pig ears were imported from Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. Some product labels indicated that the pig ears were irradiated; this process should kill _Salmonella_. _Salmonella_ identified in products labeled as irradiated indicate they may not have been irradiated or there was another issue that led to contamination.

Several firms have recalled pig ears because they might be contaminated with one or more of the outbreak strains. On 3 Jul 2019, Pet Supplies Plus recalled bulk pig ears stocked in open bins. On 26 Jul 2019, Lennox Intl Inc recalled pig ears. On 30 Jul 2019, Lennox Intl Inc expanded their recall. On 16 Aug 2019, Dog Goods USA LLC recalled bulk and packaged Chef Toby Pig Ears. On 3 Sep 2019, Dog Goods USA LLC recalled all 30-packs of Berkley & Jensen brand pig ears sold at BJ's Wholesale Club stores. These recalls do not account for all of the illnesses in this outbreak.

Information collected to date about where ill people bought pig ears has not identified a single supplier, distributor, or common brand of pig ear treats. The CDC and FDA recommend that people do not buy pig ear pet treats or feed them to dogs because they could be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people and dogs sick. The CDC and FDA recommendations may change as more information becomes available.

This investigation is ongoing. The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

Pet owners can take steps to keep their families healthy while feeding pets (https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/publications/pet-food-safety.html).

[As a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not;
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.
