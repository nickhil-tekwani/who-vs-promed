For the 1st time, scientists have explained in detail the way in which white-nose syndrome progresses as it kills bats.

A study by a team of researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Wisconsin wanted to test the hypothesis that white-nose syndrome kills bats by making them use more of their precious energy store than usual when they're hibernating.

They measured the amounts of energy used by infected vs. healthy bats in hibernation, as expressed by the bats' proportion of lean tissue to fat mass by the experiment's end. The results showed that bats infected with white-nose syndrome had higher lean-tissue-to-fat-mass ratios and were using twice as much energy during hibernation as were the healthy bats.

Worse still, the infected bats showed physiological imbalances -- such as body-wide acidification and pH imbalances and high potassium levels -- that could hinder them in areas such as normal heart function.

Another key finding the researchers made was that visible changes in the bat, such as severe damage to the wings, were indicative of later stages of the disease.

"Clinical signs are not the start of the disease; they likely reflect more advanced disease stages," said the study's lead author, University of Wisconsin and USGS National Wildlife Health Center scientist Michelle Verant.

Bat populations in North America have declined sharply in recent years due to white-nose syndrome, which is caused by the fungus _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (formerly known as _Geomyces destructans_). The fungus destroys the bat's skin in areas where there is no fur, such as its wing membranes, muzzle and ears.

The team writes that it has used its research to create a multi-stage model for how the disease progresses within bats, one that points to hypotheses that can be tested to gain a better understanding of white-nose syndrome.

"The mechanisms detailed in this model will be critical for properly timed and effective disease mitigation strategies," said Verant.

The team's findings have been published in the journal BMC Physiology http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/14/10.

[The theory -- that by the time skin lesions emerge, the disease has advanced -- makes sense and fits within the picture that when the white nose pathogen has been identified, the bats either have been dead or have begun dying. - Mod.TG]
