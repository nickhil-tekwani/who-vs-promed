Kiwifruit outbreak could be more widespread
-------------------------------------------
A kiwifruit canker outbreak in the Bay of Plenty may be more widespread
than first thought after 43 orchards supplied photographs showing symptoms
of the disease. 2 adjacent orchards have now been confirmed with
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv _actinidiae_ (PSA), and a 3rd has been
quarantined. Ministry of Agriculture & Forestry [MAF] are investigating
further samples from several orchards.

PSA has not appeared in New Zealand before. MAF has notified major markets.
Australia will continue to import the fruit, but it has suspended imports
of kiwifruit plants from New Zealand.

Craig Thompson, Opotiki Packing and Coolstorage, observed the spread of PSA
in Italy over 4 years. An outbreak there killed a quarter of a type of gold
kiwifruit vines in the Lazio region [west-central provinces], and up to
half the vines in some orchards, including one owned by New Zealanders
[ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207]. "It proved to be incredibly virulent on
gold varieties and we still don't understand why," he said. "We were too
slow and not aggressive enough with the vines we removed."

Biosecurity minister David Carter said that it was possible that the
bacteria were a latent infection which had been dormant until a cold, wet
winter had stressed vines causing symptoms to flare. "We do not know how
the disease arrived in New Zealand," he said. "It is possible that it may
have been here for some time."

David Yard, Biosecurity New Zealand, said though the strain of PSA had not
yet been identified, the industry should not simply hope it was a lesser
strain. "All of the strains are potentially pathogenic, some greater than
others. We are treating this as the worst possible situation."

He said MAF's initial aim is to eradicate this organism. Destruction of
kiwifruit orchards and the creation of a "buffer zone" is an option. "We
are working up a number of different eradication and control techniques."
It was important growers continued to prepare for the next crop, but they
should practise good hygiene such as sterilising pruning equipment, hosing
down machinery, disinfecting footwear, and washing hands.

1st record of _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ in France
---------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of France recently
informed the EPPO Secretariat of the 1st detection of _Pseudomonas
syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO Alert List) on its territory. The
bacterium was identified on 26 Jul 2010 in 5 samples of _Actinidia
deliciosa_ cv. 'Summer' (green kiwifruit) which had been collected from
Rhone-Alpes region. This outbreak concerned 4 plots of cv. 'Summer' but
similar symptoms have been observed in another plot of cv. 'Hayward' where
samples are currently being tested.

All infected plants originated from a single lot imported from a nursery of
another EPPO member country. The NPPO of this country was informed
immediately. The possible phytosanitary measures which could be taken are
currently being studied by the French NPPO. Tracing-back studies are being
carried out to determine if other plants had been imported from the
infected nursery. In addition, surveys will be conducted at the beginning
of 2011 to determine the extent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit in France.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally described in Japan
in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include
discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and
twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and
eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures
and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur
via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be
spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and
human activities), and infected planting material. Spread with infected
fruit cannot be excluded. Generally, disease management of bacterial
diseases may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to
prevent spread, and use of clean planting material and resistant crop
varieties, but specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being
developed. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in
Japan, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

It is thought that a recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post
20100414.1207) affecting 25 per cent of the Zespri Gold variety vines may
have been due to the emergence of a new strain.
