Event description
-----------------
On [9 May 2019], the Prefectural Health Directorate of Koubia, Guinea was informed of the admission of 4 suspected anthrax cases at the Prefectural Hospital located in Lab√© region in the northern part of the country. Three of the case-patients presented to the hospital with skin lesions typical of a cutaneous anthrax infection (black crusts on either face, hands, head, or neck with swelling around the affected parts). The 4th case-patient, a 2 year old boy, son to one of the 3 case-patients who presented with skin lesions, was admitted with fever, fatigue and body aches.

The 4 suspected cases, coming from the same family in the same community, reportedly developed symptoms 5 to 12 days after consuming meat from a sick goat that was slaughtered on [28 April 2019]. Half of the goat meat was sent to a neighbouring village, located 9 km [about 6 mi] from that of the case-patients. No case has been reported from the 2nd village to date. Blood specimens and/or swab samples from the skin lesions were collected from the 4 case-patients and tested at Conakry National Institute of Public Health.

One of the 4 suspected cases was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Retrospective investigation established that the index case was a 13 year old boy from the same family who developed clinical features of gastrointestinal anthrax (abdominal pain and bloating, body aches, headache, and fever) on [2 May 2019] after consuming meat from the sick goat on [28 April 2019], and who died in the community on [5 May 2019]. No biological specimen was collected.

As of [15 May 2019], a total of 5 human cases of anthrax including one death (case fatality ratio 20%) have been reported. As many as 60% (3/5) of the cases were in the age-group of 0-9 years, with a male predominance (4/5; 80%). In the same village, 2 goats were reportedly sick between [28 April and 11 May 2019]. One of them was slaughtered on [28 April 2019] and consumed by the 5 human cases before symptom onset and the other goat died on [11 May 2019]. Both animals mixed with a herd of 380 head of cattle, 174 of which (46%) were vaccinated against anthrax in January 2019.

Public health actions
---------------------
A preliminary outbreak investigation has been conducted by the Koubia prefecture health team. Active case search enabled identification of 52 community members (including 37 from the case-patients village and 15 from the 2nd village) who reportedly consumed meat or handled the carcass of the dead goat. The outbreak case definition has been finalized and is being distributed to health facilities in the affected areas.

An environmental investigation identified 2 areas in the affected village where the 2 sick goats used to graze. Burning and isolation of these areas have been approved by the prefectural veterinary services.

Case management is ongoing in the Prefectural Hospital with administration of antipyretics, antibiotics and dressing the skin lesions.

A mission intended to assess the health status of the cattle in Koubia prefecture, is being planned by the National Livestock Service with the support of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and planning for vaccination of cattle is ongoing.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
Recurrent anthrax outbreaks have been notified in Koubia prefecture in the past and the deadliest outbreak in the prefecture was reported from the same village in 2014, with 11 human deaths. Several factors may account for the recurrence of anthrax outbreaks in this locality. More than 30 pastures in this village are suspected to be contaminated with anthrax spores that can infect cattle. The poor hygiene conditions and low livestock immunization coverage could have contributed to increase the risk of transmission of the disease in animals, as well as humans.

An integrated preparedness and response contingency plan, based on a One Health approach, needs to be developed and tested to control the current outbreak and prevent future occurrence of cases in the affected and non-affected areas. Therefore, heightened animal and human health surveillance, coupled with a mass livestock vaccination campaign and environmental investigation, as well as risk communication and community engagement activities need to be implemented to avert any large outbreak.

[The disease is enzootic throughout Guinea. Koubia has had bovine anthrax outbreaks in recent years, 3 in 2012, 4 in 2014, 1 in 2015, and 3 in 2016, and 28 in 2017; 2 were reported in the 1st 6 months of 2018. Small ruminant outbreaks in Koubia were reported in 2014 (3 outbreaks with 107 cases) and 3 outbreaks in 2015 with 63 cases). Though not reported as such in this WHO report it is not unusual for cattle, goats & sheep to be affected at the same time on the same farm. For example in 2017 all 6 small ruminant outbreaks were concurrent with bovine outbreaks. Therefore any vaccination programme should involve all 3 species, if possible, with priority given to cattle.

A good map of Guinea showing the site of this outbreak is within the WHO report. Koubia is in north-central Guinea. - Mod.MHJ]
