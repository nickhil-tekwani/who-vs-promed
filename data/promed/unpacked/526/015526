AQUACULTURE ILLS
"Taura syndrome" is affecting shrimp mariculture in Ecuador, Honduras,
Panama, Japan and China, according to Jorge Calderon of the National
Aquaculture and Marine Research Center, Guayaquil, Ecuador. And it has
affected US shrimp farms (Verhovek SH. Virus imperils Texas shrimp farms:
Mysterious disease from Ecuador is moving up Gulf coast. NY Times 14 June
1995:A16).
Taura, named for a river in Ecuador, is indeed a syndrome, as three viruses
and one vibrio have been implicated (V. harveae). The aquaculture systems
themselves may be highly vulnerable to invasion. In some instances mangrove
networks are removed to create the ponds, that are then carved out of
denuded dunes adjacent to beaches. They lack vegetation to filter and
cleanse incoming water carrying nutrients and organisms, and adequate
ingresses and egresses. Many types of foodstuffs are used to feed the
shrimp, including hamburger meat. Pesticide (possibly immunosuppressive
agents) levels are high in many areas, as they are employed to prevent
plant pests on nearby banana plantations - that industry being of
equivalent economic value in Ecuador. Chloramphenicol and other
broad-spectrum antibiotics are flooded into the ponds to decrease
contamination.
The result, as the Marine Research Center on Ecuador's coast has
determined, is immunodeficient shrimp suffering from multiple opportunistic
infections (OI's). One of the suspected viral agents is a baculovirus
(insect-borne, thus transfer via insects is possible. But these
monocultures may also be vulnerable to emerging opportunistic agents.
Elsewhere (e.g., in scallop farms) rickettsial agents have emerged. Where
the shrimp farms are located inland, Ecuadorians are concerned about the
dissemination of antibiotic-resistant or insensitive (e.g., viral and
protozoan) organisms in downstream water systems.
Ecuador's shrimp exports have suffered, as have those of the other nations
mentioned - often after three or four years of high productivity. The
systems, themselves, may not be unsustainable, though more technologically
advanced and expensive systems may be more resistant. At present up to one
fifth of the 100 million metric tons of fish harvested per year are from
mari/aquaculture systems. But, as they are now, it is questionable whether
they will be able to substitute for the decline in world stocks, evident in
14 out of the world's 17 major fisheries.
