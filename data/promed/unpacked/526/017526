At least 20 cattle died in the last 2 months in Saidpur upazila, and hundreds of others were infected by a highly contagious viral disease known as lumpy skin disease (LSD).

Owners of around 100 000 domestic cattle and 300 commercial cattle farms in the upazila are now gripped by fear at the news that the LSD virus is spreading rapidly in the region, especially in Kamarpukur, Kashiram Belpukur, Khata Modhupur, Botlagari, and Bangalipur unions in Saidpur.

Rashedul Haque, upazila livestock officer in Saidpur, said they treated a minimum of 250 cattle for LSD in recent months.

Differing with the number of deaths claimed by locals, he said 9 cattle, mostly calves, died of "secondary infection" of LSD.

However, he played down the severity of the disease and blamed the deaths on weak immunity in the dead animals and wrong treatment of them by quacks.

The official claimed that after "prompt actions" taken by the livestock office, "the disease is on the decline." He also said, "Considering its severity, we've been treating infected cattle even during the [COVID-19] lockdown period in most unions of the upazila."

Contacted, Monakka Ali, district livestock officer in Nilphamari, said lumpy skin disease is a viral disease and "there is no specific vaccine available" for LSD yet [sic; There are effective vaccines - see further in the included NADIS information. -Mod.AS].

Currently, they are providing symptomatic treatments to the infected cattle, he said, adding that they also advise farmers to clean their cowsheds with bleaching power or sodium bicarbonate in order to contain the spread of the disease.

According to the official website of National Animal Disease Information Service (NADIS) in the UK, LSD is caused by infection of cattle or water buffalo with the poxvirus Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). The virus is one of 3 closely related species within the genus _Capripoxvirus_.

Transmission of LSD occurs via insect vectors, and vaccination is the most effective means of control. During the past 5 years, lumpy skin disease has spread through the Middle East into southeast Europe, the Caucasus, southwest Russia, and western Asia. The disease causes substantial losses in affected herds with significant economic consequences. It also blocks access of affected countries to lucrative export markets, compounding the financial impact of an LSD outbreak, the NADIS also said in their website.

[The upazila (sub-unit of a district) Saidpur is located in north Bangladesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saidpur_Upazila).

Bangladesh experienced its 1st ever LSD event in 2019; it started, according to the delayed notification to the OIE, mid-July 2019 and was declared as resolved on 22 Mar 2020 (last outbreak, out of a total of 4, reported as starting on 2 Sep 2019). The event's OIE summary, available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000033695_20200323_160345.pdf, is as follows:
Total outbreaks: 4 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 750 / 175 / 0 / 0 / 0

The 4 reported outbreaks were located at considerable distances from each other (map at the above summary's URL); it is assumed that there were additional, unreported outbreaks. The disease spread to North-East India. OIE's interactive map of LSD outbreaks reported globally since 1 Jan 2019 is available at https://tinyurl.com/y7v29a4y (click on Bangladesh to center, zoom in to the required resolution).

Lumpy skin disease is primarily a disease of cattle, but clinical cases have been reported in Asian water buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_) as well. It is not zoonotic.

In the absence of effective control measures, in particular vaccination, LSD is likely to become endemic. - Mod.AS
