Ref: Lindsay L, Wolter J, De Coster I, Van Damme P, Verstraeten T: A decade of norovirus disease risk among older adults in upper-middle and high income countries: a systematic review. BMC Infect Dis 2015, 15(1):425 doi:10.1186/s12879-015-1168-5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The researchers identified 39 studies from high income (HI) and upper-middle income (UMI) countries. 36 percent of publications provided risk estimates [of norovirus (NoV)-associated illness] based on laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically-linked population-based surveillance data using molecular diagnostic methods.

Over the study period, estimated annual NoV rates and extrapolated number of cases among older adults in HI and UMI countries were: 29-120/10 000 or 1.2-4.8 million NoV-associated illnesses; 18-54/10 000 or 723 000-2.2 million NoV-associated outpatient visits; 1-19/10 000 or 40 000-763 000 NoV-associated inpatient visits; 0.04-0.32/10 000 or 2000-13 000 NoV-associated deaths. NoV was responsible for approximately 10-20 percent of GE [gastroenteritis] hospitalizations and 10-15 percent of all-cause GE deaths among older adults. Older adults experienced a heightened risk of nosocomial infections. Those in LTCFs [long-term care facilities] experience frequent NoV outbreaks and the range in attack rates was 3-45 percent, case hospitalization rates 0.5-6 percent, and case fatality rates 0.3-1.6 percent.

The researchers concluded that older adults are at increased risk of severe NoV-associated health outcomes. NoV-associated hospitalization rates were higher, more severe, resulted in longer stays and incurred greater costs than for younger patients. NoV-associated mortality rates were approximately 200 percent higher among individuals 65 years and older compared to less than 5 years. The burden of NoV among older adults is expected to rise along with societal aging and increased need for institutionalized care. NoV prevention in older adults, including potential vaccination, may significantly impact risk of severe illness. Their research was published in BMC Infectious Diseases [see reference above].
