Canine rabies cases are on the increase, and the National Zoonoses
Program declared there is an epidemic (epizootic) of this infection.
In this Department (Cochabamba), the case toll increased from 4 to 36
dogs with rabies. Other Departments affected are Santa Cruz and
Chuquisaca.

An epizootic is a transmissible disease affecting animals that may
become quickly disseminated. Its equivalent in humans is epidemics.

The Ministry of health, through the National Zoonoses Program,
elaborated a situational diagnosis including strategies for preventing
further dissemination of this disease and also aiming to detect
failures which may have influenced the propagation of this condition.

According to data revealed by the National Officer of the Zoonoses
Program, Mr. Rene Alarcon-Ayala, in Cochabamba, by the 24th week of
2010, 4 cases of canine rabies had been reported, while for the same
period in this year, there are already 36 cases reported. The case
toll of canine rabies increased 9 times in Cochabamba compared to 2010
figures.

In Santa Cruz, by the 24th week of 2010, there were 13 cases
reported, and now there are 25 cases; in Chuquisaca, the case toll was
4 last year and now it is 19. In the other departments, only 4 and 2
cases had been reported, respectively. The total number of cases for
the whole country increased from 40 to 88, compared to 2010.

Mr. Alarcon declared that amongst factors influencing for the
increase in this infectious condition there are families that own up
to 5 dogs within their households, and some of the pets had not been
vaccinated; other reason for this is the increased number of dogs
living with homeless persons.

According to official figures, 1300 persons had been attacked by
dogs, but not all the animals were infected. "Just figure it out, this
represents increased health care costs and children are most
vulnerable," pointed out Mr. Alarcon.

The Ministry of Health, through Healthcare Departmental Services, had
already immunized 3327 persons against rabies. In Cochabamba, the
number of immunized persons is 815.

[The best protection for humans is to vaccinate their pets, as well
as to vaccinate any stray dogs. Education of the public on the risk
and how to protect themselves when an animal is acting strangely, is
very necessary in these early situations. - Mod.TG]
