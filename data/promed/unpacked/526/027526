Leishmaniasis outbreak in N. Darfur displaced camp
--------------------------------------------------
The health situation continues to deteriorate at the Zam Zam camp in North Darfur. An activist announced the outbreak of the 'black fever' disease (also known as kala-azar) [visceral leishmaniasis] at the site, along with a shortage of medicine.

Zam Zam's night clinic halted its operations since the beginning of January [2013] and the camp's ambulance is no longer available, as reported on Wednesday [23 Jan 2013] by Radio Dabanga. Amid the situation, a large delegation comprising elders, youth representatives and women submitted a memorandum to the ministry of health in El-Fasher.

In the document, he reaffirmed his previous statement that the arrival of displaced [persons] from East Jebel Marra is exacerbating the already critical conditions at the camp.

On a related event, the medical coordinator for the department of emergency and humanitarian action of Zam Zam said the camp's sheikhs and omdas had already informed the state's ministry of health about the problems they are experiencing.

Dr. Tarek said the ministry promised to resolve the situation in the "near future" and reopen the night clinic and the camp's pharmacy. Additionally, the doctor revealed that the director of the drugs administration assured he will coordinate efforts with health organizations in order to overcome the shortage in medicines. The director will also ensure the return of the staff of the night clinic to Zam Zam, Dr. Tarek said.

[Visceral leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Sudan. It is not a surprise that under primitive conditions with probably no or little vector control, high population density in the camps and malnutrition, that leishmaniasis will surge. Visceral leishmaniasis is a life-threathening infection without treatment and treatment is costly. - Mod.EP
