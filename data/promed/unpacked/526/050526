Brazil issues alert against orange rust infection
-------------------------------------------------
The Brazilian government issued Monday [1 Sep 2008] an alert against
_Puccinia kuehnii_, a plant pathogen that causes the most dangerous disease
of orange rust in sugarcane. According to a statement issued by the
Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, a kind of sugarcane known as RB72454 has
been proved susceptible to orange rust.

As cases of orange rust have been reported in a series of countries such as
Australia, Indonesia, the United States, and Brazil's neighboring countries
of Guatemala and Nicaragua, the production of sugar and ethanol in Brazil
now is facing a huge threat, said the government.

Brazil recommended people going to Brazil from the countries above take
precautious measures such as washing and ironing all clothes before packing
luggage and not to bringing any vegetables to Brazil. Since _Puccinia
kuehnii_ is airborne, the ministry considers an eventual infection
inevitable. However, the ministry said such precautious measure could
postpone the process, and when the next planting season comes a new type of
sugar cane is expected to be developed with better resistance to the
pathogen. Brazil currently has some 7.8 million hectares (19.28 million
acres) of sugar cane farmland.

Orange rust spreads through Central America
-------------------------------------------
The sugarcane disease, orange rust, has been found in the Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, and Panama sugarcane regions of Central America. At a recent workshop
in Colombia, BSES senior researcher Dr Kathy Braithwaite, exchanged advice
and experience on the disease.

"The disease was first found in the Western Hemisphere in Florida in July
2007, and a short time later turned up in Guatemala -- now it is becoming a
serious threat in the Americas," Dr Braithwaite said. "It is not known how
orange rust arrived in the Americas but DNA fingerprinting currently under
way may identify its origin. The disease has not yet been seen in the
Caribbean or South America but is a serious concern to those sugar
industries," she said.

Orange rust fungus naturally occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and has been
present in Australia since the 1890s. Australia had success fighting the
disease by using resistant varieties. "It was estimated that orange rust
caused direct and indirect losses of up to AUD 400 [million] [approx. USD
334 million] in Australia in 2000 and losses continued for up to 3-4 years
as growers went through the expensive exercise of replacing the highly
susceptible variety Q124. Similar losses could occur in other countries
when orange rust arrives but this will depend on the susceptibility of
their varieties and the environmental suitability for orange rust," Dr
Braithwaite said.

The international plant pathology workshop highlighted that strains of
sugarcane rust can adapt and a previously resistant sugarcane variety can
become susceptible again. This highlights the dangers of over-reliance on
one variety and the need for continual vigilance regarding the possible
reappearance of old diseases.

Rust threatening Louisiana sugarcane
------------------------------------
New sugarcane varieties are increasing yields, but diseases pose a constant
threat, farmers were told by LSU [Louisiana State University] AgCenter
researchers at a recent sugarcane field day at St Martinville, Louisiana.
Researchers told farmers that developing new varieties is an ongoing
effort. "Trying to stay one step ahead of rust is getting to be quite an
ordeal," said Ken Gravois, LSU AgCenter sugarcane breeder.

Orange rust disease affecting sugarcane was found in Florida cane fields
during 2007, Jeff Hoy, LSU AgCenter pathologist, said. Louisiana growers
could be finding it soon. "We are anticipating it is going to show up this
year [2008] or the next," Hoy said. He said preliminary variety resistance
evaluations are being conducted for orange rust in Florida.

[Orange rust of sugarcane is caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_.
Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange
to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the
lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Environmental
conditions conducive for the development of orange rust include warm, humid
summers and cool autumns, and the disease is favoured by rain. The disease
has the potential to cause significant economic losses to sugarcane crops.
A related species, _P. melanocephala_, causes brown or common rust. Colour
and distribution of leaf lesions varies from orange rust, and development
of this pathogen is inhibited by rain. Both rusts are rapidly spread by
wind, and disease management includes fungicide treatments and development
of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia the pathogen had been present for 100 years without causing
significant losses until in 2000 a much more virulent strain emerged
devastating the most widely grown sugarcane cultivar and demonstrating once
again the dangers of monoculture. A similar occurrence would be one
possible explanation for the emergence of orange rust in the Americas, or
the pathogen may have bee introduced recently. DNA fingerprinting of
different isolates mentioned in item [2] should help to clarify this question.
