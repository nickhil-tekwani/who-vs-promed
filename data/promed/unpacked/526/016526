-----------------------------------------------
The Texas Department of State Health Services has not confirmed an outbreak of influenza in Laredo, Texas. Routine surveillance did identify some early season influenza B cases in the community. Based on these findings, the local health department sent a health advisory to local healthcare providers reminding them of the importance of influenza prevention, treatment and diagnosis.

[ProMED-mail post entitled: Influenza (99): USA (TX) type B outbreak, archive number 20121013.1341462, relayed a report on PRWeb that the Texas Department of State Health Services had confirmed an outbreak of influenza B virus infection in Laredo. This information is incorrect. The influenza B cases were identified in the community in early season surveillance only.

ProMED-mail apologises for propagating this misinformation and thanks Carol Davis for providing this correction. - Mod.CP]
