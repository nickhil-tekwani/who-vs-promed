Infected crop shoots up onion prices
------------------------------------
Onions are set to bring tears to consumers' eyes once again as prices
in the retail market rose as a result of the new crop being hit by a
fungal infection.

Earlier, heavy rains adversely affected the onion crop in Nashik and
other parts of the state. The rates will continue to be on the higher
side for the next couple of months as over 30 percent of the crop has
been affected by the fungal disease called 'Karpa'. Besides Nashik,
Ahmednagar and Pune districts, some parts of Satara district also
grows onion.

Shivlal Bhosle, chairman of Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market yard
Commission Agents Association said, "In November [2008], many farmers
released their stock because prices were high." The stock is about to
be exhausted while there is a significant reduction in fresh crop.
Even supply from some northern states has dipped, making the situation
worse, he added.

At present, Pune consumes 200 tonnes of onion every day. The annual
onion production in the country is 7.5 million tonnes. Raju Morya, a
commission agent at Pune agriculture produce market committee said,
"There is onion shortage in the gap when harvest of fresh onion crop
is awaited. Generally the situation lasts only for a short period,
but this time we are facing a major shortage."

[The term 'karpa' appears to be used in Maharashtra for leaf blight
(bacterial or fungal) and anthracnose diseases in a range of crops.
In onion, there are 3 fungal leaf blights: blight and stem rot caused
by _Stemphylium vesicarium_, which is a serious problem in northern
and eastern parts of India, especially in seed crops; anthracnose
caused by _Glomerella cingulata_ (synonym _Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides_), which is an economically important disease during
the rainy season in Maharashtra and some neighbouring states; and
blast caused by _Botrytis_ species, which does not appear to be
considered a major problem in India. The disease reported above may
be anthracnose or stemphylium blight, since both have been reported
from Maharashtra before.

All 3 leaf blights can cause serious yield losses in onion. For
example, 100 percent crop loss due to anthracnose has been reported
from the Philippines. Disease management for the blight pathogens
includes fungicide treatments, although the effectiveness for
anthracnose appears to be in doubt. Blight resistant onion cultivars
are being developed. For more information on the blight diseases
please see links listed below.
