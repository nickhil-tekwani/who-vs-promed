At least 2 people have died and over 900 affected by cholera since the outbreak of the disease started a month and a half ago in Gaidatar VDC [village development committee] of Rautahat district. The VDC lies 55 km [34 mi] to the north of the district headquarters, Gaur.

The outbreak, which started after the local water source was contaminated with fecal matter, can spread to nearby villages, doctors in the district said.

Duryodhan Prasad Chandrabanshi, acting superintendent at the District Public Health Office (DPHO), Rautahat, said, on Friday alone [6 Jun 2014], over 2 dozen new cholera patients visited the health camp set up in the village and the condition of 3 children among them is critical.

After the number of cholera patients started to rise, 300 bottles of saline and medicine were supplied to the health camp set up on the premises of Janashakti Secondary School.

It is learnt that the source of drinking water in the village became contaminated due to open defecation by the locals of Dhiyal VDC in Makawanpur even after the district was declared open defecation free. Dhiyal VDC is located upstream of the stream that flows past Gaidakot.

With the increasing temperature, the number of people visiting the District Health Office, Bajura, has increased. Around 25 patients visit the emergency ward of the hospital daily, according to the hospital source.

Most of the patients visiting the hospital are found suffering from diarrhea. Some 70 people suffering from different diseases visit the hospital daily, of them, 25 are diarrhea patients, said Dr Dosti Regmi of the District Health Office, Bajura.

The number of patients suffering from diarrhea has increased at most of the VDCs in the district in the past few days. A large number of locals of Pandusain, Budhiganga, and Martadi are found suffering from diarrhea, it is learnt.

Public Health Officer at the Office, Gyanendra Dawadi, said that the number of diarrhea patients has increased due to consumption of decomposed food and contaminated water as water sources have become polluted and contaminated during summer season.

The flow of patients suffering from fever and diarrhea has increased to Damauli Hospital [Tanahu District] with the rise in mercury of late. The number of patients approaching the hospital has gone up since last mid-May [2014], said Dr Anjila Ghimire of Damauli Hospital. The rise in the number of patients is caused by unmanaged wastes and consumption of contaminated drinking water, he added.

Daily around 150 patients come to visit the hospital for treatment, said Dr Ghimire. Earlier, there was no such flow of patients to the hospital.

Mostly the patients from Byas municipality, Kahunshivapuri, Ghansikuwa, Pokharibhanjyang, and Camin of Tanahu district and from Lamjung and Gorkha [districts] are coming to receive treatment service from the hospital, said the hospital sources.

[The cause of the diarrhea is not stated but is not likely to be cholera, which is generally not associated with fever.
