Pfizer's Paxlovid reduces COVID risk in seniors regardless of vaccine status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pfizer Inc's antiviral treatment Paxlovid reduces COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients 65 years and older, according to a new study in Israel conducted during the rise of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.

The treatment, however, was not found to prevent severe illness among younger adults, according to research from Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest healthcare provider.

Use of Pfizer's pills, authorized to treat newly infected, at-risk people in order to prevent severe illness, has soared in the United States along with a spike infections. Biden administration officials have pushed for wide use of Paxlovid, which the government purchased and provides free.

Pfizer's clinical trial tested Paxlovid in unvaccinated people who had risk factors for serious disease and found that the 2-drug treatment cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 90%. That was during the delta wave of the virus.

There has been some concern, amid anecdotal reports of bounceback COVID symptoms after patients get relief from taking Paxlovid, that the treatment might not be as effective in vaccinated patients.

The Israeli study, which was published without peer review as a preprint by online platform Research Square, included data from nearly 110 000 participants between [9 Jan-10 Mar 2022], when omicron was the country's dominant coronavirus variant.

Senior citizens who had no prior immunity -- meaning they were neither vaccinated nor recovered from a previous COVID case -- saw an 86% drop in hospitalizations with Paxlovid. Those who had prior immunity also benefited, but at a lower rate of 60%.

In total, 0.6% of those 65 and older treated with Paxlovid -- or 14 of 2504 -- had to be hospitalized. Those who did not receive Paxlovid were hospitalized about 3 times more often, or 762 out of 40 315.

In patients ages 40-64, however, regardless of their prior immunity, the data showed no significant benefit in reducing hospitalization, said Clalit researcher Ronen Arbel.

In reducing mortality, Arbel said the treatment showed a very high benefit in patients 65 and older -- an 81% risk reduction. There were no observed benefits in younger adults, who are at less risk of dying from COVID.

The researchers noted limitations that may have biased their findings, such as lack of data on the symptoms patients presented, which may have impacted their course of treatment, or patients' degrees of prior immunit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background: Paxlovid was granted emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate poo years or older with first ever positive test for SARS-CoV-2 between January and February 2022, who were at high risk for severe COVID-19 and had no contraindications for Paxlovid use. Patients were included irrespective of their COVID-19 vaccination status. Cox hazard regression was used to estimate the 28 day HR for severe COVID-19 or mortality with Paxlovid examined as time-dependent variable.

Results: Overall, 180 351 eligible were included, of them only 4737 (2.6%) were treated with Paxlovid, and 135 482 (75.1%) had adequate COVID-19 vaccination status. Both Paxlovid and adequate COVID 19 vaccination status were associated with significant decrease in the rate of severe COVID-19 or mortality with adjusted HR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39-0.75) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.17-0.22), respectively. Paxlovid appears to be more effective in older patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with underlying neurological or cardiovascular disease (interaction p-value < 0.05 for all). No significant interaction was detected between Paxlovid treatment and COVID-19 vaccination status.

Conclusions: This study suggests that in the era of omicron and in real life setting Paxlovid is highly effective in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 or mortality.

Discussion
----------
... In this real-world study, we show that treatment with Paxlovid in the 1st 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with markedly reduced risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or mortality, regardless of vaccination status for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, this study has been conducted in Israel when omicron was the dominant variant, thus shows high effectiveness of Paxlovid against infection with the omicron variant. In addition, this study confirms that having adequate vaccination status against SARS CoV-2 remains the most effective treatment in preventing severe illness.

Although the magnitude of the effect is smaller, the direction of the results is in line with the results of interim analysis of the EPIC-HR trial, a phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which provided the evidence upon which the US FDA based their decision to grant Paxlovid an emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 [5,6,7].

The magnitude of risk reduction was larger in the EPIC-HR trial (88%) than in the current study (46%). The lower risk reduction we have observed in the real-world setting might be explained by several differences between the studies, including those related to the virus, study design and settings. ...

COVID booster in NBA cut infection risk 57% amid omicron
--------------------------------------------------------
Booster COVID-19 vaccination was tied to a 57% reduction in cases among 2613 National Basketball Association (NBA) players and staff who were regularly screened for infection during the omicron variant surge, according to a research letter published yesterday [2 Jun 2022] in JAMA. [Caroline G. Tai, Lisa L. Maragakis, Sarah Connolly, et al. Association Between COVID-19 Booster Vaccination and Omicron Infection in a Highly Vaccinated Cohort of Players and Staff in the National Basketball Association. JAMA. Research Letter. Published online 2 Jun 2022. doi:10.1001/jama.2022.9479]

Led by scientists from IQVIA and Johns Hopkins University, the study compared rates of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated NBA players and staff who did and didn't receive a booster dose and were tested more than once from 1 Dec 2021-15 Jan 2022. Testing was routinely conducted after an exposure to the virus and daily amid a cluster of cases on a team.

While players weren't required to be vaccinated, staff were mandated to be fully vaccinated by 1 Oct 2021, and receive a booster dose by 5 Jan 2022, if eligible. Full vaccination was considered 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or 1 dose of Johnson & Johnson.

Players and staff had to wear face coverings, except for players on the court and head coaches during games. As of 21 Dec 2021, boosted participants had received their last dose a median of 20 days earlier.

85% were boosted by study end
-----------------------------
Among the 2613 players and staff, 67% were monitored for all 45 days of the study, with fully boosted participants accounting for 74 165 person-days and those who were fully vaccinated but not boosted despite being eligible accounting for 10 980 person-days. Median age was 33.7 years, and 88% were men.

Over the study period, the proportion of fully vaccinated but not boosted participants fell from 682 (26%) to 205 (8%), while the proportion who were boosted rose from 1282 (49%) to 2215 (85%). The remainder of participants fell into other categories, such as fully vaccinated but not eligible for a booster or within 14 days after their booster.

Boosted participants experienced 608 COVID-19 infections and were at significantly lower risk of infection than those who hadn't received a booster. The not-boosted group had 127 infections, for an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.53).

A secondary analysis of symptomatic infections found a comparable reduction (aHR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.50) -- or a 61% reduction. No participants were hospitalized or died. Omicron was the causative virus in 93% of sequenced cases.

"Surveillance testing in this population captured both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, which differs from studies of the effectiveness of boosters that did not assess risk of asymptomatic infections," the researchers wrote. "Continued research is required to assess the need for additional booster doses beyond a single booster dose."

N. Korea Covid outbreak likely 'getting worse', says WHO
---------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization lamented Wednesday [1 Jun 2022] that it had no access to data about North Korea's COVID-19 outbreak, but assumed the crisis was deepening, contrary to Pyongyang's reports of "progress".

North Korea, which announced its first ever coronavirus cases on [12 May 2022], said last week its COVID outbreak had been brought under control, with state media reporting falling caseloads.

But WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan questioned that claim.

"We assume that situation is getting worse not better," he told reporters, acknowledging though that the secretive totalitarian state had provided only very limited information.

"Right now we are not in a position to make an adequate risk assessment of the situation on the ground," he said, pointing out that "it is very, very difficult to provide a proper analysis to the world when we don't have access to the necessary data".

Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's lead on COVID-19, meanwhile said the country had registered around 3.7 million suspected COVID cases, although the official accounts only mention cases of "fever".

The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported last Friday [27 May 2022] that caseloads had fallen for a 7th straight day, with just over 100 000 new "fever" cases in 24 hours, down from a high of 390 000 daily cases earlier in May [2022].

KCNA also reported one more death Friday [27 May 2022] -- taking the official toll to 69 -- and claimed the fatality rate remains at 0.002%.

"There are many recoveries that have been reported, but there's limited information that we have from the country currently," Van Kerkhove said.

North Korea, which has one of the worst health systems in the world, has not vaccinated any of its roughly 25 million people, having rejected jabs offered by the WHO.

Ryan stressed the importance of reining in the outbreak in the impoverished country.

"We have offered assistance on multiple occasions. We have offered vaccines on 3 separate occasions. We continue to offer," he said.

He said the UN health agency was working with China and South Korea in a bid to get aid in, hailing "a very positive attitude towards trying to deal with this collective problem".

The WHO has repeatedly cautioned against allowing the virus that causes COVID to spread unchecked, among other things since it then is more likely to mutate and produce new, potentially more dangerous variants.

"We do not wish to see intense transmission of this disease in a mainly susceptible population, in a health system that has already weakened," Ryan said.

"This is not good for the people of (North Korea). This is not good for the region. This is not good for the world."
