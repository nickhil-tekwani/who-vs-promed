The death toll from Haiti's cholera epidemic has risen to at least
4030 more than 3 months after the disease broke out in the country's
Artibonite Valley, the health ministry said. The number of cholera
cases in Haiti totalled 209 034 as of 24 Jan 2011, the ministry said.

The severity of the epidemic has diminished over time, but the
ministry's figures show that Haitians are still dying from the
bacterial infection, which can strike swiftly with intense diarrhea
and vomiting leading to dehydration and sometimes death.

cases a week in December 2010.

The ministry said the 53-year-old victim had not seen a doctor,
despite suffering from vomiting and diarrhea for several days.

In Haiti, during the 2nd epidemiological week (EW) of 2011 and for the
3rd consecutive week, Haiti has registered a decrease in the weekly
incidence rate at the national level. It decreased from 24.1 to 12.7
and to currently 10.1 cholera cases per 10 000 inhabitants. A total of
3 departments located in the north of the country increased their
weekly incidence rate (Nord, Nord Est, and Artibonite). At the
national level, the in-hospital case fatality rate for week 2 of 2011
stayed at 1.3 percent, very similar to the previous week which was 1.2
percent.

While in the Dominican Republic, the Ministry of Public Health
reported the 1st death caused by cholera in the province of
Altagracia. The outbreak began in EW 45 of 2010 and as of EW 2 of 2011
there were 244 laboratory confirmed cases.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe 2010

At least 21 people died from cholera in 2010 while nearly 1000 others
were affected by an outbreak of the disease that started last February
2010, the WHO said this week. According to the UN agency, the deaths
were part of the 951 cumulative cholera cases recorded between 4 Feb
and 19 Dec 2010.

"(Some) 951 cumulative cholera cases consisting of 835 suspect cases,
116 laboratory confirmed cases and 21 deaths had been reported by 19
Dec 2010 to the WHO through the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare's
National Health Information Unit," the WHO said in its latest
Epidemiological Bulletin.

The recorded cases and deaths were, however, a far cry from the 98 522
cumulative incidents and 4 282 fatalities that had been reported
during the comparative period in 2009.

Cholera has become a perennial disease in Zimbabwe where the water and
sanitation infrastructure has collapsed due to lack of maintenance.

A fresh cholera outbreak which has seen 60 people infected with the
disease and 4 people dead has been reported in Bikita. Masvingo
Provincial Medical Director Dr Robert Mudyiradima said tests had
confirmed that the deaths of 2 children, a man and a woman from Nyika
Growth Point were caused by cholera.

"We have dispatched our health teams to assess the situation and raise
more awareness on the disease," Dr Mudyiradima said. He said the
recent rains and a recent meeting of the Apostolic Faith members could
have contributed to the resurgent outbreak. "I am told there was an
apostolic sect meeting held near Nyika growth point. The church
gathering went for 3 days. The people there had no toilets and [no]
clean source of water."

[8] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula)

A cholera outbreak in Monapo district, in the northern Mozambican
province of Nampula, has claimed 4 lives over the past week, according
to a report in Thursday's [20 Jan 2011] issue of the Maputo daily
"Noticias."

There have been 176 diagnosed cases of the disease which, according to
Lidia Chongo, the Deputy National Director of Health, is particularly
severe in the communities of Nacuca and Carapira. The main reasons for
the spread of the disease in Monapo, she said, are the habit of
defecating in the open, and contamination of traditional, unprotected
wells used by the population.

Since Monapo lies on the Nacala rail corridor, there are fears that
the disease will spread to other parts of the province including the 2
main cities, Nampula and Nacala port. Cases of severe diarrhea have
been reported from Nampula, Mozambique Island and Ribaue and Murrupula
districts, but these have not yet been confirmed as cholera.

Cholera has arrived in Pune [formerly called Poona - Mod.LL]. 2
persons have tested positive for cholera after their stool samples
were sent to the Sassoon General Hospital. Officials at the hospital
confirmed that the culture tests at the microbiology lab have
indicated _Vibrio cholerae_ of the El Tor type, which doctors said is
generally a milder form of the infectious bacterial disease.

Dr Anju Kagal, head of the microbiology department, said the 1st
sample was of a 16-year-old girl, who was traveling to Jharkand with
friends. "She developed severe diarrhea and dehydration and had to
stop in Pune. She was admitted to Sassoon hospital and was treated
here after her sample tested positive for cholera.

The 2nd person's stool sample was sent to Aditya Birla Memorial
Hospital for confirmation of cholera," said Kagal. Kagal said the
patient was a 65-year-old and refused to divulge further details
citing patient confidentiality.
