Subject: Polio epidemic in Kwilu district, RDC
----------------------------------------------
Hello,
I am a retired physician from Belgium, who has worked in Kikwit, DR
Congo, during the years 1970-80.

I was in Kikwit recently, and was told about several suspected cases
of polio-virus [infection] there.

In a mail dated [9 Dec 2010], Dr Matthieu Bikoko, a local
[physician], working for a Belgian NGO, Memisa, reported:
*"Yesterday, I participated in an epidemiological surveillance
meeting, during which the mayor of the city of Kikwit [Dr Cyrille
Kiyungu], accompanied by local WHO staff and a team of the provincial
health division of Bandundu, reported the epidemiological situation
of the province (more particularly the Kwilu district):

For the moment, the status of the polio virus epidemic (l'Epidemie de
poliovirus sauvage) is as follows:
in the city of Kikwit (with its 2 health zones Kikwit North and
Kikwit South), there are 42 suspected cases, of which 3 cases were
confirmed, and 15 died. One of the 3 confirmed cases is a young lady
of 20 years old, who is still alive.*
** Health zone Ipamu: 10 cases*
** Health zone Kimputu: 1 case."*

Yesterday, 24 Dec 2010, the mayor, Dr Kiyungu, sent me a mail
mentioning: "We have now 60 cases of wild polio virus in Kikwit, and
20 fatalities.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr. Jansegers for providing us with an
update on the polio situation in Kikwit Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DR Congo). In the ProMED-mail posting of 9 Dec 2010, there was
a report of 36 cases and 15 deaths attributable to wild poliovirus
(WPV) infection in Kikwit (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (30): DR
Congo, RFI 20101209.4395).

According to the most recent weekly report available on the polio
eradication initiative website, as of 22 Dec 2010, there have been 79
cases of WPV infection confirmed to date in the DR Congo. In the
preceding week, there were 5 new cases reported (3 WPV1s from Kasai
Occidental, one WPV1 from Kasai Oriental and one WPV1 from
Bas-Congo). The most recent confirmed case had a date of onset of
paralysis of 18 Nov 2010 -- a WPV1 in Bas Congo.

Kikwit is located in the province of Bandundu (see the map links
provided below). One suspects that the cases referred to in the above
message from Dr. Jansegers may be pending laboratory confirmation,
and will be added to the official case count as laboratory results
become available.

Kikwit is located in Bandundu province in the southwest of the DRC.
