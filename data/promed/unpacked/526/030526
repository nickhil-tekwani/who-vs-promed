CJD AND VARIOUS TISSUES (07)
============================
[See
CJD and various tissues (06) 970519183813]
Date: 20 May 1997 10:05:10 PST
From: "Jon Rosenberg M.D. C" <HW1.JROSENBE@HW1.CAHWNET.GOV>
Since the statement referred to the use of neurosurgical instruments and
transplant of brain-associated material in addition to cornea, and the
number of patients who have developed CJD from pituitary hormones is at
least 25, the number from dura mater transplants at least 7, the number from
pericardial homografts at least 1-2, the number from contaminated
instruments at least 5, given that these are from published literature, it
is possible that 100 is a reasonable estimate.
This is not a comment on the accuracy of the program overall or its intent,
just the numbers.
