[Every year, between 30 to 200 cases of trichinellosis are registered on the territory of the Russian Federation, according to the press service of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor).

It is noted that the factor contributing to infection of people with trichinellosis, can be consumption of the meat of domestic and wild animals that have not been assessed through veterinary-sanitary examination, as well as meat of stray dogs. The incidence of trichinellosis in 2016 was recorded, in particular, in the Altai, Transbaikal, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Astrakhan, Vladimir, Kursk and Lipetsk regions, the Altai and Tuva republics, and also in St. Petersburg. The highest incidence in 2016 was registered in the Irkutsk region.

The press service added that, in October 2017, 16 cases were registered among the population of the Tomsk region related to the consumption of the smoked meat of bear cubs, which did not pass the veterinary and sanitary examination. The bear was hunted by an amateur hunter in a poaching manner http://www.mskagency.ru/materials/2717669. - Mod.NR
