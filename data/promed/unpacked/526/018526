[2] Perspective
- Mon 16 Dec 2019. MSF: humanitarian response
[MSF (abridged, edited)]
https://www.msf.org/dr-congo-msf-urges-humanitarian-organisations-return-southern-north-kivu

For years, the territories of Masisi, Walikale and Rutshuru, in the southern part of North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, have been plagued with armed violence and banditry. In the past months, these armed clashes have intensified, further aggravating the dire humanitarian situation, leading to significant numbers of displaced people and worrying signs of malnutrition, sexual violence and gunshot wounds among them.

"Since the start of the year [2019], the number of victims of sexual violence treated by MSF in Masisi has doubled compared to last year [2018], and we have seen an increase in malnutrition cases", says Ewald Stals, MSF field coordinator in Masisi health zone. "The escalation of armed clashes has also led to more people being treated for bullet wounds, and to a surge of displaced families arriving in already overcrowded camps where access to water and sanitation is scarce. Unsurprisingly, cholera cases have been reported and we've had to rapidly set up a cholera treatment centre."

"Where are the humanitarians?"
------------------------------
From January to September 2019, MSF teams working in the territories of Masisi, Rutshuru and Walikale treated more than 11 220 malnourished children, 2310 victims of sexual violence and 1980 people with weapons injuries. Despite this critical situation, these territories - often referred to as the 'Little North' of North Kivu in the aid sector - suffer from a glaring lack of assistance from humanitarian organisations.

"In recent years, several NGOs have left the 'Little North' because of insecurity, difficulties in movement around the region, and a lack of funding," says Karel Janssens, MSF Head of Mission in DRC. "Given this reduction in the number of organisations, we have been responding to an increasing number of medical, but also non-medical, needs, especially in camps. Now we're running at maximum capacity, and other emergency organisations must urgently come back and help respond to the massive humanitarian needs on the ground."

According to recent estimates, more than 687 000 people are living in camps for internally displaced people or are being hosted by local families in the territories of Masisi, Rutshuru and Walikale. For months, MSF has been advocating for the on-the-ground return of other humanitarian organisations. These efforts resulted in the arrival of a handful of organisations with temporary funding from the DRC Humanitarian Fund in mid-November [2019].

"This support is temporary and far from enough to meet the needs," says Janssens. "Given the scale of the crisis, a much larger humanitarian response is needed in southern North Kivu, with organisations being present on the ground and benefitting from longer-term funding. The Humanitarian Response Plan 2020 for DRC must clearly take this into account in its upcoming revision."

[See video at URL above: 'Little North': a neglected crisis in North Kivu, DRC. The DRC is suffering from much more than Ebola alone, including other diseases such as measles, TB, malaria, as well malnourishment, sexual violence, physical violence. This needs to be kept in mind when thinking about the trauma people in the region have experienced and the combined impact of all these factors. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 16 Dec 2019. Uganda: porous border
[LSE (The London School of Economics and Political Science, abridged, edited)]
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2019/12/16/uganda-export-ebola-drc-disease-porous-borders/
[Byline: Grace Akello]

Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) share porous borders, as well as social and economic links. With porous borders, it is common for an individual to travel between Uganda and the DRC without being sure about their current country location - particularly when mobile phone networks oscillate between DRC and Uganda service providers. Even when the River Lhubhiriha marks one such border, people in this region wade through the river without thinking about its political significance.

One only appreciates the extent to which these 2 countries' borders are porous (or even imaginary) when conducting fieldwork in districts like Kasese, Bundibugyo, Nebbi, Zombo and Arua. It is said that the Bakonzo of Uganda speak the same language and have close kinship with the Kinande of the DRC. The same can be said of the Alur, Banyoro and Lugbara - ethnic groups living in both Uganda and the DRC. Noticeably, these border districts have market days whereby both Ugandans and Congolese small scale traders engage in the exchange of goods and services.

In 2018, the 11th Ebola epidemic was confirmed in DRC's border province of North Kivu. Different authorities, including the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Health, humanitarians and local leaders in high risk districts, devised strategies to keep Uganda Ebola-free. While at the national level Ugandans were depicted as faceless, nameless citizens living in a high risk border district, who must be protected from catching the virus from their risky Congolese neighbours, local leaders in Kasese knew that families cut across borders, and Ugandans farm and sell their agricultural produce in Congo, and vise versa.

In June 2018, an Ebola surveillance team from Uganda's Minister of Health (MOH) travelled over 15 km [approx. 9 mi] into the DRC without realizing they left their target citizens, whom they were sensitising to prevent Ebola's spread from the DRC. Their loudspeaker announcements advised Ugandan citizens to stop eating bush meat, wash their hands with chlorine, and if they saw anybody with signs such as bleeding from bodily openings - particularly if they have been to the DRC in the recent past - to report immediately such persons to Uganda's Ebola Treatment Unit, located at Bwera hospital in Kasese district.

National vs local authority viewpoints
--------------------------------------
There was therefore a clash between national and local authorities' viewpoints concerning the appropriateness of preventive approaches. For instance, when the state viewed all Congolese as suspects who must be surveilled and forced (beaten even) into washing their hands and feet in chlorine prior to entering Uganda, local leaders viewed these approaches as divisive, aimed at bringing disharmony among families across borders - 'our relatives', as mentioned in many discussions in Kasese. These leaders therefore disregarded such Ebola response activities and, at best, small Ebola checkpoints only targeted unknown Congolese and women for screening.

Ebola and indeed any virulent disease may force people into moral, social and political dilemmas.

Such events force us to reflect upon the importance of humanitarianism in countries facing pandemics. We must ask ourselves: to what extent are humanitarians' contributions geared towards resolving the issue at hand, particularly if their interventions are guided by detachment, neutrality, seeing affected citizens as without a face, without a name, sans social links and kinships? These are pertinent questions whether within or across countries' borders.

[3] Simulation exercise
- Thu 12 Dec 2019. Ebola simulation exercise
[The Conversation (abridged, edited)]
https://theconversation.com/is-it-ebola-or-just-a-drill-how-to-test-a-public-health-crisis-response-128365
[Byline: Mosoka Fallah]

There wasn't an Ebola outbreak in Lesotho - but for a few hours in November 2019, you may have heard that there was.

On [14 Nov 2019], Lesotho public health authorities conducted a simulation exercise involving a woman who was rushed to hospital and tested positive for Ebola after crossing the border from South Africa. Media picked up on this event and reported it as if it were true. But a few hours later it was revealed that there had been no Ebola case in Lesotho, and this event was only a drill.

The Lesotho government was conducting a public health simulation exercise. When done properly, a simulation exercise is a useful tool for evaluating preparedness for a public health emergency. When done poorly, a simulation exercise can cause unnecessary panic in local or international communities. Here, we've drawn on our experience in Liberia to outline how to properly plan and execute a simulation exercise.

- What is a simulation exercise?
A public health simulation exercise is a test of an emergency response system. Simulation exercises are used to develop emergency response protocols, train staff, and monitor and evaluate the capability of the public health system to respond to emergencies. Regular exercises make it possible to identify areas for improvement and ensure that a health system will be able to respond appropriately to a true crisis.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) lays out guidelines for planning various types of simulation exercises. Simulation exercises can range from tabletop discussions to partial tests to full-scale field exercises.

The simulation in Lesotho was a full-scale exercise. This is the most complex type, intended to mirror real-life emergency situations as closely as possible. It tests many components of an emergency plan and may involve many organisations and multiple countries. Full-scale exercises are immensely valuable for testing emergency management plans under close-to-real conditions. But they are difficult to plan and can cause alarm in the wider community if not executed thoughtfully and deliberately.

- Planning a simulation
- Running the exercise effectively
- Lessons
A simulation exercise strengthens health systems - and helps countries prepare for real public health emergencies.

It's difficult to determine if Lesotho's public health simulation exercise was a success because lessons about emergency preparedness were overshadowed by panic. With proper planning and management, Lesotho and other countries can conduct future simulation exercises without making headlines.

The exercise management team should anticipate potential media and public relations issues and help prevent misinformation from spreading.

[As stated in the full report, in order to have an effective and safe simulation exercise, a strategy must be developed for clear communication with the community leaders, the public, and the media, so that panic does not ensue following dissemination of misinformation. The WHO has guidelines for such exercises. See https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/WHO-WHE-CPI-2017.10/en/ - Mod.LK]

[4] Attacks
- Mon 16 Dec 2019
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/more-violence-beni-drc-tracks-new-ebola-cases
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the weekend at least 43 people, including a pregnant woman, were killed in Beni, one of the epicenters of the DRC's current Ebola outbreak, as officials tallied 8 new cases of the deadly disease.

The rebel terrorist organization Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) likely conducted the attacks, according to the Associated Press (AP) and Al Jazeera.

Last month [November 2019], clashes between the DRC's military and the ADF led the World Health Organization (WHO) to temporarily pull its Ebola response teams out of the area, after health workers were killed during the skirmishes.

The violence has made contact tracing and vaccination difficult, and has since led to an uptick of cases just weeks after WHO officials said the outbreak was almost contained.

Rebels pit civilians against military
-------------------------------------
The AP said the 1st attack began the night of [13 Dec 2019], when at least 6 people were killed in Beni, including a pregnant woman. Al Jazeera said 22 more people were killed in an attack on [14 Dec 2019], also in the same city.

All told, the AP said today [Mon 16 Dec 2019] that 43 people died over the weekend in Beni, including several who were shot as ADF militants went door to door in communities surrounding Beni yesterday [Sun 15 Dec 2019].

According to human rights organizations interviewed by the AP, ADF's goal is to pit civilians against the DRC military. The ADF, which has been associated with the Islamic State, is active in eastern DRC.

As of today [Mon 16 Dec 2019], the WHO's Ebola dashboard shows 8 new cases recorded over the weekend, including 2 cases today. The outbreak total now stands at 3348, including 2210 fatalities. Officials are still investigation 437 suspected cases.

Violent attacks have almost always spurred on new Ebola cases in their wake during the 17-month-long outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said cases over the weekend were in Mabalako.
