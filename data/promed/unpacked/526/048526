The Michigan Department of Natural Resources says bats have shown evidence of white nose syndrome [WNS] in 3 Michigan counties.

WNS is a type of fungus that makes the North American bat population very sick, and can eventually lead to death. This is the 1st time the disease has been detected within state borders. The DNR says characteristics of WNS were recently detected in Alpena, Dickinson, and Mackinac counties.

Bats show signs of skin lesions when infected with the illness. Researchers first documented the disease in 2006 in upstate New York. According to a press release, 11 species have been infected and over 6 million [bats] have died.

Bat populations are down by 70-80 percent in northeastern states where WNS has been present the longest. Scientists say winter die-offs in some specific caves have been greater than 90 percent.

The loss of bats is tough for Michigan farmers since bats are a natural form pest control. A reduction in population could pose economic issues for agriculture and commercial forestry because pests can be harmful to crops and trees.

[2] Wisconsin: 1st report

Wildlife officials have confirmed a deadly bat disease has reached Wisconsin.

The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced Thursday [10 Apr 2014] that tests completed earlier this month show at least 2 bats in a Grant County mine had white nose syndrome. Visual surveys of 85 other mine and cave sites this winter didn't turn up any other signs of the disease but the DNR is awaiting test results on samples collected at 19 of those sites.

White nose syndrome, so named for the white fuzz that grows on bats' noses, wings, and tails, causes hibernating bats to frequently wake from hibernation, depleting their energy reserves and leading to starvation or dehydration.

The disease has been confirmed in 23 other states so far. It has killed as many as 5 million bats since 2006.
