Ha Tinh Province on 3 Dec 2010 announced the existence of a blue ear
epidemic in some communes, and it destroyed 51 pigs in Thach Hoi and Thach Van.

More than 60 pigs in 2 communes -- Thach Hoi and Thach Van in Thach
Ha District, central province of Ha Tinh -- had been infected with
blue-ear disease from 18 to 29 Nov 2010.

The provincial Department of Animal Health has worked with localities
to sterilise and set up quarantine points. The province has directed
localities to strictly implement measures to stamp out and prevent
the spread of the disease.

According to the agriculture ministry, the blue-ear disease, also
known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS),
affected thousands of pigs.

[An earlier newswire included the following information: "Blue-ear
pig disease has spread to 12 provinces across the nation as of 30 Nov
2010, according to the Department of Animal Health under the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The 12 afflicted provinces include Dak Lak, Son La, Quang Ngai, Khanh
Hoa, Gia Lai, Phu Yen, Bac Ninh, Yen Bai, Nghe An, Quang Ninh, Lang
Son and Bac Kan. See
<http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Blueear-pig-disease-spreads-to-12-provinces/201012/121924.vov>.

The disease is caused by the PRRS virus, a virus currently classified
as a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus
_Arterivirus_. The primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar
macrophage of the pig.

Two major antigenic types of the virus exist, the European and the
American type. The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs
but also by faeces, urine, semen and fomites. Additional background
is available at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf>.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world.
The disease, initially reported from Viet Nam in 2007 -- locally
named "Blue ear pig disease," spread throughout the country and was
declared endemic on 23 Feb 2008 (see, with distribution map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>).
During 2009, 43 outbreaks of PRRS were reported in Viet Nam; the
number in 2010 is expected to be considerably higher.

PRRS identification in Viet Nam followed the spread of the disease in
China, where initially it was designated "porcine high fever
disease." In both countries, the virus involved was highly pathogenic
and genetically close.

Further background on PRRS, its etiology, diagnosis and vaccine
requirements, is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf>. - Mod.AS]
