The number of cases of toxoplasmosis among employees of the Agronomic Institute of Parana (IAPAR) in Londrina [Parana] has risen to 40. Still unsure of the cause of the outbreak, the department of health surveillance has asked that the supply of water to the population through pipes located near the institute's headquarters on the banks of the PR-445 [motorway] be suspended.

"Last week [week of 19 Oct 2015] we suspended the water supply for both the general public and the workers, in order to clean the water tanks. Water consumption by the institute's employees was reinstated earlier this week [week of 26 Oct 2015], after the completion of the cleaning procedures but, at the recommendation of the department of health surveillance, the pipes must remain closed until [3 Nov 2015]," said Altair Dorigo, managing director of IAPAR in Londrina, in an interview with radio Paiquere AM.

He said the department of health surveillance is investigating 2 hypotheses of contamination: one involves the water tanks and the other the cafeteria at IAPAR. "The 40 infected employees use the cafeteria daily. They may contracted the disease after eating contaminated vegetables," he said, noting that the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis may be found in cat feces.

The director of IAPAR said the affected employees are already being treated. "Among the cases there is pregnant woman who worries us more, but everything is under control," he said.

Seventeen workers of the Agronomic Institute of Parana (IAPAR) of Londrina, in [northern Parana state], acquired toxoplasmosis, according to Health Surveillance Office, investigating an outbreak at the site this week.

It is suspected that the water or food served to the workers were contaminated but so far tests have not identified the source of contamination. Since the outbreak was discovered, workers have received lectures on prevention and treatment and hygiene at the institute has been reinforced. Work at the institute continues and those who are ill are receiving treatment and responding well.

Experts say the contamination happened between July and August [2015], but symptoms appeared only in recent weeks. The infected workers are being treated at the institute's outpatient clinic. The disease was only discovered after an employee sought help from a doctor outside the institute.

"[Symptoms include] body ache, fever, and headache. In the beginning we mistook it for conventional influenza. Then one employee tested positive for toxoplasmosis. After that we started to investigate to find the source of the infection," explained nurse trainee, Francislaine Mateus da Silva.

One of the infected workers said the 1st doctor who examined him mistook the disease with influenza A. "I had fever for about 3 or 4 days and I took Tamiflu [oseltamivir], which the doctor prescribed. Later, the result was positive for toxoplasmosis."

Cassia Balbinotti, benefits manager for IAPAR, said, "the institute has outside suppliers and they are all being investigated. We are reviewing the routine guidelines, such as recommended hygiene practices for both the restaurant workers and the other institute employees."

[We assume that the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is correct even though the text does not mention anything about the results of the serology.

Waterborne outbreaks of toxoplasmosis are well known. The best described happened in Victoria, Vancouver Island (Canada) in 1994-95 when a water reservoir was contaminated by _Toxoplasma gondii_ oocysts presumably from wild cougars defecating in the reservoir.

Other outbreaks have been reported from Brazil. Surface water is contaminated by _T. gondii_ oocysts from defecating cats, and if the water is consumed without cooking or swallowed for instance when swimming, there is a risk of infection.

Infection with toxoplasma causes a short febrile illness in the majority of cases, but is more severe in 10-15 per cent, especially causing choroiditis (retinal inflammation). In pregnant women it may cause congenital toxoplasmosis and the infection is more severe in the immunocompromised, for instance HIV-positive patients. - Mod.EP
