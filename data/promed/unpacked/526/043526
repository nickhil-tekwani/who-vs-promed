Update on Kranji Way cluster
----------------------------
1. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was notified of 8 additional cases of
chikungunya fever involving 6 foreign workers and 2 locals working at
Kranji Way. Of the foreign workers 5 are working and residing at the
site in Kranji Way, while the remaining worker commutes daily from
Malaysia. The total number of cases linked to Kranji Way currently
stands at 28.

2. NEA officers have been conducting intensive mosquito control
operations within the vicinity of the cases' workplace and
residences, and the areas that they frequent. More than 28 premises
have been inspected in the Kranji Way area and a total of 16 premises
were found breeding the _Aedes_ mosquito. Outdoor and indoor fogging
of insecticide has been carried out for all the premises checked.
This intensive operation to seek out and remove any mosquito breeding
habitats will continue. Residents and premise owners in the vicinity
of Kranji Way have all been advised to check their premises daily to
remove any stagnant water that may breed mosquitoes.

Update on Chikungunya cases
---------------------------
3. MOH was notified of 2 new cases of chikungunya fever. The 1st case
involved a 27-year-old housewife who stays at Woodland Street 81. She
developed symptoms on 4 Aug 2008, sought outpatient treatment at a
medical clinic, and has since recovered. She has no recent history of
travel overseas and her movement was largely confined to her
residence and nearby places. MOH has conducted active case detection
among her 7 household contacts. None was tested positive for
chikungunya virus.

4. The 2nd case involved a foreign worker (40-year-old Chinese
national) who works and resides at Sungei Kadut Street 1. He
developed symptoms on 4 Aug 2008 and was admitted to CDC
[Communicable Disease Centre] on 7 Aug 2008. He has no recent history
of travel overseas and his movement was largely confined to his
workplace and nearby places. MOH has conducted active case detection
among his 38 co-workers at his workplace. None was tested positive
for chikungunya virus.

5. NEA is carrying out vector control operations in the premises
around the cases' residence, including the common and public areas.
Areas where the cases frequented are also being inspected for
mosquito breeding. So far, 5 premises in the vicinity of the case
residing at Woodlands St 81 were found breeding the _Aedes_ mosquito.
NEA's checks in the respective areas are continuing.

6. To date [8 Aug 2008], a total of 95 cases of chikungunya fever
were notified to MOH in 2008. Of these cases, 46 were imported cases
with history of travel to Johor (36 cases), Malacca (2 cases),
Indonesia (4 cases), Sri Lanka (2 cases), and India (2 cases). There
have been 9 incidents from which 49 local cases have arisen.

Ministry's advice to the public
-------------------------------
7. The Ministry advises persons who have travelled to Kranji Way
recently and develop symptoms of chikungunya, which include fever,
joint pain, and rashes to consult their doctors immediately.

8. Chikungunya fever, like dengue fever, is a mosquito-borne disease
and the best way to prevent chikungunya fever is to take
precautionary measures to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. Persons
infected with chikungunya fever [virus] should be isolated from
further mosquito bites to reduce the risk of further transmission of
the virus.

9. Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported in our region such as
Malaysia (Johor, Malacca, Negri Sembilan, and Perak), Indonesia, and
India. Therefore, we have to remain vigilant to the risk of imported
cases leading to local transmission.

10. Persons travelling overseas are thus advised to take
precautionary measures to protect themselves, remain vigilant, and
seek prompt medical treatment upon their return if they are unwell
and developed symptoms of chikungunya which include fever, joint
pain, and rashes.

On his return to Bologna, a 50-year-old man who had been on holiday
in Sri Lanka developed a high fever, joint pains, and widespread
malaise. In the beginning of August [2008], the man consulted his
doctor and was admitted to the Maggiore Hospital with a [diagnosis of
chikungunya virus infection].

On 31 Jul 2008 the man, who is from Sri Lanka, returned to Bologna
where he has lived for years. He spent the night at the home of his
son who picked him up at the airport. The day after [1 Aug 2008], he
felt the 1st symptoms of viral fever, went to his doctor, and then to
the hospital.

Fausto France, chief of the Department of Hygiene and Public Health
of dell'Ausl Bologna confirmed the diagnosis. France pointed out that
the man had contracted the virus (which is transmitted only by the
bite of tiger mosquitoes) abroad, that his condition is good, and
that he could be discharged during the day. [The Asian tiger
mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_ is a recognized vector of chikungunya
virus, and so is _Ae. aegypti_. - Mod.TY]

Although the man had been home only for a few hours, the regional
protocol [was implemented] for the elimination of [mosquito] larvae
within a radius of 100 meters from the place in which there are known
cases of [chikungunya virus] infection. Consequently, the
Municipality has ordered an urgent, emergency health care cleanup of
the area.

[The Bologna, Italy health authorities have reacted swiftly to the
risk of establishment of a local focus of chikungunya virus
transmission as happened in a nearby area of the same region in Italy
last year (2007), when an infected individual brought this virus from
India to an area in Italy where there was a sufficiently abundant
population of the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_ to
initiate a local outbreak of the disease. That outbreak is summarized
in ProMED-mail archive no. 20071210.3980 (see below).
