The 1st case of cholera has been recorded in Zogra camp near Jarabulus city (125 km or 78 mi north of Aleppo) at the Syrian-Turkish border, which accommodates people displaced from Homs. A medical source told Smart News on [Thu 19 Oct 2017] that cholera symptoms have been identified in a 4-month-old girl who had a severe form of rice water diarrhea, accompanied by dehydration and hypotension.

The cause of the cholera outbreak is possibly related to polluted water sources in the camp and the exposed sewage system that provides a source for flies to transmit the disease. The source pointed out that they have communicated with the Directorate of Health, which promised to take appropriate action. The source warned of the spread of infection among a larger number of people if preventive measures are not taken through awareness campaigns and maintenance of sewage networks as soon as possible.

The 10 200 persons living in Zogra camp have previously complained of lack of food and health assistance and lack of water and electricity in the camp.

[The development of cholera in Syria may be ominous. A conflict environment with displaced people and a destroyed infrastructure, like Yemen, could breed a substantial outbreak of cholera and other contaminated water-associated diseases such as typhoid and viral hepatitis. - Mod.LL
