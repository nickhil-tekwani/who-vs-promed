_C. sordellii_ toxic shock syndrome, medical abortion - USA, Canada, 2001-05
--------------------------------------------------
On 19 Jul 2005, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding the
deaths of 4 women in the USA after medical abortions with Mifeprex
(mifepristone, formerly RU-486; Danco Laboratories, NY, NY) and
intravaginal misoprostol (1). 2 of these deaths occurred in 2003, 1 in
2004, and 1 in 2005. 2 of these USA cases had clinical illness consistent
with toxic shock and had evidence of endometrial infection with
_Clostridium sordellii_, a Gram-positive, toxin-forming anaerobic
bacterium. In addition, a fatal case of _C. sordellii_ toxic shock syndrome
after medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol was reported in
2001, in Canada (2). All 3 cases of _C. sordellii_ infection were notable
for lack of fever, and all had refractory hypotension, multiple effusions,
hemoconcentration, and a profound leukocytosis. _C. sordellii_ previously
has been described as a cause of pregnancy-associated toxic shock syndrome (3).
Investigation by FDA, CDC, and state and local health departments into the
2 most recently identified USA deaths after medical abortion is ongoing.
Empiric therapy for patients suspected of having postpartum or postabortion
toxic shock syndrome should include antimicrobials with anaerobic activity
against _Clostridium_ species. Health-care providers are encouraged to
report any cases of postpartum or postabortion toxic shock syndrome to
their state or local health department and to CDC at telephone
800-893-0485. Cases potentially associated with use of mifepristone or
misoprostol should also be reported through the FDA MedWatch system:
<http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/index.html>
or by telephoning 800-FDA-1088.

[For a more detailed short discussion regarding _C. sordellii_, please
refer to the earlier posting regarding this cluster.
It is curious that this particular species of _Clostridium_ was associated
with at least 3 of the cases as well as the Canadian case, but the genus is
one not uncommonly associated with pregnancy and abortion. _C. sordellii_,
as discussed in the previous post, can cause serious infection in other
obstetrical situations as well.
The medical literature, especially the older literature, is dotted with
reports of post-surgical abortion clostridia septicotoxemia with striking
massive intravascular hemolysis, hypotension, and renal failure as well as
in other clostridial infections (1,2). Indeed, the phenomenon has been
noted after amniocentesis (3) and spontaneous abortion as well (4). Most
of these cases are related to _C. perfringens_.
