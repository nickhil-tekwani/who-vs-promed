2 more deer in Nebraska test positive for disease
-------------------------------------------------
2 mule deer killed this fall in Nebraska's Panhandle have tested positive
for chronic wasting disease. The discoveries bring to 17 the number of wild
deer in Nebraska that have been confirmed as having the fatal disease in
the past 4 years. All the deer were killed by hunters in the Panhandle.

The 2 most recent cases involved bucks, both about 30 months old and killed
in areas where infected deer have been found, said Bruce Morrison,
assistant chief of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission's wildlife
division. One of the bucks was killed in the south west corner of Kimball
County. The other was killed in northern Sioux County.

They are the first positive tests from 1844 deer tested so far since the
fall hunting seasons by the University of Nebraska's Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory. About 2000 deer from central and western Nebraska remain to be
tested. All of the 846 deer tested from eastern Nebraska were negative,
along with 305 deer tested that were killed by hunters in central Nebraska,
Morrison said. Nearly 700 deer have been tested from the Panhandle.

In Colorado, it has been detected in 233 deer and elk killed by hunters,
vehicles, and culling this season alone. The disease first appeared in
Nebraska in 1999 in a wild deer in Kimball County. 2 more cases were found
in that county in 2000, as well as one in neighboring Cheyenne County. Last
year [2002], 10 wild deer in northern Sioux County and one in Scotts Bluff
County tested positive for the disease.

5 CWD deer killed outside "the zone"
------------------------------------
5 deer have been found with chronic wasting disease outside the boundary of
an area Wisconsin wildlife experts had hoped limited where the disease
would be found, the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said on
Friday. The newest cases -- bringing to 55 the number of deer with the
fatal disease -- show the disease is now in a new county, Richland.

The 5 new diseased deer were killed in what the DNR calls a buffer area
around a 411 square mile area of Dane, Iowa, and Sauk counties, where the
first 50 deer with the disease were found, including 3 discovered last
February [2002] in an area just west of Mount Horeb. The 5 positive tests
were from deer found in the management zone, an area that extends 40 miles
from where the DNR first detected deer with the disease. The 5 new cases
are "geographically close" to the so-called eradication zone, where the DNR
wants all the deer killed to wipe out the disease from the herd.

Tom Hauge, director of the DNR's Bureau of Wildlife Management, said the
agency's wildlife experts expected the disease to show up in areas adjacent
to the eradication zone. He said computer models showed the disease has
probably been in the area as long as 5 years, and that's long enough for
deer to spread the disease beyond places it originally appeared. "That kind
of dispersal is well within reason," Hauge said. "We're disappointed, but
from a scientific perspective, this is very expected."

So far, laboratory experts have examined tissue samples from 9064 of the 38
241 deer heads submitted by hunters for testing. The DNR has tested 2199
samples from areas outside the management and eradication zones, and all
were negative for CWD.

The 5 infected deer in the management zone were detected among 4554 deer
tested so far from that area, the DNR said. Hauge said the finding will not
alter the DNR's plans to combat the spread of CWD by killing all the deer
-- about 25 000 -- inside the eradication zone.

But some argue that the appearance of CWD outside the eradication zone is
reason enough for the DNR to change its approach. A group called Citizens
and Landowners for a Rational Response said last week that the agency
should drop the eradication plan in favor of thinning the herd and devoting
more money to research on the disease. "There is no way they are going to
kill all the animals in that area," said Mark Peck, a member of the group.
But Hauge said that efforts to kill more deer in the eradication zone are
necessary regardless of the presence of the disease.
