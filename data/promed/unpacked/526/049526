The first U.S. cases in an apparent worldwide outbreak of a rare strain of
meningitis have been reported. Government health officials said Thursday
that at least three New Yorkers have come down with the type of the disease
that's been linked to this year's Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned all returning
pilgrims and their close contacts to contact a doctor or go to the nearest
emergency room if they experience fever, intense headache, stiff neck or
neck pain, pain when looking at bright lights, nausea or vomiting. The
World Health Organization said Thursday it had recorded 250 cases of
meningitis linked to the pilgrimage, including 55 deaths. The reports began
about a week ago when Britain and France diagnosed meningitis in people
returned from the pilgrimage.
The CDC now says three people in New York City who either traveled to Saudi
Arabia or had close contacts who did have been diagnosed with meningitis.
The CDC contacted state health departments Thursday, urging them to be
alert to meningitis symptoms in recent travelers to Saudi Arabia. The
specific strain involved is the rare "W-135" strain of the bacterium
_Neisseria meningitidis_. About 1.3 million pilgrims traveled to Mecca last
month for the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, which all Muslims are expected to
complete once in their lives. Saudi Arabia requires them to produce
documents certifying that they received vaccinations against such
contagious diseases such as meningitis. Those immunized in the United
States most likely received a vaccine that does include some protection
against the W-135 strain but the vaccine is not perfect and it does not
prevent someone who appears healthy from carrying the germ and spreading it
to family members.
