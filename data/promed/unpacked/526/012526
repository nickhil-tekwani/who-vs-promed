The Michigan Department of Agriculture was cited as warning that Thorn
Apple Valley Inc.'s (TAVI) Herrud franks made with chicken, pork and beef
have the potential to be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_.
In a press release Friday, the agency was cited as saying no illnesses have
been reported to date, but customers should return Herrud packages marked
NOV 21 2A4 Est. No. P-13529 and with UPC code 7470000902. The packages were
distributed by Michigan Meat Processors.
