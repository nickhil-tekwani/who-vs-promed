[1] Cholera - Congo DR

A cholera epidemic has been declared in Kinshasa and continues throughout the country. Cholera response in DRC will not succeed without support. Although the number of cholera cases has decreased significantly along the Congo River, the cholera epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is not controlled yet, by far. Since the beginning of 2017, the DRC recorded 10 982 cases of cholera and 349 deaths have been recorded, an increase of more than 10 per cent compared with the situation in the same period in 2016.

The DRC accounts for more than 98 per cent of all reported cholera cases in West and Central Africa. UNICEF calls on donors not to disengage from the cholera epidemic. The organization itself needs USD 2 million for its contribution to the fight against the epidemic.

Cholera is endemic in many parts of the DRC, particularly in the east of the country. The province of Tanganyika, for instance, reported 2496 cases and 43 deaths during the month of May 2017. Transmission remains active in many health zones in Tanganyika. Population movements linked to the conflicts between Pygmies and Lubas worsen it by causing internal displacements to neighboring provinces, such as Maniema, Upper Katanga, Upper Lomami and South Kivu.

The situation is also of concern in non-endemic areas in the north and west of the country. This epidemic affects several health zones in western DRC, particularly Kimpese in Central Kongo, with more than 600 cases reported from March to the present day. The province of Kinshasa also requires attention, as the Provincial Minister of Health declared an epidemic last [Fri 26 May 2017].

Several factors are aggravating the persistence of the cholera epidemic. These include the weak involvement of state structures in fighting against cholera, a lack of attention from the humanitarian and development community and other actors to this "forgotten" epidemic, as well as some funds that ended on [Fri 31 Mar 2017].

[2] Cholera - Malawi (Southern Region)

A cholera outbreak continues to hit hard areas around Nchalo in Chikwawa district as the number of infected people increases from 12 to 25.

Last week [week 21-27 May 2017], there were reports that about 12 people were treated for suspected cholera cases at St Montfort Hospital in Nchalo. According to Chikwawa District Health Office spokesperson, Settie Piriminta, the outbreak has occurred because people from the villages of Sekeni and Allan in the area of Chief Lundu were drinking water from Nkombezi River which is contaminated. "Lack of safe drinking water is the main factor which has caused the cholera outbreak at Sekeni and Allan Villages around Nchalo Trading Centre in the area of Chief Lundu," said the public relations officer.

According to Piriminta, communities in the 2 areas have been fetching and drinking water from contaminated Nkombezi River because the villages have no functional boreholes and in most cases, when the boreholes start working they produce saline water. "This forced people to drink water from the river which is also used for bathing and cleaning their household utensils. That aside, most communities in those areas do not have toilets and use the river to defecate consequently exposing themselves to water borne diseases," added Piriminta. Currently, the patients are receiving treatment at St Montfort Hospital where no cholera death has since been recorded.

[3] Cholera - Sudan (White Nile)

Cases of cholera or in officialese, watery diarrhea in Sudan have increased in White Nile State with 75 deaths, and 4188 infections, the state's governor said [on Tue 30 May 2017]. "The number of infection cases with cholera, since the disease's appearance on [Sat 8 Apr 2017], has reached 4188 cases, including 75 death cases," Abdul-Hameed Musa Kasha, governor of White Nile State, said when addressing the state's legislative council.

Meanwhile, social media activists published photos and information, which said were authentic, on cases of cholera in some hospitals in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The Sudanese health authorities have not yet published any indicators on the spread of the disease, its causes or the number of the people infected. Khartoum State's minister of health Mamoun Humaida, in a telephone conversation with Xinhua, declined to give any information about the disease.

Sudan Tribune on [Tue 30 May 2017], reported the opposition Sudan Change Now Movement as saying that "Sudan is witnessing a state of epidemiological spread of cholera in White Nile, Khartoum and North Kordofan States in addition to occasional cases in eastern Sudan."

Meanwhile, Khartoum State's Health Ministry acknowledged presence of cholera cases in Khartoum, but refuted that the disease is cholera. "All the cases admitted to the state's hospitals were watery diarrhea cases. There were 120 cases, where 49 of them have been treated and they are in good conditions. The conditions of the remaining patients are stable. We have registered 2 death cases during last month [April 2017]," said the ministry in a statement on [Tue 30 May 2017].

"We would like to reiterate that epidemic cholera does not exist among these cases, and the ministry has allotted 4 hospitals to receive the cases with qualified medical staff," it noted. "We would like to reassure the citizens that these watery diarrhea cases do not represent cholera and the situation is now under control," added the statement.

The watery diarrhea cases started in Sudan's White Nile State in April [2017] and then spread to neighboring states including Khartoum. During August and September 2016, watery diarrhea hit Sudan's Blue Nile and other states, leaving more than 55 dead with 2619 infection cases.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press) oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
