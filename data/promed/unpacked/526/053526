The FDA confirmed Saturday [16 Apr 2022] it is investigating Lucky Charms after fielding more than 100 customer complaints of illness after eating the cereal. Thousands of people have complained on a consumer website, saying they have experienced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after eating Lucky Charms, the Wall Street Journal reported.

"The FDA takes seriously any reports of possible adulteration of a food that may also cause illnesses or injury," the agency said in a prepared statement.

Minneapolis-based General Mills Inc., which makes the cereal, said it is working with the FDA, but noted than an internal investigation found no evidence of illnesses linked to Lucky Charms consumption. Neither the company nor the FDA has issued a recall of the cereal, which is one of the company's top brands. According to the Journal, breakfast cereal rarely results in foodborne illness because the baking process typically kills pathogens, but the products can be contaminated after baking, such as when glazes are added or during packaging.

Patrick Quade, founder of the consumer website <iwaspoisoned.com>, told the newspaper that his site has fielded nearly 2500 reports to date from people nationwide who said they got sick soon after eating Lucky Charms.

[ProMED has been aware of this potential foodborne outbreak since the 1st news reports occurred. It remains unclear if the breakfast cereal is related to these illnesses. While the baking process should inactivate any bacterial pathogens, some toxins are heat stable and can cause nausea and vomiting or, as noted above, contamination can occur after the baking process. An example of the latter is baked-pastry transmission of hepatitis A related to postbaking contamination of the icing (ProMED post Hepatitis A, 2012 - Germany: (NI) bakery sweet pastries, Archive no. 20141219.3042399).

A colleague of mine from my time at the University of Iowa, Dr. Sam Donta, suggested to me the possibility of _Bacillus cereus_ foodborne illness in these cases. As noted below, the emetic toxin of _B. cereus_ is heat stable. As well, because _B. cereus_ endospores are extremely heat resistant, they could survive cooking at temperatures that would otherwise destroy foodborne pathogen cells. This heat resistance increases with increasing salinity (presence of salt) and decreases with increasing acidity.

_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness [as in the report above].

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus, moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usual mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer J M, et al. Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med. 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604).

A good review on the subject follows:
Stenfors Arnesen L P, Fagerlund A, Granum P E. From soil to gut: _Bacillus cereus_ and its food poisoning toxins. FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008; 32(4): 579-606; doi: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00112.x

"Abstract
--------
_Bacillus cereus_ is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. From these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrheal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. The emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. Similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish _Bacillus thuringiensis_ and _Bacillus anthracis_ from _B. cereus_, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. The diarrheal syndrome of _B. cereus_ is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. Three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrheal disease: hemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe), and cytotoxin K. Hbl and Nhe are homologous 3-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin A found in _Escherichia coli_. This review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by _B. cereus_. The disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation."

For any readers who are breakfast cereal "muggles," "Lucky Charms is a brand of breakfast cereal produced by the General Mills food company since 1964. The cereal consists of toasted oat pieces and multi-colored marshmallow shapes (or marshmallow bits). The label features a leprechaun mascot, Lucky, animated in commercials."

A photograph of the cereal can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Charms#/media/File:Lucky_Charms_(14803357412).jpg.

The post does not adequately describe the symptom complex, especially related to incubation period -- from ingesting the cereal to when symptoms began -- and how long the illness lasted. ProMED awaits further information about this situation. - Mod.LL
