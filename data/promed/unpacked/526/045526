An 80-year-old man infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus has died in Hong Kong, the government said on Thursday [26 Dec 2013], in the 1st such death in the city after the virus surfaced in early December. The man, the 2nd person in Hong Kong to be diagnosed with the virus strain, lived in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen [Guangdong Province] and had eaten poultry there, media reported.

The H7N9 strain was 1st reported in humans in February [2013] in mainland China, and has infected at least 139 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing more than 40.

Experts say there is no evidence of any easy or sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9, and so far all people who came into contact with the man had tested negative for the strain, authorities said.

A Hong Kong man infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu died on Thursday [26 Dec 2013], the 1st such death in the city since the virus emerged there this month. The 80-year-old man was the 2nd reported case of H7N9 infection in Hong Kong after one reported on [2 Dec 2013]. A government spokesman confirmed the death of the man, who had been suffering from other underlying medical conditions. He had been taken to hospital after returning to Hong Kong from the neighbouring city of Shenzhen [Guangdong Province] in mainland China, where he lives. Hong Kong officials have stepped up border checks and traced hundreds who had been in contact with the 2 people infected.

The 1st case involved a 36-year-old Indonesian domestic helper who also had a history of travelling to Shenzhen. Health officials had expected human cases of avian influenza in low winter temperatures, given the number of cases in mainland China. In all, 138 human cases of H7N9 have been reported in mainland China since February with 45 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.

Hong Kong is especially alert to the spread of viruses after an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] swept through the city in 2003, killing 299 people and infecting around 1800.

[It has been assumed that this case was infected with the H7N9 avian influenza virus prior to travel to Hong Kong from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, but this has not yet been confirmed. There has been no evidence of onward transmission of the H7N9 virus in Hong Kong up to the present. The patient had underlying chronic conditions at the time of his arrival in Hong Kong. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
