MALARIA, POSSIBLY RESISTANT - KENYA (KISUMU)

On 29 May 2007, a nurse requested a consultation
at our travel medicine clinic in Biella (Italy),
since she wanted to leave for Kenya for a one
month voluntary service in a hospital. She
decided to take Malarone as malaria
chemoprophylaxis. She left Italy on 20 Jun 2007.
A few days after her arrival in Kisumu (on the
banks of Lake Victoria), she developed a sore
throat and tracheobronchitis and was administered
ampicillin (500 mg/bid) for 4 days. On 6 Jul
2007, while in Nakuru on a 2 day trip, she
developed fever, headache, chills, diarrhea and
general weakness. The following day, she was seen
at a clinic ("John Health Centre") in Nakuru and
was diagnosed with _Plasmodium falciparum_
malaria; the nurse reports that a blood smear was
taken and examined on a microscope slide. She was
treated with Artequin 600/750 (Artesunate 200 mg
and mefloquine 250 mg) once a day for 3 days; on
the 2nd day, the fever disappeared and she felt
well. The nurse is sure that she took Malarone
precisely as it was prescribed, starting a day
before leaving and then daily till she developed
the above reported symptoms. She never had
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea until 6 Jul 2007.
Unfortunately, the slide was not brought to
Italy, so we could not confirm the diagnosis made
in Kenya. I searched ProMED-mail for Malarone
resistance and found no case reported from Kenya.
Have any of your readers observed cases of
Malarone-resistant malaria from Kenya?

[This case does not qualify as a case of
atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone) breakthrough.
Firstly, it is well known that malaria diagnosis
in rural Africa is unreliable, and either the
slide should be brought back or the diagnosis
confirmed by finding malaria-specific antibodies in the blood of the patient.
If this was a recent malaria attack in a
non-immune person, she should have a high titer
of antibodies, and if not, the diagnosis is
doubtful. Even if the patient had malaria, it may
not be resistant to Malarone. Atovaquone is
fat-soluble, and the recommendation is that
Malarone should be taken with a fatty meal.
Failure to do so may result in inadequate blood
levels and malaria breakthroughs despite prophylaxis.
Malaria in travelers taking Malarone has been
reported before (see Kofoed K & Petersen E. The
efficacy of chemophrophylaxis with chloroquine
plus proguanil, mefloquine and atovaquone plus
proguanil against malaria in travellers from
Denmark. J Travel Med. 2003;10:150-4).
The present case shows the importance of
surveillance and reporting, but, with no attempt
to verify the diagnosis or compliance, this case
alone does not indicate the presence of
resistance to Malarone in the Kisumu area of Kenya. - Mod.EP]
