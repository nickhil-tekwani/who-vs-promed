The national Veterinary and Food Administration on Friday [26 Jul
2002]confirmed an outbreak of the Newcastle disease at 42 farms in
western Denmark. "The outbreak certainly will have consequences for
the Danish poultry exports because many countries will close for
imports of Danish poultry products," the agency said in a statement.
In 1999, Denmark exported 133 078 tons of poultry and eggs. The main
Danish export markets are the Middle East, Germany, and Britain,
according to the Danish Poultry Council.
In mid-July, Danish authorities suspected an outbreak of the
contagious and fatal viral disorder. Most of the affected farms are
located in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula, near the
German border. As soon as the suspicions appeared, the Danish
veterinary agency began to destroy thousands of chicken and eggs as a
protective measure. "We decided to act fast," said agency spokesman
Preben Willeberg, adding he believed they expected to be able contain
the outbreak.
The agency on Friday set up safety zones of up to 10 kilometers (6.2
miles) around the affected farms. Within the zones, poultry nor
equipment may be removed without permission.
Veterinary authorities will remove the safety zones in 30 days after
disinfection and cleaning of the farms have been approved.
The Newcastle disease poses no danger to humans.
