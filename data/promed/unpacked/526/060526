In ProMED-mail posting "HIV - Kyrgyzstan: nosocomial transmission, children 20120211.1039333," the moderator stated that: "Whereas Kazakhstan, the former Soviet Republic and northerly neighbour of Kyrgyzstan, has made considerable progress in improving its healthcare infrastructure, it is distressingly obvious that Kyrgyzstan has not so far made comparable progress."

I would like to point out that the per capita (purchasing power parity) GDP of Kazakhstan in 2010 was estimated to be USD 12 700, whereas the comparable figure for the Kyrgyz Republic was USD 2200. Considering how few resources the Kyrgyz Republic has in comparison with its neighbour, it does relatively well.
