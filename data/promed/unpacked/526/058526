CDC confirms new norovirus outbreak linked to New Orleans area oyster beds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new report by the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]
confirmed a new strain of norovirus, which, in Louisiana, "has
sickened dozens and forced the closure of some oyster harvest areas.
Because the strain is new, few people are immune to it causing more
outbreaks," according to a statement from the Louisiana Department of
Health and Hospitals [DHH].

Several oyster beds in Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes were
closed recently due to the norovirus outbreak, though they are being
re-opened Thursday [15 Apr 2010] and Friday [16 Apr 2010] mornings
respectively, after tests determined them to be safe for harvesting
oysters. The beds were closed after tests linked the norovirus
outbreak to those beds.

While norovirus outbreaks are common, according to the CDC, it is
transmitted from person to person, but those infected generally
recover within one to 2 days.

"The CDC name for the new strain, GII.4 New Orleans, includes 'New
Orleans' in the name because the 1st confirmed samples came from the
Crescent City," said the statement from DHH.

People can become infected by eating and drinking food contaminated
by norovirus, touching objects infected and them touching their
mouths, and direct contact with someone infected with norovirus.

DHH tips to avoid becoming infected with norovirus:

- Frequently wash your hands, especially after toilet visits and
changing diapers and before eating or preparing food.

- Carefully wash fruits and vegetables, and fully cook oysters before
eating them.

- Thoroughly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately
after an episode of illness by using a bleach-based household cleaner.

- Immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be
contaminated with virus after an episode of illness (use hot water
and soap).

- Flush or discard any vomitus and/or stool in the toilet and make
sure that the surrounding area is kept clean.

[Noroviruses are a group of related, single-stranded RNA,
non-enveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans.
Noroviruses are part of the larger family _Caliciviridae_. Currently,
there are 5 recognized norovirus genogroups, of which 3 (GI, GII, and
GIV) are known to affect humans. More than 25 different genotypes
have been identified within these genogroups. And since 2002,
variants of the GII.4 genotype have been the most common cause of
norovirus outbreaks.

The Louisiana DHH suggests that since the GII.4 New Orleans norovirus
is a new strain few people will have protective antibodies. This may
be so, but mechanisms of immunity to norovirus infection are unclear
at present. It appears that immunity may be strain-specific and lasts
only a few months; therefore, given the genetic variability of
noroviruses, individuals are likely to be repeatedly infected
throughout their lifetimes. This may explain the high attack rates in
all ages reported in outbreaks. Recent evidence also suggests that
susceptibility to infection may be genetically determined. (Further
