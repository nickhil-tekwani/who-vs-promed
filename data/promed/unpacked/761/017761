Farmers in the Balkans can't find the cause of a kidney disease,
according to a new study that appears to have resolved a decades-long mystery.
The contamination of the region's wheat by the birthwort plant seems
to be the source of an unusual form of kidney failure and urinary
tract cancer that afflicts many people in countries such as Croatia and Serbia.
Researchers believe the finding should spark action by public health
officials to save lives by clearing the birthwort plant from grain
fields across the region.
Since it was 1st formally recognized in 1956, the disease, called
endemic Balkan nephropathy, has perplexed experts, who have
considered various explanations, including groundwater contamination.
Unlike most patients with kidney failure, people with the Balkan
illness often have healthy blood pressure. Nonetheless, as their
kidneys begin to fail, they require dialysis, and about half of them
eventually develop a rare cancer of the upper urinary tract.
Arthur Grollman of the University at Stony Brook, New York, US did
not expect to discover birthwort as the cause of this kidney disease
when he set out for the region a few years ago. Instead, he had
hypothesized that herbal remedies were to blame for this nephropathy.
He knew about the disastrous mix-up in which thousands of healthy
Belgium women developed severe kidney failure requiring transplants
after accidentally receiving the Chinese herbal drug guang fang ji
instead of the similar-sounding han fang ji.
Grollman suspected a similar cause behind the endemic Balkan
nephropathy, so he surveyed patients in dialysis clinics in the
region on whether they had taken any herbal medicines. But none
reported taking such supplements.
Disappointed that his theory had proven wrong, Grollman headed for
home, but not before spending a final afternoon in a library in
Zagreb, the Croatian capital. There, he came across a striking
description from the 1930s about how horses in the region had
developed kidney failure after grazing on a plant known as
_Aristolochia clematis_, also known as birthwort. Grollman
immediately cancelled his flight and set off to meet Balkan farmers.
A survey of their fields and mills revealed that some of their wheat
was indeed contaminated with _Aristolochia clematis_ seed. Back in
the lab, Grollman and his colleagues examined kidney samples from
Croatian nephropathy patients. They found the same telltale signs of
DNA damage linked to _Aristolochia clematis_ as seen in animal studies.
For example, they found specific cancerous mutations in a gene called
p53 known to arise from the aristolochic acid, a chemical found in
birthwort. And chemical analysis revealed metabolites of the plant
stuck to the patients' DNA in a disruptive way.
Grollman says 100 000 people are at risk of nephropathy in the
Balkans as a result of inadvertently eating birthwort. He says he
would "like to make sure that the public health officials take action
on this." Local farmers need government assistance to weed out the
plant, as many of them cannot afford herbicide, he adds.
Grollman also notes that birthwort has been used as an herbal remedy,
being given to mothers following birth because it reputedly helped to
expel the placenta. But he doubts birthwort has any genuine medicinal
value and stresses that "the toxic effects far outweigh any potential
good effects."

[It is not uncommon for grains to become contaminated with various
other grains, weeds, or mycotoxins. Aflatoxin in corn is an example,
as is ergot in rye. Birthwort is of the family _Aristolochiaceae_, so
it stands to reason it may contain aristocholic acid.
Aristolochia means "excellent birth" and refers to the traditional
use of the fresh juice to induce labor. (Ingestion would be toxic, so
it is likely used externally as some type of rub or poultice.) The
Indian Root (possibly another name for the plant) was used mainly in
childbirth. In England, it was known as birthwort and used for this
purpose (assisting in birth, expelling the child or the afterbirth).
Theophrastus (c. 372-286 BCE) records that the plant was used to
treat disorders of the uterus, reptile bites, and sores to the head.
(The reference does not tell us what disorders of the uterus.)
Of the 350 or so species of _Aristolochia_, several carry the common
name of snakeroot because many of the species were used by Native
Americans to treat snake bites. They also employed the plants to
treat stomachaches, toothaches, and fevers.
In the 16th century, when Francisco Hernandez was cataloging the
flora of "New Spain," he came across a plant that looked the same as
the herb he knew back in Europe. The Mexican species, however, can
have enormous flowers. He reported that the Aztecs used it to treat
abscesses, dysentery, deafness, and various other ailments.
Other uses of the plant have been identified as:
--Birthwort was formerly used induce labor, and, when taken after
childbirth, it prevented infection while inducing menstruation.
--A decoction was taken to heal ulcers as well as for asthma and bronchitis.
--It was also used to treat wounds, sores, and snakebites. Poultices
and infusions were used by Native Americans for snakebites. It was
also used for this purpose in the Amazon.
--Although used in China for lung disorders, pain, and fluid
retention, Germany has banned the plant because of the toxicity of
aristolochic acid. It is used in a wide variety of ways in nearly all
European countries.
--It was also considered a strong fever remedy.
--In the Sudan, it is used for scorpion stings.
--In Iran, the European variety is used as a tonic and to induce menstruation.
--In India, it is used as a contraceptive.
--In Mexico, it has long been recommended for snake bite, and,
interestingly, half a world away in Taiwan, a 1974 study of another
species also effectively inactivated snake venom.
--It is used to stimulate the immune system as well as in the
treatment of allergic gastrointestinal and gallbladder colic.
--In Chinese medicine, it is used for joint pain, stomachache,
malaria, and abscesses.
--Homeopathic uses include gynecological disorders and in the
treatment of wounds and ulcers.
--It has been used in treatment after major surgery and in
ear-nose-throat treatments.
--Duck Flower has a number of reported uses in Central America.
Generally not available in the US, it is available south of that
border. Michael Balick and Rosita Arvigo state that it is one of the
most popular herbal remedies used in Belize, where decoctions and
infusions are commonly made from the vine. It can often be seen
soaking in a bottle of rum in saloons, since it is taken by the shot
for hangovers, flu, flatulence, late menstrual periods, and irregular
heartbeat. However, it is advised that it be used under the guidance
of a knowledgeable professional, as it is poisonous and contains a
mutagen and carcinogenic.
Birthwort is _Aristolochia clematitis_. The root and stem are
poisonous (19). The plant contains aristolochic acid, which,
according to some, has received rather mixed reports on its toxicity.
According to one report, aristolochic acid stimulates white blood
cell activity and speeds the healing of wounds, but is also
carcinogenic and damaging to the kidneys (254). Another report says
that it is an active anti-tumor agent but is too toxic for clinical
use (218). Another report says that aristolochic acid has anti-cancer
properties and can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy and that it also increases the cellular immunity and
phagocytosis function of the phagocytic cells (176).
Birthwort has a very long history of medicinal use, though it has
been poorly researched scientifically and has been barely used by
present-day herbalists (254, 268). It is an aromatic tonic herb that
stimulates the uterus, reduces inflammation, controls bacterial
infections and promotes healing (238). The juice from the stems was
used to induce childbirth (268). The plant contains aristolochic
acid, which, while stimulating white blood cell activity (presumably
this is to increase immunity) and speeding the healing of wounds, is
also carcinogenic and damaging to the kidneys (254). The flowering
herb, with or without the root, is abortifacient, anti-inflammatory,
antispasmodic, diaphoretic, an emmenagogue, febrifuge, oxytocic and a
stimulant (7, 9, 21, 100, 200). Another report says that the root is
used on its own (238), while a 3rd says that either the fresh
flowering herb or the dried rootstock can be used (268) (for
medicinal purposes). The plant should not be used internally without
experienced supervision; externally, it is used in the treatment of
slow-healing cuts, eczema, infected toes and fingernails, etc. (9).
Use with caution; internal consumption can cause damage to the
kidneys and uterine bleeding (7, 9, 21). It should not be used by
pregnant women (238).
