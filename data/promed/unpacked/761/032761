SCHISTOSOMIASIS - EUROPEAN UNION: 2007, IMPORTED CASES

A preliminary analysis of sentinel surveillance data of the European
Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop)
shows 88 cases of imported schistosomiasis for 2007: (17 cases of
_Schistosoma haematobium_, 44 of _S. mansoni_, 3 of _S. japonicum_,
and 27 unknown species, e.g. early stage, Katayama fever) [1].

Although clinical reporting data for schistosomiasis are notoriously
difficult to assess due to the chronic nature of the disease and thus
very long periods before diagnosis is confirmed, the analysis gives a
good idea about how this infection is brought into Europe.

Reported patients with schistosomiasis are predominantly male (71.6
percent male, 28.4 percent female). Median age has declined in
comparison to recent years and is now at 25 years, (32 years in
2005). The proportion of immigrants in the total patient population
remains at 53 percent (43.6 percent in 2005). Main purposes of travel
reported by infected Europeans were tourism (47 percent) and
missionary/humanitarian work (29 percent).

Unlike in 2006, but very much like in previous years, West Africa
contributed the most cases. Infections from countries outside Africa
do occur, but are very rare. In 2007, most infections were reported
to have been imported from Mali, Senegal, Ghana, Democratic Republic
of the Congo, and Uganda. [see Figure 1 at above given URL link for
geographic distribution of country of origin of schistosomiasis
infection. - Mod.MPP]

A high percentage of patients (59 percent) were asymptomatic when
infection established itself.

Diagnosis has to be sought actively in those patients who have been
exposed. In those with clinical complaints, symptoms were quite
unspecific. Most patients complained about fever, respiratory and
genitourinary symptoms. Once diagnosed, the clinical management was
straightforward: the majority of patients were treated on an
outpatient basis. Only 8 percent were admitted as inpatients, and
they were kept for a median of 4 days. All patients were cured with
praziquantel.

Since a simple and effective therapy is available, schistosomiasis
should be considered for differential diagnosis when dealing with
patients who might have been exposed in areas where this disease is endemic.

[The number of cases, 88, is surprisingly low, as 53 percent of the
cases are reported in immigrants from endemic areas. Schistosomiasis
is often asymptomatic in short term travelers exposed only over a
short time to _Schistosoma_, and low-level infection will be
undiagnosed unless screening is done with assays based on detection
of _Schistosoma_-specific antibodies. - Mod.EP]
