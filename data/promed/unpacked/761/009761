Over 1200 cows have been slaughtered in the Russian Far East by Tue, 6 Sep
2005. They were diagnosed with foot and mouth disease [FMD].
The animals contracted the Asia-1 virus. Animals have been affected in 7
districts in the Primorsky (Maritime) territory and in 2 [districts] in
Khabarovsk territory, the Emergency Situations Ministry said on Tuesday.
Veterinarians are inoculating the animals. They have vaccinated 140 000
cows, goats and swine.
An emergency situations regime has been introduced in the Primorsky
territory. Round-the-clock disinfection posts and sanitary check posts are
set up there. Roads to the villages where animals have FMD are blocked by
traffic police. The 1st case of the disease was registered in the territory
on 26 Aug 2005.
FMD has also affected western Europe. The largest outbreaks were registered
in 2001 in Great Britain, where 200 000 head of cattle were slaughtered in
6 months in 8 counties in England. Over 2000 farms were affected by the FMD
outbreak. The British Ministry of Agriculture was then sustaining weekly
losses of 8 million pounds sterling [USD 14.78 million].

Outbreaks of FMD have been reported in 13 populated areas of Russia near
the Chinese border as of 5 Sep 2005, according to the [Russian] Federal
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service.
The Agriculture Ministry said in a press release that FMD cases have been
registered in 4 populated areas in the Khabarovsk region and in 9 in
Primorye. [For maps of Primorye and Khabarovsk see
<http://map.rin.ru/maps_e/Primorsk.gif> and
<http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/maps/fareast.gif>].
Infected animals are slaughtered, quarantine has been imposed, and
vaccination of healthy livestock is underway, the press release says.
China's Ministry of Agriculture has said they have no information that the
disease has crossed the border and would take immediate action if such an
event occurred.

[The statement by China's Ministry of Agriculture about action to be taken
"if the disease crosses the border" (from Russia) is rather puzzling; this,
in view of the clear circumstantial evidence (in the absence of official
reports) that China's territory must be widely contaminated with FMD Asia
1. The disease seems to have spread therefrom to several neighbouring
countries since early 2005 (see FAO statement, 24 Jun 2005, in
20050624.1774, as well as other postings). - Mod.AS]

More than 370 new cases of foot and mouth disease were detected in 7
districts of the Maritime territory as of Tuesday. The affected areas are
the Luchegorsk, Kirovsky, Kamen-Rybolov, Spassk-Dalny, Mikhailovsky,
Slavyanka, and Khorol districts, the regional veterinary service told
Itar-Tass.
The largest outbreak occurred in the village of Sivakovka, Khorol district,
where FMD sickened 282 cows. No new FMD cases were registered in the
village of Krasny Kut, Spassk-Dalny district, where all the sick animals
had been slaughtered. All the FMD-hit settlements have been quarantined.
Veterinary services have already culled 530 cattle and buried the animals
in special burial grounds with strictest precautions.
Primary inoculation of all 100 000 cattle against the Asia-1 serotype has
been completed in the region. A 2nd vaccination is due in a week. [Will
this be a booster vaccination, or a 2nd stage of the vaccination campaign,
this time to cover young, yet unvaccinated animals? - Mod.AS]
The 1st case of FMD was registered in the village of Krasny Kut on 26 Aug
2005. Specialists said the outbreak of the infection this week had been
caused by the inoculation, which helped expose the animals suffering from
mild or latent disease. [Probably, the sentence should have said: ..."the
infection this week has been exposed during the visits of vaccination teams
to the farms where animals were suffering from mild disease"?! In view of
the unfortunate continued absence of official notifications, various
interpretations might be made. - Mod.AS]

[The Primorsky Krai, also known as "Primorye", is one of Russia's 89
federal subjects (also referred to as "members of the Federation"). Krai is
a term used to refer to several of Russia's administrative units. Primorsky
means maritime in Russian, hence the region is sometimes referred to as the
Maritime Province. It is located at the southern extreme of the Russian Far
East (one of Russia's 7 main administrative divisions), bordering China,
North Korea, and the Khabarovsk Krai, and separated from Japan by the Sea
of Japan. - Mod.AS]
