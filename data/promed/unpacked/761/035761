Gold Coast horse dies from hendra virus
---------------------------------------
There has been another confirmed case of hendra virus in Queensland. A
horse on a property in the Currumbin Valley in the Gold Coast
hinterland has died after testing positive to the virus.

Chief veterinarian Dr Rick Symons says authorities were called to the
horse-breeding property about 10:00pm on Monday [22 Aug 2011]. "The
horse was unsteady on its feet and had a[n elevated] temperature," he
said. "The vet suspected hendra virus, took samples and sent it to the
Biosecurity laboratory."

Biosecurity Queensland says 23 horses are on the site and one has
tested positive.

Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says 2 people may have been
exposed -- the vet and the property owner -- and there are more people
on the site. "I have staff out on the property who are assessing who's
been exposed," she said.

A total of 20 horses infected with hendra have died or been put down
since 20 Jun 2011 (11 in Queensland and 9 in New South Wales) and more
than 60 people have been tested. The hendra virus is transferred from
flying foxes to people through horses, and the outbreaks have prompted
calls for flying fox populations to be culled. The virus was also
detected in a dog that had come into contact with infected horses.

Researchers are currently working on a hendra vaccine for horses, and
the Queensland and NSW governments, along with the Federal Government,
have promised AUD 12 million [USD 12 618 545] for research into the
virus.

Gold Coast Councillor Ted Shepherd has renewed his call for every
flying fox colony on the Gold Coast to be checked for the virus. "We
now need to get an assurance from the Minister that they will come
down and test these colonies on the Gold Coast to determine if there
is hendra there," he said. "And if there is hendra there, the State
Government must release the legislation to allow the colonies to be
culled."

[One has to wonder if the risk of testing flying foxes is worth
potentially exposing the humans who would have to do the testing.

While I am not a bat expert, I suspect that stressing the bat colonies
with testing, and/or depopulation may cause more bats to shed the
virus. I am uncertain if there is enough research in the flying foxes
to understand why they shed virus. If they shed virus all the time,
then we would have constant outbreaks of deaths and illnesses related
to hendra virus. This is not the case. Consequently some factor has to
trigger the bats to shed the virus.

Horse owners need to realize that the flying foxes are attracted to
fruit trees and fruit. Thus, removing the fruit trees from the equine
paddocks or keeping the horses out of areas where the fruit trees are
when there is fruit is a key to help protect the horses and the owners
themselves.

These flying foxes are extremely messy eaters, slobbering quite a lot,
and when horses graze nearby they are likely to be exposed to the
virus.

It would be helpful if the new vaccine were far enough along in its
development to be field tested now. - Mod.TG]
