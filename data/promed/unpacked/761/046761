[The most recent update (until 16 Jan 2020) on the epidemiological situation of avian influenza in Poland can be seen at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20200116_hpai-h5n8_pol.pdf.

"Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species.

The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.

Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans."
