AFP cases: 1
Environment: 1

Headlines
- This week, the world's largest conference on gender equality and the health, rights, and well-being of girls and women is happening in Vancouver, Canada. Women are truly delivering a polio-free world. The GPEI proudly recognizes women's valuable contributions in the fight against polio. For more information on women on the frontlines, please see http://polioeradication.org/gender-and-polio/women-on-the-frontlines-of-polio-eradication/.

- In Papua New Guinea, a GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.

- On [Tue 4 Jun 2019], The Lancet published the results of the 1st in-human, phase 1 clinical trial for nOPV2, a key 1st step toward determining the potential for a novel type-2 oral polio vaccine that would provide the same level of protection against type-2 poliovirus as OPV without the same risk of reverting into cVDPV2 in under-immunized populations. These initial results are promising and suggest the vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults; further clinical trial results will be important to evaluate nOPV as a potential tool to sustain a world free from all types of polioviruses [see section [3] below].

- The GPEI Semi-Annual Status Report covering the reporting period July-December 2018 is available online, reporting against the major objectives of the Polio Endgame Plan 2013-2018. The GPEI will continue to publish its Semi-Annual Status Reports to track progress against the newly launched Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case;
- Pakistan - 2 new WPV1 cases and 16 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Niger - 1 cVDPV2 case; and
- Nigeria - 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week from Kunar province, with onset of paralysis on 8 May [2019], bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2019 to 8.
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week from Bannu district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (with onset of paralysis on [14 and 19 May 2019]), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 to 21.
- 16 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, all collected in May [2019] from different provinces across the country (Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab).

Nigeria
- 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Kwara state, collected on [27 Apr 2019]. There are 8 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported in the country since the one detected from Borno state with a date of onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- Recent confirmation of spread of the cVDPV2 outbreak, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- In Cameroon, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was detected from an environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only; no associated cases of paralysis have been detected.
- The affected province borders Borno, Nigeria, and genetic sequencing confirms it is related to cVDPV2 circulating in neighbouring Nigeria. This outbreak originated in Jigawa state and had previously spread to other areas of Nigeria, as well as internationally to the Republic of Niger.
- Cameroon had already been participating in outbreak response to the Nigeria cVDPV2 across the Lake Chad subregion.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required.
- This event further underlines the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 across the Lake Chad basin.
- In Niger, 1 new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week from Diffa province, with onset of paralysis on [3 Apr 2019]. It is the 1st cVDPV2 case from the country in 2019, and the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria.
- Acute flaccid paralysis [AFP] surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo):
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). So far, one cVDPV case has been reported in DR Congo in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DR Congo is currently affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri; and Kasai.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 14 cVDPV cases (7 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks.
- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health-worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia, and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains one.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week. In total, 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, both from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[The 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the above weekly summary were reported earlier through media reports and the End Polio Pakistan reports, reinforcing the value of EBS (event-based surveillance) activities for early warning and recognition of health events of significance globally. (See Poliomyelitis update (41): Afghanistan, Pakistan, global 20190531.6495396 and Poliomyelitis update (42): Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia 20190603.6500037.) In addition, there is a 22nd case reported via the End Polio Pakistan website yesterday [Wed 5 Jun 2019] that will most likely be reported in next week's weekly update. (See Poliomyelitis update (43): Pakistan (KPTD) 20190605.6505194.)

What is impressive is the isolation of 16 WPV1 in the past week in Pakistan involving all of the provinces. This signifies widespread circulation of the WPV1, and given the increasing vaccine hesitancy (a politically correct way of referring to the anti-vaccine movement), this finding is very disconcerting, as the pockets of susceptibles have clearly grown to support continued widespread circulation of the WPV.

As for the cVDPVs, the identification of another case of AFP associated with cVDPV2 in Nigeria and in a new province in Niger is a sign the virus is in continued circulation, presenting a continued threat to other countries in the region. As a reminder, back in 2004-2006, Nigeria was a major exporter of WPV after experiencing increases in vaccine refusals in the northern states. As history is famous for repeating itself unless preventive measures are taken, the continued circulation of the cVDPVs in Nigeria with evidence of spread to Niger and Cameroon warrants significant concern regarding continued spread to other countries.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Cameroon [6 Jun 2019]
-------------------------------
On 23 May 2019, WHO received notification through the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from an environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in a hospital in Northern Cameroon, which borders Borno state in Nigeria and Chad. In this region, the vaccine coverage in 2018 for inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV1) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3) was 73% and 72%, respectively. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only; no associated cases of paralysis have been detected so far.

Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolate is associated with the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in neighboring Nigeria, which originated in Jigawa state and spread to other areas of Nigeria as well as internationally to the Republic of Niger in 2018.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health and local health authorities have been involved in the response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria and across the Lake Chad subregion (Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria) by providing monovalent type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2). A thorough investigation of the incident is ongoing with the support of partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and includes assessing the extent of circulation of this strain, identifying subnational immunity gaps, and supporting efforts to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity.

WHO risk assessment
This event highlights the risk of renewed international spread of cVDPV2 from Nigeria and the rest of the Lake Chad region, given the large-scale population movement, subnational immunity, and surveillance gaps across the Lake Chad region. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.

WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation and risk assessment by national authorities.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, particularly those reporting frequent travel to polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect imported cases and facilitate a rapid response. All countries should maintain a high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the impact of new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, which requires an outbreak of poliovirus to be declared as a national public health emergency and all international travellers to be vaccinated. Likewise, countries with the risk of exporting poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.

[Vaccination coverages of less than 80% in the areas where the cVDPV2 was identified are disconcerting, as they are lower than the accepted rates necessary for herd immunity, where circulation of a poliovirus (both wild and vaccine derived) can be blocked by high levels of immunity. As the virus isolated is genetically related to the cVDPV2 in the Jigawa outbreak, it reinforces the concerns re: international spread from Nigeria. - Mod.MPP]

Summary
Background
Use of oral live-attenuated polio vaccines (OPV) and injected inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) has almost achieved global eradication of wild polio viruses. To address the goals of achieving and maintaining global eradication and minimising the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-derived polioviruses, we tested novel monovalent oral type-2 poliovirus (OPV2) vaccine candidates that are genetically more stable than existing OPVs, with a lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence. Our study represents the 1st in-human testing of these 2 novel OPV2 candidates. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines, the presence and extent of faecal shedding, and the neurovirulence of shed virus.

Methods
In this double-blind, single-centre phase 1 trial, we isolated participants in a purpose-built containment facility at the University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium) to minimise the risk of environmental release of the novel OPV2 candidates. Participants, who were recruited by local advertising, were adults (aged 18-50 years) in good health who had previously been vaccinated with IPV and who would not have any contact with immunosuppressed or unvaccinated people for the duration of faecal shedding at the end of the study. The 1st participant randomly chose an envelope containing the name of a vaccine candidate, and this determined their allocation; the next 14 participants to be enrolled in the study were sequentially allocated to this group and received the same vaccine. The subsequent 15 participants enrolled after this group were allocated to receive the other vaccine. Participants and the study staff were masked to vaccine groups until the end of the study period. Participants each received a single dose of one vaccine candidate (candidate 1, S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3; or candidate 2, S2/S15domV/CpG40), and they were monitored for adverse events, immune responses, and faecal shedding of the vaccine virus for 28 days. Shed virus isolates were tested for the genetic stability of attenuation. The primary outcomes were the incidence and type of serious and severe adverse events, the proportion of participants showing viral shedding in their stools, the time to cessation of viral shedding, the cell culture infective dose of shed virus in virus-positive stools, and a combined index of the prevalence, duration, and quantity of viral shedding in all participants. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2017-000908-21 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03430349.

Findings
Between 22 May and 22 Aug 22 2017, 48 volunteers were screened, of whom 15 (31%) volunteers were excluded for reasons relating to the inclusion or exclusion criteria, 3 (6%) volunteers were not treated because of restrictions to the number of participants in each group, and 30 (63%) volunteers were sequentially allocated to groups (15 participants per group). Both novel OPV2 candidates were immunogenic and increased the median blood titre of serum neutralising antibodies; all participants were seroprotected after vaccination. Both candidates had acceptable tolerability, and no serious adverse events occurred during the study. However, severe events were reported in 6 (40%) participants receiving candidate 1 (8 events) and 9 (60%) participants receiving candidate 2 (12 events); most of these events were increased blood creatinine phosphokinase but were not accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccine virus was detected in the stools of 15 (100%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 1 and 13 (87%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 2. Vaccine poliovirus shedding stopped at a median of 23 days (IQR 15-36) after candidate 1 administration and 12 days (1-23) after candidate 2 administration. Total shedding, described by the estimated median shedding index (50% cell culture infective dose/g), was observed to be greater with candidate 1 than candidate 2 across all participants (2.8 [95% CI 1.8-3.5] vs 1.0 [0.7-1.6]). Reversion to neurovirulence, assessed as paralysis of transgenic mice, was low in isolates from those vaccinated with both candidates, and sequencing of shed virus indicated that there was no loss of attenuation in domain V of the 5'-untranslated region, the primary site of reversion in Sabin OPV.

Interpretation
We found that the novel OPV2 candidates were safe and immunogenic in IPV-immunised adults, and our data support the further development of these vaccines to potentially be used for maintaining global eradication of neurovirulent type-2 polioviruses.

[ProMED-mail does not usually post on phase 1 vaccine or drug trials, as the volume of novel vaccines and drugs that do not go on to the final stages of testing is quite high. That being said, this piece is being posted as an example of the important research and development that is ongoing to eliminate the problem seen with cVDPV2 in countries where vaccination coverages have fallen, leaving large pockets of susceptibles to continue transmission of the vaccine viruses and ultimate reversion of neurovirulence making the vaccine part of the problem in the polio eradication effort. A reminder of the preliminary nature of this study is that it takes at least a year with multiple passages in different individuals before the oral vaccine virus mutates into a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus with polio-like neurovirulence. This study looked mostly at the safety (for adverse events) and the seroconversion rate (or serologic booster rate, as all participants had been previously fully vaccinated), leaving many of the known issues still unaddressed at present.

Not meaning to be a skeptic, I'm just cautioning against a premature conclusion that the problem with the OPV2 virus has been resolved. It is great that there is active research to address this very present obstacle to interruption of transmission of all polioviruses, both wild as well as vaccine derived. - Mod.MPP]
