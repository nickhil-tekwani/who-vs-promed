Investigators have found a strain of the plague bacteria _Yersinia
pestis_ in the body of a University of Chicago geneticist who died last
week [13 Sep 2009] within 12 hours of his arrival at Bernard Mitchell
Hospital with "intense flu-like symptoms." The autopsy did not identify
a cause of death, according to the Chicago Tribune.

No other cases have been reported in Chicago, and none of the other
researchers exposed to the strain, used as a vaccine since the 1960s,
has fallen ill, but officials gave antibiotics to his family, friends,
and co-workers. Ken Alexander, head of pediatric infectious disease
said that the autopsy did not imply that the strain of the plague was a
public health threat. He told the Chicago Tribune that "the more likely
possibility, I'd say 999 to 1, is that there was something unusual
about him."

In this posting, it is stated that severe influenza-like symptoms
(presumably myalgias, fever, and rigors) occurred with death occurring
within 12 hours of admission. These symptoms can be found in many acute
illnesses but certainly suggest strongly that the bacterial isolate
(presumably grown from a blood culture) was a pathogen here.

The statement that the strain has been "used as a vaccine" suggests
that the strain may be the EV76 mutant. This prototypic live,
attenuated vaccine strain has lost its pigment phenotype, absorbs
pigments from agar, produces a sideraphore called yersiniabactin and
causes a lethal disease after subcutaneous inoculation of laboratory
animals (1). The strain was originally reported by Girard and Robic in
1936 (2).

ProMED-mail and its readers await more definitive information regarding
the clinical illness and characteristics of the isolated strain.
