As many 17 new cases of scrub typhus infection have been reported in Chitwan in a week, pushing the number of patients in the district to 162 in the last 4 months [May-August 2016]. According to the District Public Health Office, Chitwan, a total of 17 people were found to have been infected with the bacterial disease in the examination of 70 patients.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, an obligate intracellular Gram negative bacterium, which is transmitted to humans and rodents by chigger mites.

The district public health officer Madhusudan Koirala said that blood tests showed that 162 out of 400 persons have contracted the disease since April [2016], and 5 persons have been reported dead due to the infection since April. A team of Epidemiology and Diseases Control Division has arrived to Chitwan district for further research on scrub typhus.

A total of 13 people have died due to scrub typhus across the country in the past one year. 277 people were found infected with the bacterial disease since it was first diagnosed in the country in 2015.

"Laboratory test of blood sample collected from the patients at Dharan-based BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences confirmed the disease in August last year [2015]. Scrub typhus may have been causing illness and fatalities before as well, but the disease was not identified in the country until last year [2015]," said Dr Guna Nidhi Sharma, deputy health administrator at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, during an interaction in Chitwan.

Scrub typhus is an acute, febrile, infectious illness that is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and if untreated, could lead to death. Rodents are the main vectors of the disease. Scrub typhus is transmitted to humans and rodents by some species of trombiculid mites.

According to the data compiled by the division, 101 people were diagnosed with scrub typhus as of mid-April, 2016. As many as 8 of the patients lost their lives, 5 among them in the last 5 months.

Scrub typhus had mostly affected the people from Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura, Dhading, Nuwakot, Sankhuwasabha and Khotang last year [2015]. This year [2016], the disease has also been detected in people from Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Dhankuta, Bhojpur, Gorkha, Baglung and Parsa. In Chitwan alone, 145 scrub typhus cases were diagnosed.

Dr Dayaram Lamsal, director of the Chitwan Medical College and Teaching Hospital, said Chitwan had a high number of diagnosed cases because people from other parts of the country also visit the district for treatment.
