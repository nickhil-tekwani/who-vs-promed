Three hundred additional emergency workers will arrive at Mangrove Mountain
north of Sydney today and tomorrow in an effort to eradicate the worst
outbreak of exotic disease among animals in Australian history.
The teams, many travelling from Queensland, come as fears grow that the
highly contagious Newcastle disease could spread beyond the 30 chicken
farms now in quarantine and being destocked.
The discovery of the disease has alarmed the $2 billion chicken meat
industry. More than 100,000 chickens are being killed each day using carbon
dioxide gas and the total number to be eradicated is expected to reach 2
million.
But there are grave fears that another 3 million chickens in the
surrounding districts of Peats Ridge and Somersby may also need to be
destroyed.
The chief veterinary officer for NSW Agriculture, Dick Jane, said more than
600,000 birds had been slaughtered so far, with about one-third of the
properties being destocked as a precautionary measure.
Australian Chicken Growers Council president Gary Sansom described the
outbreak as "a total disaster." "It is a major logistical exercise," he
said. "There appears to have been a genetic change in a local version of
the disease, which is usually harmless."
