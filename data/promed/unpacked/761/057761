Measles outbreaks in Solwezi
----------------------------
Measles has broken out in Solwezi with more than 68 cases reported so far.
Solwezi District commissioner Frobisher Fulayi confirmed the epidemic which
is mainly concentrated in the densely populated areas of Kyawama and Zambia
compounds, but was spreading fast.

"We have 40 cases of admissions at Solwezi General hospital and 28 at Urban
clinic. We are badly hit. There is no death recorded so far, but the
situation is getting out of hand; it's intensifying. The most affected are
babies aged 9 months and below and those above 5 years," he said.

Fulayi said the hospital and the clinic were not taking in any more cases
as there was no more bed space available. He, however, said his office was
in the process of bringing in more beds from Meheba refugee resettlement
and Katandano Zambia National Service camp and further engaging the army
for tents regarding over spilling cases at the 2 health institutions.

Fulayi appealed to Solwezi residents to report any suspected cases of
measles to health centres.
