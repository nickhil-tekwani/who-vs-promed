Then it would seem that a question that begs to be addressed is: Would the
same procedure work on bovine for BSE? Is the test for prions in general
and if so, is there some specific reason that it would/not work on bovines?

Can Robert LaBudde provide more specific references than "ANIMALNET and media
sources" for the USDA's $25 Scrapie's test? Thanks.

[Bob merely scanned what the USDA PR put out. We have had other requests of
a similar nature so I have asked Dr Joan Arnoldi, deputy administrator for
veterinary services of the USDA's Animal Health and Plant Inspection
Service, to have one of her people prepare a more authoritative
communication. This might also answer Tam's query. Hopefully Joan Arnoldi
will be quick but in the meanwhile if any other person should have
information on this test, would they please share it with us. Mod MHJ]
