Organophosphate Food Poisoning: Case Study in India
In many developing countries, widespread use of organophosphate
insecticides (OPs) has been accompanied by an appreciable increase in
accidental poisoning with these chemicals. A report in the British Journal
of Medicine highlights the dangers of indiscriminate use of
organophosphates and stresses the importance of early and accurate
identification of the cause of food poisoning outbreaks. According to the
report, this increase in poisonings is often a result of the easy
availability of OPs, indiscriminate handling and storage, and lack of
knowledge about the serious consequences of poisoning. Increased use of OPs
as agricultural and household insecticides without accompanying public
education about proper storage or dangers associated with their use
increases the likelihood of more food poisoning incidents.
The report calls for health professionals to know the symptoms associated
with organophosphate poisoning so that they can differentiate between these
and neurological symptoms caused by other forms of poisoning. Based on
their research, the authors believe that skilled, prompt treatment can save
lives.
The authors use an incident that occurred in India in July 1997 as a case
study. Sixty men aged 20 to 30 years attended a communal lunch where they
ate chapati, vegetables, pulses and halva. All sixty developed nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain over the next three hours. They were taken to a
local primary healthcare center where they received treatment for their
symptoms (intravenous fluids, antiemetics and antibiotics). Fifty-six
responded to the treatment and were discharged the same day. However, the
condition of the remaining four patients deteriorated. Their level of
consciousness decreased and they developed respiratory distress and
muscular weakness. The next day the four men were moved to an urban
emergency hospital.
One of these patients, a 20 year-old man admitted with a range of symptoms
(including sweating, impaired consciousness, hypotension and muscle
weakness) began having difficulty breathing on the second day, and was
eventually placed on a ventilator. Despite continuing treatment of his
symptoms, he developed respiratory failure and muscle paralysis and died of
cardiac arrest on the tenth day. The other three patients responded to
treatment and were discharged a week later.
Detailed questioning of those who had been working in the communal kitchen
where lunch had been cooked revealed that on the morning of the outbreak
the kitchen had been sprayed with malathion, an organophosphate
insecticide. Many of the cooking ingredients used for the lunch were stored
in open jute bags. All 60 people who had eaten the meal developed symptoms,
but the patient who died had eaten at least eight chapati, while the others
had eaten only three or four. Laboratory testing of leftover food from the
shared lunch revealed the presence of an organophosphate compound, but no
other toxins or chemicals.
Due to the severity of his illness, health care workers initially suspected
botulism as the cause of his symptoms. When test results for botulism
proved negative, hospital staff ordered additional analysis of the
patients' gastric fluids. A positive test for organophosphate poisoning was
obtained nine days after the onset of illness. All of the men hospitalized
developed symptoms more consistent with organophosphate poisoning than
botulism. However, the early onset of certain intermediate symptoms had not
been described previously with malathion, but rather with other OPs. This
added to the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis. This delay in
diagnosis, evaluation and management of the malathion poisoning resulted in
the death of patient who might otherwise have survived had he received
early appropriate treatment.
The article concludes by issuing a reminder "...to epidemiologists,
toxicologists, and microbiologists that organophosphate food poisoning is a
continuing hazard, especially in developing countries. Health professionals
should be familiar with the acute illness syndromes associated with
organophosphate poisoning so that they can differentiate between these and
the neurological symptoms caused by other forms of poisoning."
