[It is now 12 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 12 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 5 in Guangdong, 4 in Heilongjiang and 3 in Beijing. It has now been 22 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 10 days or so.

According to the report above, a total of 82 341 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3342 deaths, representing an increase of 46 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (14 Apr 2020) report, and no new reported death.

There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

The 24-hour change between 14 & 15 Apr 2020 was 2667 newly confirmed cases. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (62 153), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (21 029), Veneto (14 624), and Piedmont (18 229). These 4 provinces combined account for 70.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is still the main contributor representing 37.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 37 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 35 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details)

[4] Iran: 74 877 total cases, 4683 deaths
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2020
Source: Al monitor [edited]
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/worst-case-report-iran-coronavirus-virus-covid19-isolation.html


In a grim estimate, a prestigious Tehran-based research center found that up to 75% of the Iranian population could test positive for the coronavirus if isolation measures are not implemented.

The assessment by the Iranian parliament's research center, based on Health Ministry epidemiological models, says nearly 30 000 Iranians could die of the virus if only 10% of workable containment policies are in place. The mortality figure could collapse to 6000, however, provided that 40% of social distancing restrictions are robustly observed.

The 46-page document warns that a peak in Iran could be as far away as November, when a 2nd wave may await the population. The study evaluated the government's current response planning as "acceptable," unlike its "weak" handling at the outset.

Iran announced 94 new deaths on [15 Apr 2020], marking a 2nd day of a 2-digit mortality rate. More than half of Iranian provinces are witnessing significant drops in positive cases, according to Health Ministry statistics, with confirmed daily infections falling somewhere between zero to 20.

The situation in the capital Tehran, nonetheless, remained alarming. Nahid Khodakarami, a female member of the Tehran City Council, challenged the official mortality reports, saying that in the most optimistic estimate, at least 70 people are dying on a daily basis in Tehran. She said the discrepancy was because "acute respiratory symptom" is the official cause for many COVID-19 deaths.

Amid the pandemic, Iran has waged a parallel battle to finance its response, attempting to get US-imposed international banking restrictions lifted. Last week, the governor of Iran's central bank, Abdolnasser Hemmati, declared that 1.6 billion USD -- frozen by a Luxembourg bank due to US pressure -- had found its way back home. Officials in Luxembourg, however, clarified that a final decision resided with the country's highest court and the funds had yet to be sent. Later, Hemmati told Iran's state TV that even further seizure of the amount "will not be the end of the world" for Iran, as it is pressing to unfreeze "a lot more of such funds held overseas."

Elsewhere, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif lamented on Twitter the "US regime's bullying" that "kills people" amid the coronavirus pandemic and will leave behind a memory of "infamy" among Iranians. His American counterpart Mike Pompeo has stated that Washington is ready for "real humanitarian assistance to the Iranian people." But, according to Pompeo, cash aid will not end up in the right hands in Iran and will be used by the state "for corrupt purposes." Medical supplies and other humanitarian imports are exempt from US sanctions.

Mounting a fresh, rosy defense of his government's crisis management, President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on [15 Apr 2020] that even with sanctions in force, not a single coronavirus patient has been turned away from Iranian hospitals during the outbreak.

Despite its relentless complaints about US measures interfering with the pandemic response, Iran has in recent weeks taken pride in self-reliance, with a list of "new achievements" -- mostly claimed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) -- ranging from homemade diagnosis kits to a promised vaccine "soon to be introduced." In the latest, IRGC commander Hossein Salami unveiled "an astounding, phenomenal" device, which he said was capable of detecting coronavirus-infected human bodies and objects within a radius of 100 meters [328 ft] in a matter of 5 seconds.

[In the 24 hours from 14 Apr 2020 to 15 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 74 877 to 76 389, an increase of 1512 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 4683 to 4777, an increase of 94 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 8th globally -- behind the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK, and China.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 644 089, including 28 529 deaths, an increase from 613 886 cases, and 26 047 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 214 648 (33.3%) cumulative case reports and 11 525 (38.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2206 newly confirmed cases 7.3%), Massachusetts (1775 newly confirmed cases 5.8%), Illinois (1346 newly confirmed cases 4.5%), California (1302 newly confirmed cases 5.2%), Pennsylvania (1288 newly confirmed cases 4.4%) and Michigan (1058 newly confirmed cases 3.5%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number 1, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness.

[Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. However, transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. As of today [15 Apr 2020], totals of 177 633 cases and 18 579 deaths have been reported, up from 172 541 cases and 18 056 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 160.54, slowly decreasing over the past 7 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 160.54 today [15 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 177 633 cases, approximately 76 121 (42.8%) have been hospitalized and 7871 (4.4%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Table 3 at the source URL shows the weekly evolution of daily increases in newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths from mid-March (2020) to this current week.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7228979,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.UBA]
