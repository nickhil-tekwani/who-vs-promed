Floods cited as reason for typhoid outbreak in Kelantan
-----------------------------------------------
The floods in Kelantan at the end of 2004 have been cited as one of
the major causes for the typhoid that hit the state early in 2005,
the State Legislative Assembly was told on Mon 27 Jun 2005. The State
Exco for Local Governments, Housing and Health, Takiyuddin Hassan,
said the floods had resulted in the overflow of sewage, which
polluted water in wells, and the problem was aggravated by the
subsequent drought.

The government had called on the people to use water supplied by Air
Kelantan Sendirian Berhad and to refrain from using well water, he
said, when replying to a supplementary question. He said the state
government had also identified a food handler from a neighboring
country who had been confirmed as being the carrier of the disease.
Laboratory tests showed that the drinks sold by the food handler had
been contaminated with animal and human feces.

Takiyuddin said that, following the typhoid outbreak, the number of
people visiting Kelantan had dropped, but the situation had
normalized in the past 2 months.

He said 698 typhoid cases had been detected since 3 Apr 2005, and
following this, action had been taken to tackle the outbreak with the
cooperation of the Health Department, Kota Baharu Municipal Council,
and other local authorities.

Typhoid worries ministry
---------------------------
The Ministry of Health is worried by the growing number of people
contracting typhoid fever. There were 92 reported cases of typhoid up
until Thu 16 Jun 2005, a 40 percent increase from the 39 cases
reported in April 2005. Even though only one person has died from the
disease, the Ministry of Health is not taking any risks, embarking on
a surveillance project around Fiji.

Ministry senior medical officer Dr. Solomone Qaranivalu said there
was a need for close surveillance and active case-finding on typhoid
rather than reaction. "There is a need to change the focus from cases
to communities and to closely monitor and actively intervene on this
disease," he said. Dr. Qaranivalu made the statement while presenting
the ministry's findings on the recent outbreak of typhoid cases in
Fiji -- particularly in areas like Koro, Lami, Nadera, in Nasinu, and
Vatuwaqa, Suva -- and how they were able to treat them, at the last
day of the week long expanded immunization program (EPI) workshop.

There was a recent outbreak of typhoid disease in Fiji in the
Central/Eastern divisions, in which the ministry identified 39 cases.

Dr. Qaranivalu said there was a typhoid case at Nadera, Nasinu which
was being investigated. He said the causes of typhoid included
overcrowded homes, groundwater sources (wells, creeks), pit toilets
and poor environmental care. Of the 92 reported cases, 36 were
reported in the Central and Eastern Divisions, compared to 27 in
April 2005. In the North, there were 52 reported cases, compared to
13 in April 2005.

Dr. Ili Kubuabola, of the Fiji Centre for Communicable Diseases, said
surveys carried out in the reported areas in the North by medical
officials contributed to the increase in number. "The most cases
reported were from the North. The surveys were carried out within the
community and families of those suspected and treated of typhoid,"
Dr. Kubuabola said. She said the failure to practice safe hygiene was
the cause of the spread of the potentially fatal typhoid fever.
