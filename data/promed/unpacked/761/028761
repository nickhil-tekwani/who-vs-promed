Rift Valley Fever in Kenya and Somalia
An outbreak similar to that reported in north-eastern Kenya has been
reported in Somalia in the flooded area delimited by the towns of Belet
Weyne and Johar on the Shabelle River. Four of 13 blood samples from
suspected cases have been positive for RVF. [This area is in central
Somalia and a significant distance from the Kenya border. It raises the
distinct possibility that RVF may also be in the central Ogaden region of
Ethiopia. MHJ
The WHO team assembled in Kenya has established a small coordinating group
for the Rift Valley Fever Task Force. It will comprise representatives from
the Kenyan Government and from participating agencies and international
organizations in Somalia and Kenya. This group will facilitate the rapid
planning, coordination and implementation of surveillance and control
activities. The surveillance system in both countries will be extended and
strengthened in order to detect and confirm suspected cases. Standardized
clinical case definitions and reporting methods will be used allowing for a
better understanding of the epidemiology of the outbreak. The WHO
Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Virology in Johannesburg
has confirmed RVF virus infection in a second batch of 41 blood specimens.
The virus was isolated in three specimens from human cases and six other
specimens had IgM antibody indicating recent RVF virus infection. RVF virus
was detected by PCR in one of seven blood specimens collected from goats.
Further details are given in the press release below.

Press Release WHO/9 - 16 January 1998
RIFT VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK WIDESPREAD IN KENYA
The outbreak of Rift Valley fever, which had previously been reported in
the north-eastern Province of Kenya, appears to be present in other parts
of the country, according to WHO experts now in the country. Moreover, the
outbreak is also equally serious in neighbouring Somalia.
Approximately 300 deaths from this outbreak have been reported to the
Government in Nairobi. The World Health Organization (WHO) has received
estimates of an approximately equal number of deaths due to the outbreak in
Somalia.
The first reports came from the north-eastern Province in December 1997. In
recent days, reports of humans and animals suffering from a disease with
the symptoms of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have now been reported in Kenya's
north-eastern, eastern, Rift Valley, central and coast provinces. These
areas include some national parks and reported cases have also come from
near Nairobi and Mombasa. "At this point, we would not recommend that
travellers cancel their journeys to Kenya but they should be aware that
Rift Valley fever is transmitted by mosquitoes. If they travel to areas
near where outbreaks have been reported, they should take proper
anti-insect measures. These include wearing long-sleeved shirts and long
trousers and using mosquito repellant and bed nets," said Dr. David
Heymann, Director of WHO's Division of Emerging and other Communicable
Diseases Surveillance and Control (EMC).
A second team of WHO experts arrived in Kenya on 15 January and, in
collaboration with the Kenyan Ministry of Health, has elaborated a
provisional plan to combat the outbreak. Elements of the plan include
case-based, clinical surveillance in hospitals throughout Kenya to detect
new cases and investigate the increased spread of the disease, and a
systematic sampling and testing of specimens taken from humans and animals
which have contracted the disease. WHO is working with national and
international partners to improve access to the northeast of Kenya, which
has been largely cut off because of floods, and to develop a plan for
control of the disease adapted to local conditions.
For the moment, information on the outbreak from northeastern Kenya is
still sparse and WHO and its partners will be working in coming weeks to
increase surveillance of and testing for Rift Valley fever and other
diseases potentially associated with this outbreak. Rift Valley fever may
not be the sole cause of the outbreak, but recent evidence suggests that
malaria and cholera are not playing as great a role as has been previously
reported. Famine, on the other hand, has been a significant cause of death.

[For some time the official reports have limited the Kenyan deaths to some
300 deaths. The number has not increased as one might expect. This may
reflect either an inability to reach new areas or news censorship. With the
Kenyan parliamentarians claiming over 5000, the latter explanation may be
what is happening. - Mod.MHJ
