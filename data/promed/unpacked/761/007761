Canadian Food Inspection Agency veterinarian George Luterbach was cited as
saying that four Saskatchewan elk herds are quarantined and all provincial
herds banned from moving animals because of a recent case of chronic
wasting disease, adding, "We are talking here about a single, isolated
case. The movement ban was put in as a temporary measure and we expect to
modify the ban within a week."
The story says that in early April an elk died on a Swift Current area
farm. The owner sent the carcass to the Western College of Veterinary
Medicine in Saskatoon. An autopsy showed signs in the elk of chronic
wasting disease. It causes elk to waste away and sometimes act bizarrely.
Tissue samples were sent to the CFIA, which also found signs of CWD, as did
a second opinion by the world expert on the disease. The Swift Current farm
was quarantined, and after talking to the provincial elk farmers
association, the CFIA banned movement of all farmed elk in Saskatchewan.
It's suspected that CWD is passed from mothers to offspring, so the dead
animal's mother and five siblings were exterminated, even though they had
no signs of the disease. "Test results from these animals are not yet
available, but should be within days," Luterbach said.
