Sources from the Health Secretariat stated that the Murcia local police are investigating what happened at a meeting of persons of Ecuadorian nationality held last week [15 Aug 2012] in the La Fica fairgrounds, on the occasion of the celebration of the day of the Virgin of the Swan. Up to 82 individuals suffered from food poisoning and were seen at the Virgin of la Arrixaca, Morales Meseguer, and Reina Sofia hospitals. 13 people remain in hospital although their condition is not serious.

The incident occurred last Wed 15 Aug 2012 during a meeting of Ecuadorean people at the La Fica fairgrounds, who became ill after eating beef kebabs with mayonnaise.

The appropriate inspections were carried out and an epidemiological survey was conducted among those affected, who presented with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. It was determined that the food in question, which had provoked this situation, was the mayonnaise served with the beef kebabs.

According to the incubation period and symptoms, the health department determined that salmonella bacteria had caused the illness and the diagnosis was confirmed after positive culture of fecal samples.

The Murcia City Council, together with the local police and Consumer Department, established surveillance in the area to prevent the street vending of this and other products.
