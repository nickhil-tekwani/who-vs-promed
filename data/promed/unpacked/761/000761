FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - ZIMBABWE (02)
************************************
A ProMED-mail posting
[see: Foot & Mouth Disease - Zimbabwe 970829152552]

The FMD virus spread from a herd of buffalo, through a double game fence,
into a herd of cattle and then back through the fence into another herd of
cattle. This shows the obvious necessity of having a good buffer area
between cattle and buffalo in Africa. Whether the virus spread was by
aerosol or via infected items makes no difference - a buffer zone would
have reduced the possibility for disease spread. A fence alone is not enough!
This outbreak also makes nonsense of a recent risk assessment done in
Zimbabwe which indicated that buffalo and cattle could be kept on adjoining
properties with an almost negligible risk of FMD spreading to cattle. I
think African veterinarians must be very circumspect when dealing with
buffalo, especially if their country's economy is dependent to any degree
on beef exports.
[Unfortunately, the word risk assessment is beginning to be applied to
every public statement or claim concerning any risk. What methodology was
used and what data was included in this risk assessment? - Mod. pc]
