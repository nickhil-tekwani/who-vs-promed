[1] WHO: influenza virus activity in the world
Date: Fri 6 Jul 2012
Source: WHO, Laboratory confirmed data from the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) [edited]
http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/updates/summaryreport/en/index.html


Based on FluNet reporting (as of 4 Jul 2012)), during weeks 24 to 25 (10-23 June 2012), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 70 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 12 952 specimens. 1559 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1285 (82.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 274 (17.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 176 (15.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 967 (84.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 27 (93.1 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2 (6.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Summary
-------
During weeks 24 and 25 in 2012, laboratory confirmed influenza activity continued increasing in the southern hemisphere with A(H3N2) viruses predominant. In the northern hemisphere activity remained low in general.

In the southern hemisphere, increased influenza activity has been reported in Australia and New Zealand with A(H3N2) as the predominant circulating subtype.

In Africa, influenza activity increased steadily. Ghana and South Africa were experiencing increased co-circulation of A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses while Madagascar continued to report local outbreaks of A(H3N2). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus continued to circulate in Rwanda at a lower level.

In central and South America, circulation of influenza A and B viruses were detected. Increased activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and associated outbreaks were reported in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), El Salvador, and Paraguay, while in Brazil and Chile increased activity of A(H3N2) and associated outbreaks were detected. In Ecuador influenza B predominated.

In the northern hemisphere, sporadic detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to be reported at low levels, except in Hong Kong, SAR China, where unusually high level of A(H3N2) activity continued.

- The influenza season is largely finished in the temperate countries of the northern hemisphere and most countries in the northern temperate zone have now stopped weekly reporting. A detailed review of the recent influenza season in the temperate countries of the northern hemisphere is available online here.

- In the tropical zone, Brazil, Paraguay, and Honduras have reported notable influenza activity in the Americas; Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa; and southern China, including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Viet Nam in Asia.

- The influenza season has commenced in most temperate countries of the southern hemisphere for which there is data. In Argentina, however, influenza remains nearly undetectable and although New Zealand has reported persistent increases in influenza virus detections over the last 3 reporting weeks, influenza-like illness (ILI) reports remained below the national baseline.

- Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the most commonly reported type/sub-type in recent weeks in the Southern Hemisphere temperate region in Chile, South Africa, and Australia; however, significant numbers of influenza type B were also reported in South Africa and to a lesser extent, Australia. Very few influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported in the temperate region, however A(H1N1)09 is currently the most commonly detected virus in active countries of Central and tropical South America.

[It is clear that the Northern hemisphere influenza epidemic is over and the Southern hemisphere epidemic has commenced. No new influenza viruses have appeared and a predominant pattern has yet to be established. Many countries in the temperate regions of South America continue to report outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children. - Mod.CP]
