Influenza update number 190
---------------------------
Summary:

- Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere temperate zones remained at inter-seasonal levels. The United States of America reported 12 cases of human infection with influenza A(H3N2)v. More details can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-cases.htm.

- In most regions of tropical Asia, influenza activity decreased, except for India and Viet Nam where influenza A activity remained relatively high.

- In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity in Cuba and the Dominican Republic remained high, but with decreasing trends, and began to increase in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua.

- Influenza activity in the southern hemisphere increased considerably in South America and in Southern Africa but remained low in Oceania. In temperate South America, respiratory syncytial virus remained the main detected respiratory virus, but the proportion of influenza positive viruses continued to increase. In tropical South America, influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 became the main detected respiratory virus in most countries, except in Ecuador where respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remained the main detected virus.

- As of 19 Jul 2013, a total of 133 cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection have been reported. For more details see: http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html.

[The northern hemisphere seasonal influenza epidemic has ended, and the southern hemisphere seasonal influenza epidemic is developing, but leaving Oceania unscathed so far.

As commented previously, the predominance of isolations of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in some countries in South America are striking, and their relative absence elsewhere is noteworthy. This situation could be no more than a statistical anomaly reflecting predominance of severe respiratory illness in young children relative to the rest of the population. However, it may reflect a more fundamental situation. RSV is a major cause of severe respiratory disease in infants and the elderly.

In the past, RSV strains have been divided into 2 major antigenic groups (A and B), which are further divided into several genotypes. The main genetic and antigenic differences between genotypes are found within the 2 hypervariable regions of the attachment (G) glycoprotein. In 1999, a novel RSV B genotype, which contained a 60-nucleotide duplication in the 2nd hypervariable region of the G protein, was discovered in Buenos Aires and designated BA. Since then, genotype BA has almost completely replaced other RSV B strains spreading globally from Argentina within a few years, and subsequently diversifying into several sub-types largely replacing the original B strains. The conditions facilitating this diversification and global expansion are presently unknown. It may be appropriate in the future to determine the antigenic subtypes of RSV in circulation. - Mod.CP]
