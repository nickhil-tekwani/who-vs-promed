FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, WILD BOAR - ISRAEL (NORTH & NORTHEAST)

In ProMED-mail post "Foot & mouth disease, bovine - Turkey (Thrace)
(04) 20070413.1239", the moderator -- referring to a Turkish report
of 28 Feb 2007, wherein the source of infection was claimed to be an
infected boar -- requested additional information on this potential
source of infection for livestock, in Turkey as well as in other
Middle-Eastern countries.
We are consequently forwarding the following information from Israel.
During the months of January to March 2007, a small-scale
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) surveillance was conducted in wild boar
along Israel's northern and northeastern frontiers, while an outbreak
of FMD (type O) was affecting domestic ruminants in the same regions.
Samples of blood and throats (pharynges) from hunted boars were
collected and forwarded to the national FMD Laboratory at the Kimron
Veterinary Institute. Attempts at virus isolation from the throats in
cell culture were negative. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) NSP (non-structural 3ABC protein) (Cedi Diagnostics) tests
(see reference) were performed with the following results:
Location / sampling date / samples / Positive /positive (percent)
Mevo Hamma / 9 Jan 2007 / 6 / 6 / 100
Hamadiya / 10 Mar 2007 / 8 / 8 / 100
Goren / 13 Mar 2007 / 7 / 4 / 57
Total: sampled 21, positive 18 (85.7 percent).
Positive ELISA NSP tests demonstrate the presence of antibodies
against nonstructural 3ABC protein, regarded to be indicative that
FMD virus multiplication had taken place. The results indicate the
presence of FMD virus within the wild boar population in the
FMD-affected regions; in at least one case (Mevo Hamma), the virus
activity in boar seems to have taken place some time before outbreaks
in domestic livestock were recorded.

[The respective locations of the 3 sites of sampling can be seen in
the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>
as follows:
1. Goren, square 2, x=390; y=324, 4 km (2.5 mi) from the Lebanese border.
2. Mevo Hamma, square 3, x=509,95; y=429,95, 3 km (2 mi) from the
Jordanian border, 8 km (5 mi) from the Syrian/Jordanian/Israeli
border junction.
3. Hamadiya, square 5, x=387; y=290, 2 km (1.25 mi) from the Jordanian border.
In view of the rather sedentary behavior of wild boar and the
distances between the 3 respective sites of sampling (25-50 km)
(15.5-31 mi), these foci of infection can be considered as
independent of each other.
The high rate of positive sera is intriguing. Serological and
virological investigations in wild boar have been carried out in the
past in Israel, pretty much in the same regions. Between 1987-1999, a
total of 740 boar sera were sampled, of which 108 (14.6 percent) were
found SN (sentinel node) positive (see "FMD in wildlife" in the
review "FMD: The Israeli Approach", available at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm>.
It is not clear if the apparent very high rate of positive boar in
2007 is indicative of higher infection rate compared to past
observations, or rather a reflection of the high sensitivity of the
ELISA SMP (sodium metaperiodate) test.
It remains to speculate about the origin of these infections and
about the possibility that the infected boar may have played the role
swine are known to play in FMD epidemiology, namely as virus
amplifiers with the potential of disseminating the virus by air
(while sheep are regarded to be maintenance hosts and cattle are indicators).
It is worth noting that the Israeli wild boar population is
concentrated in areas stretched along the north and northeastern
frontiers (upper Galilee, Golan Heights, Jordan valley); similarly to
the current epizootic, most past FMD outbreaks in Israel started
along these borders (see
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/web/pages/map5.htm>).
Another topic awaiting further study is the seasonal pattern of FMD
in Israel (see graph at
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/web/pages/season.htm>).
The possible involvement of wild boar in FMD epidemiology deserves to
be included in the objectives of such studies, in Israel and
throughout the Middle East. - Mod.AS]
