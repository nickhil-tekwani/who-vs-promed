A patient in Children's Hospital's [Madison, Wisconsin] neonatal intensive care unit has been infected with the _Elizabethkingia_ bacterium, hospital officials said. It's unknown if the child has the deadly strain which has been linked to a recent outbreak. State health investigators are trying to find out if the child has the deadly strain or another less severe one, more common in infants.

The Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene received samples [Thu 28 Apr 2016] for 2 cases under investigation. DHS would not confirm if the child's sample was one of those 2. There have not been any confirmed cases of the bloodstream infection's outbreak strain in children, DHS officials said.

Thus far, there have been 59 confirmed cases of the outbreak strain. All of those cases are among adults. Another 4 possible cases are also among adults. The child's infection does not appear to be serious, Children's Hospital officials said.

A sample has been given to the state Health Department (DHS) and the CDC.

The head of disease control at University of Wisconsin-Madison Hospital said she would be surprised if the deadly strain of _Elizabethkingia_ showed up in a child at this point in the outbreak. "You know, the outbreak has been going on for several months. Why now the 1st case in a child?"

[As stated in the article above, it is unclear if the neonatal isolate is one of the possible new cases reported by Wisconsin on 27 Apr 2016. If the _Elizabethkingia_ isolate were to be an _E. anophelis_, it still may not be the current outbreak strain as none of those in the current cryptic outbreak were in children and all were apparently non-nosocomial. Many of the previous reports of _E. anophelis_, however, were from neonatal intensive units as well as the prototype species _E. meningoseptica_, initially known as _Flavobacterium meningosepticum_.

Much of the epidemiological data regarding the current _E. anophelis_ outbreak remains unreported. - Mod.LL
