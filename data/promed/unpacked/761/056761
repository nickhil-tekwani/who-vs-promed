Epidemics erupt in Bolivia flooded areas
--------------------------------
LA PAZ: Several epidemics have erupted in Bolivian towns affected in the
past few weeks by floods, which caused at least 28 deaths and affected some
220 000 people throughout the nation, according to official reports. In all
9 Bolivian provinces, heavy rains caused rivers to overflow and triggered
flooding in several towns, forcing residents to temporarily abandon their
homes.
Virgilio Prieto, national director of communicable diseases, told EFE that
"the flood waters are mixing with the sewage, and flood victims are using
this serious threat of contamination as drinking water." According to
Prieto, the incidents of acute respiratory infections have increased 12 per
cent and gastrointestinal infections some 10 per cent, compared to last
year. Officials are implementing a safe-water campaign to ensure clean
drinking water for populated areas affected by the flooding. Bolivian
health officials have detected [no] cases of cholera, another of the
concerns of [the] prevention plan implemented since the floods began.
Doctors have detected 1224 new cases of malaria, mostly in towns in
northern Bolivia, where the disease is endemic and where the heavy rains
have fostered favorable conditions for the mosquitoes that transmit the
disease [to breed]. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits dengue
fever, is also a potential threat to flood victims, especially in eastern
Bolivia, where heavy rains have increased over the past week. The Health
Ministry confirmed the existence of 2 cases of dengue fever in the province
of Santa Cruz and [two in the province of] Pando, near the Brazil border.
The government declared a nationwide health emergency, and hospitals are
ready to treat any possible outbreak of infectious diseases, Prieto said.
The rains stopped this week, but water that is receding from the highlands,
or Altiplano, now threatens towns located along rivers in northern Bolivia.
Among the more than 220 000 flood victims, the most severely affected by
the overflow of Lake Titicaca and Desaguadero River are the rural
populations of La Paz Altiplano. Homes have been lost in several Andean
Chipaya Indian communities located near Lake Poopo in Oruro province.
In the Chapare region in central Bolivia, 2 youths and 3 soldiers drowned
in the Espiritu Santo River [on] Wednesday. Civil Defense officials are
directing the nationwide state of emergency plan, now in its second week,
to assist the flood victims. The agency's main concern has been to provide
food to victims who lost their homes and fields and shelter them in schools
and tents until the floodwaters recede.

Outbreak of malaria in Guanay and in Palos Blancos
------------------------------------------------
According to reports of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES) on the
malaria outbreak in the province of La Paz, 110 cases of malaria have
presented in the region of Palos Blancos (South Yungas) and 12 in the rural
region of Guanay. This was announced by the prefecture of the province,
German Velasco.
"The malaria outbreak is in the early stages when it can be controlled.
This should not lead to panic, but it does require immediate attention. We
are now in the middle of controllable activity," [said Velasco]. He
explained that the outbreak reported in Palos Blancos was not a result of
the intense rains and for this reason Palos Blancos would not be treated as
a disaster zone. As Palos Blancos is in a malaria endemic zone, this
disease outbreak was a predictable outcome of the recent flooding.
According to the same reports of SEDES La Paz, there is a suspect case of
dengue in the north of the province. In an attempt to cover all of the
patients in the zone, 2 medical teams with [about] 30 physicians will be
transported to this region of the province [on] Monday morning [12 Feb
2001], and will replace the medical team installed there for the past
several weeks.
