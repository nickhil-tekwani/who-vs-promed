The Distribution Alimentaire Tony company is recalling Olivera brand sliced olives because they may permit the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_ , which causes botulism poisoning. Untreated, botulism can paralyze the muscles needed for breathing, resulting in sudden death.

"Consumers should not consume and distributors, retailers and food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes should not sell or use the recalled products described below," according to a recall notice posted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). There is concern that consumers and businesses may have the olives on hand because of their long shelf life, which reaches into July 2023. The company reports distributing the implicated olives in Quebec. The recall notice did not indicate if further distribution was involved.

"This recall was triggered by Canadian Food Inspection Agency test results. The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products," according to the recall notice. The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing the recalled products from the marketplace. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.

Consumers can use the following information to determine whether they have the recalled olive products. The codes are printed on the ends of the cans.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Olives and botulism have an important history in the USA as noted in these paragraphs about the early days of the canning industry in the USA extracted from Smithsonian Magazine (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/botulism-outbreak-gave-rise-americas-food-safety-system-180969868/):

"Their worst fears materialized in late 1919 and early 1920, when a series of deadly botulism cases struck unassuming consumers throughout the country, killing 18 people in Ohio, Michigan, and New York, with smaller outbreaks in other states. The deaths were traced back to canned black olives, a mainstay of hors d'oeuvre plates and a delicacy often reserved for special occasions. The olives had been packed in California and then shipped across the country to far-flung destinations, the result of a newly nationalized commercial food system.

"The National Canners Association and California Canners League sprang into action, recognizing the particular vulnerability of this moment. These botulism deaths--widely publicized in mainstream media outlets--threatened to undermine the still-shaky foundation of the canned food business, fueling consumers' deepest fears about these processed foods.

"The canners worked on 2 fronts. Even as they sought to displace responsibility and downplay media coverage of the deaths, they launched an expensive research and inspection campaign that would lay the groundwork for the American food safety system.

"In early December 1919, the canning and olive industries came together to fund a Botulism Commission of scientific experts tasked with producing specific strategies for safely processing olives to prevent such a crisis from happening again.

"After much negotiation, the Botulism Commission's findings led to strict regulations for the processing of olives --240 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 40 minutes-- and a statewide inspection service, funded by the industries, but overseen by the impartial California State Board of Health. By 1925, many of these standardized practices had expanded to other food products, covering sardines, tuna, and all vegetable products except tomatoes.

"In the process, 3 distinct groups --scientists, canners, and government officials-- established a set of relationships. As they got to know each other and worked through their competing commitments and quirks, they built the network that would underpin the nation's food system.

"Because the canning industry had taken a lead role in this network, many critical consumers were mollified, leading to acceptance of canned food, and later processed food, in the decades to come.

"This small story of a food scare and an emerging industry's embrace of food safety regulation encapsulates the larger story of American commerce in the 20th century. In solving the problem of botulism, an industry threatened with destruction instead came back with a set of practices that not only revolutionized canned food, but the entire relationship between science, government, and the food industry in America today. In this early phase, the canners were as much a player in policing themselves as were external regulators."
