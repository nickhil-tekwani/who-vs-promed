New bird flu outbreak in Northeast
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of avian influenza in the northeastern province of
Kalasin is the 1st case outside the Central region's poultry zone
since the 3rd wave of infections in July [2005]. It has raised fears
among bird flu fighters about the spread of the disease, and prompted
warnings that the public is still not doing enough to help.
"The Kalasin outbreak is not what we expected," said Livestock
Development Department director-general Yukol Limlaemthong. "We have
had no reports of a bird flu outbreak in the northeastern provinces
for over a year. We have to find the cause of the outbreak and come
up with measures to cope with it as soon as possible."
Livestock and public health officials earlier predicted the current
spate of bird flu would be confined to 25 provinces in the Central
region, the hub of the country's poultry industry.
The outbreaks were confirmed in Kalasin's Yang Talat and Huai Mek
districts on Tuesday [25 Oct 2005] and Thursday [27 Oct 2005]. The
affected coops and all property within 5 km have been put under
quarantine until mid-November 2005.
34 villagers from the 2 districts, including a 4-month-old baby, have
been put under close observation after they developed flu-like symptoms.
Although the outbreaks occurred at only 2 spots, and only 18 fighting
cocks have died or were culled, Mr. Yukol said the department would
investigate the case in a bid to plug loopholes in the bird flu
control operation that might have lead to outbreaks outside the
Central poultry zone.
The department has divided the country into 5 poultry zones, Northern
(9 provinces), Northeastern (19), Eastern (8), Central (25), and
Southern (15), for more effective movement control and farm management.
Mr. Yukol said livestock officials and the police were questioning
the birds' owners. "We want to know where the roosters were before
falling ill and how the owners smuggled the chickens outside the
province without permission from provincial livestock officers," he
said. Cooperation from raisers of fighting cocks and poultry farmers
was the key to eradicating the virus.
The department had set up 32 checkpoints nationwide to control
movement of fowl between the 5 poultry zones, but owners of fighting
cocks were hiding the birds in cars, which were beyond the officers'
ability to interdict, he said. "Safeguards against the bird flu
outbreak have already been put in place, but cooperation from people
is the most important thing we need at the moment," he said.
4 more tambons [the 3rd administrative subdivision level, below
district (amphoe) and province (changwat)] in Kalasin have been put
under observation pending lab tests for bird flu outbreaks.
Chief of the Communicable Disease Control Department Thawat
Suntrajarn said the number of Kalasin villagers put under 16-day
observation was large. "This is to ensure that all people who could
have a bird flu infection are closely watched," said Dr. Thawat.
The department's investigation concluded the roosters were likely to
have picked up the virus from a cockpit in Suphan Buri, where the
owners took them for fights, he said.
The department yesterday [30 Oct 2005] reported 1369 people from 70
provinces as having been put under observation, while the Livestock
Development Department's website reports that 13 tambons in 6
provinces are under 21-day quarantine.
