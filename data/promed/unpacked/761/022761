The Pender County [North Carolina] Health Department says a 4 year old miniature stallion has died from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

It's the 3rd case of EEE reported in North Carolina so far this year [2013] and 2nd case reported in our area. Last week the 1st EEE case of the year in North Carolina was reported in Brunswick County.

The Health Department says people should take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their horses.

There is a very effective vaccine. EEE vaccine is often combined with West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and should be given to protect the horses from both diseases.

EEE is transferred to horses from mosquitoes. In addition to vaccine, owners should use an approved mosquito repellent for the horses. - Mod.TG]
