Cuba: Coxsackievirus suspected as Cause of Death of 8 Children
--------------------------------------------------
A spokesperson for the Cuban Health Service stated on Tuesday [26 Jul 2005]
that human coxsackievirus may have been responsible for the death of 8
children in the island.
Human coxsackievirus, which is named after a town in New York State, is [a
small RNA virus classified in the genus _Enterovirus_ of the family
_Picornaviridae_], transmitted predominantly by the fecal-oral route. It is
easily transmitted and individuals cay be infected via unclean hands, by
contact with surfaces contaminated with feces, or by droplets expelled by
cough or expectoration.
A bulletin issued by the Public Health Ministry (Minsap, Ministerio de
Salud Publica), last Sunday concerning the deaths instructed the population
to pay increased attention to personal and environmental hygiene.

[It is uncertain from this report whether the diagnosis has been confirmed
by laboratory analysis or whether the disease process observed is
characteristic of coxsackievirus infections in general. A more definitive
statement is awaited. - Mod.CP]
