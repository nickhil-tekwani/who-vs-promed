Mule deer killed by hunter was found to have CWD
------------------------------------------------
A mule deer killed by a hunter near the Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary was
infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD). Government veterinarians say
the deer was shot about 15 km south of Empress, near Medicine Hat, in
September 2005.
It's the 1st case of CWD turned in by a hunter this year [2005], and the
4th detected in Alberta. The other deer with CWD were detected after
organized culls in the same vicinity. Saskatchewan has recorded 80 cases of
CWD.
Like mad cow disease in cattle, CWD affects the infected animal's central
nervous system, causing it to lose weight and slowly waste away. The
Alberta government said in its release that "there is no scientific
evidence to suggest CWD can affect humans". But, as a precaution, the World
Health Organization advises against humans consuming products from animals
infected with any sort of prion disease.

[It is actually the 5th affected deer found in Alberta. In September 2005,
we reported a "very thin" wild mule deer about 30 km south east of Oyen,
which, on culling, was shown to have CWD. Previously, there had been 3
cases of CWD found in game-farmed animals in Alberta, and in Saskatchewan,
68 cases in wild deer and a substantial number of elk found on game farms.
