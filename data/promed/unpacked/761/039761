Sabah has been put on a cholera alert after health authorities in Tawau
discovered 10 cases and 133 carriers. The current drought season is said
to have brought about this dreaded water-born illness.
According to Sabah Medical and Health Services acting director Dr. R
Meganathan, the 143 people were from the Kalabakan area near the
Tawau-Indonesian border and they had been using river water during the
current dry weather.
All of them have been treated at the Tawau General Hospital but Meganathan
said the alert is still on.
"Our health officers in the district, as well as other areas experiencing
the drought, has been put on alert to monitor for cholera, typhoid and
other water-borne diseases in view of the dry spell."
"So far we have only detected cholera in the Tawau area which seems to have
affected sawmill workers and villagers nearby," he said.
