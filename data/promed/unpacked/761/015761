56 inhabitants of the Republic of Tyva [also spelled Tuva] have
contracted tick-borne encephalitis since the beginning of 2006.
During the past 10 years a high level of tick-borne encephalitis
morbidity has prevailed throughout the Republic of Tyva, despite
preventive measures to contain this disease. Since 1997 tick-borne
encephalitis morbidity has increased 7.4-fold, with 708 persons
affected by the disease and 6 fatalities. So far during 2006, 56
people have contracted tick-borne encephalitis, giving a morbidity in
2006 of 18.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, which is 6.2 times the average
index of morbidity for the whole of Russia.
Research carried out by the Republic Centre of Hygiene and
Epidemiology has revealed an increase in tick density. The number of
territories [of the Republic] reporting cases of tick-borne
encephalitis during the past 10 years has increased 2-fold. Since the
beginning of 2006, some 1019 people in the Republic of Tyva have
experienced tick-bites (compared with 889 in 2005) and sought medical
treatment. These people reside in 16 administrative territories of
the Republic; 78.8 percent of cases were registered in the Districts
of Piy-Hemenskiy, Ulug-Hemenskiy, Kaa-Hemenskiy and Tandinskiy and in
the city of Kyzyl. The level of tick-borne encephalitis morbidity in
the Ulug-Hemenskiy, Kaa-Hemenskiy, Chaa-Hoolskiy, Tandinskiy and
Tondjinskiy Districts is 1.8-4 times the average level for this republic.
The principal causes of high tick-borne encephalitis morbidity are
reductions in tick control activities, the limited extent of
preventative vaccination and lack of availability of [immunoglobulin
preparations] for emergency treatment. Only 4647 individuals were
vaccinated in 2006 compared with 11 567 in 2003. Only 22.5 percent of
people who suffered tick-bite were vaccinated and only 30.1 percent
received specific antibody treatment according to the press-service
of the republic's government.
The funding allocated by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of
Tyva did not fully cover the purchase of immunological preparations,
including vaccine and specific antibody. In 2006, 725 000 roubles
[USD 27 000] were allocated from the republic's budget for purchase
of vaccine, but in fact only 688 200 roubles [USD 25 500] have been
spent. Municipal administrations do not allocate finances for
purchase of vaccine or antibody, do not take responsibility for tick
control procedures, nor for protection of the public in outdoor
recreational areas. Furthermore the management of the Federal
Services for Protection of Consumers' Rights and Human Well-being
[Rospotrebnadzor] in the Republic of Tyva does not fully exercise its
administrative powers to influence the heads of the organizations and
establishments to fulfill their responsibilities with regard to
control of tick-borne encephalitis.

[The average level of tick-borne encephalitis morbidity in Russia
for the period from January to August 2006 was 3.91 per 100 000
inhabitants (see - <http://www.fcgsen.ru/>). The high level of
morbidity in Tyva (18.2 per 100 000 inhabitants) is alarming for a
republic which has a population of approximately 311 000 inhabitants
(2000 census). It is the result of increases in tick activity,
changes in climatic and other factors, and deficiencies in tick
control activities and heath care.
The Republic of Tyva is one of the regions of the Russian Federation
located in the heart of Asia, quite far away from populated areas,
close to the Mongolian border. The population of 311 000 is
distributed over 170 500 sq km, i.e. somewhat larger than the area of
England and Wales. The republic is split up into 16 kozhuuns
(regions) and borders Mongolia, the Russian Republics of Buryatia and
Khakasija, as well as regions of Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Altay.
Kyzyl, the capital, is situated in the geographical centre of Asia,
which is commemorated in a monument called "The Center of Asia" -- an
obelisk with inscriptions in 3 languages. The city's population is
under 100 000. - Mod.NP]
[A map of the Republic of Tyva can be accessed at
<http://map.rin.ru/cgi-bin/main_e.pl?Region=tiva>. These problems are
not confined to the Republic of Tyva, and tick-borne encephalitis, a
vaccine-preventable disease, remains a problem throughout much of
central Russia. The situation is unlikely to improve until there are
more systematic efforts to provide better vaccine coverage and to
give tick control greater priority. - Mod.CP]
