Kapuas, Kalimantan Selatan [South]: mass chicken deaths confirmed H5N1
positive
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of chickens confirmed to have died of bird flu H5N1 virus in
Kabupaten (regency) Kapuas. Confirmation tests on dead bird specimens,
such as organ, serum, and swab, were done by the Veterinary
Investigation and Diagnostic Center (BPPV) Regional V, Banjarbaru,
South Kalimantan.

A total of 82 specimens were collected from dead chickens in several
sub-districts (kecamatan), including Pulau Petak, Selat, Kapuas Timur,
and Basarang.

For Desa Batu Nidan, Kecamatan Basarang, 3 backyard chicken samples
tested positive for bird flu infection. For Kuala Kapuas, one broiler
chicken sample tested positive for bird flu infection.

Sudden deaths in chickens in Kuala Kapuas occurred between early
December 2009 and 3 Jan 2010. A total of 6615 chickens died in 7
sub-districts: in kecamatan Basarang 3909, in Selat 360, in Petak 953,
in Kapuas Hilir 422, in Kapuas timur 255, in Kapuas Murung 500, and in
Kapuas Kuala 16 chickens.

So far, bird flu H5N1 virus has only attacked chickens in South
Kalimantan. No bird to human virus transmission is reported.

According to FAO information, HPAI has become endemic on Java,
Sumatra, Sulawesi, and probably Bali islands, with sporadic outbreaks
reported elsewhere. Village prevalence varies widely. Only 2 of its 33
provinces have not reported the occurrence of H5N1 HPAI. The detailed
epidemiological information is available due to the implementation of
the 'participatory disease surveillance and response' (PDSR)2
programme that targets village-type poultry production systems (mainly
backyard) and reports evidence of virus circulation in the village
environment. The programme is financially supported by FAO with USAID
and AusAID, and is operating in 331/448 (74 percent) districts through
31 Local Disease Control Centres (LDCCs) in 27 out of 33 provinces in
Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan, including all known
endemically infected areas. Larger and less densely-populated
provinces report HPAI outbreaks less often than more densely populated
provinces.
