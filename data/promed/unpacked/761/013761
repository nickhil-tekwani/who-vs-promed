An outbreak of meningitis in Niger has claimed 252 lives since January [2015], a health official said [Mon 4 May 2015], warning the country was short of vaccines to fight the outbreak, AFP [Agence France-Presse] reports.

"As of [3 May 2015], 252 people died out of a total of 3304 cases," said Niger's epidemics surveillance and response director Goumbi Kadade.

Less than 2 weeks ago, the government had put the toll at 129 people out of 1150 cases. "The number of cases has risen in the past 3 weeks. This worries us, because there aren't enough vaccines. Our orders are arriving in dribs and drabs," Kadade added.

A meningitis epidemic has been declared in 8 districts of Niger, while 3 others are in a state of alert, the official said. The whole of Niger is currently under quarantine, in an effort to contain the highly contagious disease.

Some 300 000 vaccine doses have arrived in the west African landlocked country, and are currently being distributed. That is less than half the amount the authorities ordered, and far below the 1.8 million doses actually needed to stop the epidemic, Kadade said.

One reason for the vaccine shortage is a meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria, near Niger, the doctor said.

The epidemic's mortality rate in Niger has shrunk in the past weeks, because patients are now being given antibiotics, he added.

ProMED-mail recently reported on this meningitis outbreak throughout Niger (Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger: fatal, serogroups C, W 20150430.3332448), when there were 1543 suspected cases, including 147 deaths (as of 25 Apr 2015). The total number of cases now has more than doubled, with 252 deaths. The prior ProMED-mail post reported that _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C predominated in the affected areas, with also _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W identified.

Serogroup A meningococcus had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt, which includes Niger (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf; see map at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf). Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is serogroup-specific with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. WHO had promoted vaccinating all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt with serogroup A conjugate vaccine. As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Recent outbreaks of other meningococcal serogroups following recent mass vaccination with serogroup A conjugate vaccine likely represent serogroup replacement in the meningitis belt.

A mass vaccination campaign is now planned for emergency epidemic control, with serogroup ACW meningococcal vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger: fatal, serogroups C, W 20150430.3332448). - Mod.ML]
