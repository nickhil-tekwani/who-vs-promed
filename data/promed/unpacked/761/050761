Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive; legal movement of animals; illegal movement of animals; fomites (human, vehicles, feed, etc)

Epidemiological comments: The surveillance system of the Directorate of Animal Health was implemented following a clinical picture of diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration that resulted in the death of piglets less than 15 days old at different farms. Samples were sent to the Center for Animal Diseases of the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in the United States of America in order to confirm by real-time RT-PCR, isolation and sequencing the causal agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). On 21 Mar 2014, in a preliminary report, the USDA confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing that samples submitted were similar to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus reported in the United States of America.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; treatment of affected animals (symptomatic)

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (United States of America) (Foreign laboratory) /Swine / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 21 Mar 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the USDA-APHIS-VS, "Case Definition for Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease" updated on 5 Jun 2014 http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/swine/downloads/secd_case_definition.pdf:
"Novel swine enteric coronavirus disease (SECD) is a disease in swine caused by emerging porcine coronaviruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV).

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was 1st reported in the United States in 2013 and quickly spread throughout the country. PEDV has also been reported in Canada and Mexico and is suspected in Central America, Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic. [Note: Official Veterinary Services of Colombia and now the Dominican Republic have confirmed to the OIE the disease in their countries. - Mod CRD].

PEDV is thought to be widespread throughout most regions of Western and Central Europe and Southeast Asian countries, including China and Japan. PEDV is currently a source of concern in Asian countries, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe.

Severe outbreaks with high mortality are typically rare in Europe but recently have been commonly reported in Asia. China has seen a large increase in outbreaks since 2010, and the emergence of new strains has been attributed to this increase."

The Dominican Republic becomes the 1st country in the Caribbean to officially report PEDv to the OIE as an "emerging disease."

PEDV is not transmissible to humans thus poses no danger to human health.
