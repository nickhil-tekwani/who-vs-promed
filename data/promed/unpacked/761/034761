Migratory birds are behind the fresh outbreak of bird flu in Assam,
Indian Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss said Saturday [29 Nov 2008],
adding that culling operations had started in the northeastern state
and that inter-country bird movements are under close scrutiny. "Yes,
we are concerned, and this new outbreak is mainly due to migratory
birds," Ramadoss told IANS. "We are taking measures to control it,
and let me assure you that everything is under control. A team from
the central health ministry has already gone to Assam and is helping
authorities there," he added.

The minister said he has been keeping a close eye on the development
and was closely monitoring the situation along with the animal
husbandry department, which is under the central agricultural
ministry. He said all possible help would be provided to the state
government in terms of human resources, medicines, masks and other
preventive measures.

On Thursday [27 Nov 2008], the outbreak of bird flu in Assam was
confirmed after laboratory tests confirmed strains of the deadly H5N1
avian influenza. More than 300 birds died in the past week in Kamrup
district of Assam. "The culling operation has started, and
inter-country bird movements are under close scrutiny," the minister
said, adding that the bird flu outbreaks in the past had helped India
gain experience to handle such situations. Asked about the frequent
bird flu outbreaks in India, Ramadoss said: "Winter is a favourable
period for the spread of bird flu. These migratory birds come
southwards (to India) from other countries." While saying that there
is "no need to panic," he added that these migratory bird movements
cannot be stopped completely.

Meanwhile, authorities in Assam have culled over 12 000 of the
estimated 60 000 birds to be killed. The culling of ducks and
chickens is being carried out in 48 villages within a 5-km radius of
village Thakurchuba in Kamrup district, about 40 km west of Assam's
main city of Guwahati. About 20 Rapid Response Teams, each comprising
about 7 personnel including a veterinarian, are engaged in the
culling that is expected to continue for about a week until the
entire area is sanitized.

India has witnessed several outbreaks of bird flu earlier in states
like Maharashtra, West Bengal and a few northeastern states. India
has been pointing fingers at Bangladesh and Thailand for the spread
of the disease.

[While it is not impossible that this outbreak in Assam in northeast
India might be due to migratory birds, there is as yet very little
evidence for them playing a meaningful part in the epidemiology of
this disease, in fact, rather to the contrary, as commercial
movements of poultry and such have been found to be the consistent
cause. If one goes to the OIE-WAHID page for disease outbreaks by
month and enter Bangladesh (there is no ability to enter Assam, so
one is forced to use the neighbouring country of Bangladesh), you
will see that November-December 2007 is the apparent start for HPAI
outbreaks in that region.

More detailed genomic analysis will show where this recent Assam HPAI
strain is most likely from. - Mod.MHJ]
