[The above information is in need of official confirmation. Saudi
Arabia has reported, since the start of the event on 12 Nov 2007, a
total number of 7 outbreaks; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6489>.
An update will help.
The grave situation in Saudi Arabia is reflected by news on
preparedness in neighbouring countries, such as Jordan (Jordan on
alert for bird flu,
<http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Science/2007/12/22/jordan_on_alert_for_bird_flu/1052/>)
and United Arab Emirates (UAE to update plans to tackle bird flu
threats, at

Date: Mon, 24 Dec 2007

The HPAI H5N1 virus has been identified in various parts of Egypt,
though no apparent clinical outbreaks of magnitude been observed. It
is suggested, that mass vaccinations mask the spread of the virus.

[Egypt submitted to the OIE a follow-up report on 3 Dec 2007,
relating to 922 outbreaks. The report includes a map and the
following epidemiological commentary:
"This report includes outbreaks from 23 March 2006 till 24 November
2007; some of these outbreaks had been previously reported to the OIE
using the old notification format. The number of vaccinated birds
include the vaccinated backyard poultry free of charge using
inactivated avian influenza H5N1 vaccine and hatcheries using
inactivated avian influenza H5N2 vaccine. All the samples were tested
in due time at the Central Laboratory for Veterinary Quality Control
on Poultry Production (CLQP) by real-time PCR test. Since the last
vaccination campaign in June 2007, Egypt has had only 16 sporadic
outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. The total number of
culled birds since the start of the event is 34 533 000 birds." See

Avian influenza H7N3 strain makes appearance in Vietnam
-------------------------------------------------------
The dangerous, human-transmissible avian influenza A (H7N3) strain,
previously recorded in Korea, Canada and Holland, has reemerged in
several Asian countries including Vietnam, according to the National
Steering Committee for Avian Influenza Prevention and Control.
The committee held a conference on Tuesday in Ha Noi to discuss the
country's response to the recent reoccurrence of the deadly bird flu.
The H7N3 virus found in Vietnam, however, is classified as
low-pathogenic, not readily transmitted to humans.
The committee has made plans already to import more H7N3 avian
influenza vaccines to prevent possible outbreaks.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the
H5N1 strain reappeared in the northern Cao Bang province's Bao Lam
District. Lower temperatures and poultry smuggling from China in the
northern provinces have also increased the risk of another outbreak
of bird flu in several provinces there.
The committee is directing local officials to improve environmental
sanitation in high-risk areas and tighten their control over the
transportation of poultry through borders.

[On 17 Dec 2007, Vern Weitzel submitted a newswire where the Viet Nam
authorities stated there were no cases of H7N3 human infections in
Viet Nam (see <http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/2007/12/759995/>).
From the above newswire, it does appear as though there have been
avian cases although the geographic locale of the outbreaks of H7N3
avian cases is not stated.
In 2006, there was an outbreak of low pathogenic H7N3 in the United
Kingdom (UK), which was associated with 4 cases of human
conjunctivitis infections.
More information on the geographic locations of the H7N3 outbreak(s)
identified in Viet Nam, and possibly in other neighboring countries
(note the newswire mentions that it has been identified in other
Asian countries as well) would be very much appreciated.
