A British woman has died from a rare disease after being scratched by
a wild rat. The rat had been trapped in a bird feeder in her garden
and the 56-year-old woman was injured while trying to free it.

The woman was not wearing protective gloves and suffered scratches
and cuts to her fingers as she struggled to free the rodent from the
wire feeding device. Within days she developed flu-like symptoms and
48 hours later died from the rare Weil's disease, which is a severe
form of leptospirosis, caused by bacteria found in the urine of wild animals.

As a rule leptospirosis victims experience severe headaches and
flu-like symptoms but the severe form, which is Weil's disease,
causes jaundice and liver damage, and can be fatal, but it usually
only affects 10 percent of leptospirosis victims.

Weil's disease is also known as canicola fever, canefield fever,
Nanukayami fever, and 7-day fever. It is a bacterial disease that
affects humans and a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds,
amphibians, and reptiles but is relatively rare in humans. The
infection is usually transmitted to humans when fresh water that has
been contaminated by animal urine comes into contact with unhealed
breaks in the skin, eyes, or with the mucous membranes.

It is most commonly carried by rats, mice, and voles but a wide range
of other mammals including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cows,
sheep, and even certain marine mammals are also able to carry and
transmit the disease; dogs may pick it up by licking the urine of an
infected animal from grass or soil, or drinking from an infected
puddle. The infective bacteria are likely to be found on muddy
riverbanks, ditches, gulleys, and muddy livestock rearing areas,
which wild or farm mammals regularly traverse.

Experts say there is a direct link between the amount of rainfall and
the incidence of leptospirosis, making it seasonal in temperate
climates and year-round in tropical climates. The incubation period
can be anywhere from 4 to 14 days and in humans the symptoms include
high fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting, and
may include jaundice, red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a rash.

It is diagnosed by blood and urine tests and treatment is usually
complicated involving antibiotics and possibly other drugs to ward
off possible complications. Experts say confirmed cases of Weil's
disease are few and far between and advise against leaving food out
for wild animals and also say people coming into contact with animals
such as wild rats should always wear gloves.

[Weil's disease, a term which has been used for leptospirosis in
general, is often reserved for the syndrome of severe multisystem
disease, presenting with profound jaundice and renal function
impairment, described by Adolf Weil in Heidelberg, Germany in 1886
(Weil A: Ueber eine eigentumliche, mit Milztumor, Icterus und
Nephritis einhergehende akute Infektionskrankheit. Dtsch Arch Klin
Med. 1886; 39: 209-232).

Leptospirosis is an uncommon disease to be reported in the UK with
15-30 cases reported yearly
