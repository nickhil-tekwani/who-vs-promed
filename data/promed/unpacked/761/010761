Around 31 000 turkeys will be slaughtered from Thursday [6 Nov 2014] after a dangerous strain of a flu virus was discovered in some creatures being fattened in East Germany -- the 1st time it has been seen in Europe.

"This is the virus's 1st hotspot and that has to be stamped out immediately," veterinarian Holger Vogel said.

Turkeys in Heinrichswalde, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, were found to have the highly pathogenic influenza virus, H5N8, which was previously only found in Asia.

The 1st symptoms were spotted over the weekend [1-2 Nov 2014], but the virus was confirmed after avian flu experts at a state veterinary research organization, the FLI, carried out tests.

The FLI will supervise the birds' slaughter. The animals are to be gassed, loaded into sealed vehicles and disposed of.

Examinations on 1000 animals were conducted in a 3-kilometre [about 1.9-mile] restricted area, while a 10-kilometre [about 6.2-mile] "observation area" was also established. Poultry within a 50-kilometre [about 31-mile] radius -- the area of which reaches up to the border with Poland -- may no longer be kept outside their pens.

There have been no reports of people being infected with the virus, according to the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania agricultural ministry.

[Thanks to Sabine Zentis for the information provided.

As noted in the media, this is the 1st time that the H5N8 avian influenza subtype has been identified in Germany and the EU. During the course of this year (2014), H5N8 has been reported in China, Japan and South Korea. See pertinent reports below.

"Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, northeastern Germany, borders the Baltic Sea to the north, Poland to the east, and the German states of Brandenburg to the south, Lower Saxony to the southwest, and Schleswig-Holstein to the west. The state has more than 1700 lakes, including Lake Muritz in the south." See more at http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372034/Mecklenburg-West-Pomerania.

The source of infection was most likely wild birds. In that case, it be would be necessary to identify the dynamics of the virus introduction. (Is this time of the year characterized by bird migration into the area? In case affirmative, which species and from where?)

Heinrichswalde municipality is located close to Galenbecker Lake (2 km, http://www.europethisway.com/place/heinrichswalde-uecker-randow-germany/). See map at http://wikimapia.org/7389826/Galenbecker-Lake.

According to the European Commission - Health and Consumers: "Measures to prevent and control avian influenza are coordinated at EU level. There are preventive measures against avian influenza which must be implemented by all the Member States and surveillance for the disease has been increased. Prescribed measures must be enacted by national authorities if there is a suspected or confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in either wild birds or domestic flocks in their territories. EU import bans have also been placed on potentially risky poultry products and susceptible imports from 3rd countries with HPAI outbreaks. When there is an outbreak in a domestic poultry holding, all birds must be culled and measures are taken to prevent the further spread of the infection to other holdings. Zones with movement restriction (protection and surveillance zones) are established. In these zones, movement of live poultry and certain poultry products are restricted. Poultry has to be kept indoors and must be closely monitored" http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/index_en.htm.
