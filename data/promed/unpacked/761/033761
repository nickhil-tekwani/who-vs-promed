What is the health risk of bovine TB in white-tailed deer?
What does this mean to the cattle industry, etc?

Accordingly to our data collected since 1992, _Mycobacterium bovis_ cervid
infections have been confirmed in Montana, New York, Texas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Arkansas & Michigan.
Non-traditional animal production, such as deer and elk farming and
ranching, has undergone tremendous growth. Imports, breeding, specialized
auctions, and trading have led to the introduction of other non-traditional
farmed species including llamas, alpacas, and other exotic ruminants. In
addition, the sylvatic population of elk has grown by 62% over the last 30
years. Such growth has resulted in captive, wild, and domestic animals
residing in closer geographical proximity to each other. In addition, over
70 white-tailed deer were found to be infected with _M. bovis_ in Michigan
and maintaining the infection in sylvatic populations since 1994. In the
first 9-11 months of FY 1992, there were 30 cases in deer, 6 in elk, and one
case each in a bison and a coatimundi in the USA. There have also been 5
documented cases of cross-species infection of _M. bovis_ between cattle and
Cervidae (in either direction) during 1991 and 1992, so indeed deer may
serve as a source of infection for cattle and vice versa.
