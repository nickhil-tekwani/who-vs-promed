Avian influenza in Cameroon
---------------------------
(Disease never reported before in Cameroon).
Translation of information received on 12 Mar 2006 from Dr. Hamadou
Saidou, Director of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Livestock,
Fisheries and Animal Industries, Yaound:
Report date: 12 Mar 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country or zone/compartment.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 11 Mar 2006.
Date of start of the event: 21 Feb 2006.
An outbreak of avian influenza due to highly pathogenic virus subtype
H5N1 was reported in 3 domestic duck farms in the Doualar area in
Maroua, Diamare department, northernmost province.
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: 58
deaths: 50
destroyed: 8
Laboratory where diagnosis was confirmed: Pasteur Institute Laboratory (Paris).
Samples were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for avian influenza
and Newcastle disease, Padova, Italy; results are pending.
Control measures: stamping out and destruction of birds by
incineration; epidemiological survey to determine the origin of
infection; formal ban on the movement of birds and poultry products
in Maroua city; closure of all live bird markets and products in
Maroua city; active surveillance of all poultry farms in Maroua city
and nearby areas; screening; disinfection of infected premises and
material.

[The outbreak is located in the extreme north of Cameroon near Lake Chad.
<http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/travel/dg/maps/65/750x750_cameroon_m.gif>.
Cameroon has such a narrow sliver of land in the North that one must
guess that the country of Chad is likely to be infected as well. If
true, then all 4 countries surrounding Lake Chad would comprise an
infected zone. Clearly, the ecology is spawning a regional outbreak,
but one wonders whether we are up to mounting a regional response. We
wish the Cameroon health authorities good luck in stamping out the
disease, and it appears that they are taking the correct initial
steps. - Mod.PC]

Details of new outbreaks:
[In the interest of time, ProMED-mail will not provide the usual
details for this report. These are summarized below; details at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/A_CURRENT.HTM#Sec0>.
There were 28 outbreaks ranging in a wide swath of the northern
middle of the country from the Federal Capital Area to the extreme
north (Katsina) and northeast (Yobe); see
<http://www.mapsofworld.com/nigeria/nigeria-political-map.html>.
By state, there were 3 outbreaks in Bauchi, 2 in the Federal Capital,
6 in Kaduna, one in Kano, 5 in Katsina, a single outbreak in Nasarawa
state, 9 in Plateau state near Jos (fortunately or unfortunately,
this is near the National Veterinary Research Institute at Vom) and
one in Yobe state. Numbers of poultry affected ranged from hundreds
up to 6547. Dates range from 11 Feb to 24 Feb 2006. - Mod.PC]
Description of affected populations: the affected farms are mainly
commercial and backyard poultry production units inside towns. The
species involved are mostly poultry layers, with few broilers and
cockerels. At Azare, however, there was a mixture of chickens, ducks
and Guinea-fowl.

Kano, Plateau, Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe and Nasarawa States and the
Federal Capital Territory. The government is to compensate affected
farmers.
A regulation came into force on 20 Feb 2006 dividing the country into
3 zones (infected zone, buffer/surveillance zone and free zone),
banning movement of poultry and poultry products -- including egg
trays, etc. -- between the zones, closing poultry markets, banning
interstate movement of birds in the infected zone, etc.

[The Nigerian animal health authorities are to be complimented for
their reporting of results and the transparency thereby demonstrated.
The value of transparency can be seen in this report, because only
transparency and good surveillance allow the information required to
see the pattern of disease spread. Nigerians need to know this
pattern in order to direct their control efforts; neighboring
countries need to know it to in order to prepare for an outbreak,
while instituting preventive tactics in hopes that it doesn't enter
the country; and even North Americans need to examine these reports
closely. This report is a significant one, as it means the disease
has spread from the northern Sahelian areas of Nigeria to the
southern, coastal, wet and very densely populated areas of eastern
Nigeria. See
<http://www.mapsofworld.com/nigeria/nigeria-political-map.html>.
While the western part of Nigeria is not yet infected, the spread to
the southeastern parts of Nigeria in places like Anambra, Benue and
Rivers almost assures that the disease will become endemic unless
heroic efforts are made very quickly. Its becoming endemic in the
south of Nigeria is problematic for 2 reasons. 1st, to the extent
that wild waterfowl spread the disease, it is more likely to move up
to northern Europe and then Greenland, where it can then spread as a
global pandemic. Secondly, an expanded area of concentrated human and
poultry interaction will likely be occurring in some of the most
densely populated areas of Nigeria. Let's hope that we mobilize the
maximum resources in support of the Nigerian efforts to stamp out the
disease, because these developments, while expected and predictable,
do not bode well for the future of the avian influenza epidemic.
