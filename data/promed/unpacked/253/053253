Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been detected in 741 head of cattle in the district between June and December 2013. So far, 83 head of cattle have died due to the disease. The largest number of cases has been reported from Kunnathunadu taluk.

Outbreaks of the disease have been reported from 16 panchayats in the district: Marady, Karumaloor, Kottuvally, Manjapra, Mookkannoor, Kodanad, Parakkadavu, Thuravur, Paingottur, Nellikuzhi, Maneedu, Edathala, Edavanakkad, Tripunithura, Perumbavur, and Ayavana.

A meeting held here on Friday [6 Dec 2013] to take stock of the situation in the wake of the outbreak of the epidemic resulted in a decision to expand the coverage of preventive vaccination.

K. Udayavarman, director, Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Palod, said that free treatment would be extended to all affected cattle. Direction in this regard has been given to animal husbandry officers across the state.

The government has already banned the transportation of cattle from outside. Mr. Udayavarman said that cattle markets should not operate till further orders.

Paul Kunnath, district animal husbandry officer, said that the functioning of slaughterhouses should also be restrained to contain the spread of the disease. Dairy farmers have demanded doubling the compensation allotted by the government. They said that Rs. 20 000 [USD 325.7] for dead cattle owing to the disease was insufficient, as a cow yielding more than 10 litres of milk in the morning has a price tag of about Rs. 40 000 [USD 651.4] in the market. A demand was also made to fix compensation for the loss of calves to the disease.

Mr. Kunnath said that animal husbandry squads are functioning in all panchayats in Ernakulam to contain the disease. He urged the public to be vigilant and the cattle owners not to sell diseased cattle for slaughtering, as this would make the already bad situation worse.

Since pigs and gaurs [_Bos gaurus_, Indian bison] could also be carriers of FMD, people residing near forest areas have been asked to take preventive vaccines at the earliest opportunity.

Interest on the bank loans of ordinary dairy farmers should be relaxed. Legal hurdles should not created in the delivery of the maximum possible assistance to farmers. They also wanted long term projects for dairy farmers.

Vinod Kumar, assistant professor with the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, said that preventive vaccines should be administered all at once in 70-80 per cent of cattle in an area for the vaccination to be effective. Cattle markets and slaughter houses caused the outbreak of the disease in the state, against which dairy farmers should be alert. He said that professors from the veterinary university would visit each district to study the disease.

The current outbreak of FMD among cattle has significantly hit milk production in Tamil Nadu, prompting dairy farmers to seek intervention, including large scale vaccination.

The daily procurement [of milk] has come down by about 4 lakh [400 000] litres a day, according to Tamil Nadu Milk Producers' Welfare Association (TNMPWA) President K A Sengottuvel.

The threat of foot and mouth disease (FMD) reported among cattle has forced officials to take preventive measures in the villages surrounding the forest areas, especially the ones in the fringe areas of wildlife sanctuaries in the south.

With support from the respective district administrations, the forest officials in the locality have been conducting veterinary camps in the bordering villages over the last week. The veterinary camps are being undertaken in 10 villages bordering Srivilliputhur Grizzled Squirrel Sanctuary, 20 villages near Kalakkad, Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), while camps are proposed for Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Theni and Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary.

Chinnamanur region has been identified as being vulnerable due to its proximity to Megamalai sanctuary, and the 2nd round of vaccination will be undertaken in the region, officials said.

It seems that the FMDV-O epizootic which has been reportedly circulating in 4 of India's southern states, namely Kamataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, is continuing its spread in spite of the measures applied.

Since FMD is long known to be endemic in India, there is no official obligation to immediately report new outbreaks to the OIE, authoritative information becoming publicly available twice a year from the required 6-monthly summarising reports. However, in view of the seemingly unusual dimensions of the current epizootic in India, probably due to a new strain/genotype, the partial and sometimes contradictory reports from the local government, but mainly from unofficial sources, are short of providing an accurate picture of the unfolding FMD situation there. An interim official report from the central authorities would be helpful and appreciated (including disease distribution, epidemiological data, number of cases and mortalities, control measures including vaccination coverage, and vaccine-strains used).

According to available information (see previous posts in this thread), the outbreak is caused by an FMDV serotype O strain which has been identified as topotype 'ME-SA', Genotype/strain 'Ind-2001 (KAR-13)'.

The same strain has recently been identified in samples submitted to the WRLFMD from affected cattle in Libya and Saudi Arabia. The circulation of the same virus strain in such distant locations is worrying. It is somewhat reminiscent of the early stages of the FMDV-O epizootic of 2000, when another serotype-O strain, the Pan Asia strain, was initially reported from Asia (Japan, S. Korea, Mongolia) and became pandemic, spreading to Africa and eventually Europe.

FMDV serotype O outbreaks have recently been reported from Israel (on the Syrian-Lebanese border) and from the Palestinian authority (Jericho, adjacent to the Jordanian border, yet to be officially reported to the OIE). Their genetic profiles, including their interrelationship, are not yet known. Hopefully, samples have been forwarded to the reference laboratory. - Mod.AS
