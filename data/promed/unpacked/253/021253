[1] Upsurge in Perth cases

A top doctor has warned of an upsurge in hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD] in Perth, with kids and adults suffering painful symptoms after contracting the highly contagious virus.

HFMD is a viral infection that causes a rash or blisters on the hands and feet, as well as in or around the mouth. It mainly affects children under the age of 10, but can also affect adolescents and, in rare cases, adults.

A Perth dad found that out the hard way when he contracted the virus from his toddler. He told The West Live that he, like many adults, didn't think he was at risk of contracting the virus, especially when his son recovered fairly quickly with minimal symptoms.

However, as with chicken pox, getting HFMD as an adult can be a very different story.

"I started noticing very bad back pain, bad neck pain, bad headaches, and there was a day when I slept for 20 out of 24 hours, but I didn't put it down to anything other than a big session at the gym and being a bit run down," the dad said. "And then there was an explosion of marks on my body on Sunday [18 Apr 2021]; it was literally an overnight bang."

He said he now has painful blisters on his hands and feet, which he initially worried were the symptoms of meningococcal, prompting him to visit a GP. "To even put shoes on now is incredibly painful," he said.

Blisters in and around his mouth are also making it challenging to eat. "I'm pretty much on a water diet; swallowing is pretty difficult, and it's on the tongue, it's on the lips, the corner of the mouth," he said.

He was told by his GP that HFMD was rife in Perth right now, which was confirmed by Dr Simon Torvaldsen, chair of the AMA Council of General Practice in WA.

Dr Torvaldsen said there is no vaccination that can protect against the virus, which "goes around in waves" through the community.

"Currently, there's been a bit of an upsurge once again," Dr Torvaldsen told the West Live.

The doctor said the virus was spread through contact with the fluid from inside the blisters, with the droplets spread from sneezing and coughing, or through contact with faecal matter of an infected person.

It typically is spread among children who play together at schools, daycare centres, or playgrounds.

[2] Protection from HFMD infection

A leading doctor says there's been a spike of hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD] infections in Perth.

The disease is quite contagious, so what are the symptoms, how does it spread, and should you be worried?

What are the symptoms?
------------------
Symptoms of HFMD vary from person to person. Some people may experience small white blisters on their palms, the soles of their feet, and in their mouth, with a bit of inflammation around the blisters. This may lead to a sore mouth and throat, dehydration, and a poor appetite.

Alternatively, a red skin rash with a brown scale on it could appear on a person's arms, hands, legs, feet, and around the mouth.

The trunk area usually remains clear, according to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne.

Dr Simon Torvaldsen, Chair of the WA Australian Medical Association Council of General Practice, says the disease usually begins with a mild flu-like illness and low-grade fever.

"Particularly in children, usually it makes them mildly to moderately unwell, a bit like a cold or flu," he said.

However, children typically recover within a few days to a week.

Dr Torvaldsen says the disease is quite easily identifiable.

"There is no other condition really that gives you those spots that look like that, that are exactly in those areas only," he explains.

Until the fever subsides -- and the spots or blisters start to dry up -- it's important for the infected person to be isolated from school or work.

How does it spread?
-----------------
The disease is most common in kids, who typically don't exercise good social distancing practices. Therefore, the disease can run rampant though schools and kindergartens.

"It's readily transmitted through close contact," Dr Torvaldsen says, such as skin-to-skin contact. "[Or] any sort of close contact or sharing of eating and drinking utensils."

To help prevent spread, the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne recommends washing your hands thoroughly after touching a child's bodily fluids -- including their blisters -- and when helping them blow their nose or go to the toilet.

It's best not to share drinking and eating utensils, plus towels, shoes, socks, and toothbrushes.

Why has there been a spike?
-------------------------
Dr Torvaldsen says HFMD comes in waves.

"That's just the nature of these viruses, a bit like colds and flus," he says.

However, it's not a reportable or notifiable disease, so it's not clear just how many cases there are.

"So other than a general sense that we are seeing more cases than usual, we actually don't know for sure exactly the numbers that are infected," he says, adding that doctors only see a portion of the cases that occur.

Should you be worried?
------------------------
While it's not known to be deadly, the disease can be rather unpleasant. Some people can find it hard to swallow because of their blisters. It can also require people to take time off work.

But Dr Torvaldsen says, "It's still generally not considered to be dangerous."

The Queensland Health Department warns in rare cases, people may develop a more severe case with complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or paralysis.

Can adults catch it?
-----------------
Yes. According to the Queensland Health Department, older children and adults can be affected by the disease, but it mainly occurs in young children.

What's the remedy?
------------------
Basically, just rest and paracetamol, Dr Torvaldsen says. And water to help with potential dehydration.

[The most common cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease [HFMD] is the virus coxsackievirus A16. The coxsackievirus belongs to a group of viruses called nonpolio enteroviruses. Other types of enteroviruses sometimes cause [HFMD].

"Coxsackievirus A6 can also cause HFMD, and the symptoms may be more severe. Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) has been associated with cases and outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia. Although rare, EV-A71 has been associated with more severe diseases such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain)" [excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/transmission.html]. - Mod.LK
