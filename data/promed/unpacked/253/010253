An unidentified disease currently ravaging parts of Garissa District
[see ProMED-mail post entitled: "Viral hemorrhagic fever - Kenya
(Garissa): susp. 20061221.3578"] has claimed 5 more people, pushing
the death toll to 12.
Garissa Medical Officer of Health, Dr Abdullahi Abagira, confirmed
the deaths. He said the disease, which affects both livestock and
human beings, was highly contagious and was already taking a high
toll on the herdsmen in grazing fields, where the 1st case was
reported last week. Seven people died from the disease in Shanta Abaq
and Fafi areas, where hundreds of livestock have also succumbed.
The MOH said the animals are exhibiting similar symptoms as human
beings but not as severe. Three herdsmen died on arrival at the
Garissa Provincial General Hospital. Nurses told "The Standard" that
efforts to resuscitate the bleeding patients were not successful.
Most of the victims experienced high fever, swollen limbs, diarrhoea
and vomited blood. Abagira convened a crisis meeting on Wednesday to
map out modalities of containing the outbreak amid fears that the
disease could spread further. And medics from the African Medical and
Research foundation (AMRF) jetted into the area in a bid to unravel
the disease.

The Government has identified the disease that has killed 11 people
in Garissa. The Health ministry Public Relations Officer, Mr Njeru
Ngari, said on Thu 21 Dec 2006 that the Kenya Medical Research
Institute (KEMRI) had identified the disease as Rift Valley
haemorrhagic fever.
Consequently, Health minister Mrs Charity Ngilu and her Livestock
counterpart, Mr Joseph Munyao, will meet on Friday morning [22 Dec
2006] to discuss ways of managing the disease. The fever is mainly an
animal disease, but can be transmitted to human beings through
mosquitoes and raw milk. There is a livestock vaccine against the
fever, but none for humans. Head of Preventive and Promotive Health
Services,
Dr Shahnaaz Sharif said mosquitoes were transmitting the fever,
especially to humans. "Most of the patients are aged between 20 and
30 and are men," Sharif said. Speaking at a press briefing at the
Ministry of Health headquarters, Sharif said the major symptoms of
the disease are fever, headache, vomiting and abdominal pains. He
attributed the outbreak to the floods in North Eastern Province. The
ministry has started distributing 240 000 mosquito nets to residents.

[The prediction by ProMED-mail moderators that the unidentified
disease afflicting cattle-herders and their animals in the North
Eastern Province of Kenya would prove to be an outbreak of Rift
Valley fever has now been confirmed.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute, fever-causing viral disease that
affects domestic animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and
camels) and humans. RVF is most commonly associated with
mosquito-borne epidemics during years of unusually heavy rainfall.
The disease is caused by the RVF virus, a member of the genus
_Phlebovirus_ in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first
reported among livestock by veterinary officers in Kenya in the early
1900s. and has since been recorded throughout East Africa and the
Middle East.
A detailed account of the epidemiology of Rift Valley fever can be
found at the CDC web-site
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf.htm>), and
a map of the North Eastern Province of Kenya can be found at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/kenya.pdf>. -

[Unfortunately, once again, humans play sentinels for a (severe)
zoonotic disease, which is also a transboundary disease. This is a
reminder for the urgent need to improve animal health surveillance by
the strengthening of veterinary infrastructures in eastern and other
parts of Africa.
Laboratory confirmation, followed by official notification, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
