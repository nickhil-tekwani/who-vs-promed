Viet Nam: 29th Confirmed Human Case of Avian Influenza Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A 16-year-old girl from southern Viet Nam has become infected with
the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus that killed 32 people earlier in
2004 and devastated the poultry industry across Asia, a doctor said
on Thu 30 Dec 2004. The girl, from the southern Mekong Delta province
of Dong Thap, was in critical condition and on a respirator at the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, hospital deputy
director Dr. Tran Tinh Hien said.

Viet Nam has suffered recurring outbreaks of the disease in chicken
farms -- most recently in southern provinces -- since a big wave of
infections sickened poultry across much of Asia earlier in 2004. The
virus has jumped to people in Viet Nam, where it killed 20, and
Thailand, where it killed 12.

The girl from Dong Thap is Vietnam's 29th person confirmed with the
disease [however, see below - Mod.CP]. "She is still in critical
condition and is being hooked to a respirator," Hien said. The girl
had slaughtered a chicken she brought with her from Dong Thap
province to southern Tay Ninh province, where she was visiting her
uncle. She developed the disease's typical symptoms of high fever,
coughing and breathing difficulties on 19 Dec 2004, said Huynh Tan
Kiet of the Tay Ninh provincial Preventive Medicine Centre. Most
human cases of bird flu have been traced to direct contact with sick
birds. The virus is not believed to have mutated into a form that can
easily be passed among people.

The girl was admitted to a clinic in Tay Ninh province late last
week, before being transferred to the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on
26 Dec 2004, Kiet said. None of her uncle's 8 family members have
developed avian influenza symptoms, and the man's house has been
disinfected, he said. Heath officials were still investigating how
the girl contracted the disease.

Vietnam's last previous human case of bird flu was a 14-month-old boy
who died in September 2004 in Hanoi. During the outbreaks earlier in
the year, more than 100 million chickens and ducks were culled or
died in 10 countries and territories in Asia, including more than 40
million in Vietnam. Animal health officials have recently warned
that seasonably cool temperatures and the increased transportation of
poultry between now and the Lunar New Year holiday in early February
2005 create conditions favouring the spread of the virus. Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai this week ordered a ban on transportation of
sick poultry from affected areas, and heavy penalties for those who
sell sick birds at markets.

Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation - 28th Confirmed Human Case
--------------------------------------------------
WHO has received informal reports of a laboratory-confirmed [human]
case of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in Viet Nam. The patient,
who has been hospitalized since 26 Dec 2004, is a 16-year-old girl
who fell ill in the southern province of Tay Ninh. The Vietnamese
authorities are investigating the source of her infection, including
the possibility of contact with infected poultry.

This is the 1st human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection detected in Viet Nam since early September 2004. It
coincides with several fresh poultry outbreaks reported in southern
provinces in December. Recent poultry outbreaks in Tay Ninh Province
have not been reported. As avian influenza viruses become more active
at cooler temperatures, further poultry outbreaks, possibly
accompanied by sporadic human cases, can be anticipated.

Poultry marketing, transportation, and consumption increase in Viet
Nam with the approach of the Lunar New Year in early February. These
activities create conditions favouring the spread of poultry
outbreaks and call for heightened control measures.

Since January of 2004, 28 human cases have been detected in Viet Nam.
Of these, 20 were fatal. Thailand has also reported human cases,
bringing the total in Asia since the beginning of 2004 to 45 cases.
