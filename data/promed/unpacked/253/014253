Since June 2018, more than 20 customers have contracted a severe bacterial infection after visiting a massage parlour in KL [Kuala Lumpur], Oriental Daily reports. Out of the 20, 7 victims have expressed their grievances to the members of the Kuala Lumpur Chinese Assembly Hall (KLCAH) as well as the director of Malaysia's Public Service Department, Xue Fufeng. This was done so at a press conference on [28 Jan 2019, where the 7 victims brought their medical reports along.

MRSA [methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_] usually causes infections on the skin and is harder to treat as it is resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. Serious cases involve the infection of surgical wounds, bloodstream, lungs, and urinary tract.

As it is, majority of the victims underwent surgery to remove the infected parts, and some of them are still under quarantine in the hospital due to its highly-contagious nature.

One of the victims known told the press that he visited the massage parlour on [20 Nov 2018], and subsequently found his legs itchy and painful. After a week of painkillers and antibiotics, both of which did not work, [he] visited the doctor, where he was told that he would need to undergo a surgery immediately or it would compromise a full recovery. "From the 2 weeks it took for me to fall sick and to be hospitalised, the doctor had to remove the flesh from 8 infected wounds as the surrounding tissue was already dead. The entire surgery was RM 23 000 [Malaysian ringgit] (SGD 7569.82) [about USD 5616], which includes a month of follow-up consultations."

The wife of another victim said that her husband had gotten rashes and spots after visiting the same place. After seeking medical attention, he decided to warn others about his experience on Facebook, and the post went viral. It connected the other victims, who banded together to escalate the matter to the relevant authorities.

According to Oriental Daily, all victims were serviced by the same masseuse before experiencing the symptoms, which included swelling, pain, and pus-filled wounds. Some even had their ability to walk affected. In another report by China Press, one of the victims was told by the doctor that an amputation will be required if the infection reaches the bone. Furthermore, a number of victims thought that they were isolated cases until they heard about similar cases on the Internet.

KLCAH will be submitting the medical and police reports to the relevant authorities for investigation, and another press conference will be called for in the near future to provide updates.

[Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is a type of _S. aureus_ that is resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, which include methicillin, oxacillin, and other more common antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. MRSA have caused infections acquired in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital, long-term care facility (such as a nursing home), or hemodialysis unit for more than 40 years.

The appearance of MRSA infections acquired outside healthcare settings is a more recent problem, first reported in Australia and the United States. Clusters of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections have been documented among children in daycare centers, athletes participating in contact sports, military recruits, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, Native Americans, men who have sex with men, IV drug users, and prisoners, who had no link to health care systems since the late 1990's in the US.

Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces (such as, gym equipment, shared towels), and poor hygiene.

Molecular typing of _S. aureus_ by 1) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 2) multilocus sequencing (MLST), that is, DNA sequencing of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping genes, 3) spa typing, that is, DNA sequencing of staphylococcal protein A gene variable repeat region, and 4) staphylococcal cassette chromosome _mec_ (SCC_mec_) typing are commonly used to characterize methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) isolates.

The SCC_mec_ gene determines methicillin-resistance. In this regard, CA-MRSA are distinct from healthcare-associated strains (HA-MRSA). Unlike HA-MRSA, most CA-MRSA carry SCC_mec_ types IV or V and are usually susceptible to a wider range of antibiotics, other than beta-lactams. HA-MRSA carry larger SCC_mec_ types I, II, or III, which carry additional genes that encode resistance to classes of antimicrobial drugs other than beta-lactams. However, CA-MRSA are becoming more resistant to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, mupirocin, and tetracycline.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies MRSA isolates based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns (for example, USA100-1200) (McDougal L, et al. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of oxacillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates from the United States: Establishing a national database. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(11): 5113-20; available at http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/41/11/5113).

USA300 causes most community-associated MRSA infections and has become increasingly a cause of health care-associated MRSA infections in the United States. USA100 are multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA that are typically associated with healthcare-acquired infections. USA300 usually carries the genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (an exotoxin that induces lysis of host phagocytic blood cells, thus impairing host response), and has caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue infection, as well as invasive disease (such as, bacteremia, endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis) (Tenover FC, Goering RV: Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ strain USA300: origin and epidemiology. J Antimicrob Chemother 2009; 64(3): 441-6; available at https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/64/3/441/776075). USA300 is also characterized by having the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), MLST ST8, and spa-sequence type t008.

MRSA can be spread at recreational facilities by direct and indirect contact with infected persons. Direct contact can happen when there is contact another person's MRSA infection or colonized. Indirect contact can happen when there is contact with shared items (like towels or razors) or surfaces (like hand rails, massage tables or locker room benches) that are contaminated with MRSA.

Sporadic cases of CA-MRSA infection related to sharing cosmetic equipment and an outbreak of the USA300 strain related to a beauty salon in the Netherlands (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2630724/) have been reported.

Preventive measures in massage facilities include carefully covering all open sores, not sharing any personal items like towels or razors, and disinfecting all surfaces before and after each client, as well as changing linens used during massage.

Molecular typing of the isolates of MRSA causing infection in the more than 20 clients of the masseur who have developed MRSA infections and any strains isolated from the environment and the masseur would help delineate transmission pathways. - Mod.ML
