The 1st case of the tick-borne Powassan virus has been confirmed this year [2021], according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The person infected was a Waldo County resident who is recovering after initially being hospitalized with the virus.

Cases of Powassan are rare in the United States, with about 25 cases reported each year since 2015, according to the Maine CDC.

Maine has identified 9 cases since 2010. People become infected with Powassan through the bite of an infected deer tick [blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_] or woodchuck tick [_Ixodes cookei_ and also _Ixodes marxi_, the squirrel tick], health officials said.

The symptoms of Powassan virus [infection] are similar to other tick- and mosquito-borne illnesses, such as eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus.

Symptoms may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Serious neurologic problems may also occur.

Health officials recommend people wear long sleeves and pants and use insect repellant to prevent tick and mosquito bites.

People are also encouraged to perform tick checks after being outside.

[The season for tick transmission of various pathogens, including Powassan virus, is underway in northeastern USA, including Maine. Powassan virus infections have occurred in Maine before, and the virus is probably endemic there.

Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the USA, Canada, and Russia. In the USA, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states, including Maine, and the Great Lakes region. Cases of Powassan virus infection occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active.

Residents and visitors in Maine and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well advised to heed the CDC advice mentioned to avoid tick bites. The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that the above precautions and those of the CDC should be ignored. - Mod.TY
