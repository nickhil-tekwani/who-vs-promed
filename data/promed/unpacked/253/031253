Farmers are desperately seeking a new release of the calicivirus [Rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus after its failure to eradicate rabbits in wetter
areas. They are calling on the Department of Natural Resources and
Environment to act urgently as rabbit populations continue to increase. The
first release of the virus has been described by some farmers in southern
and western areas of Victoria as a disaster.
Victorian Farmers Federation Land Use Committee Executive Officer Jon Pitt
said the success of the calicivirus was patchy. "It has been very
successful in the drier areas and not so good in others," he said.
Woady Yaloak Catchment Group project officer Cam Nicholson said [the
calicivirus had no effect in his district, which includes 48,000 hectares
south of Ballarat near Pittong, Rokewood and Cape Clear. "We expected a
big bang and dead rabbits around everywhere and that certainly didn't
happen," he said. "No one seems to understand how it spreads and I think we
need to know how it works before it is re-released."
Chatsworth Merino wool producer Belinda Winter-Irving said [the
calicivirus had been ineffective because it hadn't spread from release
sites. "The only rabbits that have died here are from our 1080 carrot
baiting in January," she said. [The "Calicivirus is supposed to have come
through this area but if it did, it didn't do anything."
Bellarine Peninsula farmer Graeme Brown said the department should have
released the virus at more sites to ensure widespread eradication. "On
some of the farms I sharefarm, rabbits are still a real problem," he said.
"It needs to be re-released because in hindsight [the calicivirus has been
a disaster." [Unclear what he meant by this. -- Mod CHC
A Federal Bureau of Resource Sciences report found a reduction of 65% of
rabbit numbers had occurred in 17% of broad-scale monitoring sites where
the virus was introduced by inoculation, compared with 76% where the virus
spread naturally.
[The Calicivirus has been released at 120 sites in Victoria and has been
less effective in the wetter areas of the state, according to the DNRE.
The department confirmed further releases were unlikely. Its Mallee pest
animal co-ordinator, Laurie Hocking, said the virus had spread well in dry
areas, killing up to 95% of rabbits on some properties in the state's north.
John Hardiman, the marketer of the Victorian-developed Rid-A-Rabbit, a
rabbit killing invention using LP [liquid propane gas, said farmers
desperate to control [plagues of rabbits were calling him regularly. He
said graziers were relying on 1080 poison, fumigation and technology to
kill rabbits because calicivirus had not spread.

[So we have gone from hysteria, in which the release of this virus was
about to let loose untold horrors on the vertebrate populations of
Australia, to a scenario in which the virus is not killing rabbits at a
rate sufficient to suit everyone. Sounds like what might have been
expected. Next we will hear of virus-resistance building in the Australian
and New Zealand rabbit populations
and then we will hear nothing while careers are built on studies of the
development of this resistance. As Yogi Berra said, "It's deja vu all over
again." (i.e., myxomatosis). -- Mod CHC
