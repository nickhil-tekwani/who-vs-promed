Since the beginning of the [2018] mosquito season, 9 deaths related to the West Nile virus have been reported in Serbia, 4 of them in the past week [1-7 Aug 2018], the Institute of Public Health of Serbia stated in a press release on [Tue 7 Aug 2018]. The release reads that the virus was confirmed in the population of mosquitoes in northern parts of Serbia, especially in Belgrade, where all 4 fatal outcomes occurred.

The institute said that of 102 cases of West Nile infection this season [2018], 44 were registered in Belgrade, as the mosquitoes carrying the virus in Serbia are most densely populated around the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The press release said that from the 1st confirmed West Nile infection in 2012 to the end of 2017, 574 infections have been reported in Serbia, 61 of which were fatal.

In European Union (EU) countries, 111 cases of the virus -- mostly in Italy and Greece -- have been reported so far in 2018. Last year [2017], there were 340 reports of infection, resulting in 35 deaths.

The West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and maintained among birds. Besides humans, the virus also [affects] horses. 80 per cent of people infected with the virus have no symptoms, whereas 20 per cent report a flulike illness. The virus is life-threatening for the elderly. In fewer than one per cent of people, the virus causes aseptic meningitis or encephalitis that require hospitalization. These patients report headaches, a stiff neck, disorientation, weakness, and depression.

The institute urges people to use prevention against mosquitoes to reduce the risk of catching the virus.

["Serological and virological examination of the presence of human and animal infection caused by West Nile virus (WNV) as well as the presence of the virus in vectors, which has been conducted during the past few years, confirmed an active virus circulation in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. Based on the results obtained intense circulation of WNV is anticipated, which poses substantial risks for both public and animal health in Serbia and having in mind its crucial role in the protection of public health, Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched and funded the national WNV monitoring program starting from April 2014.

"The Program encompassed the entire territory of the Republic of Serbia and was conducted by scientific and specialized veterinary institutes and field veterinary service in close collaboration with qualified entomologists and ornithologists. The principal objective of the monitoring-surveillance program is early detection of WNV in monitored regions, timely reporting of the virus presence and activation of human health service institutions and local authorities aimed at establishing the control measures -- eradication of mosquitoes, informing the local community and taking all relevant preventive measures for human health protection." (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289335005_WEST_NILE_VIRUS_SURVEILLANCE_PROGRAM_IN_SERBIA; accessed 10 Aug 2018).

"The 1st case of West Nile virus, a seasonal viral infection typically spread by mosquitoes mostly in July and August, was confirmed in Serbia in the summer of 2012 and a total of 574 cases (including 61 deaths) have been registered in the country since then."

Three people have died from West Nile fever after an outbreak in Athens that has infected 60 people this year [2018], Greek authorities said on Friday [10 Aug 2018], indicating they were monitoring the situation carefully. "Since last week, we have registered 17 new cases," of the mosquitoborne disease, the Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Keelpno) said.

A total of 60 cases have been recorded since the start of the year [2018], with 16 people still in hospital, including 4 in intensive care, Keelpno added. The bulk of infections have occurred within the past month [mid July to early August 2018]. "That is why we are warning the public," an official said. The cases, mostly in the western suburbs of Athens, mark a reappearance of the virus after an outbreak last year [2017] when Greek authorities registered 48 cases resulting in 5 deaths.

The virus can cause flulike symptoms, but in extreme cases, it can result in tremors, fever, coma and a lethal swelling of the brain tissue, known as encephalitis. It can also cause meningitis. First discovered in Uganda in 1937, the virus is carried by birds and spread to humans by mosquitoes. It is indigenous to Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia.

"It is necessary that health professionals and national and local authorities are vigilant because there is no way of predicting which regions the virus could spread to," said Keelpno. Cases of the West Nile virus have also been reported in 2018 in Hungary, Italy, Romania and Serbia, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Some European countries this year [2018] experienced an early start to their West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season, which could be related to earlier warmer temperatures and higher rainfall levels that foster populations of culex mosquitoes that carry the virus, according to 2 reports published today in the latest issue of Eurosurveillance.

In the first study, focused just on Italian surveillance, researchers said the 1st human case was reported in the endemic province of Rovigo, in Veneto region, in the middle of June [2018] [1]. They note that the first cases are usually seen in July, with case numbers peaking in August and September. Also, they said human cases are higher than in previous years. As of 1 Aug [2018], 52 human WNV infections had been reported in 2 regions. The cases include 16 neuroinvasive illnesses, 14 involving West Nile fever, and 22 with asymptomatic infections.

In recent years, transmission patterns have been changing for other vectorborne diseases in Europe, and climate change has been implicated as a contributing factor, the group wrote. They said the One Health surveillance system in Italy is providing an early-warning service, which allowed blood and tissue donation safety measures to be stepped up before the 1st human cases were reported.

In the 2nd report, a team led by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) detailed early WNV activity in Italy along with Greece, Hungary, and Romania [2]. The investigators said the 1st cases of 2018 were reported from Greece in late June and early July, with 31 May as the earliest illness onset. In other European countries, the authors also saw a steeper rise in cases, with 168 cases reported in the first 6 weeks of the season compared with 8, 2, 62, and 66 in 2014 through 2017, respectively.

Climate data show that precipitation was above average in March [2018], especially in West Nile-affected areas, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures with normal rainfall in April and warmer temperatures in May, with precipitation levels along the Adriatic coast high in May and June.

They authors concluded that the weather pattern reflects an early spring in southeastern Europe, which could favor an early rise in vector populations. The early season should trigger heightened vigilance for the disease for clinicians. They note that outbreaks depend on numerous factors, and an early start to the season does not necessarily mean large outbreaks will occur.

[The WNV case numbers are increasing in Europe at a faster rate this year [2018], owing to an earlier rise in vector activity because of warmer temperatures; the presence of a working surveillance system has been able to detect and document this, which can help public health officials plan control measures accordingly. - Mod.UBA
