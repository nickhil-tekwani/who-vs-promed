Ministry of Health investigates an outbreak of whooping cough in Jinotega
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough may be
responsible for the deaths of at least 4 children with 70 others
affected in the Amak area, on the Bocay River in Jinotega, according
to a warning by Jose Luis Rodriguez, pastor of the Council of
Pro-Denominational Alliance Churches (CEPAD).

Whooping cough (or pertussis is a contagious bacterial disease that
causes a violent and sometimes difficult to control cough that can
lead to difficulty in breathing, and it can lead to incapacitation or
death of those affected, particularly in young children.

Through a press release, CEPAD reported that Pastor Rodriguez
received the news from Maria Cornejo, one of the health promoters in
the area [health promoters are community health workers. - Mod.MPP]

She added that on 25 Mar [2009] another 7 children were suspected of
being infected. The children are from the Amalakuwas community,
located about 8 hours by pipante [a motorized dugout canoe] from the
Karawah community on the same Bocay river.

Bocas de Wina, 36 km [approx. 22 mi] from Ayapal, is another place
where tens of children were reported with symptoms of whooping cough
according to CEPAD.

The main cause of the outbreak, according to the health promoter, is
that parents do not come to vaccinate their children when they
conduct vaccination days. [In remote, difficult to access regions,
vaccination activities are often conducted on special vaccination
days, either once a week or once a month, or other frequencies
depending upon the size of the target population. Maintenance of the
cold chain, keeping vaccines within required temperature ranges so
they maintain their potency, is a challenge, as well as the logistics
of bringing supplies and trained personnel into these regions. - Mod.MPP]

The Ministry of Health (MINSA) via Dr Edmundo Sanchez, director of
the Department of Disease Surveillance, confirmed the existence of
tens of children with symptoms of a cold (catarrhal disease),
especially cough, in the Jinotega area. However, he said they cannot
ensure what the disease is [the diagnosis], until they have taken
samples from cases and perform a variety of different tests on the specimens.

According to Sanchez, a medical team from MINSA traveled to the
affected area and they expect to have news on what is really
happening there. "For now, we cannot say what disease is affecting
the population, the children, but we do not think that it is an
outbreak of whooping cough, because this zone has a good immunization
coverage, surpassing 85 per cent. When we know what is going on we
will [provide more information], it is not our policy to hide what is
happening," said Dr Sanchez.

[Even with more widespread immunization, outbreaks of pertussis in
young infants (who represent the cohort with most of the severe
morbidity and mortality in this disease) can occur since vaccine
immunity wanes and can produce adolescents and young adults who,
manifesting infection as a chronic cough, transmit _Bordetella
pertussis_ to infants. Reimmunization of this older group may be able
to prevent serious pertussis in infants not old enough to be fully immunized.

More information on the results of investigations of this outbreak
would be appreciated.
