California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA) state veterinarian Dr. Annette Jones disclosed on 15 Aug 2019 that ongoing surveillance and testing in the virulent Newcastle disease (VND) outbreak in Southern California resulted in the detection of a new case on 14 Aug 2019 at a retail feed store in western San Bernardino County.

Jones said this is the 1st detection of VND since 4 Jun 2019. She noted staff members from CDFA and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered the infected birds during a routine biosecurity check at the feed store, which has been closed temporarily while an investigation is conducted. The exposed birds have been euthanized.

"We are moving quickly to determine the origin of disease and working with the store to identify any customers who may have purchased infected birds and products like feed, equipment, or anything else possibly carrying the infection," Jones said. "Our priority is to stop the spread of the virus and eradicate the disease, and while we've made significant progress, this case is instructive for all bird owners in Southern California to remain aware of VND signs, practice good biosecurity, don't move birds, and report any sick birds immediately to the Sick Bird Hotline: (866) 922-2473."

Jones said the regional quarantine is still in effect (see map at https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Animal_Health/pdfs/RegionalQuarantineMap.pdf). A complete list of VND cases since the outbreak began in May 2018 is available on the USDA VND website: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/virulent-newcastle/vnd.

[Virulent Newcastle disease, formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs.

Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected with mild symptoms, such as conjunctivitis. These are easily prevented with personal protective equipment.

As of 16 Aug 2019, USDA has confirmed 449 premises in California as infected with vND, including 142 in San Bernardino County, 260 in Riverside County, 45 in Los Angeles County, 1 in Ventura County, and 1 in Alameda County. USDA also confirmed 1 infected premises in Utah County, Utah, and 1 infected premises in Coconino County, Arizona.

Virulent Newcastle disease is one of the most serious poultry diseases worldwide. A death rate of almost 100% can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks. Virulent Newcastle disease can infect and cause death even in vaccinated poultry.

Virulent Newcastle disease spreads when healthy birds come in direct contact with bodily fluids from sick birds. The disease affects almost all birds and poultry, even vaccinated poultry. The virus can travel on manure, egg flats, crates, other farming materials or equipment, and people who have picked up the virus on their clothing, shoes, or hands.

A domestic introduction could cause devastating effects on the poultry industry [as we have seen for approximately 18 months - Mod.TG] and have a significant impact on trade. A large vND outbreak would have long-term economic consequences and an extensive recovery period.

Clinical signs in chickens include
- sudden death and increased death loss in flock;
- sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing;
- greenish, watery diarrhea;
- decreased activity, tremors, drooping wings, twisting of head and neck, circling, complete stiffness; and
- swelling around the eyes and neck.

It is essential that all poultry owners follow good biosecurity practices to help protect their birds from infectious diseases. These simple steps include
- washing hands and scrubbing boots before and after entering a poultry area;
- cleaning and disinfecting tires and equipment before moving them off the property; and
- isolating any birds returning from shows for 30 days before placing them with the rest of the flock.

All bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials right away, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.
