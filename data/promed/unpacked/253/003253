New foot-and-mouth case confirmed
---------------------------------
A new case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been confirmed in the
same county as the UK's last outbreak.
The government has set up a 10km (6.2 mile) control zone centred on
the affected farm near Egham, Surrey, and a pre-emptive slaughter has
been ordered.
A national movement ban has been put in place to prevent the disease
spreading from Milton Park Farm, Stroude Road.
A report into the August [2007] outbreak blamed a leaking pipe at the
Pirbright animal research site in Surrey.
The latest outbreak comes just days after the government declared
Surrey to be FMD free.
Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said it was
a "disaster" for British agriculture.
"The industry will be devastated that all the hard work it has put in
to eradicate the outbreaks of 3 Aug and 8 Aug 2007 when the whole
industry was completely locked up for a long time," he said.
Dr Reynolds, said the control zone was put in place swiftly because
"containment and eradication of FMD is our top priority".
She urged farmers to remain vigilant and report any suspicions.
The EU has halted plans to lift the export ban on livestock products
from the area around the original outbreak.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is due to chair a meeting of the Cobra
emergency committee at 1700 BST (1600 GMT).
A farmer at Stroude Farm, Stroude Road, said he had heard nothing of the news.
He said: "This has made me go all cold. It was only Monday [10 Sep
2007] that they opened up the country after the last time.
"I can't believe it's happening again. I have heard nothing about it.
You'd think they'd let us know."
The Cobra meeting will take place once the government has received the results.
The control zone was set up around the suspected outbreak at 0935 BST.
Earlier in the summer, 2 farms tested positive for the disease but
the all-clear has since been given.
FMD was confirmed in a herd of cattle at Woolford Farm in Surrey on 3 Aug 2007.
A 2nd case, at a farm nearby, was confirmed on 7 Aug 2007.
A report into the previous outbreak found it was probably caused by
leaking drains, heavy rain and building work at the Pirbright site, 4
miles from where the disease was originally found.
But the Health and Safety Executive said it was not clear which of
the 2 labs which share the site - Merial, a private pharmaceutical
company, and the Institute of Animal Health (IAH) - were responsible.

original alert that this outbreak was identified, shortly before the
laboratory confirmation was received. - Mod.MPP]
[DEFRA's press release on the suspected outbreak in Wegham (seemingly
confirmed in the meantime) is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2007/animal-0912.htm>.
The declaration of a control zone, including a map, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/declaration-tcz120907-2.pdf>.
Details on the affected holding, number, species and age of the
animals involved, proximity to other animal holdings, the estimated
age of the erosions (if observed) and the suspected route(s) of
introduction, are anticipated. If in case clinical symptoms have been
observed now, the virus may have been circulating on the premises for
some time, up to several weeks. Unravelling the source and route of
the pathogen's introduction are crucial for the decisions on the due
steps which may be needed to contain the outbreak and subsequently
regain the UK's freedom of FMD. The earlier such information becomes
available, the earlier efficient measures may be applied, free
movement of animals of susceptible species within the UK is
reinstituted and UK's international trade in animals and their
products may be resumed. - Mod. AS].
