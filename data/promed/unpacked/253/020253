New laboratory-confirmed cholera cases reported during 10-16 Dec 2007 (week 51)

no cholera case was reported from Kirkuk.
- Sulaymaniyah: no report was received this week
- Ninewa: during the period 9 Sep 2007-16 Dec 2007, 21 837 acute
diarrhea cases were reported, 15 570 stool samples tested for
cholera, and only 5 tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_

Overview and pattern of transmission in Baghdad Province
--------------------------------------------------------
During week 51, no report was received from Baghdad, therefore, the
cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases remained as reported
at 127 cases. Data provided from Baghdad are neither complete nor
timely; therefore, reported cholera cases may underestimate the real
situation. What is reported from Baghdad seems to be the tip of the
iceberg. There is a noticeable relaxation in the surveillance system
in all affected provinces including Baghdad.

Health officials of the Kaohsiung county government said yesterday
[25 Dec 2007] 14 patients in a mental institution in the southern
Taiwan county of Kaohsiung are suspected to have been infected with
amoebic dysentery.
The officials said that they were informed 19 Dec 2007 by Hualien
County that 9 patients from Kaohsiung's Liang Jen Hospital who were
recently transferred to a Yuli sanatorium in the county had a high
level of _Entamoeba histolytica_ antibodies in their blood. Further
tests showed that 3 out of the 9 have been infected with the disease.
The officials said that they immediately began disinfection work at
Liang Jen Hospital and conducted tests on 105 patients. 14 of the
patients were suspected to have been infected, although they have
shown no symptoms of diarrhea. Stool samples of the 14 patients will
be collected 3 times within the next week to determine whether they
have been infected, the officials said.

[3] Cholera - Congo DR: (North Kivu)

A total of 5 people have reportedly succumbed to an outbreak of
cholera in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Rutshuru town.
Rutshuru, which lies north of Goma, has become a center of heavy
fighting between rebels and government forces in recent times.
The outbreak has erupted among the town's displaced people. And
according to health officials, at least 1300 people have so far been
affected by the outbreak. Health experts linked the outbreak to lack
of drinking water and pit latrines in refugee camps in Rutshuru.
Humanitarian workers had earlier warned against the emergence of
health in Rutshuru and Masisi.

The UN (United Nations) has said it is concerned with annual cholera
outbreaks in Malawi, which are costly for the country. World Health
Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
representative, Ben Chandiyamba, made the remarks in Nkhata Bay on
Sat 22 Dec 2007, during the official launch of 2007-8 cholera
campaign.
By 16 Dec 2007, the country has registered 291 cases of cholera with
8 deaths. Nsanje, with 154 cases, reported the highest number,
trailed by Blantyre with 54 cases. Other districts affected were
Nkhotakota, Mulanje, Thyolo, and Chikwawa.
