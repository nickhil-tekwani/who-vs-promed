Investigation report on a foodborne norovirus outbreak associated
with shellfish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An investigation report on the outbreak of illness that affected 529
people who had eaten at the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire,
during January and February this year [2009], has been published the
Health Protection Agency [HPA] [1].

The investigation was conducted jointly by the Agency and
environmental health officers from the Royal Borough of Windsor and
Maidenhead, with Berkshire East Primary Care Trust also involved. The
outbreak investigations focused on: laboratory testing of diners with
symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting (where possible); analysis of
detailed questionnaires sent to others who reported similar illness;
investigation of illness among staff; examination of the restaurant
environment and food processing, handling and supply; and laboratory
testing of food samples.

Putting together findings from all these parts of the investigation,
the report's conclusions were that:
-- There was a large outbreak of food poisoning among diners at the
Fat Duck Restaurant in January and February 2009, with more than 500
reporting illness -- more than 15 percent of those dining there
during this period;
-- The organism responsible was norovirus which was probably
introduced via shellfish (more diners who ate shellfish dishes
reported illness). Oysters were served raw; razor clams may not have
been appropriately handled or cooked; tracing of shellfish to source
showed evidence of contamination and there have been reports of
illness in other establishments associated with oysters from the same source;
-- The outbreak continued for at least 6 weeks (between 6 Jan 2009
and 22 Feb 2009) because of ongoing transmission at the restaurant --
which may have occurred through continuous contamination of foods
prepared in the restaurant or by person-to-person spread between
staff and diners or a mixture of both;
-- Several weaknesses in procedures at the restaurant may have
contributed to ongoing transmission including: delayed response to
the incident; staff working when they should have been off sick and
use of the wrong environmental cleaning products. Delays in
notification of illness may have affected the ability of the
investigation to identify the exact reason for the norovirus contamination.

The restaurant co-operated fully with the investigation and was able
to re-open in March [2009] having followed recommendations to: review
the food management system to minimise risk of cross-contamination;
identify early warnings of increased staff or customer illness and
ensure prompt notification to the Royal Borough of Windsor and
Maidenhead Environmental Health team; and use of a variety of
education tools to support understanding in those staff whose 1st
language is not English.

Wider recommendations to other restaurants and food-handlers are that
norovirus is an important cause of food poisoning and is easily
spread so there needs to be scrupulous attention to food and personal
hygiene especially when handling shellfish.

Restaurants that suspect food-poisoning among staff or diners should
quickly seek advice and support from their local authority's
environmental health team and the Health Protection Agency. This can
prevent incidents becoming prolonged outbreaks and reduce the number
of diners and staff affected.

[The Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, is one of only 3 in the
United Kingdom and Ireland that have received a 3-star Michelin Guide
rating. In 2005, The Fat Duck restaurant was named as the best
restaurant in the world by Restaurant magazine. Thus even dining at
"the best restaurant in the world" does not protect diners from the
unwise consumption of uncooked sellfish.
