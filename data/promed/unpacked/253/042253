The latest outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD], confirmed in the Viljoenskroon area of the Free State, is a localised, exceptional event, and with the cooperation of all stakeholders the situation can be brought under control soon, according to Gerhard Schutte, chairperson of the National Animal Health Forum. He told Farmer's Weekly that this outbreak was merely a continuation of the illegal movement of animals outside the FMD disease management areas in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal. "This boils down to industrial sabotage and is very concerning. As an industry we have already given our full support to the authorities to bring the transgressors to book."

The Free State was one of South Africa's most important livestock-producing regions, Schutte said. But the impact of FMD had a wider fallout than just meat production, and also affected the mohair, dairy, wool and wildlife industries, among others. "Everybody needs to be included in the solution."

The Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed the case on Thursday [7 April 2022]. The department's member of the executive council, Thembeni Nxangisa, said this followed investigations on 3 farms after suspicions were raised about the movement of cattle from North West to Gauteng. While the cattle on one of the farms tested negative, testing of the others confirmed a single case of FMD. All the farms were placed under quarantine, Nxangisa said in a statement. "[Cattle on] another farm are also being investigated in the Frankfort area following the procurement of calves from a speculator in Randfontein. Veterinary personnel are [now] on the ground implementing appropriate control measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Farmers should, however, remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour in their animals."

The statement added that the disease was characterised by the development of fluid filled vesicles and erosion of the mouth and feet in infected animals, which rendered them unable to eat and walk. In addition, calves and lambs could succumb to heart failure.

[The Free State has become South Africa's fifth province suffering FMD in cattle since the start of the 2022 epizootic, in early February. The others are Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, North West and Gauteng.

On top of local economic losses, caused by the direct and indirect effects of FMD upon the livestock (cattle, sheep, goat, pig) industries, and the accompanying animal suffering, the spread of FMD may affect the country's exports.

The causative agent in the events which have already been reported to the OIE, was FMDV serotype SAT-2. It may be assumed, but requires confirmation, that the recent events have been caused by the same serotype. - Mod.AS
