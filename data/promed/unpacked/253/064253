[According to WHO, the case fatality rate for unvaccinated adult
non-immunes is over 60%.
Moral of story: get vaccinated before traveling to the yellow fever endemic
zones of South America and Africa. The vaccine has no side effects, unless
you are allergic to eggs or are immunodeficient, and gives
protection for at least 10 years - Mod.JW
