Since September [2021], a large number of autumn salmon and sea urchins have been killed on the Pacific coast of Hokkaido.

In September [2021], it was confirmed that about 4000 autumn salmon landed at the Otsu fishing port in Toyokoro Town were dead. Also, by [28 Sep 2021], a large number of farmed sea urchins were found dead on the Pacific coast from Kushiro to Hidaka.

Red tide is believed to be the cause of the mass deaths of autumn salmon and sea urchins.

Red tide was confirmed at Katsurakoi fishing port in Kushiro city in mid-September [2021].

After that, it was confirmed that it occurred in a wide area on the Pacific side from Nemuro City to the offshore of Samani Town in Hidaka.

In addition, sea urchins were found dead in fishing grounds in Urakawa Town and Shinhidaka Town earlier this month [October 2021], and the damaged sea area is spreading to the west.

According to the Fisheries Agency, the damage confirmed by [8 Oct 2021] was more than 1400 tons of sea urchins and 17 000 autumn salmon, and the damage amounted to more than 4.5 billion yen [about USD 39.6 million].

The damage to sea urchins was also serious, with about 90% of the released sea urchins in Kushiro City and Kushiro Town, 80% in Akkeshi Town, and 50% in Hamanaka Town.

Sea urchin fishing in Hokkaido is expected to affect the landing from next year [2022] onward because small sea urchins are released into the sea and landed three to four years after they are grown.

In addition, 400 farmed rockfish were dead in Toyokoro Town, Tokachi, and damage of 200 kg of whelk was confirmed in Kushiro City. It is the largest red tide damage in Hokkaido ever.

On [7 Oct 2021], the heads of 16 coastal municipalities handed a request to Governor Suzuki in response to the fishing damage that caused a large number of autumn salmon and sea urchins to die on the Pacific coast of Eastern Hokkaido.

A survey by the Prefectural Research Organization has revealed the type of organism that caused the red tide off the coast of Eastern Hokkaido.

Of these, _K. mikimotoi_ is a species that has caused damage to the fishing industry mainly in western Japan. It is believed that the rise in seawater temperature due to climate change moved northward to the eastern coast of Hokkaido, leading to red tides.

We also found a type called "_Karenia selliformis_". It is believed to be the cause of the red tide that occurred along the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia from September to October 2020. This is the 1st time it has caused a red tide in Japan.

This time, more _K. selliformis_ were detected than _K. mikimotoi_ in the sea off the east coast of Hokkaido where red tide damage occurred.

Several researchers have pointed out that _K. selliformis_ may have migrated south from cold northern waters, suggesting that the red tide may have been caused by more than just global warming.

Professor Emeritus Ichiro Imai of Hokkaido University, who is familiar with dinoflagellates, said, "I have seen red tides all over Japan, but I am really surprised to see such a large red tide in Hokkaido."

The plankton _K. selliformis_ which is thought to be the cause of red tide has been confirmed in various parts of the world such as New Zealand and Tunisia, but I did not recognize it as a species that causes red tide in Japan. It is frightening to realize that red tides can also occur in Hokkaido if the ocean conditions are right."

Regarding the future outlook, he said, "I think that the red tide will disappear if the seawater temperature drops below 10 deg C [50 deg F] and the winter monsoon blows," but the resistance of _K. selliformis_ to low water temperatures is not well understood so "it is an urgent task to investigate whether it can overwinter in and around Hokkaido."

[Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists called dinoflagellates proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because under certain circumstances these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter-feeding animals, such as clams, oysters, and mussels, in which the toxin bioaccumulate.

_Karenia_ is a genus that comprises several species of marine dinoflagellates. These organisms may produce toxins. For example, _K. brevis_, the causal agent of Florida's red tides, produces brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning
