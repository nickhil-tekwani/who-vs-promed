Wilt disease in tomato crops has severely hit Sundargarh district [Odisha]. The disease is spreading. Assistant Horticulture Officer (AHO), Soumya Pathak, said from symptoms in the affected plants, it appeared to be viral wilt disease and 25 to 30 per cent of the crop was affected. He said farmers admitted to repeating tomato cultivation on the same piece of land, which increases chances of virus contamination and fungus attacks. Pathak said they have asked farmers to immediately remove the plants which are affected to save healthy plants, and avoid repeating planting the crop on the same land.

Assistant Horticulture Director (ADH) SP Nayak said, "It is impossible to contain the disease with any form of treatment, including pesticide application and the only viable option is to remove affected plants," adding that a study would be conducted to assess the total crop damage.

[A considerable number of viruses have been reported to affect tomatoes and other solanaceous crops. In India and other areas, begomoviruses of the leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops. The problems above may be due one or a combination of these viruses, however, symptoms are not described in sufficient detail. Reliable diagnosis is required to be able to design effective management strategies for the farmers.

The leaf curl viruses are transmitted by whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_) and can also be spread by plant material (such as infected tomato transplants). Disease management may include use of certified vector- and virus-free planting material, cultural practices, as well as removal of infected crop residues and pathogen and/or vector reservoirs (such as infected plants, as mentioned above). Control of the vectors is most important, but extremely difficult in open fields due to the wide host range of whiteflies.
