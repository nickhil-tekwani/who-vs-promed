30 People Killed by Encephalitis in Nepal
-----------------------------------------
At least 30 people have been killed by encephalitis in the Terai plain of
southern Nepal since the monsoon season began in mid-June, according to
reports reaching here Friday. The outbreak of encephalitis has claimed the
lives of 20 people in the Chitwan district bordering India, said the
official Rising Nepal daily.
The [Rising Nepal Daily reported that with [increasing numbers of
encephalitis patients [seeking hospital treatment, local hospitals are
facing shortage of beds and manpower. Meanwhile, 10 encephalitis deaths
were reported in Terai districts including Morang, Sunsari, Siraha,
Saptari, Udaypur and Kailali. Encephalitis claims several hundred lives in
southern Nepal every year during the monsoon season that lasts from
mid-June to the end of September.

[Outbreaks of encephalitis are an annual feature in mosquito-infested
regions on the Indian (Uttar Pradesh)-Nepal border. It is likely that
Japanese encephalitis virus is the agent responsible for this outbreak.
Japanese encephalitis virus-induced disease was first identified in 1978 in
the Ganges plain, in the region of the Nepalese Terai, along the border
between Nepal and India. Since then annual epidemics of varying sizes have
been recorded in Nepal and adjacent regions of India during the rainy
season. The largest number of reported cases was 2953 in 1997. In 1999 the
epidemic began about two weeks early (in early July) due probably to early
onset of to the monsoon rains. By the end of August there had been more that
1100 cases and over 170 deaths had been reported in the Terai region of
Nepal. In past years there have been sporadic localized immunization
campaigns, but no attempt at comprehensive vaccination. Travellers into
these regions should be made aware of the developing risk. - Mod.CP
