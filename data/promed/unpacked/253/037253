[Since "stamping out" is a control measure reportedly applied, the entire unit should have been destroyed; thus the number of susceptible animals in the outbreak should have been 18.

At present, at least 2 different foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strains are circulating in China, A and O. Genotyping results of previous isolates are presented at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/cha.htm: 2 strains of FMDV-O, one dating back to 2010 (topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98) and the other one to 2011 (topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia). The FMDV-A strain, sampled and genotyped in 2013, was of topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97. This strain is assumed to be the one still circulating in China and several of its neighbors.

Genotyping of the current FMDV-O strain deserves to be considered; results are anticipated to be published. - Mods.AS/CRD
