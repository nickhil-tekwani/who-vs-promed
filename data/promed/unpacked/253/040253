A 44 year old male patient came to the emergency service of CHU-AP in Mons on 16 Mar 2013 with acute anuria, acute fever at 37.8 C [100.04 F] and an episode of chills in the morning. In Belgium, he is a gardener by profession and reported lumbar pain for several weeks after a work trauma in January 2013 in Belgium.

He mentioned frequent travel to Madagascar (Mahajanga) for entertainment (beach gaming and fishing), lasting usually for 3 weeks every 3 or 4 months including during the rainy season. He had no diabetes mellitus. Clinical laboratory diagnostics showed a severe inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein at 308 mg/L), and medical imagery demonstrated spondylodiscitis at L1, multiple lung infiltrates, as well as pyelonephritis and prostatic abscess. The patient was treated by levofloxacin (400 mg twice a day). The clinical status of the patient remained stable, with decreasing inflammatory syndrome and fever. A month after the initial hospitalization, however, the patient was again hospitalized following new identification of the causative agent and relapsing inflammatory syndrome. Pulmonary lesions and spondylodiscitis were not improved.

Microbiological results of blood and urine cultures obtained upon hospital admission yielded an organism identified as _Burkholderia cepacia_ with a "very good" identification probability index on the VITEK II instrument (BioMerieux). Biopsy of the L1 lumbar abscess conducted on 29 Mar 2013 and drainage of a prostatic abscess on 5 Apr 2013 both yielded positive cultures, identified this time as _Burkholderia cepacia_ or _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ with equal probability by VITEK II. All isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones. The strain was sent to the _Burkholderia cepacia_ complex National Reference Center (UZ Brussel), where it was 1st identified as _B. thailandensis_ by using the standard Biotyper reference library version 3.2.1.0 on a Microflex LT MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). However, as the score value hardly exceeded the accepted cut-off, a new analysis was performed using the so-called "security-relevant" (SR) reference library. A high score was then obtained for _B. pseudomallei_. This identification was supported by biochemical tests and definitely confirmed at the national reference laboratory for melioidosis at CODA-CERVA Brussels using a highly specific PCR assay (1).

Antimicrobial treatment was reformulated immediately after _B. pseudomallei_ infection was suspected and consisted this time of meropenem (1 gram IV 3 times a day) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg 2 pills 2 times daily) (2). The patient's condition and inflammatory syndrome significantly improved after the start of the new treatment.

Although less frequently reported as an at risk zone compared to South East Asia and northern Indonesia, Madagascar is another place where melioidosis is endemic. Climatologic conditions such as rainy seasons and the occurrence of tropical cyclones and storms, as observed in late 2012 and early 2013 in this region, are well-known factors increasing the risk of contamination. The bacterium typically enters the body through pre-existing cutaneous lesions, including minor trauma such as insect bites, and develops in the wound following contact with soil or water contaminated with _B. pseudomallei_. If not treated, the infection may become systemic and cause a febrile disease with various presentations ranging from acute septicemia to a chronic infection with multi-organ involvement that may be fatal. In the case of this patient, evidence of percutaneous transmission could not be established during our face-to-face interview, and the actual contamination route remains elusive.

The present report stresses the need to question the bacteriological identification results yielded by automatic analysis platforms connected to incomplete or un-adapted reference databases. Microbiologists should be aware of the risk of misidentification provided by such platforms when analysing uncommon pathogenic bacteria and/or bacteria highly similar to less dangerous relatives. As a result, caution should be taken by microbiology staff working unwittingly with such isolates in routine biosafety containment (level 1 or 2) to avoid laboratory contamination. In particular, laboratory personnel should avoid opening or smelling culture plates (_B. pseudomallei_ is reported to have an "earthy odor" in traditional bacteriology manuals) and should never centrifuge liquid bacterial cultures or suspensions using non leak-proof rotors. Complementary testing, preferentially based on DNA, should always be conducted on bacteria identified as _B. cepacia_ by automated systems and isolated from patients with atypical clinical presentations (non cystic fibrosis patients) and/or returning from an area of the world where melioidosis is endemic.

A similar case of _B. pseudomallei_ misidentified by an automated microbiology system occurred 5 years ago in a Swiss hospital (3). As recently underlined (4), bacterial species of the SRMALDI-TOF MS library should be included in the standard database for optimal patient care, laboratory safety, and rapid recognition of public health hazards.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Rossi and her colleagues for this firsthand report of melioidosis in Belgium acquired on the island of Madagascar and highlighting difficulties of identification of the pathogen.

With the increase in international travel and ecotourism, melioidosis is likely to become commoner among travelers to melioidosis-endemic regions. This report serves as a reminder to clinicians who treat patients returning from disease-endemic tropical areas to consider melioidosis in the differential diagnosis in febrile illnesses and isolated skin ulcers without any systemic involvement.

The following has been extracted from moderator LL's comments in ProMED-mail post Melioidosis - Australia (04): (NT) cases increase 20120814.1243818:

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ exists as an environmental saprophyte living in soil and surface water in endemic areas (Southeast Asia and northern, tropical Australia), particularly in rice paddies. In endemic countries, the organism exists primarily in focal areas and is not equally distributed throughout the landscape. Sporadic cases have been reported to have been acquired in parts of Africa and the Americas. The organism may exist in a viable, non-cultivable state in the environment, interacting with other organisms, particularly protozoa, which might explain its adaptation to an intracellular niche. Two outbreaks in Australia have also implicated potable water supplies rather than surface water as a potential source of the infection.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in the endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor co-morbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 per cent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 per cent.

_B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), anti-pseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides, but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatments have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. - Mod.LL
