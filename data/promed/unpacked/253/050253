The 1st tests from a north German farm suspected of being the source
of an _E. coli_ [O104:H4] outbreak are negative, officials say. Of 40
samples from the farm being examined, they said 23 tested negative
[and the others? Mod.LM].

Officials had said earlier that bean sprouts produced at the farm in
Uelzen, south of Hamburg, were the most likely cause of the outbreak.
The outbreak, which began 3 weeks ago and is concentrated in Hamburg,
has left 22 people dead. Initially, German officials had pointed to
Spanish cucumbers as the probable cause of the illness.

The farm in Uelzen is about 100 km (62 mi) south of Hamburg and
supplies restaurants and markets in the city and neighboring German
states.

[Negative tests at this point certainly do not exclude previous
shipments of sprouts as the vehicle for this large outbreak. It is
possible that most if not all of contaminated vehicle may have been
eaten or passed the time when it would be eaten and newer lots might
not have been exposed to the contamination source.

It may be the case that science may not produce a "smoking" sprout
here (where the outbreak strain is isolated from the suspected
vehicle) and we would be left with epidemiological data alone. More
tests are being performed and cultures of sprouts already in
restaurants may also be useful.

In this moderator's mind, negative tests at this point do not
eliminate a source. - Mod.LL]
