Cowpox: Sporadic human cases in Germany
-----------------------------------------------
Cowpox has been enzootic in cattle for a long time [1]. Over the past
years, however, no cowpox virus infections of cattle were diagnosed
in Germany. Instead, cowpox viruses are increasingly found in cats,
which can develop lesions and secrete large amounts of virus. Cats
infected with cowpox virus usually develop clinical illness, but
latent infections exist as well. As infected rodents are the
reservoir for cowpox viruses [2], the cats probably become infected
when hunting and eating mice and rats.
The virus is usually transmitted to humans through direct contact
with infected cats [3]. In 2002, a girl in the Netherlands was
reported to have contracted cowpox directly from an infected rat [4].
Another case was reported in 2003 from Finland, where the infection
was probably transmitted by a dog [5]. Human-to-human transmission
has not been described but cannot be excluded. Patients present with
a local exanthema on arms and legs or on the face, often in the area
of the eyes, probably acquired as smear infections, and most cases
have a pronounced lymphadenopathy. In addition, infected people often
display influenza-like symptoms, headache, nausea and myalgia after
an incubation period of between 7 and 12 days. Immunosuppressed
patients can develop lethal systemic disease that resembles a variola
infection [6].
While orthopoxviruses in general can be detected by either electron
microscopy or serology, a rapid differentiation between different
orthopoxviruses is best possible by DNA sequencing. Other existing
assays are based on RFLP analysis of PCR amplicons of various
poxvirus genes [7-9], but are less informative and less rapid
compared to sequencing.
No approved antiviral therapy against poxviruses currently exists.
People that come into contact with animals that could be infected,
especially cats with slow-healing skin lesions, are therefore advised
to protect themselves. Hygienic procedures need to be followed (such
as wearing gloves) when treating cowpox patients. Infected people are
treated locally with antibiotics in order to prevent bacterial
superinfection. Cidofovir, a nucleotide analogue, licensed for the
treatment of CMV-associated retinitis in HIV patients, showed
antiviral activity against vaccinia virus experimentally [10] and has
been considered for the therapy of vaccinia virus related
complications. However, the strong side effects of this drug restrict
it to only the most severe infections, and new therapeutic agents
like the small compound ST-246 are promising candidates for the future [11].
As shown by 2 recent examples, human cowpox cases usually display a
similar history. A 22-year-old animal caretaker presented with an
erythema below the eye. Two weeks earlier, she had been looking after
a cat that died of "catpox," as diagnosed by the veterinarian.
Orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies were detected in the patient's
serum, and different real-time PCR protocols [12, and unpublished
assays] allowed the clear identification of cowpox viruses in
material obtained from the erythema.
Similarly, a 25-year-old cat-owner was admitted to hospital with
suspected endocarditis and a pronounced lymphadenitis. Three weeks
earlier, her 3 cats had, according to the veterinarian, died of
"catpox." A vesicle on the patient's shoulder where she had
frequently carried the cats was surgically removed, and a swab
containing wound liquid as well as serum were sent to the consultant
laboratory for poxviruses at the Robert Koch institute in Berlin to
investigate the specimens for poxviruses. The serum was positive for
orthopox virus-specific antibodies. Using different real-time PCR
protocols [12, and unpublished assays], cowpox virus could be
identified in the wound liquid within 90 minutes of arrival of the
samples. In addition, cowpox virus was confirmed by sequencing of the
hemagglutinin gene. In parallel with the PCR, wound liquid was also
examined by electron microscopy, which allowed morphological
identification of the infectious agent as orthopox virus.
Before the global eradication of smallpox (announced by the World
Health Organization in 1979), live vaccinia virus was commonly used
as a vaccine against variola virus. Vaccinia virus is closely related
to variola virus and other members of the orthopoxviruses and induces
cross-immunity [13]. In the course of the eradication of variola
virus, vaccinations of children were stopped in Germany in the 1970s
due to severe vaccination-related complications. Thus, there is a
widening immunization gap in a population that was previously
protected by this vaccine not only against smallpox, but also which
had a not precisely defined protection against other forms of
orthopoxviruses, e.g. cowpox and monkeypox. Over the last 2 years, 9
patients suspected of suffering from poxvirus infection were examined
at the German consultant laboratory for poxviruses. Four of the
patients, including the 2 cases described above, were positive for
cowpox virus. The remaining 5 had infections with parapoxvirus,
molluscum contagiosum virus, or herpes simplex virus, or turned out
to suffer from mycosis. This represents an increase in diagnosed
human cowpox infections in Germany during the past years. Whilst it
cannot be excluded that this is due to a reporting bias, this
increase may reflect the fact that a smaller proportion of people
have immunity against cowpox virus after the stop of smallpox
vaccinations. Interestingly, recent human cowpox cases were observed
in people too young to be vaccinated against smallpox.

Epidemiologisches Bulletin [14].

[The species _Cowpox virus_ is a member of the genus _Orthopoxvirus_
of the sub-family _Chordopoxvirinae_ of the family _Poxviridae_. The
species name cowpox virus is a misnomer since it is not naturally
present in bovines but occurs predominantly in rodents. Cowpox virus
in fact has a broad host range and has been isolated from felines,
dogs, elephants and humans as well as bovines. Genome sequence
analysis has suggested that cowpox virus is closest to a hypothetical
ancestral poxvirus from which other orthopoxviruses have evolved. The
preceding report makes the interesting observation that the
appearance of cowpox virus in human hosts may increase with overall
resistance to orthopoxvirus infection as a consequence of the
cessation of smallpox (vaccinia) vaccination. - Mod.CP]
