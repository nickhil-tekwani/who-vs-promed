Tests have confirmed West Nile virus in an organ donor and 3 people who
received transplants from her, federal experts said on Tuesday. The donor
received transfusions, raising concerns that the mosquitoborne virus may be
transmitted through the blood supply. The virus may also have dwelled in
the transplanted organs. Even so, health officials can't rule out the
possibility that all 4 people, from Georgia and Florida, were infected by
mosquitoes.
One of the 4, a Georgia man who received a kidney, has died. A Florida
woman -- the fourth organ recipient -- also developed symptoms of West Nile
[virus infection], but lab confirmation is not yet available. She is at
home recuperating.
"If this resulted from organ transplantation, as it appears to have, the
organ donor was the source," said James Hughes of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). "But these patients all lived in areas where
mosquitoborne transmission of West Nile virus is occurring. It's important
that we not jump to conclusions," said Hughes, director of CDC's National
Center for Infectious Diseases.
The donor died 1 Aug 2002 after a car crash. Before her death, she received
multiple blood transfusions as doctors worked to save her life. CDC
officials say that blood was drawn -- and in some instances pooled -- from
more than 60 donors, any of whom might have been infected with West Nile
[assuming they were from states where there is active WNV transmission,
which are the majority now. - Mod.JW].
Before the cases surfaced, and the Food and Drug Administration recalled
all blood taken from those donors, more than a dozen other people were
given potentially tainted blood. Health officials are attempting to test
all remaining samples of that blood for the virus. They are also trying to
test the blood donors to see whether any of those people show evidence of
infection, said Julie Gerberding, director of CDC.
Though blood is tested for viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, "the tests
for West Nile that would work in a blood center do not exist," said Louis
Katz, acting vice president of America's Blood Centers, which collects
about half the nation's blood supply. It would take months, maybe years, to
develop such a test, he said. Katz said that the blood supply is safe, and
that the blood banks and the government will take whatever steps are needed
to keep it that way. "Fortunately, with West Nile virus, which tends to go
away in September, we're going to have the fall and winter to make
decisions," he said.
All blood banks are required by the FDA to take donors' temperatures before
they take their blood, and anyone with symptoms of illness is asked to come
back when they've recovered, Katz said. But about 80 per cent of people
infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms and could give blood while
the virus is circulating. "We can ask if they've been exposed to
mosquitoes," which carry the virus, he said, but "everybody's been exposed
to mosquitoes."

[Note that this although this is a confirmed infection, is still only a
"probable" case of transplant transmission, but the probability is quite
high -- it would be an extraordinary coincidence if so many organ
recipients just happened to be incubating WNV at the time of surgery. If
there are virus isolations from all the cases, sequencing will show if they
are indistinguishable. Note also that it has not yet been determined if the
organ donor was infected through blood transfusion. - Mod.JW]
