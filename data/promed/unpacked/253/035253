To date, 2 people have died in a legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York; 31 cases of the flu-like disease have been reported since mid-July [2015] in the South Bronx, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said.

Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source, such as cooling towers, air conditioning, or showers. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, and a cough. Most people recover, but between 5 to 30 percent of those who get the disease die, according to the US Centers for Disease Control [CDC].

"We are conducting a swift investigation to determine the source of the outbreak and prevent future cases. I urge anyone with symptoms to seek medical attention right away," said Dr Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York City health department.

The health department's probe includes testing water from potential sources in the area. "The New York City water supply does not pose a risk, so people should continue to feel confident in drinking tap water to stay cool during this period of hot weather," said Bassett.

At a City Hall press conference Thursday afternoon [30 Jul 2015], Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that anyone with symptoms should get tested, but he said that most New Yorkers are not at risk. "We will continue to be vigilant on all fronts, ensuring the health and safety of New Yorkers by both addressing Legionnaires' at its source, and ensuring affected New Yorkers who need it are getting proper treatment," he said.

An estimated 8000 to 18 000 hospitalized cases of legionnaires' disease occurs each year in the United States. An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name.

New York City health officials say the number of legionnaires' disease cases in the Bronx has risen to 46.

So far, 2 rooftop cooling systems have tested positive [presumably for the bacterium _Legionella_], at Concourse Plaza, a complex that contains a movie theater, and the outside cooling tower at Lincoln Hospital. There is no clustering in either of the identified locations, the city says. It is considered a dispersed outbreak.

The total of cases is up from the 31 reported [Wed 29 Jul 2015] over the past 3 weeks. 2 people have died from the disease, a man and woman in their 50's.

The cases have been centered in 4 neighborhoods in the South Bronx: High Bridge, Morrisania, Hunts Point, and Mott Haven. [The video at the source URL includes a map of the Bronx showing the locations of these neighborhoods.]

The New York City Health Department is working to track down the source of the outbreak, which has been called "unusual." Legionnaires' disease is caused by the bacteria _Legionella_. "In terms of Lincoln Hospital, it does not come through the water," said Mayor Bill de Blasio. "It can only come through the air that is dispersed out of the cooling towers, the mist that is dispersed out of them. So we know we have a localized problem."

"No employees, no patients in the hospital have acquired legionnaires' there," said city Health Commissioner Mary Bassett. "They have acquired it in the neighborhood and we don't fully understand how."

Health officials are testing water from cooling towers and other potential sources in the area to determine the source of the outbreak. The city has identified 20 cooling towers in the Bronx that need to be tested.

New Yorkers with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, chills and muscle aches, are advised to promptly seek medical attention.

About 2200 legionnaires' illnesses have been reported nationwide since [1 Jan 2015], including more than 100 in New York City.

This is the full list of neighborhoods in the South Bronx with reported cases: Hunts Point, Longwood, Morrisania, Crotona Park, Claremont Village, Concourse Village, Woodstock, Highbridge, Concourse, and Mount Eden.

Symptoms usually appear 2 to 10 days after significant exposure to _Legionella_ bacteria. Most cases of legionnaires' disease can be traced to plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for _Legionella_ growth, such as whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, cooling towers, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.

Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person. Groups at high risk for legionnaires' disease include people who are middle-aged or older -- especially cigarette smokers -- people with chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems and people who take medicines that weaken their immune systems (immunosuppressive drugs). Those with symptoms should call their doctor and ask about testing for legionnaire's disease.

[The news reports above describe an expanding outbreak of legionnaires' disease that is occurring is several neighborhoods of the South Bronx. The Bronx is the northernmost of the 5 boroughs of New York City, in the US state of New York. The Bronx is the 3rd most densely populated county in the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx). A map of the Bronx showing the location of the South Bronx can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx#/media/File:Southbronx.png. A map of the South Bronx that shows the location of some of these neighborhoods can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Bronx,+Bronx,+NY+10455/. Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center is a 347-bed, full service medical center and teaching hospital located in the South Bronx (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Hospital_(Bronx)). Concourse Plaza is a shopping center, near Yankee Stadium, located on E 161 Street and the Grand Concourse, a major north-south boulevard.

For discussions of legionnaires' disease, please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of a single genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping. - Mod.ML
