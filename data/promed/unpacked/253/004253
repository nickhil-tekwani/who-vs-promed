Deadly virus discovered in flying foxes
---------------------------------------
Worried residents are calling for a cull of flying foxes to help stop
the spread of a deadly disease across Victoria. The highly contagious
[Australian bat] lyssavirus was discovered in a fruit bat colony in
Yarra Bend, Kew East. Detected in a flying fox, the disease can be
fatal for humans. Residents who live near them are being urged to
avoid any contact.

Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester issued this warning today [13
Jul 2011]: "Under no circumstance should people handle flying foxes on
their property as some diseases they carry, such as Australian bat
lyssavirus, are transmissible to humans." The virus is similar to
rabies. Those infected can suffer symptoms, including paralysis, high
fever, and severe confusion.

Some residents living nearby say culling the multiplying bat
population could help to halt the spread of the disease. One resident
told 7 News: "I don't have any feelings for the bats -- they are a
menace, destructive, and smelly. They should have controlled them with
some sort of culling a long time ago. If they have got a disease
that's fatal to humans then perhaps this is the time to control them."
Another resident added: "We're concerned about any infectious disease
they can bring, particularly as they are in such great numbers. We'd
like to see smaller numbers."

There have been 2 deaths caused by [this] lyssavirus in Australia
over the past 15 years. The threat to humans is via direct contact
either bites or scratches. It is estimated there are 50 000 flying
foxes state-wide, and some 16 000 at Yarra Bend. The concentration of
the flying fox population increased at the park after they were
controversially relocated from the Botanic Gardens.

Since 1996, a total of 10 Victorian flying foxes have been found
carrying the virus, but no human cases have ever occurred in the
state. Anyone who encounters a sick or injured flying fox should call
the DSE [Department of Sustainability and Environment] customer
service centre on 136 186. If someone is bitten or scratched by a
flying fox, they are advised to wash the area with soap and water and
seek medical help.

[The increased number of bats at Yarra Bend in the state of Victoria
is causing alarum, but so far there has been no transmission of
infection to humans or other species. General information on
Australian bat lyssavirus and the risk of infection can be found at
the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) website
http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-pubs-other-bat_lyssa.htm.

Since its discovery in a juvenile black flying fox (_Pteropus
alecto_) in 1996, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) has become the
cause of a potentially important emerging disease for health
authorities in Australia, with 2 human deaths (one in 1996 and one in
1998) attributed to the virus in the north eastern state of
Queensland. In Australia, the virus has been isolated from all 4
species of flying fox found on the mainland (that is _P. alecto_, _P.
scapulatus_, _P. poliocephalus_, and _P. conspicillatus_) as well as a
single species of insectivorous bat (_Saccolaimus flaviventris_).
Australian bat lyssavirus belongs to the genus _Lyssavirus_ [family
_Rhabdoviridae_] and is closely related, genetically, to the type
species of the genus _rabies virus_ (RABV).

Clinically, patients infected with ABLV have displayed the
'classical' symptoms of rabies and a similar disease course. This
similarity has led to the belief that the infection and dissemination
of ABLV in the body follows the same pathways as those followed by
RABV. Following the 2 ABLV-related deaths in Queensland, protocols
based on the World Health Organization's guidelines for RABV
prophylaxis were implemented and, presumably in consequence, no human
infection with ABLV has been recorded since 1998. ABLV will, however,
probably always have an important part to play in the health of
Australians as the density of the human population in Australia and,
consequently, the level of interaction between humans and flying foxes
increase (see: Moore PR, Jansen CC, Graham GC, Smith IL, Craig SB:
Emerging tropical diseases in Australia. Part 3. Australian bat
lyssavirus. Ann Trop Med Parasitol. 2010; 104(8): 613-21; abstract
available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144181).

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), which occurs in pteropid and
insectivorous bat populations, causes a rabies-like encephalitis in
infected humans. A complete genome sequence of an ABLV isolate has
been obtained from a human who developed symptoms 27 months after
being bitten by an infected flying fox. This is the smallest
lyssavirus genome to be sequenced, with a size of 11 918 nucleotides.
Analyses of previously unsequenced regions and the complete genome
confirm its close relationship with classical rabies viruses. A
comparison of the genomes of pteropid and insectivorous isolates of
ABLV indicates considerable differences between the 2 viruses. If the
divergence of the 2 viruses occurred on the Australian mainland, ABLV
may have been endemic to Australia well before European colonisation
(see: Warrilow D, Smith IL, Harrower B, Smith GA: Sequence analysis of
an isolate from a fatal human infection of Australian bat lyssavirus.
Virology. 2002; 297(1): 109-19; abstract available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12083841).

Yarra Bend is Victoria's newest national park, formed by the recent
amalgamation of several state forests and water catchments of the
Upper Yarra Valley. It is close to the city of Melbourne. The
