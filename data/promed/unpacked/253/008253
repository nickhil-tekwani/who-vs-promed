Summary
-------
Once SARS-CoV-2 is introduced in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF), rapid transmission can occur.

Following identification of a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a healthcare worker, 76 of 82 residents of an SNF were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 23 (30%) had positive test results, about half of whom were asymptomatic or presymptomatic on the day of testing.

Symptom-based screening of SNF residents might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic SNF residents might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Once a facility has confirmed a COVID-19 case, all residents should be cared for using CDC-recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), with considerations for extended use or reuse of PPE as needed.

[2] Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among patients with influenza-like illnesses presenting to a Los Angeles medical center

Until recently, diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was only available through public health laboratories. This limited testing was prioritized for persons who had severe illness or identifiable risk factors, such as travel to an area with ongoing transmission. Thus, the incidence of community transmission by persons with mild illness and without risk factors remains ill-defined.

The current public health strategy of case containment is premised on the assumption of no or limited community transmission. Identifying a high rate of community transmission would indicate a need to shift the public health strategy from containment to mitigation of spread. Thus, determining the rate at which mild disease is spreading in the community, particularly among persons without risk factors for acquisition of the virus, is critically important. We conducted a rapid sentinel surveillance study to determine what proportion of mild, outpatient influenza-like illnesses were caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
-------
Between 12-13 Mar and 15-16 Mar 2020, the Los Angeles County plus University of Southern California Medical Center conducted testing among patients presenting with mild influenza-like illness to the emergency department or urgent care. Patients who had nasopharyngeal swabs tested with polymerase chain reaction assays for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (GeneXpert Flu, Cepheid) were automatically tested for SARS-CoV-2 (Quest Diagnostics).

Only the influenza tests conducted during the day shift were automatically tested for SARS-CoV-2 because the process was manual. Patients were excluded if they had specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 (for example, travel exposure or known contact with a traveler, severely ill patients admitted for respiratory tract infections). Positive test results were followed up by Department of Public Health experts to assess clinical factors and demographics.

The number of influenza tests ordered by physicians at the Los Angeles County plus University of Southern California Medical Center between 2 Mar and 18 Mar 2020 and the proportion testing positive for influenza were also assessed. In addition, the rate of influenza-like illnesses obtained from weekly surveys of emergency departments over the past 5 years were summarized, as well as the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza from ongoing public health sentinel surveillance conducted at 7 clinical laboratories across Los Angeles County, California.

Results
-------
A total of 131 tests for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained and 7 were positive (5.3%). The median age of patients who tested positive was 38 years (range, 34-44 years), 3 were male (43%), and the median duration of symptoms was 4 days (range, 2-4 days) at presentation. Six of 7 patients presented with fever, 5 with myalgias, and only 1 with cough. Only 1 patient had a travel history (returned from Miami, FL). All patients had mild illnesses, and all tested negative for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.

At the Los Angeles County plus University of Southern California Medical Center, the number of influenza tests ordered by physicians was relatively stable, but the percentage of positive test results for influenza declined around the time of the study. Across the county, sentinel testing revealed a 3rd seasonal spike in influenza-like illnesses during the weeks before the study; no 3rd seasonal spike was seen during the prior 4 years, and the 3rd spike occurred later than any spike during those years. This late, 3rd seasonal influenza-like illness spike occurred even as the percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive for influenza steadily declined.

Discussion
----------
The 5% rate of SARS-CoV-2 among patients with mild influenza-like illness without risk factors is concerning. These patients had sufficiently mild illness to be active in the community throughout their illness, increasing the possibility of transmission. Such transmission is consistent with the unusual, 3rd countywide influenza-like illness spike that occurred late in the season and with declining rates of influenza positivity. Nevertheless, the results suggested that containment efforts were unlikely to succeed and helped inform the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to adopt a more aggressive mitigation strategy to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Similar efforts may be needed in other jurisdictions.

[3] Mapping body's COVID-19 immune response
Date: Tue 17 Mar 2020

Researchers in Australia said on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] that they had mapped the body's immune response to the novel coronavirus, in a potential breakthrough in the fight against the global killer.

A team of scientists were able to test blood samples from a patient who had contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalised with moderate symptoms. Authors of the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine [see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0819-2. - Mod.SH], said it was the first time experts had mapped the body's general immune response to the new disease. "We saw a really robust immune response that preceded clinical recovery," Katherine Kedzierska, from the University of Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, told AFP. "We noted an immune response, but she was visually still unwell, and 3 days later the patient recovered." Researchers are in a race against time to try to find a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, which as of 09:00 GMT Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] has registered more than 180 000 confirmed infections and over 7000 deaths.

Kedzierska said her team's research was "an important step in understanding recovery from COVID-19. First, it will help virologists develop a vaccine because the goal in vaccination is to replicate the body's natural immune response to viruses. The team identified 4 distinct immune-cell populations in the COVID-19 patient's blood as she underwent recovery. Researchers were able to dissect the immune response leading to successful recovery from COVID-19, which might be the secret to finding an effective vaccine.

The 2nd practical application is screening, said Kedzierska. Their observations could also help health authorities make better predictions in future disease outbreaks about who is most at risk. These immune system "markers" could in theory predict with greater accuracy which patients are likely to have mild symptoms and which are at risk of dying. The majority of COVID-19 deaths occur in patients who are elderly or have existing medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.

Children, on the other hand, appear to show few or no symptoms. Kedzierska said more research was needed to work out why, but the immune system does naturally slow down as people age. "Hopefully now we can fish out those antibodies and grow them up to scale," she said.

[4] Baricitinib for COVID-19 treatment
Date: Fri 3 Apr 2020

As rheumatologists used to treating rheumatoid arthritis with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and working in an area (Lombardy, Italy) with a high incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we read with great interest the Comment in The Lancet Infectious Diseases by Justin Stebbing and colleagues about the potential use of baricitinib for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The described mechanism affecting viral endocytosis mediated by 2 members of the numb-associated kinase family is one of the many unfamiliar effects of a relatively recent drug class, the real safety profile of which still remains to be definitively clarified. Undoubtedly, the fact that baricitinib can provide this antiviral effect at the approved dose for rheumatoid arthritis therapy is an undeniable advantage over other potential inhibitors of the same pathway.

However, some concern could arise from the best-known aspects of the mechanism of action of the drug and its safety profile. Interferon is one of the most powerful innate immune responses to prevent viral replication during the early phases of infection. Transcription through the JAK-STAT signalling pathway (mainly mediated by JAK1 and JAK2), activated by interferons, leads to the upregulation of many interferon-controlled genes that quickly kill viruses in infected cells. The importance of this defense mechanism is confirmed by the fact that most viruses have developed strategies to counteract the effects of interferons by blocking their signalling pathway, and viral-encoded factors that antagonise the JAK-STAT pathway are crucial determinants of virulence.

As a consequence, JAK-STAT signal blocking by baricitinib (a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor) produces an impairment of interferon-mediated antiviral response, with a potential facilitating effect on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This mechanism is thought to be involved in an increased risk of herpes zoster and simplex infection, which was reported in the development programme of baricitinib 4 mg compared with placebo (herpes zoster 4.2 per 100 person-years vs 1.0 per 100 person-years [p less than 0.5]; herpes simplex 5.4 per 100 person-years vs 2.2 per 100 person-years [p less than 0.5]). Notably, this complication also seems to be shared by the new JAK1 selective inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib. Viral infections (including herpes zoster and herpes simplex) in intensive care units can account for up to 10% of community-acquired and up to 5% of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the incidence of which might be expected to be higher in immunocompromised patients given JAK inhibitors.

In conclusion, we believe that, beyond the intriguing opportunity to directly block the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, the use of baricitinib in susceptible patients with ongoing pneumonia associated with COVID-19 should be considered with extreme caution.

[5] Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019
Date: Wed 1 Apr 2020

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory tract infection that emerged in late 2019. Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe and 6.1% with critical courses. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligo-symptomatic transmission. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of 9 cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the 1st week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 times 10exp8 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all) but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness. Active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract puts the prospects of COVID-19 containment in perspective.

[6] Barrier enclosure during endotracheal intubation

Clinicians with inadequate access to standard personal protective equipment (PPE) have been compelled to improvise protective barrier enclosures for use during endotracheal intubation. We describe one such barrier that is easily fabricated and may help protect clinicians during this procedure. The barrier studied was an "aerosol box," which consists of a transparent plastic cube designed to cover a patient's head and that incorporates 2 circular ports through which the clinician's hands are passed to perform the airway procedure. The dimensions of the box are provided in the Supplementary Appendix (https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMc2007589/suppl_file/nejmc2007589_appendix.pdf), available with the full text of this letter at <NEJM.org>.

In our simulation (see video; link provided at source URL), a laryngoscopist, attired in standard PPE, took position at the head of an airway mannequin. To approximate a forceful cough and generate a spread of droplets and aerosols, a small latex balloon containing 10 mL of fluorescent dye was placed in the hypopharynx of the mannequin. The balloon was inflated with compressed oxygen that was run through tubing inside the mannequin until the balloon burst; the explosion of the balloon represented a crude simulation of a cough. We repeated the experiment without and with the aerosol box, and after each simulation, we illuminated the scene with ultraviolet light to visualize the spreading of the dye.

With the use of PPE only, dye was found on the laryngoscopist's gown, gloves, face mask, eye shield, hair, neck, ears, and shoes. Contamination of the floor occurred within approximately 1 meter from the head of the bed and also on a monitor located more than 2 meters away. When we repeated the experiment with the aerosol box, the simulated cough resulted in contamination of only the inner surface of the box and the laryngoscopist's gloves and gowned forearms. Examination of the laryngoscopist and the room with ultraviolet light showed no macroscopic contamination outside the box.

Our simulation method, although pragmatic, was not validated for the projectile direction, speed, or turbulence of a true cough, nor did it match the particle-size distribution. Droplets were overproduced as compared with aerosols. Our method of detection could not identify very small quantities of material that could be infectious. Nevertheless, we suggest that our ad hoc barrier enclosure provided a modicum of additional protection and could be considered to be an adjunct to standard PPE. A caveat: We found that the box restricted hand movement and would require training before use in the treatment of patients. Operators should be ready to abandon use of the box should airway management prove difficult.

[7] Flattening the curve for incarcerated populations -- COVID-19 in jails and prisons
Date: Thu 2 Apr 2020
Source: The New England Journal of Medicine [abridged, edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005687?query=featured_home


Because of policies of mass incarceration over the past 4 decades, the USA has incarcerated more people than any other country on Earth. As of the end of 2016, there were nearly 2.2 million people in US prisons and jails. People entering jails are among the most vulnerable in our society, and during incarceration, that vulnerability is exacerbated by restricted movement, confined spaces, and limited medical care. People caught up in the US justice system have already been affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and improved preparation is essential to minimizing the impact of this pandemic on incarcerated persons, correctional staff, and surrounding communities.

"Social distancing" is a strategy for reducing transmission and "flattening the curve" of cases entering the healthcare system. Although correctional facilities face risks similar to those of community health care systems, social distancing is extremely challenging in these settings. Furthermore, half of all incarcerated persons have at least one chronic disease, and according to the US Department of Justice, 81 600 are over the age of 60, factors that increase the risk of poor outcomes of infection. With limited ability to protect themselves and others by self-isolating, hundreds of thousands of susceptible people are at heightened risk for severe illness.

To date, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and certain states and municipalities have opted to suspend visitation by community members, limit visits by legal representatives, and reduce facility transfers for incarcerated persons. To reduce social isolation and maintain a degree of connectedness for incarcerated people, some correctional systems are providing teleconferencing services for personal and legal visits. Irrespective of these interventions, infected persons -- including staff members -- will continue to enter correctional settings. By 14 Mar 2020, some US correctional staff members had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the 1st COVID-19 diagnosis in a detained person was announced on 16 Mar 2020. A recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among cruise-ship passengers and crew in Yokohama, Japan, provides a warning about what could soon happen in correctional settings.

To operationalize a response for incarcerated populations, 3 levels of preparedness need to be addressed: The virus should be delayed as much as possible from entering correctional settings; if it is already in circulation, it should be controlled; and jails and prisons should prepare to deal with a high burden of disease. The better the mitigation job done by legal, public health, and correctional health partnerships, the lighter the burden correctional facilities and their surrounding communities will bear. We have learned from other epidemics, such as the 1918 influenza pandemic, that nonpharmaceutical interventions are effective, but they have the greatest impact when implemented early.

Therefore, we believe that we need to prepare now, by "decarcerating", or releasing, as many people as possible, focusing on those who are least likely to commit additional crimes, but also on the elderly and infirm; urging police and courts to immediately suspend arresting and sentencing people, as much as possible, for low-level crimes and misdemeanors; isolating and separating incarcerated persons who are infected and those who are under investigation for possible infection from the general prison population; hospitalizing those who are seriously ill; and identifying correctional staff and healthcare providers who became infected early and have recovered, who can help with custodial and care efforts once they have been cleared, as they may have some degree of immunity and severe staff shortages are likely.

All these interventions will help to flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases among incarcerated populations and limit the impact of transmission both inside correctional facilities and in the community after incarcerated people are released. Such measures will also reduce the burden on the correctional system in terms of stabilizing and transferring critically ill patients.

Beyond federal, state, and local action, we need to consider the impact of correctional facilities in the global context. The boundaries between communities and correctional institutions are porous, as are the borders between countries in the age of mass human travel. Despite security at nearly every nation's border, COVID-19 has appeared in practically all countries. We can't expect to find sturdier barriers between correctional institutions and their surrounding communities in any affected country.

[8] How sewage could reveal true scale of coronavirus outbreak
Date: Fri 3 Apr 2020
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00973-x


More than a dozen research groups worldwide have started analysing wastewater for the new coronavirus as a way to estimate the total number of infections in a community, given that most people will not be tested. The method could also be used to detect the coronavirus if it returns to communities, say scientists. So far, researchers have found traces of the virus in the Netherlands, the USA and Sweden.

Analysing wastewater -- used water that goes through the drainage system to a treatment facility -- is one way that researchers can track infectious diseases that are excreted in urine or faeces, such as SARS-CoV-2.

One treatment plant can capture wastewater from more than one million people, says Gertjan Medema, a microbiologist at KWR Water Research Institute in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. Monitoring effluent at this scale could provide better estimates for how widespread the coronavirus is than testing because wastewater surveillance can account for those who have not been tested and have only mild or no symptoms, says Medema, who has detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material -- viral RNA -- in several treatment plants in the Netherlands: "Health authorities are only seeing the tip of the iceberg."

But to quantify the scale of infection in a population from wastewater samples, researchers say the groups will need to find out how much viral RNA is excreted in faeces and extrapolate the number of infected people in a population from concentrations of viral RNA in wastewater samples. Researchers will also need to ensure that they are looking at a representative sample of what is being excreted by the population and not just one snapshot in time, and that their tests can detect the virus at low levels.

Infection-control measures, such as social distancing, will probably suppress the current pandemic, but the virus could return once such measures are lifted. Routine wastewater surveillance could be used as a non-invasive early-warning tool to alert communities to new COVID-19 infections, says Ana Maria de Roda Husman, an infectious-disease researcher at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven. The institute has previously monitored sewage to detect outbreaks of norovirus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, poliovirus and measles.

de Roda Husman's group detected traces of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at Schiphol Airport in Tilburg only 4 days after the Netherlands confirmed its 1st case of COVID-19 using clinical testing. The researchers now plan to expand sampling to the capitals of all 12 provinces in the Netherlands and 12 other sites that have not had any confirmed cases.

Studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 can appear in faeces within 3 days of infection, which is much sooner than the time taken for people to develop symptoms severe enough for them to seek hospital care -- up to 2 weeks -- and get an official diagnosis, says Tamar Kohn, an environmental virologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. Tracking viral particles in wastewater could give public-health officials a head start on deciding whether to introduce measures such as lockdowns.

[9] FDA green-lights clinical trial for COVID-19 coronavirus treatment that "flattens the curve" in patients
Date: Thu 2 Apr 2020 09:00 EDT
Source: Forbes [edited]
https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2020/04/02/fda-gives-green-light-to-test-a-treatment-against-covid-19-coronavirus-that-flattens-the-curve-in-patients/#2d04419f4b57


Therapeutics startup Celularity announced Thursday morning [2 Apr 2020] that it has received Food and Drug Administration clearance to begin a clinical trial of a proposed stem-cell treatment for COVID-19. The approval of the New Jersey-based company's IND application enables the company to begin a clinical trial with patients who have the disease.

The company's therapy, called CYNK-001 for now, uses natural killer (NK) cells, a form of white blood cells that wage war against cancer and viral infection, derived from placental stem cells. The company's been developing similar treatments for several years against cancer and Crohn's disease, several of which are being tested as well.

The idea behind the therapy is that for patients who are starting to show symptoms, or who may be at risk for a more severe form of the disease, can receive an intravenous infusion of NK cells to bolster their immune response to the virus, says founder and CEO Robert Hariri. That's because the additional NK cells help slow down the viruses' ability to replicate within the body. It's an approach he likens to social distancing -- slowing the spread of COVID-19 so hospitals don't get even more overwhelmed -- within patients themselves. "By administering our NK cells to patients, we are acting to 'flatten the viral titer curve,' so the patient's adaptive immune system can get in gear and do the job of clearing the virus," he says.

The primary thrust of the company's therapeutic efforts have been to employ these treatments against forms of cancer such as myelomas and leukemia. But because NK cells are often involved in protecting the body against viruses, Hariri says he's always looked to the company one day going after infectious disease. According to Hariri, it may take only a matter of days to see results from the 1st clinical trial of COVID-19 patients. That test will involve use of the treatment in a patient group of up to 86 people. If that's successful, Hariri hopes those results will mean accelerating to a larger trial, and then, if all goes well, out to market. "This is a very easy product to deploy," says Hariri. "We're hopeful that if we get compelling enough data, the agency and the CDC and the NIH will work with us to scale up production."

[10] Do chronic respiratory diseases or their treatment affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection?
Date: Thu 3 Apr 2020

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an acute respiratory disease that can lead to respiratory failure and death. Previous epidemics of novel coronavirus diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), were associated with similar clinical features and outcomes.

One might anticipate that patients with chronic respiratory diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, would be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more severe presentations of COVID-19. However, it is striking that both diseases appear to be under-represented in the comorbidities reported for patients with COVID-19, compared with the global burden of disease estimates of the prevalence of these conditions in the general population (see table at source URL); a similar pattern was seen with SARS. By contrast, the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 or SARS is as high as or higher than the estimated national prevalence, as might be expected.

The lower reported prevalence of asthma and COPD in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 might be due to one or a number of factors. First, it is possible that, in contrast to the diagnosis of diabetes, there was substantial underdiagnosis or poor recognition of chronic respiratory disease in patients with COVID-19, particularly in China. However, this seems unlikely, as in very recent data (23 Mar 2020) from Italy, among 355 patients dying with COVID-19.

A 2nd possibility is that having a chronic respiratory disease protects against COVID-19, perhaps through a different immune response elicited by the chronic disease itself. However, this theory is not supported by the finding that among those with COVID-19 who have COPD as a comorbidity, mortality is increased, as would otherwise be expected.

A 3rd possibility is that therapies used by patients with chronic respiratory diseases can reduce the risk of infection or of developing symptoms leading to diagnosis. It is important to note that, at most, only around half of patients with COPD in China take treatments that are standard in Europe and North America, but up to 75% of people in China with asthma use inhaled corticosteroids. Furthermore, in in vitro models, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators have been shown to suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production. Low-quality evidence also exists from a case series in Japan, in which improvement was seen in 3 patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen, but not ventilatory support, after being given inhaled ciclesonide; however, no control group was used, and it is not known whether these patients would have improved spontaneously. Yet, the possibility that inhaled corticosteroids might prevent (at least partly) the development of symptomatic infection or severe presentations of COVID-19 cannot be ignored. By contrast, a systematic review on the use of systemic corticosteroids to treat SARS, once established, showed no benefit but possible harm.

The potential benefits or harms of inhaled corticosteroids and other treatments for people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or patients with COVID-19 are unclear at present, and no changes to the treatment or management of chronic respiratory conditions, including COPD and asthma, should be considered at this stage. However, collecting accurate data for the comorbidities and previous therapy of patients with COVID-19 will be essential to understanding risk factors for becoming infected, developing symptoms, and being diagnosed, as well as enabling answers to questions about possible benefits or harms of therapy for asthma and COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. This could be achieved using a standard dataset as advocated by WHO, including information about the presence and severity of comorbidities and all medication that was being taken at the time of infection.

[11] Developing antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2
Date: Sat 4 Apr 2020

In response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have instigated rules that constrain personal freedoms and hamstring their own economies, placing approximately 3 billion people under lockdown. Some have rolled out widespread testing for current infections, while others limited these tests to people who were hospitalised, at least during the early stages of their responses. As new controls begin to bite, the race to develop and approve a test with a different purpose -- to assess not current viral infection but immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -- has heated up. Medical diagnostic companies are scrambling, and governments are looking to order these antibody tests by the millions.

The task now facing governments and national regulators is to balance urgency against the everyday sensitivity and specificity concerns that apply to any new medical diagnostic. A few technical questions still exist around optimising test design, primarily hinging on understanding how the viral coating triggers a healthy immune system's recognition and neutralisation of the virus. Yet, there is a palpable hurry to limit economic damage, to get people back to work, and to reopen borders -- and those whose immunity can be demonstrated should be able to return to work, without risk. Some regulators, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have already chosen to relax normal assessment criteria.

Demand could not be higher. "We really have been inundated with calls", says Dan Hanlon, director of international sales at CTK Biotech (San Diego, CA), which has developed an antibody test. "The inquiries are coming from ministries of health, from various government institutions, from military contractors, from industry distributors that commonly work in this realm." Under normal circumstances, CTK Biotech would have to collect data for FDA approval of a novel diagnostic at 3 different sites, but under the emergency use authorisation issued by the agency in mid-March [2020], this is no longer necessary. "Basically [the FDA authorisation] says, 'You can start selling right away and then send us your data, and if we don't like it, you have to take your product back'", says Sam Lewis, CTK Biotech's director of research and development. In Europe, a German company called Euroimmun has recently received certification that will allow their test to be sold within the EU. "Everybody is getting crazy at the moment with regard to antibody detection, especially for medical personnel, because it's very important to know if they already had the virus," says Konstanze Stiba, Euroimmun's antibody test product manager. Health worker shortages due to illness put further pressure on already strained health systems. If a test can show that a health worker has already had COVID-19, and is therefore probably immune, they can return to work without fear of infection. "That's something you can easily do with an antibody detection test and not with PCR -- you can keep the health system stable."

Antibody testing is multipurpose: It can verify that vaccines are working as intended during clinical trials, or be used in contact tracing weeks or longer after a suspected infection in an individual. Probably its most important current use, en masse, is to help inform public policy makers how many asymptomatic cases have occurred in a population. Antibodies reveal evidence of a previous infection any time from about a week after the infection occurred. "At the moment we are only estimating the number of people who have been infected. No one in the world has measured that properly yet," says Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK. "We think that children are infective but asymptomatic, for example, but we don't know enough about this -- and that information matters for decisions about whether to close schools."

PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been available since January [2020], soon after the virus was identified. However, the technology behind antibody tests is fundamentally distinct and generally harder to get right. "If you have a sequence today, you have a PCR tomorrow," says Linfa Wang, director of Duke-NUS Medical School's programme in emerging infectious diseases, in Singapore. "Whether the sensitivity [of PCR] will be enough is another thing, but usually in the 1st round, it will give you data that you can use. Serology is different."

Antibody tests are different because they require some knowledge of the proteins that form the viral coat -- specifically, those proteins to which the immune system responds, triggering the production of antibodies that flag or neutralise the virus. Those sections of the viral protein coat must then be produced in the laboratory, using cell lines, for inclusion in an immunoassay (e.g., ELISA) that detects whether antibodies are present. Such immunoassays will form the basis of home testing kits for people who think they have had COVID-19. But their development takes time. Expressing the protein in the right structure is often the most difficult step. In a non-native system, such as a bacterial cell, the complex protein structures can come out slightly deformed, enough to stop antibodies from recognising them as they would the original viral coat protein.

Others, such as Peng Zhou, who leads the bat virus infection and immunity group at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China and was part of the team that sequenced SARS-CoV-2's genetic code in January [2020], have used the nucleocapsid protein and the spike protein. Zhou's antibody test is one of at least 10 antibody tests that have already been deployed in hospitals across China. "[The] nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant viral protein, which means it's easy to detect. But we also chose spike protein because it's very specific," he says. "Actually, for coronavirus, the most divergent protein is [the] spike protein."

There is a lot hanging on the uniqueness of the spike protein. In terms of the specificity of serological tests in which it is used, the more unique it is, the lower the odds of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses -- false positives resulting from immunity to other coronaviruses. The most similar of these is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which led to the SARS outbreak of 2002. But another 4 coronaviruses cause the common cold, and ensuring there is no cross-reactivity to these is essential.

Virologists generally agree that media reports of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 are most likely due to erroneous PCR tests. Hibberd argues that once people produce antibodies against a particular coronavirus, they probably have immunity for life. Indeed, Wang's laboratory has investigated how long immunity against SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus lasts: "17 years later, a SARS survivor still has neutralising antibodies against SARS -- we found that not only were the antibodies there, but they could still neutralise the SARS virus."

This is reassuring news for governments that intend to deploy antibody tests to establish which health-care workers are immune, and to get their populaces back to work as soon as possible.

[It is important to understand that antibody tests can help in determining an individual's exposure to the COVID-19 virus; they are not the first diagnostic test to identify a case. It is important that the diagnostic algorithms for case screening should be technically evaluated and recommended based on the defined criteria for testing and time of sample collection from a suspected case. There are still many unanswered questions, and the guidelines will require repeated reviews as new information becomes available. - Mod.UBA]
