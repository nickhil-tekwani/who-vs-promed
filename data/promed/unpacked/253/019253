New bacterium affects fresh tomatoes and capsicums
--------------------------------------------------
MAF Biosecurity New Zealand (MAFBNZ) has today [4 Jun 2008] withdrawn
phytosanitary certification for New Zealand fresh tomato and capsicum
export produce until further notice, following the confirmation of a
new disease-causing bacterium in 3 commercial hothouse operations in
the North Island.

MAFBNZ Director of Border Standards, Tim Knox, says the withdrawal of
phytosanitary certification is a precautionary measure until more
information about the bacterium is available. Mr Knox says little is
known about if or how the bacterium may have entered New Zealand, or
its transmission, effect, and distribution -- "we have initiated a
programme of research to answer these questions. The results of this
research will help determine the feasibility of options for managing
the disease. Initial findings suggest that the bacterium may be
transmitted by a small insect called the tomato/potato psyllid --
there are no considered human health issues associated with the
bacterium or with eating [affected] tomatoes or capsicum."

Mr Knox says MAFBNZ is working closely with Horticulture New Zealand
and sector representatives from the fresh tomato and capsicum
industry to discuss the situation and consider possible response
options.

[The bacterium has been identified as a previously undescribed
species belonging to the genus _Candidatus_ Liberibacter (E. Yamoah,
MAF Biosecurity, personal communication). It affects both the growth
and quality of plants and reduces yield. Symptoms have been detected
in both leaves and fruit of tomato and capsicum and may vary across
varieties and growing conditions in glasshouse or field crops.
Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf curling and yellowing, stunting of
the plant, and leaf stalks may become very elongated. Fruit may be
distorted with a strawberry-like appearance and fruit development may
be uneven. However, infected fruits may also be asymptomatic and
therefore pose a risk for biosecurity. Symptoms in capsicums include
pale green or yellow leaves with spiky tips, leaf distortion,
shortening of leaf stalks, flower drop, and dieback of plant tops.

The discovery of this new pathogen is very significant since only a
few members of _Ca._ Liberibacter (a genus of fastidious
phloem-inhabiting bacteria) have been characterised so far. The genus
includes the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB) in
different parts of the world (_Ca._ L. asiaticus, africanus, and
americanus). HLB is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops
affecting leaves and fruits. For more information on HLB see links and
previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives below.

HLB is transmitted by citrus psyllid vectors and is restricted to
_Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its
specific vectors. The tomato (or potato) psyllid _Paratrioza
(Bactericera) cockerelli_ suspected to be a vector of the new
Liberibacter species has a rather wide host range including species in
20 plant families (with strong preference for solanaceous species),
and this can be expected to impact on the epidemiology of this new
disease.
