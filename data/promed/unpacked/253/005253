Eleven new cases of cholera have been confirmed during the first two weeks
of August, 1998. Ten cases were acquired locally, and one is thought to
have been imported after the patient visited Shekou [location?. The
outbreak brings this year's total to 36 imported and 28 locally acquired
cases.
This recent outbreak is thought to be related to improper hygiene in some
of Hong Kong's more than 9,000 restaurants, cooked food stores and other
premises. Thousands of these establishments will be inspected in the next
three weeks according to Deputy director of the Department of Health, Dr.
Paul Saw Thian-aun.
Food premises are divided into satisfactory, acceptable and poor for
hygiene conditions, with categorisations of A, B and C respectively. A
department consultant doctor, Mak Kwok-hang, said hygiene conditions in
four restaurants that some victims ate in were unfavourable. "Initial
inspection showed poor hygiene conditions at the restaurants - cockroaches
were found, cooked food was put on the floor and there was no soap in the
staff toilets," he said. The other victims caught the disease at home
where food was inadequately reheated and seafood inadequately cooked.
Dr. Saw said the latest outbreak appeared to be under control as no new
cases had been reported in the past three days. "However, we should remain
vigilant because the current hot and humid weather provides optimum
conditions for the growth of bacteria," he said. The World Health
Organisation told the department yesterday to strengthen its preparedness
against cholera in view of the extremely heavy rainfall and floods this
year.
