I will be publishing shortly some results of my vaccine
immunogenicity and efficacy study of equine EEE vaccines in the
emu. I can tell you that:
#1: EEE *is* directly transmissible between birds in the absence of
vectors, and viable virions are in the feces and saliva, so council
the farm to segregate ill from well birds and spray for mosquitos;
#2: vaccination *does* definitely protect against a lethal challenge
of EEE in the emu, with a sharp rise in titer within 7 days that
apparently reaches its highest values within 28 days post-
vaccination (work done at CDC).
As far as public health issues go: vaccination eliminates high-titer
viremias (reservoirs) and shedding in excretions and secretions
(direct exposure). Despite the fact that there are viable virions in
the bloody feces, no human cases have been known to be
associated with ill emus. In spite of this I would recommend gloves
[when handling them].

[Considering the very high viraemias in affected emus, great care
should be taken when necropsying any suspected case. The fact
that associated human cases have yet to be seen is no proof of
zero-risk. As we might expect, until proven otherwise, that maybe
EEE antibodies are not uncommon in rural southern Louisianians,
thereby providing them with a measure of protection, urban and
suburban folk not so protected would be at risk when visiting
emu flocks professionally or otherwise. There has been discussion
that _Culiseta_ midges, very common around the heads of emus,
might aid spread - MHJ]

We were wondering if horse owners living near ratite [ostrich or
emu] farms should be concerned. What with the current status of
the emu "market" there have been incidents of emus simply being
turned loose to fend for themselves. Are we creating a potential for
disaster here?

[Unvaccinated emus, like ostriches, make wonderful sentinels for
this infection as they are very susceptible and (were) expensive.
Thus if you have horses near a ratite farm, it is like having a civil
defence hooter go off when they start dying. But of course by then
your horses might have already been infected by the mosquitoes
that inoculated the emus. It is wiser to protect your horses by
regular vaccination than worry about your neighbours.
Feral emus are by definition unvaccinated and will be rapidly and
efficiently removed by EEE. Therefore they disappear from the
scene and from providing any risk. There are also coyotes. It is
unlikely that we will see permanant flocks of feral emus in this area
