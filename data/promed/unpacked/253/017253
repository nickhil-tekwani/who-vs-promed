Enterovirus A71-associated hand-foot-mouth disease in Viet Nam
-----------------------
Over the last 4 weeks, there have been a total of over 500 admissions due to hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at Children's Hospital 1 in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, a significant increase compared to previous months. Of the hospitalizations, 38 had severe diseases (grade 2B1 or above) (PMID: 23194699), and one was fatal. Sequence analysis of the viruses collected from a subset of severe patients revealed that all enterovirus A71 strains belonged to subgenogroup C4.

Enterovirus A71 exists as a single serotype but is genetically divided into several genogroups (including C and B) and subgenogroups (e.g., C1 to C5 and B1 to B5). Subgenogroup replacement in endemic localities is a common phenomenon and is often associated with large outbreaks. Of note, a switch from C5 to C4 in 2011 coincided with an explosive outbreak in Viet Nam, which resulted in more than 200 000 hospitalizations and over 200 fatal cases between 2011 and 2012. While there has been no evidence demonstrating the difference in terms of virulence between viruses of different (sub)genogroups, in Viet Nam the replacement of C4 by B5 in 2013 coincided with a decrease in the numbers of reported cases and the proportion of cases with severe illness (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/). Hence, the re-emergence of subgenotype C4 after an absence of 6 years causing disease among a likely unprotected birth cohort of children born after 2012 is of concern.

An inactivated vaccine for EV-A71 has been licensed in China but has not been implemented anywhere outside of China. Currently there is no clinically proven effective antiviral drug available to offer the affected patients. IVIg [intravenous immunoglobulin G] is widely used to empirically treat patients with severe illness. Randomized controlled trials to assess the clinical effectiveness of current treatment approaches (including IVIg) are thus urgently needed.

[Enteroviruses are the causative agents of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD); included in the enteroviruses are polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

Enterovirus 71, a non-polio enterovirus, has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in southeast Asia over the past several years.

Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths from HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

According to the Viet Nam News (https://vietnamnews.vn/society/466697/disease-season-peaks-in-south.html#qkZ3GIfqBgbbEPuD.97), the number of children with HFMD at HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City Paediatrics Hospital 1 rose by 5 times compared to last month [August 2018], according to Truong Huu Khanh, head of the hospital's infectious and nervous diseases department.

In the last several days, the department admitted more children with the disease, and on Monday [24 Sep 2018], as many as 222 children with HFMD infections were admitted.

On Wednesday [26 Sep 2018], 179 children with HFMD were treated at the department, including 30 with severe symptoms.

Earlier this week [week of 24 Sep 2018], 10 patients with HFMD infections were placed on ventilators, while another 5 needed dialysis.

One patient died from HFMD, which has no protective vaccine, Khanh said.

[...] Khanh said that more than 50 percent of hospitalised patients had contracted the HFM EV71 infection, which causes a high risk of severe complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure, and even death.

As of Thu 20 Sep 2018, the province had 6100 patients infected with HFMD.

More than 30 000 children with HFMD have been reported nationwide since late August [2018], according to the Ministry of Health. All provinces and cities have reported patients with the disease. - Mod.LK
