A Florida man died from a "flesh-eating" bacterium after eating bad oysters, according to officials. The Florida Department of Health said that the 71 year old man in Sarasota, [Florida], died following his seafood meal on 8 Jul 2018 at a local restaurant.

His death came 2 days after he ate oysters containing the "flesh-eating" bacterium known as _Vibrio vulnificus_, which can be found in raw shellfish, according to news station WWSB. The illness is rare but can also cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, according to the agency.

"Exposures occur more commonly during the summer months from May to October, when the water is warmer," agency officials told the Tampa Bay Times.

[At least 48 cases with 11 deaths occurred in Florida due to _V. vulnificus_ in 2017.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book", Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 per cent). Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: firstly, vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and, secondly, most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
