In August [2022], authorities confirmed by molecular diagnosis 20 new outbreaks [of African swine fever (ASF)], bringing the total of accumulated confirmed cases to 1615 distributed in 31 provinces, according to a report from the Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) (https://www.swinehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/September-global-report-9-7-2022.pdf). Of those, 980 outbreaks have been resolved.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, samples from over 4899 production sites have been taken and processed by Dominican veterinary services; 417 of them were taken during the last month (the period between 24 Jul 2022 and 21 Aug 2022), from which 20 tested positive for ASF.

SHIC said it is important to note that the positive rate has changed since November 2021 (from over 40% to 17%), denoting the progressive efficacy of control efforts across the country. Still, they said, the active spread of the virus throughout the population is of great concern.

To date [16 Sep 2022], Dominican authorities have culled 45 212 pigs to control African swine fever (ASF) in areas where the disease has been detected since May 2021. According to data provided to Diario Libre by the Ministry of Agriculture, DOP 1.27 billion [USD 24.8 million] have been delivered as compensation to the producers who own the slaughtered animals, benefiting 4414.

In addition, the outbreaks detected and closed amount to 1627 throughout the country. Likewise, a team of 112 veterinary technicians and doctors participate in the control and eradication activities of the virus at the national level.

The Ministry of Agriculture reported the priority of the Executive Branch and the authorities of the agricultural sector is the control and eradication of ASF. He gave as an example of the strategy being developed the partial depopulation with active epidemiological surveillance, which allows the creation of free areas.

ASF was detected in the Dominican Republic last year [2021], after the death of some 14 pigs on a small farm in Carbonera, in Montecristi.

The document delivered by the Ministry of Agriculture to Diario Libre indicates the quarantine system at the port and airport level has been strengthened with the placement of canine duos, as well as incinerators and autoclaves.

In addition, according to official data, the authorities have increased the capacity for the diagnosis of the ASF virus, and currently the Central Veterinary Laboratory (Lavecen) has the capacity to process around 6000 weekly tests and deliver the results in less than 24 hours.

The process of control and eradication of the virus is developed in the Dominican Republic in inter-agency coordination under the incidence command system. Participating in this process are the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which is an agency of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA); the International Regional Organization for Agricultural Health (Oirsa); the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

African swine fever is a highly infectious hemorrhagic disease only affecting pigs and is not zoonotic, meaning it is not transmitted to humans. This virus affects domestic and wild pigs.

In the Dominican Republic, the pig sector generates more than 58 000 direct and indirect jobs and has an infrastructure that exceeds DOP 30 trillion [USD 561 million].

[Interestingly, the OIE (now WOAH) reported ASF in the Dominican Republic in May 2022. Prior to May [2022], the 1st outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in the Dominican Republic started on 10 Apr 2021. There is no treatment or vaccine available for this disease. The only way to stop this disease is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds.

As there is no treatment for this disease and it has a relatively easy and rapid spread, the statement from above: "partial depopulation with active epidemiological surveillance" is a little concerning. This is a highly contagious disease with a rather rapid spread. So, I am sensitive to maintaining as much of a herd as possible, as it is the peoples' livelihood, but this disease respects no one. I hope the plan of "partial depopulation with active epidemiological surveillance" works here.

Given the proximity of the Dominican Republic to the United States, it seems some of these plans could have moved faster, as it is now mid-September 2022. However, supposedly the swine from the 2021 cases were depopulated.

According to the USDA and APHIS, "USDA is working closely with other federal and state agencies, the swine industry, and producers to take the necessary actions to protect our nation's pigs and keep this disease out. This group is also actively preparing to respond if ASF were ever detected in the US" (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/swine-disease-information/african-swine-fever). - Mod.TG
