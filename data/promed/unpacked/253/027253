Death of villager due to rabies alarms administraters
--------------------------------------------
The City Veterinarian Office (CVO) was alarmed over the recent death of a villager due to rabies virus infection. Reports reaching the office said another villager in Barangay Balindog also died of the rabies virus infection. A 49-year-old resident died last week of rabies, data from the City Health Office said. The victim, according to his wife, was [bitten] by one of their puppies sometime in March this year [2012]. The puppy died the next day, the woman said. But her husband just shrugged his shoulders when told the dog might be rabid and that it might kill him. Last week, his wife said, her husband experienced fever, numbness, experienced discomfort and paralysis. Later, her husband had hallucinations and became hydrophobic.

When reports about the man's death reached the City Health Office and City Veterinarian Office, they immediately went to the victim's place and gave the family member doses of anti-rabies vaccine. They are still verifying reports that another resident of Barangay Balindog here died of rabies virus. Doctors at the hospital where the victim was treated and died eventually told the public to be extra cautious of dog bites as the animal might be a carrier of rabies virus. Rabies, they said, is a preventable disease that occurs in animals and attacks the brain, which might cause severe inflammation or encephalitis and death.

[As late as 2011 the Philippines were estimated to be among the top 10 rabies hotspot in Asia. More recently there have successful efforts in some parts of the country to improve the situation by enhanced dog rabies control programmes and increasing awareness of the general population. The unfortunate death of the person in this report can be attributed to a delay in administration of post-exposure prophylaxis due to the victim's reluctance to seek treatment when such treatment was available. Education of the population to the risk of rabies virus infection remains a priority in Cotabato at least.

Kidapawan City is a city in the province of Cotabato, Philippines. It is the capital city of Cotabato Province. It is a favorite tourist destination in the late October to December and in the summer. Tourists should be alerted to the risk of exposure to rabies virus infection at this destination. The location of Cotabato province and Kidapawan city can be found in the interactive HealthMap at: http://healthmap.org/r/2msp. - Mod.CP]
