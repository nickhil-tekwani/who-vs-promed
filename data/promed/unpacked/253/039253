Emergency report
Extracts from an e-mail received on 30 Aug 2000 from Dr Alfonso Torres,
Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, United States Department of
Agriculture, Washington, DC:
Report date: 29 Aug 2000.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 20 Aug 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: 17 Aug 2000.
Outbreak:
Location: Richmond County, State of New York
No. of outbreaks: 1
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species/ susceptible/ cases/ deaths/ destroyed/ slaughtered
equ/ 2/ 1/ 0/ 1/ 0
fau/ .../ .../ 40/ 0/ 0
Description of affected population: The case horse was a 26 year-old
gelding with no history of travel; the other horse on the premises has
remained clinically normal. The exact number of other equines in the area
is not yet known, but is believed to be small; other livestock are not
known to be in the area and there is no commercial poultry.
Diagnosis:
A. Date of confirmation: 28 Aug 2000.
B. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratories, Ames, Iowa.
C. Diagnostic tests used: IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA); plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the virus affected New York City
and surrounding counties in 1999 (see Disease Information, 12 [42, 150,
dated 29 Oct 1999 and 13 [8, 30, dated 3 Mar 2000) and was documented to
have overwintered into the year 2000.
B. Mode of spread: mosquitoes (_Culex_ or _Aedes_ sp.).
C. Other epidemiological details:
The confirmed equine case was located in Richmond County, also known as
Staten Island. Staten Island is one of the 5 boroughs of New York City. In
Jul 2000, an outbreak of human encephalitis caused by West Nile virus (WNV)
began in New York City; to date there have been five human cases identified
in New York City.
Four of the 5 human infections with WNV were in Richmond County residents.
Richmond County has also had 40 dead wild birds, primarily crows or other
corvids, and 64 mosquito pools detected as WNV-positive in 2000. Overall,
wild birds infected with WNV have been documented in 5 States this year
through an ongoing surveillance system that includes testing of wild birds,
mosquito trapping and testing, sentinel chicken testing, enhanced passive
and active human surveillance, and enhanced passive veterinary
surveillance. Surveillance has not detected any WNV activity within 2 miles
of the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens County, New York,
which is more than 20 miles from the infected horse premises in Staten Island.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Mosquito control measures have been carried out in the outbreak area. The
entire county was sprayed with a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide
(adulticide) on 2, 14, 17, and 27 Aug 2000; another application is planned
for 30 Aug 2000. Additional applications of insecticide will be made within
a 2-mile radius of any future WNV-positive wild bird, mosquito pool, human,
or equine. In addition, larvicidal treatments of catch basins and breeding
source reduction activities have been ongoing throughout New York City for
over 3 months and are continuing.
- Based on the scientific literature, and on 3 experimental equine
inoculation or transmission studies underway or recently completed in the
United States, horses are incidental ("dead-end") hosts that do not develop
viremia adequate to transmit WNV to mosquitoes. Therefore no quarantines
nor other movement restrictions have been placed on the one clinically
normal horse remaining on the case premises. Further information on the WNV
activity in the United States of America can be found on the following web
page: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ep/WNV/summary.html>

[The date of first WNV case in horses last year was 26 Aug 1999. Cases
continued to occur until the last case on 18 Oct 1999. This year seems to
be right on track. - Mod.PC
