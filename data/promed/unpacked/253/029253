Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Laboratories
Administration testing confirmed the presence of _Legionella_ bacteria
in water collected at the Plim Plaza Hotel in Ocean City, Maryland.
_Legionella pneumophila_, the bacteria that cause Legionnaires'
disease, was detected in water collected from various locations at the
hotel.

An ongoing investigation by the Worcester County Health Department and
DHMH has identified 3 additional cases of Legionnaires' disease in
people who had stayed at the hotel. This is in addition to the 3 cases
announced by the health department last week, for a total of 6
confirmed cases. One person, an elderly out-of-state resident, died.
The Worcester County Health Department and DHMH continue to work with
the Plim Plaza Hotel management to investigate this situation.

Legionnaires' disease, also called legionellosis, is a form of
pneumonia caused by inhaling mist or vapor from water containing the
_Legionella_ bacteria. People may develop the disease approximately 2
to 14 days following exposure to the bacteria.

Although the hotel is currently closed for the season, anyone who was
a guest at the Plim Plaza hotel in the month of September [2011] and
is experiencing pneumonia-like symptoms should contact his or her
health care provider to determine whether testing or treatment is
recommended. The disease can be treated with commonly available
antibiotics. Legionellosis is not spread from person to person.

There have been 93 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease reported
this year in Maryland. On average 100-130 cases are reported statewide
annually.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative
bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella
pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the
disease; about 70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis
that is less severe than Legionnaires' disease.

Legionnaires' disease, and possibly Pontiac fever, is usually acquired
by inhalation by a susceptible person of an infectious dose of
aerosolized _Legionella_. Usually, a building's contaminated water
system is incriminated as the source. _Legionella_ are found primarily
in the hot water portion of plumbing systems and in cooling towers.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful
tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one
genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common
source. Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies
without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative
infectious reservoir should be demonstrated by means of genotyping
methods (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

Ocean City is a resort town in Worcester County, Maryland, United
