Bovine TB outbreak in Welsh goats
---------------------------------
Cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) have been found in goats in
Carmarthenshire. The Welsh Assembly Government confirmed the outbreak
and said it knew of a similar case in England, but it is not clear if
they are linked.

The disease in goats is "unusual," and animal health officials are
checking to see if it has spread to other herds. The latest TB cases
came as some MPs and AMs [Assembly Members] urged the Assembly
government to halt plans to cull badgers, which are known to spread TB
to cattle. Farmers' groups believe a cull of badgers would stem a rise
in cases.

Of the outbreak in goats, Brian Walters, vice-president of the
Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW), said the news was a worrying
development, while a goat milk producer in Carmarthenshire voiced her
concerns.

An assembly government spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an outbreak
of bovine TB in goats in England and Wales that includes a case in
Carmarthenshire." DEFRA's executive agency Animal Health are
responsible for management of the outbreak, as well as possible
tracings to other herds. "Animal Health are keeping officials in the
TB team at the Welsh Assembly Government fully informed of
developments with this outbreak," said the spokeswoman.

[Although goats are strongly susceptible to experimental infection
with mammalian and avian tubercle bacteria, "spontaneous"
tuberculosis in this animal species is rather uncommon. Several
records are available which show that, in mixed herds of cattle and
goats, cross infection easily occurs. As a cause of death, however,
tuberculosis in goats is a rather important disease.

Most bovine-type infections in goats are air-borne. Van Der Hoeden
(Zoonoses, Elsevier, 1964) described very serious, strongly exudative
processes with extensive cavity-formation in the lungs and multiple
ulcers in the intestines in tuberculous caprines. This was true of
both avian- and bovine-type infections. He also reported that in
sheep, tuberculosis is even rarer than it is in goats.
