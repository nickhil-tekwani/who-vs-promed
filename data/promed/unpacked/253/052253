International symposium reports on the use of antivirals in patients with H5N1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physicians from countries affected by the deadly H5N1 influenza virus
(bird/avian flu) have presented case reports about antiviral use in
patients infected with H5N1, including treatment with the oral antiviral
Tamiflu(R) (oseltamivir). The physicians' reports were revealed this week
[2 Mar 2008] at the International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infections
(ISRVI) in Singapore.(1)

Tamiflu is approved for both the treatment and post-exposure prevention
(prophylaxis) of influenza in adults and in children aged one year and
older. Studies supporting the approval of Tamiflu are based in seasonal
influenza.

The magnitude of effect of Tamiflu in treating and preventing novel strains
of influenza (such as those that may be involved in a pandemic or
associated with avian flu) cannot be predicted as it has not been studied
or approved in a pandemic scenario. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
recommended that higher doses and longer treatment durations may be
required to combat novel strains of influenza.

According to WHO, the H5N1 virus has already killed 234 people in 12
countries.(2) In the most recent clinical management guidelines issued by
the WHO, Tamiflu remains the primary antiviral agent of choice for the
treatment of H5N1 virus infections.(3)

Symposium findings
------------------
In Indonesia, of the total of 119 H5N1 human cases reported, 22 survived --
an 18 per cent survival rate overall. Of the 119, 33 patients received no
Tamiflu, all of whom died. Tamiflu was administered to the other 86
patients, with a 26 per cent survival rate overall. Time from onset of
illness to initiation of treatment appeared to influence survival. Both of
the 2 patients who received Tamiflu within 24 hours of illness onset survived.

If given the drug within 4 days, 55 per cent survived (6/11), and 35 per
cent survived if given Tamiflu within 6 days (13/37).(4) The survival rate
of those receiving it later than 6 days after illness onset was 18 per cent
(9/49).(2)

Recent information about 8 Vietnamese patients infected with H5N1 was also
presented. All 8 patients received Tamiflu, but all 8 patients presented to
the hospital later than 5 days after onset of illness. Only 3 of the 8
patients survived, reinforcing that treatment benefit is reduced for
patients that receive the drug later in the course of illness.(4,5) In 2
patients who were unable to take the drug orally due to the severity of
their illness, physicians administered the drug by nasogastric tube and
found it was well absorbed and there was a reduction in H5N1 virus in these
patients.

Susceptibility of circulating H5N1 strains to Tamiflu
-----------------------------------------------------
These clinical findings are supported by animal data, also presented at
ISRVI, which shows that oseltamivir treatment was effective against H5N1
influenza viruses representing different clades/subclades. However, higher
doses were required for the more pathogenic H5N1 viruses.(6)

"Multiple factors can affect the susceptibility of antiviral therapy with
highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses and it is reassuring that
oseltamivir, in mouse models, demonstrates activity even to the most
pathogenic circulating strains," comments study author Dr Elena Govorkova,
St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. "Antiviral drugs
are an essential component for the early control of an influenza pandemic."

Data also confirm the low level of resistance reported to-date with Tamiflu
to H5N1 avian influenza in the field; there are only 5 cases of published
reports of H5N1 resistance or reduced susceptibility to Tamiflu to
date.(7-9) Laboratory results have shown 96 per cent of H5N1 strains (53
out of 55) tested in the laboratory were sensitive to Tamiflu.(10)

This compares to the around 14 per cent of isolates tested this year [2008]
of the seasonal influenza A H1N1 virus showing resistance to Tamiflu,
reported at the conference.(11) It is important to note that these
increased levels of resistance have only been reported spontaneously in
this year's H1N1 (Solomon Islands) seasonal strain, and not an avian strain
such as H5N1, and not in patients who have been administered Tamiflu.(12)

"Currently, we are seeing that Tamiflu has been used as part of the
clinical management of patients infected with H5N1 with only isolated cases
of resistance being reported," comments Dr David Reddy, Global Pandemic
Task Force Leader at Roche. "This is reassuring for governments that have
stockpiled Tamiflu for pandemic use. It is, however, critical that both
Roche and the medical community remain vigilant so that we can understand
this mutating virus and be best prepared for defence against a potential
pandemic strain."

About Tamiflu
-------------
Tamiflu is designed to be active against all clinically relevant influenza
viruses and works by blocking the action of the neuraminidase (NA) enzyme
on the surface of the virus. When neuraminidase is inhibited, the spread of
the virus to other cells in the body is inhibited. It is licensed for the
treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in children aged one year and above
and in adults. The most frequently reported adverse events in clinical
studies were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Tamiflu is available for the
treatment of influenza in more than 80 countries worldwide. Tamiflu was
approved based on studies in seasonal influenza. The magnitude of effect of
Tamiflu in treating and preventing novel strains of influenza (such as
those that may be involved in a pandemic or associated with avian flu)
cannot be predicted. The WHO has recommended that higher doses and longer
duration may be required.

Tamiflu was invented by Gilead Sciences and licensed to Roche in 1996.
Roche and Gilead partnered on clinical development, with Roche leading
efforts to produce, register and bring the product to the markets. Under
the terms of the companies' agreement, amended in November 2005, Gilead
participates with Roche in the consideration of sub-licenses for the
pandemic supply of Tamiflu in resource-limited countries. To ensure broader
access to Tamiflu for all patients in need, Gilead has agreed to waive its
right to full royalty payments for product sold under these sub-licenses.
