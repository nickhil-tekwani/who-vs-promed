The Atlantic coast of Guatemala runs between Belize and Honduras, 2
countries in which coconut lethal yellowing (LY) disease is highly
active (Harrison et al., 2002). Coconut palms (_Cocos nucifera_,
Atlantic tall ecotype), with symptoms indicative of LY (Harrison and
Jones, 2003) including premature nutfall, necrosis of immature
inflorescences, progressive frond yellowing, and eventual palm death
were 1st observed at several sites along the coast during 2000.
However, the syndrome differed from that reported for LY, as
inflorescence necrosis was evident after, rather than before, frond
yellowing.
Tissues from trunks, young leaves -- or inflorescences -- were
sampled from palms with, and without, symptoms at Estero Lagarto,
Finca Baltimore, Santa Maria del Mar, and Punta Manabique. Total DNA
was extracted from tissues by a small-scale method and tested for
phytoplasma DNA by a nested PCR using phytoplasma universal rRNA
primer pair P1 / P7, followed by LY group-specific primer pair LY16Sf
/ LY16Sr (Harrison et al., 2002).
RFLP profiles obtained by digesting the nested PCR products with Hinf
I endonuclease (Harrison and Jones, 2003) were identical for all
phytoplasma-positive Guatemalan palms and matched rDNA profiles of
Honduran and Florida isolates of the LY phytoplasma included for
comparison.
LY phytoplasma was detected in all symptomatic palms (8/8), but none
(0/8) of the symptomless palms tested positive. These results were
confirmed later at the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan,
and at the University of Florida, using either LY group-specific, or
LY pathogen-specific, PCR (Harrison et al., 1994).
Following this initial survey, more LY-diseased coconut palms were
sighted at other locations along the Atlantic coast, but, as of 2003,
LY has not been seen during surveys of coconut populations along the
Pacific coast of Guatemala.
This is the 1st report of coconut lethal yellowing disease in Guatemala.

[LY spreads rapidly, destroying coconut and other palms. Millions of
palms have been killed in the Caribbean region over the past 40
years. LY disease has swept through the coconut-growing regions of
Jamaica, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and Florida and is presently
destroying palms in the Yucatan Peninsula, Honduras, as well as
mainland Belize. Similar diseases have been identified in Africa
(Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon). If
unchecked, LY disease may spread to South America. Millions of
coconut palms on the Caribbean and Atlantic coasts are endangered,
because the common cultivar is highly susceptible to the phytoplasma.
LY, described by some as the "dengue of palm trees," is spread by the
planthopper _Myndus crudus_, but other planthopper species are being
assessed for their role as vectors. Infected palms die within 6-9
months after symptoms are 1st expressed. The vascular systems of
infected palms are plugged with the phytoplasma thus stressing the
palms and accelerating the onset of death. Research scientists at Ft.
Lauderdale, FL, and Meridia, in Yucatan, have identified other
phytoplasma strains associated with coconut palm that express
leaf-yellowing syndromes in southern Mexico that are distinct from LY
phytoplasmas.
There is no effective cure for LY-infected palms. Previously ravaged
areas have been replanted with resistant cultivars and hybrids such
as 'Maypan'. There is some work being done on genetic modification of
palms, but transformation of palms with genes of interest including
LY resistance, and other traits, is still in the offing.
