Near the town of Zeewolde [Flevoland], highly pathogenic bird flu [avian inlfuenza] (H5) was diagnosed at a farm with organic laying hens. The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that it concerns a farm with 2 houses, one with approximately 24 000 birds, the other with approximately 12 000. In one house the hens showed signs of bird flu. Samples were tested and found positive for HPAI serotype H5 [for completed serotyping, see commentary].

As a result of this outbreak and due to increasing finds of dead wild birds in northern parts of the Netherlands and of infected wild birds in Germany, the agriculture minister has implemented a nationwide housing order for commercially kept poultry as of 12 noon on [26 Oct 2021]. In this way, it wants to reduce the risk of the bird flu virus being introduced from wild birds to other farms in the Netherlands.

To prevent the virus from spreading, the birds on the infected farm in Zeewolde are being culled by the authorities. Minister Schouten has also immediately announced transport restrictions for poultry farms in a zone of 10 kilometers [6 mi] around the affected farm in Zeewolde.

This transport ban applies to poultry, eggs, poultry manure, and used litter, as well as other animals and animal products from commercial poultry farms. There are no other poultry farms within a radius of 1 kilometer [0.6 mi] around the infected farm. There are 6 other poultry farms in the area of 3 kilometers [1.9 mi] around the farm. These farms are sampled and examined for bird flu. There are 9 other poultry farms within the 10 kilometre [6.2 mi] zone which are affected by the transport restrictions.

[The event above was officially notified by the Dutch authorities to the OIE today (29 Oct 2021).

According to the report, the outbreak involved 2350 cases among a total of 35 301 susceptible birds; 3 birds died. The remaining (35 298) birds have been killed and disposed of. The causative agent has been identified as HPAI H5N1 by the National Reference Laboratory at the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Lelystad. The diagnosis was established by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (real-time multiplex PCR).

The following "Description of the affected population" is included in the OIE report:
"On 26 Oct 2021, an outbreak of H5N1 was confirmed on an organic layer poultry farm in Zeewolde. A 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been established. In the 3 km zone there are 6 other poultry premises. The poultry farms in the 3 km zone have been screened (examined, sampled, and tested) and there were no positive results. The subtype HPAI H5N1 is confirmed by the national reference laboratory. All susceptible animals on the infected premise have been killed."

The OIE report, including a map presenting the location of the event, is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=41785. Information about the genotyping of the strain is anticipated.

Notably, a total of 863 confirmed human cases of HPAI H5N1 have been recorded in 18 countries (most of them in Asia) since 2003; 456 of the patients died. Further details are available at https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf. - Mod.AS
