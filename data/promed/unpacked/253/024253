Cases of Ross River Virus [infection] have surged this mosquito-breeding season, with 20 cases diagnosed in the South Burnett so far this year.

Darling Downs Public Health Unit Director Penny Hutchinson said 75 cases have been notified in the Darling Downs region to date. "The latest figures up to the 2nd week of March [2015] show there have been 3292 notifications of Ross River Virus across Queensland which is 8.1 times the 5-year average," she said. "Periodic peaks are seen in Queensland with the current peak being the 2nd highest in the past 25 years."

"Ross River Virus is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes and causes fatigue, fever, skin rash and joint pain, which can be very debilitating."

Darling Downs Hospital and Health Service warned mosquito activity was likely to continue over the coming weeks due to recent rain and ongoing heat and humidity.

Residents are urged to protect themselves from mosquito bites to help stem the dramatic increase in cases:
- Avoid being outside during times of heavy infestation of mosquitoes.
- Use insect repellents and wear protective, light-coloured clothing.
- Screen living and sleeping areas.
- Check your home regularly for potential mosquito breeding areas and empty uncovered water containers.

Contact your doctor if you show symptoms of the disease.

[Cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infection are increasing rapidly in Queensland state. There were 2835 cases in the state reported on 14 Mar 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150314.3230696), and now the case count has reached 3292. As reported in a 24 Jan 2015 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20150126.3121230), New South Wales is also having a significant outbreak, with 322 cases as of late January 2015, and there have been 3 cases in Canberra. RRV transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant.

RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Although not fatal, it causes acute polyarthritis (pain in the joints) in humans that may persist long after the acute phase of the infection is over. The recommendations to avoid mosquito bites are prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting these hot spots.
