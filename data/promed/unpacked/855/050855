News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 3017 people have been vaccinated, including 829 in Mbandaka, 726 in Bikoro, 1,374 in Iboko, 77 in Ingende and 11 in Kinshasa.

Generosity
-The NGO Amani Global Networks donated 5000 USD and 50 bicycles to the Ministry of Health to support the Ministry's efforts in the Ebola response. The financial contribution was paid in full to the Association of Winners of the Ebola Virus Disease (ANVE) gathering all the cured and relatives of the victims to ensure better biological, psychological and social monitoring. And the 50 bicycles will be sent to the various health zones affected to facilitate the movement of surveillance teams in the field.

Data as reported by 17:00; 15 Jun 2018

Ebola virus disease in DRC [57 cases, 28 deaths, 49.1 percent CFR]
------------------------------------------------------------------

Event Description
-----------------
The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with cautious optimism. On 15 Jun 2018, 5 new suspected EVD cases were reported in Bikoro Health Zone. A total of 6 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. No new confirmed EVD cases and no new deaths were reported on the reporting date. Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko Health Zone developed illness on 2 Jun 2018 and was confirmed 6 Jun 2018. To date, a total 24 case-patients with confirmed EVD have been cured since the onset of the outbreak.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 April 2018), a total of 57 EVD cases and 28 deaths (case fatality rate 49.1 percent) have been reported, as of 15 Jun 2018. Of the 57 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed, 14 are probable (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing) and five are suspected. Of the confirmed and probable cases, 27 (52 percent) are from Iboko, followed by 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro and 4 (8 percent) from Wangata health zones. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The outbreak has remained localized to the 3 health zones initially affected: Iboko (24 confirmed cases, 3 probable, 7 deaths), Bikoro (10 confirmed cases, 11 probable, 5 suspected, 18 deaths) and Wangata (4 confirmed cases, 3 deaths).

The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing, with a total 1319 completing the mandatory 21-day follow-up period. As of 14 Jun 2018, a total of 387 contacts were under follow up, of which 360 (93 percent) were reached on the reporting date.

Public Health Actions
----------------------
-On 11 Jun 2018, the WHO Director General (DG) and the Minister of Health visited the affected areas, including Itipo health area (the remaining hotspot with active transmission) in Iboko Health Zone to conduct on-the-spot assessment and support response operations. The DG and the Minister of Health met the local coordination commission, the National Association of Ebola Winners (people who were cured) and field responders. The mission also visited the newly established Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Itipo. The DG thanked the government for the strong leadership and commitment to the EVD response.

-As of 12 Jun 2018, WHO has deployed a total of 271 technical experts in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the EVD outbreak.

- Since the launch of the vaccination exercise on 21 May 2018, a total of 2920 people have been vaccinated in Iboko (1290), Wangata (822), and Bikoro (726), Ingende (77), and Kinshasa (5), as of 15 June 2018. The targets for vaccination are front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed EVD cases and contacts of these contacts.

- WHO continues to support neighbouring countries to enhance their preparedness and readiness to detect and contain EVD should it be introduced. The countries have developed national contingency response plans, which were incorporated into the regional readiness and preparedness plan that was published. The regional readiness and preparedness plan requires 15.5 million USD. A total of 1.55 million USD has been mobilized through Contingency Funds for Emergency (CFE) to support the preparedness and readiness contingency plans in the 9 countries.

-A community dialogue about signs, mode of transmission, prevention measures and community involvement in EVD response was conducted with 37 local leaders (including 3 sector leaders, 17 group leaders and 17 village chiefs) in Bikoro territory.

Situation Interpretation
------------------------
Slightly over a month into the EVD response, tremendous progress has been made in containing further spread of the disease. Currently, active transmission is mainly limited to the remote and hard-to-reach communities in Itipo health area in Iboko Health Zone. The situation in Bikoro and Wangata (Mbandaka city) health zones is stable and is being cautiously monitored, with the last confirmed cases reported in mid-May 2018. The 2nd phase of EVD response has now shifted to rapid investigations of suspected cases and alerts, thorough contact tracing in the remote area sand engagement of communities, including the indigenous population in and around the villages. This will imply redeployment of field responders and response logistics.

- 17 Jun 2018. Oxfam distribution of food

Oxfam distributes rice, beans and flour to approximately 4525 people affected by the Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province. The 1st distributions took place in Mbandaka - the provincial capital - and will extend into rural communities.

It is vital to feed families who have been in contact with sick people so they can eat while protecting others from the disease. Not providing food means that they have to go out into the market, potentially infecting other people. In recent weeks, the spread of Ebola has slowed as a result of joint efforts of government, humanitarian agencies and local partners. However, "more than 50 cases of Ebola are way too much," said Jose Barahona, Oxfam Country Director in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A total of 57 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable and 5 suspected. This Sat [16 Jun 2018], 5 new suspected cases were reported in Bikoro and 6 samples were negative.

"We have all the lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to fight Ebola in the DRC. We work with communities to listen to their fears, concerns and beliefs because it is crucial to understand them in order to overcome them. In West Africa, because of movement restrictions, many people no longer cultivated their fields and prices of food increased considerably (...). We need to prepare a post-Ebola response, including helping people earn a living and providing safe drinking water and sustainable sanitation. Oxfam's work should not stop when the epidemic is over," added Barahona.

Oxfam's response to the Ebola outbreak aims to reach 40 000 people in the 1st 3 months of the response. The NGO provides door-to-door information to the most vulnerable people, works with communities and conducting mass outreach activities, including film screenings. Oxfam also installs chlorinated water points in hospitals, health centers, schools and ports, and helps to disinfect homes in which cases of Ebola have been detected. Oxfam also provides disinfection kits and hygiene kits to communities.

[This seems to be exactly the right approach. Oxfam's programmes address the structural causes of poverty and related injustice and work primarily through local accountable organizations, seeking to enhance their effectiveness. Oxfam's stated goal is to help people directly when local capacity is insufficient or inappropriate for Oxfam's purposes, and to assist in the development of structures which directly benefit people facing the realities of poverty and injustice. Oxfam recognizes the universality and indivisibility of human rights and has adopted these overarching aims to express these rights in practical terms: the right to a sustainable livelihood, the right to basic social services, the right to life and security, the right to be heard, and the right to an identity.
