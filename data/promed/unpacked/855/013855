Officials with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) report (computer translated) the 1st case of the tickborne infection, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in a 55-year-old female from Chungcheongnam-do (Chungnam) province in the west of the country.

This has prompted health officials to advise the public to take precautions when doing outdoor activities to avoid tick bites.

The patient was gardening prior to the appearance of symptoms. On 28 Apr [2019], she presented with symptoms of fever and erythema and was hospitalized at the medical institution. SFTS testing returned positive.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly emerging infectious disease. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and elevated serum enzyme levels. Multiorgan failure occurs in severe cases, and 6%-30% of case-patients die. The syndrome is caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV) (genus _Phlebovirus_, family Phenuiviridae).

Ixodid tick species are implicated as vectors of SFTSV.

[SFTS has been occurring sporadically in South Korea since 2013 and is endemic there. SFTSV can cause a serious disease and is of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well. There is also some previous evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, and a previous report provides more objective evidence that aerosol transmission could occur (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea: poss. aerosol transmission 20190108.6248997).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Phenuiviridae family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
