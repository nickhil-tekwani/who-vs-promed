A single human case has been reported in Baachat village (Gorgol region -
M'bout district) and the livestock situation is still under investigation.
The human case was in close contact with a herd where some abortions were
observed (still a rumour), and we don't know yet if these abortions were
caused by RVF or another infection. A joint mission (Veterinary Services/
Ministry of Health) is currently in the field and should clarify the
situation.
We are following-up the issue with the Veterinary Services of Mauritania
(including the Central Veterinary Laboratory - CNERV) as well as with the
LNERV (Laboratoire National de Recherches Veterinaires - Dakar, Senegal)
which coordinates the serosurveillance of Rift Valley fever in Senegal and
Mauritania during the rainy season.
We will keep you informed on the evolution of the situation.

[ProMED appreciates this informed report. Sporadic human cases do not
normally occur in the absence of livestock cases. This human case may be
the sentinel of a large ongoing livestock outbreak. - Mod.JW]
[What a different world we live in these days when a putative single RVF
case in an obscure corner of Mauritania gets this response. What an
improvement! I can remember (too well) when such an event would have been
merely a footnote in an annual report. - Mod.MHJ]
