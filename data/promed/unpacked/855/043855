Abstract
Background
Heartland virus (HRTV) was 1st described as a human pathogen in 2012. From 2013-2017, CDC implemented a national protocol to evaluate patients for HRTV disease, better define its geographic distribution, epidemiology and clinical characteristics, and develop diagnostic assays for this novel virus.

Methods
Individuals aged 12 years or older, whose clinicians contacted state health departments or CDC about testing for HRTV infections, were screened for recent onset of fever with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A questionnaire was administered to collect data on demographics, risk factors, and signs and symptoms; blood samples were tested for the presence of HRTV RNA and neutralizing antibodies.

Results
Of 85 individuals enrolled and tested, 16 (19%) had evidence of acute HRTV infection, 1 (1%) had past infection, and 68 (80%) had no infection. Patients with acute HRTV disease were residents of 7 states, 12 (75%) were male, and median age was 71 years (range: 43-80 years). Illness onset occurred from April to September. The majority reported fatigue, anorexia, nausea, headache, confusion, arthralgia, or myalgia. There were 14 (88%) cases hospitalized; 2 (13%) died. There were 14 (88%) participants who reported an attached tick in the 2 weeks prior to illness onset. HRTV-infected individuals were significantly older (P under 0.001) and more likely to report an attached tick (P=0.03) than uninfected individuals.

Conclusions
Healthcare providers should consider HRTV disease testing in patients with an acute febrile illness with either leukopenia or thrombocytopenia not explained by another condition or who were suspected to have a tickborne disease but did not improve following appropriate treatment (e.g., doxycycline) [7].

Testing should be limited to patients who either resided in or traveled to an area with previous evidence of HRTV or who had a known tick exposure [6, 19]. Because the virus is transmitted by infected ticks, prevention likely will depend on using insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and performing tick checks after spending time outdoors. Future research is needed to understand the clinical spectrum and further geographic distribution of HRTV disease, including determination of whether asymptomatic infections can occur.

[This report provides an overview of the occurrence of Heartland virus (HRTV) infections in the USA. This viral disease was 1st described 11 years ago. HRTV is a novel phlebovirus that was isolated in 2009 from 2 residents of northwestern Missouri who were hospitalized for acute onset of febrile illness with fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The HRTV-infected individuals involved in the above study were residents of Missouri, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, North Carolina, Illinois, Iowa and Tennessee.

People become infected with Heartland virus through the bite of the Lone Star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_). Patients are most likely to be diagnosed with HRTV infections from May to September. Heartland virus causes a flu-like illness, including fever, headache, muscle aches, diarrhea, appetite loss, and tiredness. ProMED-mail readers who are interested in the details of the above study can access the complete report at the above URL, which includes demographics, geographic distribution, clinical features, initial outcomes and laboratory results for the 16 HRTV disease cases.

As noted previously, a variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found signs that Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes, and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, the serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 animals were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose. Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18% of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties. These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response.
