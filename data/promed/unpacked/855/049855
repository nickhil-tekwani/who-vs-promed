Health officials announced [Tue 15 May 2018] that they have confirmed a case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome [HPS] in a Grant County resident.

Grant County Health District officials said the person is believed to have been exposed to contaminated deer mouse dropping while cleaning out their vehicle. The person has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

Officials said this is the 1st confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Grant County in 6 years. In 2012, 2 people in Grant County died of HPS from unrelated incidents. Health officials said there are 1-5 confirmed hantavirus [infection] cases reported in Washington each year.

Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome is a rare illness caused by a virus found in the urine, droppings and saliva of infected rodents. In Washington State, deer mice are the only carriers of the virus.

[This is the confirmation of the suspected case that ProMED-mail posted on 4 May 2018 (see ProMED-mail Hantavirus - Americas (33): USA (WA), Panama (LS) 20180504.5784821). Interestingly, it is mentioned that the individual might have acquired the infection while cleaning out their automobile. There was a previous case last year (2017) in Washington where a woman likely acquired her Sin Nombre virus infection from an automobile air system. The hantavirus involved in the Washington case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. Fortunately, the above case has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. This is not always the case. About one third of HPS cases are fatal.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions mentioned in the above report of those that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and at the above URL.
