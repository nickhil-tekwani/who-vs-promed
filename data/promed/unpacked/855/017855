Changes in vaccination policy may not solve California's "liver cancer
epidemic." In the United States as a whole, rates of hepatitis B had
already declined significantly before the demonstration of effective
vaccine uptake [1,2] (see graph:
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/HepB-US.png).

Vaccination of infected Asian immigrants cannot alter disease
progression or public health risk among Asian immigrants who were
already infected before arriving to California. The focus must be on
testing and counseling of pregnant carriers and high-risk contact
groups in this community. In any case, possible effects of increased
vaccination on rates of liver cancer might not be apparent for several
years, given the natural lag period from infection to tumor.
