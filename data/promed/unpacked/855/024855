Sweden said on Friday it had detected 8 new cases of the H5 flu virus in wild
birds after detecting its 1st suspected cases of the deadly H5N1 strain
earlier this week. Authorities said the birds, found in the same area where 2
wild ducks were confirmed with an aggressive form of the H5 virus on Tuesday,
would undergo further tests to ascertain if they also carried the same strain
of the virus.
"The results showing if the birds have the high-pathogen (aggressive) form of
the virus should be ready on Monday," Inger Nilsson at the infection control
unit of the Board of Agriculture said. The 2 birds first confirmed with the H5
virus are now being tested to see if they have the deadly H5N1 strain, which
has led millions of birds to be culled worldwide. Swedish authorities are
testing dozens of dead birds found on the outskirts of the port city of
Oskarshamn, as well as some found at Vastervik, around 70 km north along the
country's Baltic coastline.
The tests showed that the 7 birds found in Vastervik did not carry the H5
virus, the Board of Agriculture said.
A dead mink found in the area where the first 2 cases of bird flu were
detected tested negative for bird flu.

Greece said on Friday that 3 more cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
had been confirmed in wild fowl, bringing to 22 the number of infected birds
found in the country.
"3 wild swans have been confirmed with H5N1 from a group sent for testing to
London on February 24," the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement. Greece
is awaiting test results on 8 more cases. So far, there have been no cases of
the bird flu in domestic farm poultry. Wildlife experts say Greece has
received an unusually large number of migratory birds this winter, many of
them forced south from their usual wintering grounds in northern Europe by
exceptionally severe weather.
Poultry sales have plummeted. Industry sources say chicken sales are down as
much as 80 percent since early February 2006, when the first case of bird flu
was detected on Greek soil. On 2 Mar 2006 Greece said it would offer state-
guaranteed loans to poultry farmers hit by the sharp drop in sales.

[3] Mauritania, turtle doves

A large number of turtle doves have been found dead over the past few days in
southern Mauritania, triggering new fears of bird flu spread in Africa, the
Mauritania-based Horizons newspaper reported Thursday. In the country's
central south region of Brakna, authorities reported "massive deaths" of the
birds around a pond close to the Senegal River. Meanwhile, experts from the
French Institute of Agricultural Research (CIRAD) have arrived in the West
African state, where they have conducted nearly 500 preliminary tests on the
dead birds.
Nicolas Gaidet, head of the French team, was quoted as saying that the samples
would be sent to laboratories in Europe for analysis. Before the final results
come out, authorities would not say that the country has been hit by bird flu,
according to the newspaper. Nigeria is the first country on the African
continent to report an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, which has
claimed at least 91 lives, mostly in Asia, since 1997. H5N1 has also been
detected in neighboring Niger lately. Dead birds have also been found in
Senegal, but it is not yet known whether they have died of bird flu.
Experts fear that if the bird flu virus cannot be contained, it could go
rampant from West Africa throughout the continent, where most countries lack
resources to combat the disease.

Switzerland found 4 more cases of H5 bird flu in wild birds, the federal
veterinary office said on Friday, adding it expected to find further cases in
the coming days. The H5 virus was found in 2 dead ducks in Geneva, and in a
duck in a town called Ramsen and a coot in Stein, 2 places in the canton
(state) of Schaffhausen near the German border.
The country had sent samples for further tests to a laboratory to see if the
virus in question was the more aggressive H5N1 strain. The results would be
known in roughly a week, the office said.
On Wednesday Switzerland said it had found its first case of the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus in a wild duck found earlier in Geneva. It also found the
H5 virus in a dead swan, also found close to the German border, putting the
total number of bird flu cases in the country at 6. Switzerland has been on
high alert for bird flu since the virus emerged in neighbours France, Germany,
Austria and Italy. Starting in February 2006 it ordered that all poultry be
kept indoors for an indefinite period to lessen the risk from the fast-
spreading H5N1 virus that has led to the preventive culling of millions of
birds worldwide.

Turkey confirmed on Friday 3 new cases of the H5 strain of bird flu among
poultry in an area to the west of Istanbul and said culling of birds was under
way. The Agriculture Ministry said samples from the infected ducks and
chickens had been sent to Britain for further tests to ascertain whether they
had the H5N1 form of the virus, which is dangerous to humans.
4 children died of the H5N1 strain in eastern Turkey in January, the first
human fatalities outside East Asia. 8 other Turkish people who tested
positive for H5N1 have since recovered, according to World Health Organisation
(WHO) data. The latest cases were detected in ducks and chickens in Catalca
and Silivri, both near the Sea of Marmara on the western outskirts of
Istanbul, a city of more than 12 million people. Ministry officials said some
2800 poultry had already been culled in Silivri.
Earlier this week, authorities said they had culled a total 2.27 million
poultry so far across the country of 72 million people in a bid to halt the
spread of the disease. They said more than 60 of a total 106 districts where
bird flu has been confirmed remained under quarantine. Quarantine in Turkey
means 21-day restrictions on the movement of poultry in the designated area
and increased hygiene precautions for the local human population. Doctors say
there has been no new incidence of bird flu among humans since 13 Jan 2006.

[6] Romania, goose & domestic bird

Romania detected the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in domestic birds in a village
80 km (50 miles) west of the capital and in a wild goose in the city of Buzau,
authorities said on Friday. Avian flu has been found in 40 villages and a
small Black Sea resort since the virus was first detected in the Danube Delta
in October 2005. Birds have been culled swiftly and Romania has not reported
any cases in humans.
"We isolated the H5N1 virus in the village of Catunu in Dambovita county and
we will start to take regular measures of culling all the birds and
quarantining the village," said Gabriel Predoi of the animal health agency. He
said the samples would be sent to a British laboratory to confirm whether the
virus found was a highly pathogenic type. "We also found the bird flu virus in
a wild goose in the city of Buzau, but there is no need to panic because
nobody touched it," Predoi said. Buzau, with a population of around 150 000,
is some 100 km (60 miles) north of the capital.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) and local experts have warned that Romania
could see human cases of bird flu because its rural areas, where around 45
percent of the 22 million population live, lack proper water and sewerage
systems. The H5N1 virus remains difficult for humans to catch but has infected
174 people since 2003, killing 94, according to latest figures from the WHO.
Experts fear it will mutate into a form that spreads easily among people.
