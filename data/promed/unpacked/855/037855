https://www.westword.com/news/second-chicken-pox-outbreak-at-aurora-immigrant-detention-center-puts-two-pods-in-quarantine-11210867


There has been another chicken pox [varicella] outbreak at the immigrant detention center in Aurora, the 2nd in just 3 months. A detainee "pod," which is a prison housing unit consisting of individual cells, was quarantined for weeks after an outbreak in October [2018].

Now 2 pods have been quarantined for 21 days because of the virus, said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez in an e-mail. Paez did not answer additional questions about why a 2nd outbreak had occurred, or what the facility, which is managed by private prison company GEO Group through a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was doing to prevent future outbreaks.

But today, 31 Jan 2019, I [article author Chris Walker] met a detainee at the facility who described what it was like being under quarantine during last fall's outbreak. From behind a glass partition in the center's visitor room, [MA], age 34 years, described how guards one day told his pod, which housed 77 detainees, that they couldn't leave their housing unit, offering no explanation. "We had no idea what was going on," [MA] recalls. "Guards just told us that we had to wait."

They wound up waiting for a few days, during which they couldn't access the recreation yard, see visitors, consult face-to-face with lawyers, or even attend their immigration hearings. About a week in, the detainees finally learned that they were under a medical quarantine because of a possible chicken pox outbreak, [MA] says. The potentially sick individuals had been removed from the housing unit before it was locked down. And weeks into the quarantine, a doctor still had not visited the pod. Exasperated, [MA] and about 60 other detainees wrote letters to ICE and the GEO Group demanding answers -- and to see a doctor.

Here's the letter:

"It has been 2 weeks now that we have been in quarantine and not one doctor has been sent to this pod to offer medical treatment for the chicken pox. The first 3 people that were infected have been treated, cured and were switched over to a different pod, and are now living their normal process. But we have no visits, deportations, and our court [hearings] are being delayed.

"They won't exchange our blankets, give haircuts, and we are prohibited from having rec time in the yard. We are being exposed to dangerous medical conditions living like this, causing depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and conditions that could be fatal.

"The most difficult part is the court dates being rescheduled. Many of us have already had chicken pox or been vaccinated. Our immigration process is being delayed because this outbreak wasn't properly handled from the start, and it's not fair. It feels like medical resources don't want to be used on us because we don't deserve it. We are all in desperate need of help."

A doctor finally visited the pod, dressed in a full-body hazmat suit "looking like an astronaut," says [MA].

Some of the information that [MA] provided about the October 2018 outbreak (at least the number of individuals who were quarantined) runs counter to what ICE had told media outlets, including Westword, at the time. "Of the 77 detainees who were tested, medical staff diagnosed 3 detainees with varicella; 7 others had low immunity and therefore possessed increased risk factors of contracting the disease; all 10 were quarantined at the facility," spokesman Carl Rusnok said in a statement. "The Aurora medical staff continues to provide high-level care to all those affected, while at the same time continuing to serve the medical needs of the entire facility population."

Multiple requests for comment sent to ICE about the 2nd outbreak haven't been returned; if and when they are, we'll update this story.

[This situation is unacceptable and entirely preventable. Why were all residents not vaccinated during the outbreak in October 2018? The incubation period is 10 to 21 days. Will they be released from quarantine after this time period? Disease spreads easily when people are housed in overcrowded tight quarters, such as the situation at these detention centers. Many people who cross the border already need treatment for diseases (like chickenpox, tuberculosis), and sanitation is a big problem. These pathogens are highly transmissible. Vaccines need to be administered, and more individual medical attention is needed to prevent exposure of the group to an infectious individual.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security agency that operates detention centers, states on its website that:
1. Residents will have access to health care education and maintenance services that are determined by the health care authority to be necessary and appropriate. Services will include prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of medical, dental, and mental health conditions.
2. Newly admitted residents will be informed how to access health services, in a language they can understand.
3. Residents will be able to initiate requests for health services.
4. Residents will have access to the care determined necessary by the health care authority from a resident's admission to the residential facility until they are discharged from treatment, transferred to another facility, or removed from the US. When indicated, care shall include referral to community-based providers (https://www.ice.gov/detention-standards/family-residential). - Mod.LK

Vermont Technical College warned members of its community of one confirmed case of chickenpox in a student on its Randolph campus on Wednesday [30 Jan 2019].

The disease, known for its blister-like rash, is very contagious, so the college -- which in Randolph has about 400 residential students and about 700 students in total -- is urging members of its campus community to be diligent about handwashing, said Amanda Chaulk, the college's director of marketing and communications.

She said she hopes that those who are at greater risk, such as those with compromised immune systems or those who are pregnant, take note of this information. "They may elect to not return to campus for a period of time," Chaulk said.

While complications from chickenpox can occur, most healthy people who get the disease will recover in 5 to 7 days, Ben Truman, spokesman for the Vermont Department of Health, wrote in an e-mail. In addition to the rash, common symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and headache.

Most people are immune to chickenpox due to previous childhood vaccination or history of disease, Truman said. But college officials will review students' immunization records and contact those who might be at risk, according to a health alert on the college's website.
