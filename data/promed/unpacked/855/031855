Sudan on Saturday [10 Nov 2007] denied there were any confirmed cases
of Rift Valley Fever [RVF] in animals, after almost 250 human cases
were recorded, with a death rate of about 30 percent.

The disease could devastate livestock in the country, where much of
the population relies heavily on cattle farming. But Sudan's minister
for animal resources said there were no clinical signs of the virus.

"An investigation team conducted an epidemiological investigation and
surveillance and did not come across any clinical symptoms to
indicate an epidemic of RVF disease," minister Gutluak Deng told reporters.

Clinical signs usually show a high rate of abortions or deaths of
young lambs. In animals other than sheep, however, the disease often
shows no symptoms, according to the World Organisation for Animal
Health [OIE; see item 2 further, and commentary].

The minister said 329 samples had been taken from the suspected
infected area in White Nile state and had been sent to South Africa
for final tests. Results were expected in the next week.

In humans, at least 84 have died from almost 250 cases showing
haemorrhagic fevers in the White Nile, Sennar and Jazeera states.

The death rates in haemorrhagic cases, where patients bleed from the
nose and ears and have bloody faeces and urine, can be as high as 50
percent, the World Health Organisation [WHO] says.

Journalists chided the ministers of health and animal resources for
waiting too long to confirm that the outbreak was Rift Valley Fever.

WHO had said in mid-October 2007 it was investigating an epidemic of
haemorrhagic fever which had killed 30 people in Sudan and had
confirmed it as Rift Valley Fever on 2 Nov 2007.

The virus is transmitted by animals or mosquitoes to humans. There is
no human to human transmission.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) monitors the situation
caused by Rift Valley Fever outbreaks, which occurred over the last
few weeks in Africa, particularly in Sudan.

The OIE recalls the importance of the use of vaccination of
susceptible animals as a control measure. This recommendation of the
OIE has been recently re-endorsed by the OIE national Delegates of
Africa and Middle East during the workshop on RVF held in Cairo
(Egypt) on 13-15 Jun 2007.

Animal vaccination and, when possible, vector control need to be
applied well in advance of expected risk periods for vector activity
and occurrence of the disease.

Outbreaks of RVF have a significant impact on the trade of ruminants,
especially from the Horn of Africa to the Middle East, with a
consequent significant loss of income for livestock owners in the
affected areas and countries. By recommending the correct
implementation of standards and guidelines, the OIE stands for safe
trade and against unjustified sanitary barriers.

Should countries at risk make the request, the OIE would be in favour
of an appropriate animal vaccination campaign to be carried out in
areas at risk with the support of the international community.

[The media-derived statement that "the disease often shows no
symptoms, according to the OIE" is unfounded; see the following from
OIE's disease card on RVF:

Clinical diagnosis
------------------
1. Cattle
Calves: fever (40-41 C), depression. Mortality rate: 10-70 percent
Adults: fever (40-41 C), excessive salivation, anorexia, weakness,
fetid diarrhoea, fall in milk yield. Abortion may reach 85 percent in
the herd. Mortality rate is usually less than 10 percent

2. Sheep, goats and pigs
Lambs: fever (40-42 C), anorexia, weakness, death within 36 hours
after inoculation. Mortality rate: for animals under one week of age
- up to 90 percent; for animals over one week of age - up to 20 percent.

Adults: fever (40-41 C), mucopurulent nasal discharge, vomiting; in
pregnant ewes, abortion may reach 100 percent and mortality may reach
20-30 percent.

In-apparent infections are quite frequent in other species than sheep.

Lesions
-------
-Focal or generalised hepatic necrosis (white necrotic foci of about
one mm in diameter)

-Congestion, enlargement, and discoloration of liver with subcapsular
haemorrhages

-Brown-yellowish colour of liver in aborted fetuses

-Widespread cutaneous haemorrhages, petechial to ecchymotic
haemorrhages on parietal and visceral serosal membranes

-Enlargement, oedema, haemorrhages and necrosis of lymph nodes

-Congestion and cortical haemorrhages of kidneys and gallbladder

-Haemorrhagic enteritis

-Icterus (low percentage)

Differential diagnosis
----------------------
Bluetongue
Wesselsbron disease
Enterotoxemia of sheep
Ephemeral fever
Brucellosis
Vibriosis
Trichomonosis
Nairobi sheep disease
Heartwater
Ovine enzootic abortion
Toxic plants
Bacterial septicaemias
Rinderpest and Peste des petits ruminants

Intensified clinical surveillance and sampling in Sudan may expose
the missing link: disease in animals. Enhanced alertness in Sudan's
neighbour countries, including Egypt, should be undertaken
immediately. The need is further underlined by the approaching
regional ritual events, which include mass slaughter of domestic
ruminants, predominantly sheep, namely the Eid el Adha. - Mod.AS]
