Outbreak of mumps in Whistler
-----------------------------
With 15 lab confirmed cases of mumps in Whistler, British Columbia,
Canada, so far, Coastal Health is warning young people about the
virus.

Mumps is most commonly transmitted by saliva. It typically starts
with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite,
and is followed by swelling of salivary glands. There is no specific
treatment.

Medical Health officer Doctor Paul Martiquet says it's best not to
share anything your mouth has touched, like utensils or water bottles.
"This is the type of behaviour that allows mumps to be spread, and
that is what we're seeing happening in Whistler."

He says ultimately immunization is your best defence. Nurses will be
giving out free mumps shots this weekend at the Telus World Ski and
Snowboard Festival in Whistler [15-24 Apr 2011]. If you are just
visiting or live in the area, you are eligible to receive the free
vaccine. You can also get your booster shot by calling the Whistler
Health Care Centre at 604-932-3202 to arrange an appointment.

[The incubation period for mumps virus infection can range from 12-25
days (commonly 14-18 days). Most mumps virus transmission is thought
to occur before the salivary glands begin to swell and for up to 5
days after the swelling commences. Consequently persons intending to
participate in the Telus World Ski and Snowboard Festival should
review their vaccination status and if in doubt should consider taking
advantage of the offer of free vaccination.
