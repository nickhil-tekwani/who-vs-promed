[In Israel, all transportations of farm animals, for breeding or for
slaughter purposes, are liable to written permits issued by the
District Veterinary Offices. Cattle in Israel are officially eartagged
and have official, personal identity certificates. In case of
suspected or confirmed outbreaks of infectious disease, permits are
withdrawn/suspended.

Since no information has, so far, been provided on the animal
population and serotype involved, this outbreak deserves to be
regarded as suspected at this point in time. Cattle, sheep and goats
are known to be kept in the named village.

Tuba-Zangaria is composed of 2 twin Bedouin villages, Tuba (the
bigger one) and Zangariya, on the eastern part of Hazafon (North)
province of Israel; see map at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Tuba.html. This village has
suffered FMD outbreaks several times in the past, mainly following
breaches of animal movement restrictions. In 1982, the local cattle
herd was infected by rinderpest, originating in Lebanon, due to
illegal transportation of livestock.

Official final confirmation of the above outbreak, and - if confirmed
- details of the affected population and its vaccination status as
well as results of the serotyping, are anticipated.

About 70 percent of primary outbreaks of FMD in Israel are seen in
areas adjacent to the northern frontiers, bordering Lebanon and
Syria.

Israel has notified the OIE, since March 2011, on 3 outbreaks of FMD
serotype O in Hazafon province; see, with maps, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345
and
