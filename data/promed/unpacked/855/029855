Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Mon 6 Oct 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following figures are reproduced from the Resumen Epidemiologica
accompanying the Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 481 individuals resident in 20 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 477 were
seronegative and asymptomatic and 4 were classified as West Nile
virus-positive: 3 in the state of Chihuahua and one (confirmed by RT-PCR)
in the state of Sonora. [West Nile virus-positive cases were not reported
among the 452 individuals tested in the data reproduced in the previous
ProMED-mail update dated 24 Sep 2003. - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 4472 horses from 20 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals
1453 were seropositive and 3018 seronegative. All these animals were
asymptomatic. In addition one animal in the state of Nuevo Leon, which had
the 2nd highest incidence of seropositive animals, was symptomatic and
died. [The number of fatal cases is unchanged since 24 Sep 2003. - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Mon 6 Oct 2003, a total of 17 168 birds from 8 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 63
were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic) and 17 103 were
seronegative. In addition 2 dead birds were seropositive. [The number of
West Nile virus-positive birds is unchanged since 24 Sep 2003. N.B. The
total for seronegative birds given in the original table is incorrect in
that it omits data for the state of Chihuahua. - Mod.CP]

[These new data report the 1st West Nile virus-positive human cases in
Mexico. Overall the data are strikingly different from those recorded in
North America with regard to the lower incidence of disease and mortality
in Mexico in the case of animals that have tested seropositive for West
Nile virus infection. As commented previously, this situation raises
questions about the possible existence of cross-reactivity as a consequence
of infection with other related flaviviruses, both in terms of conferring
protection and generating false positivity. Further information is awaited
with interest. - Mod.CP]
