There's a pertussis outbreak in Jefferson County. Public health officials say there have been 23 confirmed cases of the disease [pertussis], also known as whooping cough, since 1 Jun [2019]. People who caught the disease range in age from 5 months to 15 years.

Officials say older children, adults, people who've been vaccinated, and those who've had whooping cough before may experience a milder illness but can still spread it to others.

Whooping cough is spread by coughing or sneezing, or coming in direct contact with respiratory secretions of people who are infected, health officials say. The most common symptom is uncontrollable coughing spells often followed by a characteristic "whoop" sound. An infected person can spread the disease starting when symptoms begin to 3 weeks after the coughing begins. Coughing frequently lasts for several weeks. County Public Health Director Ginger Hall says pertussis is highly communicable and can be prevented by the vaccine known as Tdap, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.

Whooping cough can be deadly for babies and tough on adults, too. In Kentucky, there have been 8 confirmed cases this year [2019].

Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a rise in cases in Kentucky and a decrease in vaccinations. The latest CDC data show that from 2017 to 2018, the number of Tdap vaccinations decreased by 1.4%. The number of cases of whooping cough increased to more than 10 cases per 100 000 people.

Knight [a nurse at the Purchase District Health Department] said the lack of vaccines for adults and a false sense of security [are] contributing to this increase. "If your child was the one that couldn't have the immunization, you would want everyone else around them to have it," Knight said. "And to keep them in mind that you're doing it for your child, because you don't want them to get this disease."

A whooping cough outbreak has prompted the closure of a private high school in Reno [Nevada] until next week. The Washoe County Health District says it has confirmed 4 cases of whooping cough at Bishop Manogue High School. Additional cases are probable.

District officials say the Catholic school is cooperating with an investigation into the highly contagious respiratory disease and agreed to close the school until Monday [28 Oct 2019] to protect students and staff.

District Health officer Kevin Dick said late Monday [21 Oct 2019] that the outbreak is "very serious." He says it underscores why all students are required to be vaccinated for the disease, which is called "pertussis" and is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe.

Washoe County School District officials say no other cases have been confirmed at any other schools in the Reno-Sparks area.

Sullivan County Public Health Services confirmed that 3 cases of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- have been identified in children of varying ages in the county this week.

Public Health Director Nancy McGraw called this an important advisory. "As recently as 2016, Sullivan County had a pertussis outbreak of nearly 30 cases, and dozens of additional probable cases were investigated, interviewed, and individuals treated," she said.

McGraw said that if you or your child has been around someone with pertussis, you may become sick with it, especially if you or your child has not received all of the pertussis vaccine shots. Sometimes, even if your shots are up to date, you may still get pertussis.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] has confirmed over a dozen new cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in a number of regions, including Lethbridge, Letbridge County, and Raymond.

Officials say 15 new cases of the illness have been discovered in the past 2 weeks, bringing the total number of confirmed illnesses to 42 for the whole year [2019]. There is a particular concern about the newest cases, AHS told the media on Wednesday [16 Oct 2019].

"They are locally acquired," said Dr. Vivien Suttorp, Medical Officer of Health, South Zone, "Whooping cough, as I mentioned before, is underreported. There's a spectrum of illness. Little kiddies and infants have the most severe disease, and adults might just have a milder cough or chronic cough, but they are infectious to others."

As a result, special restrictions are in place for visitors to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Chinook Regional Hospital as well as the labour and delivery, pediatrics, and maternity units. Under these rules, those under the age of 16 will not be permitted, and there will be only 2 visitors per patient allowed. Anyone with symptoms such as a cough or runny nose are reminded not to visit.

According to AHS, an outbreak is called when 2 or more cases of illness are identified that have a common epidemiological link, such as same location, unit, floor, caregiver or transmission within the unit of the facility.

There were 58 cases of pertussis in the South Zone last year [2018].
