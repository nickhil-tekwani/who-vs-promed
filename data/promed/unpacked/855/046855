Anthrax Found in Bay Area Cattle
-------------------------------------------
There's been an anthrax outbreak at a Santa Clara ranch. Health
officials say 21 cattle have died from anthrax infections since
October 20th. Another 120 have been vaccinated. Anthrax occurs
naturally in the ground in California, and experts say there's no
reason to believe this outbreak is related to terrorist attacks.
"At this time we believe that this is a naturally-occurring incidence
of anthrax that comes from the soil," said Santa Clara County
Agriculture Commissioner Greg Van Wassenhove. "Traditionally and
historically, anthrax has been prevalent in California. It's not a
common occurrence, but it's not uncommon, as well."
The dead cattle have been buried. Officials say only people who came
in direct contact with the animals are at risk of infection, and those
people have been given antibiotics.

[ItÂ´s a pity they buried the carcasses. They would have been much,
much wiser to have burned them. Burying carcasses only prolongs the
ground contamination. It is about 10 years since the last outbreak in
California, which was in the same general part of the state. -

Fifteen people who came in contact with cows that died of anthrax in
Santa Clara County have been treated with antibiotics as a
precautionary measure, the California Department of Food and
Agriculture said yesterday. Twenty beef cattle died at a ranch 5 miles
south of Morgan Hill between 20-26 Oct 2001.
The disease was misdiagnosed by a private veterinarian first summoned
to the ranch, and he performed 2 necropsies at the scene -- an
ill-advised practice when dealing with anthrax, because it brings
people into direct contact with diseased tissue, experts say.
The veterinarian, 2 owners of the livestock, 2 ranch hands and 10
workers at the laboratory to which samples of the dead animals' tissue
were sent were all treated with the antibiotic Cipro as a
precautionary measure. The lab workers were treated by campus
physicians at the University of California at Davis. None has shown
any symptoms of anthrax.
The incident "does not pose a threat to the general public," said
Santa Clara County health officer Dr. Martin Fenstersheib. "The only
people at risk are those coming into direct contact with the blood,
tissue or other body fluids of infected animals." The remaining 120
cattle in the herd have been vaccinated against anthrax and
quarantined for 60 days.
Anthrax spores, which can lie dormant in the soil for half a century
or more, are widespread in California's rangeland. The pastures where
the afflicted cattle were grazing were dry, and the grass was sparse.
Animals that "graze closer to the ground . . . may be more likely to
ingest spores," the Department of Food and Agriculture said in a
statement.
Before these deaths, California had just 10 reported cases in the past
decade. In 1991, anthrax killed 28 cattle in Contra Costa County. In
1984, 43 cattle and 135 sheep died of anthrax in San Luis Obispo
County.
