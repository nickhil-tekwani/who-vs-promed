Confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia nearly tripled in 2013 over the previous year. The dramatic hike in numbers was not unexpected, said provincial Health and Wellness Department officials. The number of cases, including probable ones, in 2013 was 155, department spokesman Tony Kiritsis said recently. In 2012, the number of cases was 52, and in 2011, it was 57.

"There could be a lot of factors, but we do know that there's been a lot more interest in Lyme, a lot more education out there," Kiritsis said. Since 2002, the number of Lyme disease cases in this province has totalled 329. Dee Mombourquette, communicable diseases coordinator with the Health and Wellness Department, also said her department expected the increase. "We know that people are much more aware of Lyme disease now. More (people) every year." People recognize symptoms and seek health-care advice sooner, she said. The 1st Lyme Disease Awareness Month began [1 May 2014] in Nova Scotia.

Climate studies have shown that Nova Scotia's environment is suitable for tick establishment across the entire province. "We've seen that ticks have arrived, and they like it here," Mombourquette said. "The climate is certainly conducive to them increasing in numbers."

Six endemic areas listed by the department include Yarmouth, Shelburne, Queens, Lunenburg, Halifax, and Pictou counties. The Queens County zone was proclaimed in 2012. "We do anticipate that those areas will increase, but we don't have any new (endemic) areas yet," said Mombourquette.

A total of 64 percent of reported Lyme disease cases have been from males. It is not that ticks prefer men. Ticks are opportunistic parasites and it seems more men and boys are in the woods, for work or recreation, than females.

Ticks are active when temperatures rise above 4 deg C [39.2 deg F], but Lyme disease can show up at any time of the year. The Lyme disease-carrying blacklegged ticks are very small. "We do know that blacklegged _Ixodes_ ticks can carry 2 or 3 other [organisms (the rickettsia-like bacterium _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and the protozoan _Babesia microti_)], as well as _Borrelia [burgdorferi_] that causes Lyme disease," said Mombourquette.

Donna Lugar of the Nova Scotia Lyme Disease Support Group has the disease. "I was diagnosed with 3 different tick-borne diseases in the summer of 2011," Lugar said recently from her Bedford home. The diagnosis came after many years of symptoms, she said. "I live in an endemic area. I've travelled to endemic areas." Fever, flu-like symptoms, and a bull's-eye rash are symptoms.

Ticks move around on a person's body, often ending up in a warm or moist area. Rashes may appear several days to a month after contact and may disappear and return, Lugar said. The Nova Scotia government could do a better job of informing people about tick activity, she said. "Certainly the things that have happened in the last couple of years are really a result of a lot of screaming by those of us in the Lyme (disease) community," she said about attracting more publicity to tick-related illnesses. She said a Health and Wellness Department information brochure is often hard to locate. "It isn't anywhere. You have to almost specifically request it," said Lugar, who began the support group this year [2014].

The government knows public awareness is important. "I think we're getting better and better at it every year," said Mombourquette. She said having Lyme Disease Awareness Month for the 1st time is an important step. Blacklegged ticks must be attached to the skin for at least 24 hours before they can transmit disease, said a Health and Wellness Department fact sheet and news release. Wearing light-coloured clothing to better see ticks and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts are advised. Clothing sprayed with insect-repellent-containing DEET or Icaridin is also recommended, said the news release. Everyone should check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been near grassy, shrubby, or wooded areas anywhere in the province, said the release.

[This increase in numbers of reported cases of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia, Canada is likely the result of several factors, including enhanced case detection resulting from a greater awareness of Lyme disease and improved reporting, as well as a true increase in disease incidence.

Factors that account for a true increase in disease incidence include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease; and nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in northeastern US and southeastern Canada. - Mod.ML
