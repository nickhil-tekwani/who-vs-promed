Ever since opening its 1st branch in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district in February 2015, Cat Cafe Mocha has become a hugely successful business for Japan's KI Corporation, expanding quickly throughout Japan with outlets in some of the city's most popular areas and also further abroad in locations like Osaka and Nagoya, all in its 1st 2 years.

According to a statement released by KI Corporation on 2 Aug 2018, 2 cats at their Tachikawa branch were taken to a veterinary specialist late at night on 26 Jul 2018 after showing signs of illness. Tests revealed positive results for the feline parvovirus infection, and following this diagnosis, other cats also tested positive on 27 and 28 Jul 2018, with 5 cats in total passing away from the illness by 1 Aug 2018.

The feline parvovirus is highly contagious and spread through infected feces, blood, urine, or fleas from an infected cat. The virus causes a decrease in the cat's white blood cells, resulting in a high mortality rate, especially when found in young cats, with symptoms including fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody stools. The virus cannot be spread from cats to humans.

The head of the company says that once the infections came to light they set up a special response team, putting the remaining cats into quarantine, consulting veterinary specialists, and sanitising the cafe to help stop the disease from spreading further. However, after discussions with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, the company decided to enforce a temporary closure of the cat cafe, in order to ensure the disease was thoroughly eliminated through proper sanitation and checks by officials.

To alleviate the concerns of customers, the company also decided to temporarily close all its branches in the Kanto region (in this case, Tokyo, Saitama and Kanagawa Prefectures) while the cats at these premises underwent tests for parvovirus infection.

According to the official statement released by KI Corporation, all Cat Cafe Mocha stores had worked to keep their cats free from the feline parvovirus with a round of 2 vaccinations for animals between the ages of 2-4 months, followed by a vaccination every year afterwards. However, they will now give 3 sets of vaccinations to all cats under the age of one in order to ensure the health and wellbeing of their animals.

The company has issued a formal apology over the incident, saying, "We deeply regret our mistake in judgement to continue operating and not close the store promptly for thorough sanitation after 2 cats were found to be infected." From now on, they say they will close stores immediately if any cases of feline parvovirus are found.

While it appears that Cat Cafe Mocha's other Tokyo locations have now reopened, their Tachikawa branch remains closed until further notice. Once the premises are thoroughly cleaned, they will need to pass a host of checks by Tokyo's Social Welfare and Public Health Bureau to ensure their cats, and shared equipment like bedding and feeding bowls, are virus-free.

[The following commentary by Mod.TG (from 20170908.5302524) is applicable:

"Feline panleukopenia (FP) is a highly contagious viral disease of cats caused by the feline parvovirus. Kittens are most severely affected by the virus.

"FP virus is everywhere in the environment, and virtually all kittens and cats are exposed to the virus at some point in their lives. While cats of any age may be infected with the feline parvovirus that causes FP, young kittens, sick cats, and unvaccinated cats are most susceptible. It is most commonly seen in cats 3-5 months of age; death from FP is more common at this age."

Cats can shed the virus in their urine, stool, and nasal secretions; infection occurs when susceptible cats come in contact with these secretions, or even the fleas from infected cats. An infected cat tends to shed the virus for a relatively short period of time (1-2 days), but the virus can survive for up to a year in the environment, so cats may become infected without ever coming into direct contact with an infected cat. Bedding, cages, food dishes, and the hands or clothing of people who handle the infected cat may harbor the virus and transmit it to other cats. It is, therefore, very important to isolate infected cats. Any materials used on or for infected cats should not be used or allowed to come in contact with other cats, and people handling infected cats should practice proper hygiene to prevent spreading the infection.

The virus that causes FP is difficult to destroy and resistant to many disinfectants. Ideally, unvaccinated cats should not be allowed into an area where an infected cat has been -- even if the area has been disinfected.

The signs of FP can vary and may be similar to other illnesses such as _Salmonella_ or _Campylobacter_ infection, pancreatitis, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection, or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. Infected cats may even show signs that resemble those seen when a cat has been poisoned or has swallowed a foreign object.

The likelihood of recovery from FP for infected kittens less than 8 weeks old is poor. Older cats have a greater chance of survival if adequate treatment is provided early. Since there are no medications capable of killing the virus, intensive care and treatment are critical to support the cat's health with medications and fluids until its own body and immune system can fight off the virus. Without such supportive care, up to 90 percent of cats with FP may die.

Treatment focuses on correcting dehydration, providing nutrients, and preventing secondary infection. Although antibiotics do not kill the virus, they are often necessary because infected cats are at a higher risk of bacterial infections because their immune systems are not fully functioning (due to the decreased white blood cells) and because bacteria from the damaged gut may enter the cat's bloodstream and cause infection.

Cats that survive an infection develop immunity that likely protects them for the rest of their lives. Mild cases that go unnoticed will also produce immunity from future infection.

It is also possible for kittens to receive temporary immunity through the transfer of antibodies in the colostrum, the 1st milk produced by the mother. This is called passive immunity, and how long it protects the kittens from infection depends upon the levels of protective antibodies produced by the mother. It rarely lasts longer than 12 weeks.

Prevention is vital to your cat's health. Today, there are vaccines that offer the best protection from feline parvovirus infection. Vaccination is equally important for strictly indoor cats as well as indoor/outdoor cats because the virus is everywhere in the environment. Most young kittens receive their 1st vaccination at approximately 6 weeks old and follow-up vaccines are given until the kitten is around 16 weeks old. Adult vaccination schedules vary with the age and health of the cat, as well as the risk of FP in the area. Consult your veterinarian for advice on an appropriate vaccination schedule for your cat(s).

The disease is also called feline distemper or feline parvo.

In the past, feline panleukopenia (FP) was a leading cause of death in cats. Today, it is an uncommon disease, due in large part to the availability and use of very effective vaccines" [extracted from https://www.avma.org/public/petcare/pages/Feline-Panleukopenia.aspx].

The reason for the appearance of clinical feline panleukopenia virus with mortality on the premises of the Tachikawa branch of Cat Cafe Mocha, in spite of vaccination having allegedly been properly applied, is yet to be clarified. - Mod.AS
