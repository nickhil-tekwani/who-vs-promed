Epidemiological comments: on 22 Oct 2007 a farmer brought to a
District Veterinary Office a 2-year-old ewe with redness on the
tongue, lesions on the lips, and lameness. Samples were taken on 23
Oct 2007 from animals of the farm and were sent to the State
Veterinary Laboratories with the suspicion of bluetongue. Test for
bluetongue was carried out but was negative. The samples were then
examined for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). 8 samples out of 25 were
positive in the NSP ELISA [non-structural protein enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay] carried out in Cyprus. Samples were forwarded to
the OIE Reference Laboratory at Pirbright. Probang samples were also
sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory. All results of the tests
carried out at the OIE Reference Laboratory on samples of the 1st
suspicion were negative. Sampling continued on flocks in a 1
km-radius (0.6 mi) zone around the 1st suspicion. A total of 3 other
flocks were found positive in the NSP ELISA at the National Reference
Laboratory. Samples from these flocks were sent to the OIE Reference
Laboratory on 1 Nov 2007. On 5 November 2007, the OIE Reference
Laboratory communicated the final results, which confirmed the
presence of FMD virus serotype O. Protection and surveillance zones
were established.

[Here is the full official confirmation of FMD in Cyprus mentioned in
20071108.3628. We regret the delay that occurred when this posting
took a wrong turn in cyberspace.

A map of the outbreak location on the Southern coast of the island is
available at the OIE WAHID referenced above and a map of Cyprus is available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/cyprus.gif>

It is very good to have an extensive epidemiologic comment on the
sampling procedures and results that have occurred over time. We have
information from reliable sources indicating differing results of
tests since this outbreak was 1st reported. It is good to obtain the
definitive result and an explanation.

It appears as if more farms than the index case were involved since
it is from these farms that definitive positive sample was taken. In
any case, FMD moves so fast, it is definitely possible to have more
cases. - Mod.PC]
