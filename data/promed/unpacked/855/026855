10 Oct 2006: communication No. 8 -- Ministry of Health/Social Security
------------------------------------------------
In order to keep the community informed on the advances made in the
investigations into the causes of the renal insufficiency and neurologic
deficits syndrome, the Ministry of Health and the Social Security Agency,
with the intention to preserve public health, announce:
Tests conducted to date:
- more than 30 products, including foods and medications, have been
analyzed in the search into the possible causes of this syndrome and
results thus far have been negative.
- as of today, the US CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention],
have conducted testing for the following [infectious agents] and they have
all been negative: enterovirus, flavivirus, rickettsia, leptospirosis.
- the University of Panama has conducted the following tests, all with
negative results: lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium
- results from some tests conducted in the United States and in Panama are
awaited.
- the field epidemiology group is investigating and making daily detailed
surveys.
- a team of epidemiologists is working 24 hours a day conducting field
visits and case detection.
- today there was a meeting of the clinical commission consisting of the
following specialists: Jorge Motta, Gissel Rodriguez, Aaron Benzadon, Julio
Toro, Rosendo Diaz, Eduardo Reyes, Nestor Sossa, Jaime Arias, Jose Moreno,
Dona de Lee, Luis Bravo, Walter Valverde, Jose Manzanares, Ricardo Medina,
Diego Rey, Xavier Saenz Llorens y Enrique Mendoza. The specialists
mentioned have been involved in the analysis of cases and clinical
correlations.
- the total number of patients remains 31. Of these, 28 are from the Social
Security Health System (CSS), 3 are from the Santo Tomas hospital, 4 are
ambulatory, 4 are in the intensive care units and 2 are in [the
convalescent unit].
- unfortunately today one of the patients admitted to the intensive care
unit of the Social Security Hospital Complex died, raising the total number
of deaths [attributed to this syndrome] to 21.
- there are 7 suspected cases under investigation, 6 from the Social
Security Health System and one in the Santo Tomas Hospital.
We reiterate:
- abstain from taking the medication Lisinopril Normon as a preventive
measure and provisionally until health authorities determine otherwise.
- those patients who have these medications can exchange them at the
designated Health Centers and PolyClinics.
- people with the following symptoms: vomiting, fever, diarrhea, decrease
in urinary output, or generalized weakness should go to the nearest health
center, polyclinic, or hospital.
- do not self medicate and use only those medicines prescribed by the
[health care system.]
- remember the hotline numbers: 800-5500, 512-9607, 512-9609, 229-5703.
The Commissioners:

We reiterate to the population that the investigations to determine the
causes of this syndrome are continuing and are being carried out with the

Control and Prevention of Atlanta, USA, and the specialized institute of
Analysis of the University of Panama.

[This latest update provides more information on the possible causes of the
clinical syndrome that have been ruled out thus far. The government is
still standing by the recall of the lisinopril produced by Normon. It would
be of interest to know more results of the epidemiologic studies that
pointed to this product. An earlier posting said that 5 of 9 who had died
had used this drug, and also that the syndrome was first noted after the
release of this product on the market (this product was newly released in
the Panamanian market in August 2006]. We await further information from
knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
