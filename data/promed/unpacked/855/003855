A Severe Outbreak of Ascochyta Blight of Chickpeas in Western Nebraska.
----------------------------------------------------
R. M. Harveson, University of Nebraska, Panhandle Research and Extension
Center, Scottsbluff 69361. Plant Dis. 86:698, 2002; published on-line as
D-2002-0412-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 11 Mar 2002.
Interest in chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_ L.) production as an alternative
crop to sugar beets and dry beans has rapidly increased in the Nebraska
Panhandle. Production (concentrated near Alliance in Box Butte County) has
increased from 80 ha in 1999 and 800 ha in 2000, to almost 4000 ha in 2001.
In mid-July 2001, symptoms in fields consisted of circular, dark brown
lesions (0.5 to 1.0 cm) on leaves and pods containing pycnidia (225 to 240
micrometers) arranged in concentric rings. Symptom appearance followed
unusually high rainfall events (over 25 cm the previous week), and the
epidemic affected virtually all chickpeas planted in the area.
Infected leaves incubated in humidity chambers in the laboratory produced
nonseptate, hyaline, oval to oblong conidia measuring 8.5 to 10.0 x 4.0 to
4.5 micrometers that oozed out of pycnidia in a mucilaginous mass. Based on
symptoms and fungal morphology (1), the pathogen was identified as
_Ascochyta rabiei_ (Pass.) Labr.
Because of the seedborne nature of the disease, pathogen identity was
further verified by planting seeds from infected pods in the greenhouse.
Emerging plants exhibited similar symptoms to those from field infections,
and the pathogen was identified from newly developed lesions.
A section 18 emergency exemption was obtained for the use of the fungicide
Quadris (azoxystrobin) on 2400 to 2800 ha in Nebraska. This measure averted
serious losses, but 15 to 20 [percent] reductions in yield and quality were
still recorded from treated fields. Infected plants collected from
untreated fields had almost 60 [percent] losses in both pod number and
total seed weight compared with uninfected plants.
Ascochtya blight disease occurrence in the Western Hemisphere was first
reported from Canada in 1974, followed by other chickpea-growing states in
the United States, including California, Washington, Idaho, and North
Dakota (2-4).
To my knowledge, this is the first report of the disease in Nebraska, and
its presence poses a significant threat to the developing chickpea industry
in the state, as the planted area is expected to increase in the
foreseeable future.

[Ascochyta blight of chickpea causes the greatest damage of any disease in
chickpea worldwide. The outbreak of ascochyta blight in Nebraska indicates
that the disease continues to spread into new chickpea production areas in
the United States. The disease is also common in chickpea in western Canada.
