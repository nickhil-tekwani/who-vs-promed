[The last known case of anthrax in Botosani County was in 2018. This disease is sporadic in Romania, but it is heartening that the report to WOAH was so prompt. One can hope that the vaccination of this herd and nearby herds is equally prompt.

As is unfortunate with many WOAH formal reports, the cause of this and other Romanian outbreaks remains obscure. It is hoped there is ongoing investigation in-country with results that may be reported in due course. There is probably a background of unreported, unexpected livestock deaths that go unreported and uninvestigated. The ecology of Romanian soil is prime for anthrax spore survival.
