[This new event of FMD serotype O in Tunisia is likely related to the FMDV-O event that is currently affecting Algeria. See ProMED-mail posting 20181018.6098031 and WRLFMD Quarterly Report July to Sep 2018 http://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20Jul-Sep%202018.pdf.

According to information available from the OIE, the event in Algeria continues. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=27085.

Genotyping this type O virus circulating in Tunisia would be of value to determine if it is related to the current outbreaks occurring in the area. - Mod.CRD
