2000/167 _Synchytrium endobioticum_ found on Prince Edward Island, Canada
[edited
---------------------------------------------
_Synchytrium endobioticum_ (causing potato wart disease - EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was found in one farm on Prince Edward Island, Canada. [To
date, the disease [occurred only in Newfoundland and Labrador, where
phytosanitary measures have been applied since 1912. The presence of _S.
endobioticum_ in a single field in the New Annan area was confirmed in Oct
2000. The disease appears to be confined to 0.4 ha in a corner of a 24 ha
field. Measures [were immediately [taken to prevent further spread. To
determine the extent of the disease, 400 soil samples are being analyzed
from the infested field and surrounding fields. [At present, the
situation of _S. endobioticum_ on Prince Edward Island can be described as:
Present, only in one field.
