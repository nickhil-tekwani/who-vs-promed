Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus - update 29 May 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has notified WHO of an additional 5 laboratory-confirmed cases with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

All 5 patients are from the Eastern region of the country, but not from Al-Ahsa, where an outbreak began in a health care facility in April 2013. The patients had underlying medical conditions which required multiple hospital visits. The government is conducting investigations into the likely source of infection in both the health care and the community settings.

The 1st patient is a 56 year old man with underlying medical conditions, who became ill on 12 May 2013 and died on 20 May 2013. The 2nd patient is an 85 year old woman with underling medical conditions who became ill on [17 May 2013] and is currently in critical condition. The 3rd patient is a 76 year old woman with underlying medical conditions who became ill on 24 May 2013 and was discharged from the hospital on 27 May 2013. The 4th patient is a 77 year old man with underlying medical conditions who became ill on [19 May 2013] and died on 26 May 2013. The 5th patient is a 73 year old man with underlying medical conditions who became ill on [18 May 2013] and died on 26 May 2013.

In addition, an 81 year old woman case reported earlier from Al-Ahsa, has died. The government is continuing to investigate the outbreaks in the country.

In France, the 1st laboratory-confirmed case in the country, with recent travel from the United Arab Emirates has died.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 49 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 27 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory confirmed cases; they were either transferred for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[According to the WHO report, the global total of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection is now 49, including 27 deaths. This count includes the 5 new cases, including 3 deaths, reported on the Saudi Ministry of Public Health website on 28 May 2013 (see ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (12): Saudi Arabia, France 20130528.1741836). Of note in the statement above is the mention that these 5 newly reported cases were from a location different from Al-Ahsa in the Eastern Province and may represent a new cluster.

A new case of coronavirus recorded in Al-Ahsa and 3 [deaths] in the Eastern Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that a new Saudi citizen, aged 61 who suffers from kidney failure and other chronic diseases, has been recorded to be infected with coronavirus in the Al-Ahsa Region, bringing the total number of the infected people with this virus to 38 cases.

Furthermore, MOH has announced the death of 3 cases, who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus and admitted to hospital about a month ago. It is noteworthy that all of these cases, ranging in age from 60,58 and 24 years, have chronic kidney failure and other diseases.

[3] Saudi Arabia (Eastern Province): susp. new cluster

Saudis investigating possible 2nd hospital outbreak of MERS cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities in Saudi Arabia are investigating whether there is a new cluster of MERS coronavirus cases linked to a hospital in the eastern part of the country, a separate incident from a previously reported large hospital outbreak there.

A case reported Wednesday [29 May 2013] and 5 reported Tuesday [28 May 2013] may be linked to a hospital, said the country's deputy minister of health, Dr Ziad Memish. He would not reveal the name of the town or the hospital.

Memish suggested there may have been some person-to-person spread among the cases. 3 of these patients have died.

"They're from the same town and from the same hospital," Memish said in an interview with The Canadian Press, adding the investigation into how the people became infected is ongoing.

"We're still working on it. But none of the patients from yesterday [28 May 2013] had any relation to al-Ahsa," he said, referring to the large outbreak linked to the al Moosa hospital in the town of al-Hofuf that began in April [2013] but only came to light in early May [2013].

"They actually live outside of al-Ahsa and they have no family contact in al-Ahsa. And we think that there was a community introduction and there was transmission from that community introduction."

Two of the patients shared a hospital room, he said, adding that it's not clear at this point whether the other patients are linked, and if they are, how.

"These patients came in and out a few times to the facility," Memish said. "So trying to find out who are the RTs (respiratory technicians) who looked after them, who are the nurses, who are the physicians, who took blood from them, is it the same person -- it's a very difficult task. But the team is on it 24-7."

Hospitals played a critical role in amplifying the SARS outbreak in 2003, with unidentified cases infecting other patients, family members, and hospital staff. The World Health Organization has been keeping a close eye on any suggested hospital outbreaks, fearful that the pattern might be repeated with MERS. SARS and MERS are from the same viral family, coronaviruses.

The MERS virus -- the newly coined acronym is short for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome -- 1st came to the world's attention last September [2012], though retrospective testing dates the earliest known cases to a hospital outbreak in Jordan in April 2012.

To date [29 May 2013] there have been 50 confirmed cases, 27 of them fatal. Saudi Arabia has reported 38 of those cases and 18 of the deaths.

Cases have also been reported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar. Infections have also been detected in Germany, France, Britain, and Tunisia, though in all those instances the cases originated from countries in the Arabian Peninsula. In Britain, France, and Tunisia there was limited person-to-person spread from the case that introduced the virus from abroad.

Doctors who treated France's 2 patients warned on Wednesday [29 May 2013] that the incubation period of the new virus may be longer than previously appreciated. WHO currently estimates the incubation period -- the time from exposure to illness at 10 days, though its scientists readily admit that given the paucity of data on cases, that's a 'guesstimate' based on the incubation period of the SARS virus and other viruses. [see Guery B, Poissy J, el Mansouf L, et al, and the MERS-CoV study group. Clinical features and viral diagnosis of two cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a report of nosocomial transmission. Lancet 2013; early online publication 29 May 2013; available at http://download.thelancet.com/flatcontentassets/pdfs/S0140673613609824.pdf.]

The French doctors reported in the journal The Lancet that a man in Northern France who caught the virus from a patient infected on a trip to the UAE may have gone 12 days before developing symptoms. The 2 shared a hospital room for 3 days in late April [2013], before the 1st man was diagnosed with MERS. That man died Tuesday [28 May 2013] from his illness.

The authors suggested doctors who are on the lookout for cases should test people who become ill with MERS-like symptoms within 12 days of travel to countries where the virus is found, or within 12 days of contact with a known case.

Dr Allison McGeer, a Toronto infectious diseases expert, said that fits with what was seen with SARS. Most people who came down with the virus developed symptoms within 10 days of exposure but some had a longer incubation period, she said.

Knowing the incubation period is critical to detecting cases and for trying to stop spread of the disease. During SARS, people who were exposed to known cases had to go into quarantine for 10 days to try to cut chains of transmission. At points in the Toronto outbreak thousands of people were holed up in their homes waiting to see if they would develop the disease.

"The amount of disruption that you cause to people's lives and the amount of work you have to do to identify people who may pose a risk or who may be getting sick is driven entirely by knowing what the incubation period is and when people are infectious," McGeer said.

Dr Anthony Mounts, the WHO's point person for MERS, said the agency will probably look at whether it needs to change its surveillance recommendations to include a lengthier incubation period. "I think we should consider it," he said from Geneva.

"The 10 days that we had in there was really based on expert opinion from experience with other viruses. So I think as more information comes in about this virus, we'll definitely want to revisit that."

Memish said the Saudi Arabian experience suggests the incubation period can be as long as 14.5 days.

The French study also suggested doctors trying to diagnose suspected MERS cases may need to get specimens, like sputum samples. Their 2nd case tested negative when swabs were run along the inside of his nasal passages, a common way to test for respiratory viruses. But lung samples came back positive.

WHO had already advised doctors that if they have a strong suspicion a patient has MERS but nasal swabs come back negative that they should get specimens from the lungs if they can. "The sensitivity out of the upper respiratory specimens looks like it's probably not as high as it is for lower," Mounts said.

In other MERS news, Memish and colleagues from the Saudi ministry of health and several institutions in London reported on a cluster of cases that happened in Saudi Arabia last fall [2012]. 4 members of a large extended family became ill, and 2 died. 3 of the 4 tested positive and the 4th, a teenaged survivor, is considered a probable case.

The report was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. [Memish ZA, Zumla AI, Al-Hakeem RF, Al-Rabeeah AA, Stephens GM. Family cluster of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. 29 May 2013; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1303729#t=articleTop]

There may have been person-to-person spread in this cluster of cases, the authors said. In fact, there may have been 3 generations of spread -- from the initial case, a 70 year old patriarch of this large family to 2 of his sons and a grandson. But because the source of the virus is still not known, they cannot rule out the possibility that all 4 contracted the virus from a source in nature.

The authors did note that the family members hadn't travelled before becoming ill, kept no pets, and had no contact with animals before the illness struck the family. Interestingly 24 other members of this large household did not become ill.

[The newswire above containing information from an interview with the deputy minister of public health mentions the new cluster of cases in another part of the Eastern Province might represent another nosocomial cluster, with cases in the cluster all attending the same healthcare facility (different from the one in Al-Ahsa).

The other important information is that the incubation period may likely be more than 10 days. According to the French experience, the incubation period may have been 12 days, whereas the Saudis have observed incubation periods up to 14.5 days. - Mod.MPP]
