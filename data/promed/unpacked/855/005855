Mexico's agricultural authorities have established a series of actions to prevent the so-called rugose tomato virus from spreading in the country, such as modifying requirements for the import of seeds, plants, seedlings and cuttings of tomatoes, chili and eggplant.

The virus is known as the _Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus_ (ToBRFV). The first cases in Mexico were detected in 2018 in tomatoes of the Saladette variety. It is present in 20 states and mainly affects tomato and chili crops in the fields and greenhouses.

To prevent its spread, Senasica [National Health, Food Safety and Quality Service] has trained technicians and producers. Prevention measures are the main tool to avoid infection, so Senasica suggests taking care to prevent direct contamination, using certified seeds and raising biosafety measures in production units.

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ (type species _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan after a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes occurred there in 2015. Since then, it has been identified in Israel, the Americas and Europe (ProMED-mail posts 20190117.6264517 & 20190318.6374441). It was shown to affect also capsicum crops (such as chilli) and may pose a risk to other solanaceous crops as well. It has recently been added to the alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but they may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; yellowish mottling, brown spots and rugosis on fruit, making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar, fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100 percent incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_, TMV) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means (human and insect activities), contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or transplants is crucial.

Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade (see link below). For some species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species such as _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_, surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens (e.g. pospiviroids, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560) internationally, thus work to assess a potential quarantine risk posed by the new ToBRFV is needed.

The report above confirms the presence of ToBRFV in Mexico in 20 states, only one year after its first report in the country. It is not clear whether this wide distribution is due to recent spread or whether the virus already had a high incidence at the time when it was first recognised. A phytosanitary alert was issued in Mexico (see link below).
