IBV QX Outbreak in Iraq
-----------------------
An outbreak of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) QX strain occurred recently in broiler farms in Erbil city, the capital of Kurdistan Region, Iraq. Earlier this year [2012], between February and March, 25 broiler flocks were surveyed in collaboration with OIE-FAO and National Reference laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease in Italy.

Samples were collected from upper respiratory tract of chickens.

The broiler farms showed respiratory signs including gasping, sneezing, coughing and high mortality ranging between 15-65 per cent.

The average no of chickens on each farm was 12 000.

A total of 80 per cent of the samples were found to be positive for IBV nucleic acid and 60 per cent of the IBV positive samples showed 99 per cent sequence identity to Chines and European QX-like strains.

IBV alone does not cause such a high mortality, said local veterinarian Dr Oumed Gerjis M. Amin. The damage caused by IB virus depends on several factors: the strain of the virus, pathogenicity of the virus, environmental factors, co-infection with other pathogens especially Mycoplasma and avian influenza, which are endemic in the region.

He added that this finding is very important because farmers either do not vaccinate against IBV or vaccinate once using Massachusetts (Mass) strains, but the Mass strains do not provide protection against QX strains.

Therefore, it is very important for Kurdistan veterinary authorities to reformulate the vaccination programme [to] include, in addition to Mass strain vaccination [see commentary], another appropriate prototype so that broad protection can be achieved including QX strains, which is the basic idea of protectotype.

[Avian infectious bronchitis (IB), an OIE-listed disease caused by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is an acute, contagious disease characterised primarily by respiratory signs in growing chickens. Besides chickens, pheasants are the only other species reported to be naturally affected. In hens, decreased egg production and quality are often observed. There have been no reports of human infection with IBV.

Some strains of the IBV are nephropathogenic and produce interstitial nephritis and mortality. Among those, the QX strain, detected in China between 1995 and 2004 associated with nephritis and egg production problems in IBV-vaccinated flocks, has been also reported from the far eastern and European regions of Russia between 1998 and 2002. More recently, QX-like IBV strains have been detected in several West European countries, including Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK.

Commercially available IBV vaccines are live attenuated or inactivated. Many countries only permit live vaccines of the Massachusetts {Mass) type such as H120. Some countries may also have licensed vaccines to other live strains such as Connecticut, Arkansas, or Delaware 072 (USA) or the 4/91 (United Kingdom). Live vaccines may be given as aerosols, in the drinking water, or by the intraocular route (eyedrop). Vaccination-challenge tests have shown that the commercially available H120 vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against challenge with the QX-like isolates.

The efficacy of inactivated vaccines depends heavily on proper priming with a live vaccine(s). Inactivated vaccines must be administered to birds individually, by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Variant strains may be used to prepare inactivated autogenous vaccines for controlling IB in layers and breeders.

Further information on the manufacture and testing of live and inactivated IBV vaccines is available in chapter 2.3.2 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, at:
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.02_AIB.pdf.

The so-called 'protectotype concept' in vaccination, a relatively new term, is applied mainly by vaccine manufacturing companies. Instead of developing new vaccines per serotype, the companies are trying to address the disease problems with combinations of their existing vaccines. - Mod.AS
