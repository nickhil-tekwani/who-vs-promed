The Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] for Primorsky Krai and Sakhalin region, the focus of viroid disease of potato [see comment below], reported [that a potato disease was] found in Ussuri region [Khabarovsky & Primorsky Krai] on 50 hectares of farm land. This disease of potato tubers may reduce harvest by 30-90 per cent.

To date this condition has been absent from the territory of the Russian Federation. The Rosselkhoznadzor took steps to eliminate the threat of the potato disease, which previously was never registered in the region.

Within the boundaries of the source farm, as well as in a buffer zone of 392 hectares, a quarantine area was established and a phytosanitary regime introduced which limits the cultivation, processing, storage and distribution of produced crops.

[Since it is claimed above that this is a 1st report in the country for the disease, its identity must have been established, although it is not stated in this story.

While a viroid is mentioned, _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ is widely distributed in Russia (ProMED-mail posts 20070423.1323 & 20101020.3801) and would, therefore, not qualify for a 1st report, and other viroids affecting potato are not widely reported.

On the other hand, bacterial brown rot of potato (caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_; for more information see previous posts in the archives) has been considered absent from Russia. However, in previous years, multiple interceptions have been recorded in imported ware potatoes of different origins. Some contaminated consignments were recently also discovered in Primorsky (ProMED-mail post 20140527.2500654). Phytosanitary measures were taken, but it may be possible that they were not effective enough and that the report above refers to this disease having established itself.
