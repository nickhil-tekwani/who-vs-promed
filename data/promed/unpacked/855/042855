INFLUENZA? - CALIFORNIA, USA

Control & Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, USA - Mod.]
I am curious as to whether there has been an unusually late -- or early,
depending on the season -- strain of influenza virus reported to have landed
in the United States in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically the
Peninsula area south of San Francisco.
My daughter, her classmates, my infant, my wife, myself, and now, one of my
co-workers have all succumbed in the last four weeks to what appears to be
an influenza virus, by the symptoms involved. I do not recall ever being
sicker in my life, and, after two weeks, still have residual symptoms of
infection. The symptoms include high fever (102-103F) for a week, severe
respiratory infection, malaise and weakness, and respiratory complications
such as pleurisy, which my business associate now has.
Half of the 23 kids in my daughter's pre-school became infected within a
three-day period, to give you an inkling of its contagiousness.
My physician advised me that she did not think that an influenza virus could
get started in the summer, but the course of this disease suggests otherwise.
I suggest that someone from NCID might want to take a look at what is going
on here, especially given the area's proximity to the Orient and widespread
travel. If nothing else, this outbreak here might give a clue of what we
have to look forward to this fall.
