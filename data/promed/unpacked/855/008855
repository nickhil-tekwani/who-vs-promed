[ProMED usually does not report historical
accounts in published journal articles, since
they do not cover disease outbreaks currently or
very recently underway. However, because reports
of cases of Banna virus infection and its
epidemiology have been relatively few, clinically
it can be confused with Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) infections and is sympatric in its
distribution with JEV, this report is being
posted along with a call for public health
authorities in Asia to consider it in rule-outs
during the diagnosis process of viral encephalitis cases. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
Banna viruses (BAVs) have been isolated from
pigs, cattle, ticks, mosquitoes, and human
encephalitis patients. We isolated and analyzed
20 BAVs newly isolated in China; this finding
extends the distribution of BAVs from tropical
zone to north temperate climates and demonstrate
regional variations in BAV phylogeny and mosquito
species possibly involved in BAV transmission.

Introduction
------------
Banna virus (BAV), the prototype species of genus
Seadornavirus within the family Reoviridae, has a
genome composed of 12 segments of double-stranded
RNA (1). BAV was initially isolated from persons
with encephalitis and fever in Xishuangbanna,
Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, in
1987. Since then, BAV isolates have been obtained
from pigs, cattle, and ticks in China and from
mosquitoes in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. BAV
is a BioSafety Level 3 arboviral agent that is
pathogenic to humans and may well be an emerging
pathogen or undiagnosed cause of human viral
encephalitis in some areas. Our objective was to
describe new BAV isolates from China and to
define the geographic distribution and the
phylogenetic relationships of these isolates with
reference to the previously described isolates.

Results
-------
Before our study, BAV had been isolated from 7
mosquito species in 2 genera (Culex
tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pipiens pallens, Cx.
annulus, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. modestus,
Anopheles sinensis, and Aedes vagus). To this
list we now add 3 species in the genus Aedes (Ae.
albopictus, Ae. vexans, and Ae. dorsalis), which
are widely distributed in China and elsewhere.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete
coding sequence (624 nt) of the 12th segment of
the BAV genome indicated that the BAV isolates
evaluated in this study could be divided into 2
phylogenetically different groups. Isolates from
China and Vietnam are included in group A, and
the strains from Indonesia are in group B. Group
A could be further divided into 2 subgroups, A1
and A2. Subgroup A1 includes 4 independent clades
that group according to the location of
collection and represent viruses from northern
China (Gansu, Shanxi, and Liaoning Provinces) as
well as the Viet Nam isolates. Subgroup A2
includes isolates mainly from southern China
(Yunnan Province) and Viet Nam, which is
contiguous with Yunnan Province of China, as well
as 2 isolates from northern China (BJ95-75/Beijing, and NM0706/Inner Mongolia).

Conclusions
-----------
Our results demonstrate that BAV strains are
distributed from the tropics of Southeast Asia to
the northern temperate regions of China. These
observations suggest that the distribution of BAV
is wider than previously recognized and may be
increasing. Consistent with previous
observations, we report that BAV isolates from
China cluster in group A and separate into
subgroups mainly according to the geographic
origin of the isolate; subgroup A1 is found in
the north and subgroup A2 in the south. However,
2 isolates from northern China grouped in
subgroup A2 (south), and 3 isolates from Vietnam
grouped in subgroup A1 (north).

Further study is required to determine if winds
and birds are involved in dispersal of the virus.

Our observations suggest that the public health
impact of BAV may be underestimated. BAV appears
to be actively circulating in areas where
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic and
where C. tritaeniorhynchus, which is the main
vector of JEV, is active. This mosquito also
appears to be a common vector of BAV. The
clinical symptoms of disease caused by the 2
viruses is similar, and BAV cases may be
undetected during a JE outbreak. It has been
reported that approx. 14 percent of clinically
diagnosed JE cases are BAV immunoglobulin (Ig) M
positive, indicating that BAV epidemics may have
occurred but have been clinically misdiagnosed as
Japanese encephalitis. The apparent active
transmission of BAV over a large geographic area,
genetic variation between geographic regions, and
the potential to cause severe disease underscore
the need for additional surveillance, further
characterization, and improved diagnostic systems worldwide.
