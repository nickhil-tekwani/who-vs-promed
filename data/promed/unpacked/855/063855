The reappearance on Vancouver Island of the deadly rabbit disease which swept across the Lower Mainland last spring has Richmond's rabbit community on alert.

The B.C. government and the BC SPCA issued warnings last week that rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) has resurfaced in the Parksville area, with 4 rabbits dying from the highly infectious virus.

Last year [2018], Richmond-based no-kill animal charity RAPS had to euthanize its entire 66-rabbit population on the orders of the Ministry of Agriculture, after the disease (RHD) struck at its No. 5 Road shelter.

Vaccinations destined for RAPS, which could have saved the rabbits, arrived too late.

"There's no indication yet in the Lower Mainland that there's a problem," said RAPS' spokesman Pat Johnson, who indicated the shelter is now home to only 8 rabbits, its maximum.

"We are telling our officers and staff to be extremely vigilant when out and about in the community, especially in areas known to have a high population of rabbits. They are especially on the lookout for deceased rabbits. Rabbits having succumbed to this disease are very distinctive. They will have a straight neck, extended legs and perhaps blood from the nose. Any rabbits coming into the shelter will be put into quarantine, examined by a vet, vaccinated and put back into quarantine. We will be better prepared than last year [2018]."

Sorelle Saidman, founder of the Richmond-based rabbit sanctuary Rabbitats, said all of her rabbits are vaccinated, and the charity is currently organizing fundraisers to "make sure any new rabbits we take in will also be vaccinated. Given the behaviour of the virus last year [2018], we're not expecting issues in Richmond."

B.C.'s chief veterinary officer, Jane Pritchard, last week recommended owners vaccinate pet and domestic rabbits.

The virus, which causes death within 36 hours, killed hundreds of rabbits last year [2018] across Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland.

Pritchard said the provincial government sounded the alarm as soon as it was able to confirm the disease. She said the dead rabbits are all from the same place in Parksville, but the disease can spread rapidly.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said the source of the virus is unknown, and provincial veterinarians in her ministry are monitoring the highly infectious and deadly disease.

Pritchard said the best precaution against the disease for pet owners and commercial rabbit breeders is to vaccinate their animals. The virus only affects European rabbits and is not known to affect native North American breeds, she said. It also does not affect dogs, cats, other pets or humans, said Pritchard.

Pritchard said rabbit owners should keep their pet areas clean and ensure they do not expose their animals to materials from areas where feral rabbits may have been. They should monitor their rabbits daily for signs of illness and contact a veterinarian with any concerns.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a serious and extremely contagious viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. Morbidity and mortality rates are high in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is 1st introduced. This has had a detrimental effect on some ecosystems in Europe, where wild rabbits are an important food source for certain endangered predators, such as Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_). Conversely, rabbit hemorrhagic disease has been used to help control excessive numbers of wild, non-native European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) in Australia.

The origins of rabbit hemorrhagic disease are not completely understood. The causative virus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), may have emerged from avirulent caliciviruses circulating asymptomatically in European rabbits. The 1st known outbreak occurred in China in 1984, apparently spread by Angora rabbits that were imported from Europe. Within 9 months, this disease had killed 14 million domesticated rabbits in China. By the late 1990s, outbreaks had been reported from 40 countries, and rabbit hemorrhagic disease had become endemic in a number of areas throughout the world. Other regions, including the Americas, have experienced periodic outbreaks in domesticated rabbits. However, the species of wild rabbits found in North America are not susceptible to these RHD viruses, which facilitates eradication.

A new variant called RHDV2 emerged in Europe in 2010 and has spread widely among domesticated and wild rabbits there. This virus has also been found in Australia. RHDV2 affects animals vaccinated against older RHD viruses, as well as unvaccinated rabbits. It can also cause illness in some species of hares. Whether RHDV2 could affect any wild North American lagomorphs is not yet known.

RHDV is readily spread on fomites including contaminated food, bedding, and water. Insects can transmit this virus long distances. Flies are very efficient mechanical vectors; the infectious virus can persist in flies for up to 9 days, and only a few virions are needed to infect a rabbit by the conjunctival route. Viruses can also be deposited on vegetation in fly feces or regurgita, then eaten by a rabbit. Fleas and mosquitoes could transmit RHDV mechanically in the laboratory. Mechanical transmission has also been demonstrated in birds and mammals, which can excrete infectious RHDV in feces after eating infected rabbits.

RHDV is very resistant to inactivation when it is protected within tissues. This virus can survive for 7.5 months in tissue suspensions stored at 4 deg C (39 deg F), and for more than 3 months in dried organ homogenates at 20 deg C (68 deg F). In one study, RHDV remained viable in decomposing rabbit carcasses kept at 22 deg C (72 deg F) for up to 20 days, but there was insufficient infectious virus after 26 or 30 days to cause clinical signs in rabbits.

RHDV can be inactivated with 10% sodium hydroxide or 1-2% formalin. Other disinfectants that have been suggested include 2% One-stroke Environ (Vestal Lab Inc., St. Louis, MO) and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (10% household bleach). This virus resists degradation by ether or chloroform.

In rabbits less than 4-8 weeks of age, RHDV/ RHDVa infections are usually subclinical. However, some young rabbits may have elevated temperatures, and subclinical signs of liver disease were noted in experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbit kittens. Deaths have also been reported, though rarely. In a recent study, experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbits died rapidly if they were immunosuppressed with corticosteroids.

Peracute and acute disease are the most common syndromes in older rabbits. In peracute cases, infected rabbits develop a fever and die suddenly within 12-36 hours of its onset. The only clinical signs may be terminal squeals followed rapidly by collapse and death. Animals with the acute form survive somewhat longer, with signs of dullness/apathy, anorexia, congestion of the conjunctiva, and/or prostration. These animals may also develop neurological signs, such as incoordination, excitement, opisthotonos, and paddling. Some rabbits turn and flip quickly in their cages; this can resemble convulsions or mania. There may also be respiratory signs (e.g., dyspnea, cyanosis, and a terminal, bloodstained, frothy nasal discharge), lacrimation, ocular hemorrhages, or epistaxis. Animals that survive longer can develop a subacute form with severe jaundice, accompanied by weight loss and lethargy, and die in a few weeks. These animals may have diarrhea or constipation and abdominal dilatation just before death. A small number of adult rabbits can have milder signs, with a higher survival rate, or are infected subclinically. Rabbits with persistent viral RNA were apparently healthy.

Treatment is currently limited to supportive care. Passively acquired immunity (hyperimmune antiserum) can protect animals that have not yet developed clinical signs, but it is reported to be ineffective in symptomatic rabbits.

A quick response is vital for containing outbreaks in disease-free regions. Veterinarians who encounter or suspect rabbit hemorrhagic disease should follow their national and/or local guidelines for disease reporting. In the USA, state or federal veterinary authorities should be informed immediately.

Vaccines are now available for RHDV2 as well as RHDV/ RHDVa (classical RHDV or RHDV1); there is limited or no cross-protection between these 2 groups of viruses. Because the production cycle is short, commercial rabbit farms may only vaccinate breeding animals if rabbit hemorrhagic disease has not been reported in the area. However, all animals should be vaccinated if an outbreak has occurred, as the likelihood of infection is high even with strict sanitation and other control measures. Vaccination may also be useful as post-exposure prophylaxis, as immunity to RHDV usually develops in approximately 7-10 days. Sentinel animals can be used to monitor vaccinated farms for RHDV.

There is no indication either strain of this virus affects humans."
