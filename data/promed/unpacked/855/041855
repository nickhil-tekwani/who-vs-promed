BSE may have caused Some Cases of CJD as well as vCJD
-----------------------------------------------------
Measures to protect the public from bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE)-like diseases were called into serious question last night as
researchers suggested that the BSE epidemic in cattle might have caused 2
separate fatal brain conditions, not one as thought. Their stunning
conclusion, that eating cheap cow meat might be responsible for some cases
of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), as well as variant CJD
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail] or human BSE, will
cause further reassessment of risks still posed by food and by infection
through cross-contamination of surgical instruments and blood.
Experiments with mice by John Collinge and colleagues at University College
London appear to strengthen the possibility that more animals, and by
extension humans, can act as infective carriers of the killer diseases well
before full-blown symptoms occur. They cast another shadow over the safety
of sheep, reinforcing concerns that they were infected with BSE as well as
scrapie, a disease not known to be harmful to humans, and that one disease
had "masked" the other.
The Department of Health will have to reconsider the operation and size of
its compensation scheme for families that have a human BSE sufferer. The
money is not available for sporadic CJD victims or relatives, and there is
no way yet that scientists can distinguish between cases that arose from
spontaneous changing in the form of the prion protein linked to both
diseases, and those that might be diet-related. The research, outlined in
the journal of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) [see
comment below], could mean huge changes in the counselling of sporadic CJD
patients and their families. Professor Collinge said last night: "When you
counsel those who have the classical sporadic disease, you tell them that it
arises spontaneously out of the blue. I guess we can no longer say that."
The results come from a continuing long term study of laboratory mice
[engineered to express] the human prion protein, then injected in the brain
with BSE-infected material. Some showed a molecular signature
indistinguishable from human BSE; others a signature the same as that left
by one of 3 forms of sporadic CJD.
Deaths from sporadic CJD reported in Britain in the 1990s peaked at around
60 a year between 1997 and 1999, far more than the 28 variant CJD cases in
2000, the worst year so far for variant CJD. Urgent reviews will be made as
to whether some sporadic cases might be BSE-related, although hard evidence
would be extremely difficult to find. The pattern of infectivity through the
body is markedly different between sporadic CJD and variant CJD, meaning
surveillance might now become more complicated.
There are no blood tests yet available. Hemophiliac patients who were
treated with blood clotting factors by the Scottish blood transfusion
service between 1987 and 1989 are being informed that one donor of blood for
the concentrates had later contracted variant CJD. All hemophiliacs in
Scotland are now treated with genetically engineered substitutes, but these
are not universally available in England, where warnings of possible
contamination have been issued several times. The Haemophilia Society last
night said it would increase pressure on the Department of Health to ensure
that alternatives were available to patients in England.
Gillian Turner, of the CJD Support Network, said: "This research will be
welcomed by many families who have been affected by sporadic CJD. They have
been concerned for a long time that it was diet-related." Lester Firkins, of
the Human BSE Foundation, said: "This could throw all the work that people
have been doing on modelling [the possible spread of diseases] up in the air
again. You might see clustering of cases if you have more numbers."
Sporadic CJD was identified in 1920s. The disease affects mainly the
middle-aged and elderly. The incidence is roughly one in a million, between
29 and 63 a year since 1990. The disease is found worldwide. Time between
obvious symptoms and death is typically a few months. Until now it has been
assumed that a normal prion protein in the brain spontaneously changed into
abnormal dangerous form. BSE or similar diseases could now be factor
vCJD was identified in 1996, with the average age of onset in the late 20s.
Found mainly in Britain: 129 cases with 117 deaths so far, plus 6 in France,
1 each in Italy, Ireland, Canada & the USA. Largely blamed on consumption of
cheap cattle meat and offal during 1980s. Tough food controls were meant to
have significantly reduced risk. Concern remains over whether sheep might
also have become infected with BSE and entered the food chain. First
symptoms often [imitate] psychological problems. Duration is often well over
a year. Several physical symptoms are similar to sporadic CJD.

Title: BSE prions propagate as either variant CJD-like or sporadic CJD-like
prion strains in transgenic mice expressing human prion protein.

Abstract: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has been recognized to
date only in individuals homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129. Here
we show that transgenic mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated
with either bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions,
may develop the neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD,
consistent with these diseases being caused by the same prion strain.
Surprisingly, however, BSE transmission to these transgenic mice, in
addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype, can also result in a distinct
molecular phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD with
PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more than one BSE-derived prion
strain might infect humans; it is therefore possible that some patients with
a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising from BSE
exposure.
In an interview with the London Times Health Editor, Professor Collinge
stated that the number of cases of sporadic CJD cases had been increasing at
about the same rate as the vCJD figures, and that the Swiss had reported
recently a 2 to 3 fold increase in sporadic CJD. He also expressed concern
that the transgenic mouse experiments had revealed instances of subclinical
infection; although appearing normal in life, these mice when examined
post-mortem exhibited extensive brain lesions. Subtle changes in mice are
hard to detect, but changes might be more obvious in humans in terms of
psychiatric symptoms. A subclinical form of CJD in humans would increase the
hazard of transmission of disease via surgical instruments.
Professor Collinge stated that it was now a matter of urgency to conduct a
large scale study of tonsil tissue in order to establish how widespread CJD
infection is. He said that he remained concerned about the ultimate size of
the CJD epidemic. The tonsil study that has been carried out so far
employed a relatively crude test. He stated that new cases of kuru, the
neurological disease caused by cannibalism some 50 years ago are still
coming to light. Consequently these are very early days for a human prion
epidemic, which could have a 30 year incubation period. - Mod.CP]
