A new study claims that pentavalent vaccine (PV), introduced in the country's immunisation programme six years ago, has doubled the deaths of children (soon after vaccination) as compared to DPT (Diphtheria-Pertussis- Tetanus) vaccine. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal, Wolters Kluwer Health's journal, Medical Journal of Dr D Y Patel University, calls for a "rigorous review of the deaths following vaccination with PV [1]."

The pentavalent [vaccine] is a combination of DPT vaccine and two more vaccines, [one] against Haemophilus Influenza type B (Hib) and [another against] Hepatitis B. In December 2011, the [PV] vaccine was introduced in India's immunisation programme to replace DPT vaccine in a staged manner with a view to add protection against Hib and Hepatitis B, without increasing the number of injections given to infants. At that time too, several public health experts had questioned the rationale behind introducing the vaccine and its adverse effects.

In their latest paper, Jacob Puliyel, head of Pediatrics, St Stephens Hospital in New Delhi, and V. Sreenivas, professor of Biostatistics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, say sporadic reports of "unexplained deaths" following immunisation with PV had been a matter of concern. To investigate the issue, Puliyel, Sreenivas, and their colleagues undertook a study to find out if these deaths were merely coincidental or vaccine induced. The authors obtained data of all deaths reported from April 2012 to May 2016 under the Right to Information Act.

Data on deaths within 72 hours of administering DPT and PV from different states were used. For the study, the authors say they assumed that all deaths within 72 hours of receiving DPT are "natural deaths". Using this figure as the baseline, they presumed that any increase in the number of deaths above this baseline among children receiving PV must be caused by the vaccine. "If a state introduced PV in 2014, then data on DPT doses, PV doses, and deaths following vaccination were noted from that year on. This ensured that the deaths were all reported from the state using the same surveillance system," they said.

The analysis of the data provided by the government revealed that there were 237 deaths within 72 hours of administering the PV - twice the death rate among infants who received DPT vaccine. Extrapolating the data, the authors say they estimated that vaccination of 26 million children each year in India would result in 122 additional deaths within 72 hours, due to the switch from DPT to PV. "There are likely to be 7,020 to 8,190 deaths from PV each year if data from states with better reporting, namely Manipur and Chandigarh, are projected nationwide," their report says.

The authors, however, say while the study looks at the short-term increase in deaths (within three days of vaccination) it does not calculate the potential benefits of PV on infant mortality, for example by protection against lethal diseases like _Haemophilus influenzae_. In spite of the data presented in this paper (from a large cohort) the authors point out that the evidence is merely circumstantial and "not conclusive". "These findings of differential death rates between DPT and PV do call for further rigorous prospective population-based investigations," the study concludes.

[The following is the abstract from the journal article referenced above:

Abstract
----------
"Introduction: Immunization is one of the most effective public health tools available to prevent death and disease. Serious adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are rare. However, coincidental sudden‐infant‐death‐syndrome (SIDS) deaths do occur temporally associated with vaccination. In 2010, the Government of India (GoI) introduced a new standard operating procedure (SOP) to report AEFI. There have been stray newspaper reports of deaths soon after the administration of the pentavalent vaccine (PV) which was introduced by the GoI in December 2011. This study was conducted to examine if there is an epidemiological signal from the data collected passively under the new SOP. Materials and Methods: We used data provided by the GoI on the number children who received three doses of diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis vaccine (DTP), the number receiving PV and the number of deaths in the vaccinated within 72 h. Results: After PV was introduced in the states, 45 million infants received DTP vaccination and 25 million received PV. There were 217 deaths within 72 h after DTP was administered and 237 following PV. There were 4.8 deaths per million vaccinated with DTP (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2-5.5) and 9.6 deaths (95% CI: 8.4-10.8) per million vaccinated with PV (odds ratio 1.98 (95% CI 1.65‐2.38) There were 4.7 additional deaths (95% CI: 3.5-5.9), per million, vaccinated with PV instead of DTP (P < 0.0001). Discussion: Deaths following DTP vaccination would include the natural rate of deaths within that window period, plus deaths if any, caused by DTP. For purposes of this study, we assumed that all the deaths associated with DTP are coincidental SIDS deaths. Taking that as the base rate of SIDS, we look for any increase in the death rate after PV. This study demonstrated an increase in reports of sudden unexplained deaths within 72 h of administering PV compared to DTP vaccine. Whether improvements in AEFI surveillance system or other factors contributed to this increase cannot be ascertained from this study. Conclusion: These findings do not warrant deviation from current vaccination schedule, but the differential death rates between DTP and PV do call for further rigorous prospective population‐based investigations."

Pentavalent vaccine (PV) is a combined vaccine that protects against 5 diseases, namely diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis plus hepatitis B and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B (Hib) infections. PV is at present recommended by WHO and its introduction is supported by Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) funds. PV carries several different brand names (e.g., ComBE Five, Pentavac PFS, Easyfive, Pentaxim (DTaP), Shan5, and Quinvaxem) as a consequence of being manufactured by different companies.

Several of the brands have been withdrawn temporarily: Shan5, manufactured by Shanta Biotechnic in India, was temporarily withdrawn in 2010 because of the presence of a white sediment sticking to glass vials containing Shan5 vaccine (http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/shan5_who_statement_27july10.pdf). Easyfive, manufactured by Panacea, was temporarily withdrawn in 2011 due to deficiencies in quality systems found at the company's Lalru manufacturing site in India (http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/newsstory_dtp_hepb_removed_prequal_list/en/).

Unexplained deaths have been noted to be associated with PV in the past. The authors of the referenced study above cite a study by WHO that investigated sudden unexplained deaths associated with PV in Sri Lanka and Vietnam (Quinvaxem) and serious AEFI in Bhutan (Easyfive): WHO found the AEFI were unlikely to be related to the vaccine (http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/pentavalent_vaccine/Jul_2013/en/). For some cases, additional clinical information (e.g., autopsies) allowed another cause of death to be identified.

PV (Pentavac), manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, when introduced in India to replace DTP in 2011 (http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/pentavalent_vaccine/Jul_2013/en/) was also associated with sudden unexplained deaths following its use (http://www.dadychery.org/2012/05/01/pentavalent-vaccines-part-ii-haiti/). It is apparent that several of the PV brands have been associated with sudden unexplained deaths, as some of the referenced study's authors said in an open letter to WHO in 2012, "The reactions in India suggest that the cause of the problem is unrelated to the brand or manufacturer or lot of the vaccine" (http://www.dadychery.org/2012/05/01/pentavalent-vaccines-part-ii-haiti/). The brand or brands of PV used in the referenced study above in India are not specified in the journal article.

In the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) by the Government of India, the pentavalent vaccine comes in a liquid form in a vial that contains 10 doses. Each dose is 0.5 ml to be given by intramuscular injection (http://www.searo.who.int/india/topics/routine_immunization/Pentavalent_vaccine_Guide_for_HWs_with_answers_to_FAQs.pdf). Reconstitution with a diluent is not required with this pentavalent vaccine; use of an incorrect or contaminated diluent has led to adverse reactions with other types of vaccines.

The referenced study above compared the rate of sudden unexplained death within 72 hours following PV versus that following diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis (DTP) vaccine from 2012 to 2016 in different states in a large cohort, based on adverse effects following immunization (AEFI) data from the Indian government surveillance system. Deaths associated with DPT were accessed after PV was introduced in a particular Indian state to ensure that all deaths following vaccination were investigated and reported using the same type of protocol. The referenced study found unexplained deaths within 72 hours following PV to significantly exceed deaths following DTP and, although rare, the 4.7 excess deaths per million vaccinated following PV require a detailed medical explanation. - Mod.ML]

[While the article in question (abstracted above) presents the summary data findings, it would be nice to see the actual data tables, disaggregated by year and State (in India) to see if there are State associations or annual associations. For example, was there an increase reporting in years or locations (States) following previous press announcements? Clearly there is a need to conduct more formal analyses which will address potential confounding variables. It took multiple studies to "clear dpt" as a contributing factor for SIDS following the beginning of the USA adverse events following vaccination surveillance efforts back in the late 70s and early 80s following reports of a cluster of SIDS deaths following receipt of DPT in Tennessee USA. At present it is too early to conclude that the pentavalent vaccine is responsible for the increase in unexplained mortality (as the author of the above paper concludes as well). - Mod.MPP
