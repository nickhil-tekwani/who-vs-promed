A 55 year old man isolated in a northern Johannesburg hospital has tested
negative for all haemorrhagic fevers, including the [novel] arenavirus.
Life Fourways hospital spokeswoman Marietjie Shelly said: "We have been
informed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases that they have
ruled out all the haemorrhagic fevers." She said the man's condition had
improved: "He is doing very well, and he is taking all his meals."

The man, a South African citizen who lives in Malawi, arrived at the
hospital on Thursday [6 Nov 2008] at 7 pm and was taken to the trauma and
emergency unit before being placed in an isolation unit. "He had a high
temperature, severe abdominal and kidney pain, and vomiting. Initial blood
tests gave no indication of internal bleeding," said Shelly.

The man was placed in an isolation unit as a precautionary measure to
ensure the safety of hospital staff, patients and visitors, she said. In
September and October 2008, 4 people died of haemorrhagic fever owing to
[novel] arenavirus infections.

[Laboratory investigation has now excluded arenavirus (and other
haemorrhagic fever viruses) infection as the cause of the illness of the
patient recently arrived in Johannesburg from Malawi. The other viruses
responsible for viral haemorrhagic fevers in central and southern Africa
include Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus and the filoviruses (Ebola
virus and Marburg virus). Although a positive diagnosis remains to be
established, haemorrhage is not prominent among the patient's symptoms, and
the patient is recovering well. A final diagnosis is awaited.
