Cattle deaths from vampire bat bites raise concerns in Ecuador
------------------------------------------
Quito -- Rabies-infected vampire bats are believed responsible for
killing at least 83 head of cattle in Ecuador over the past 6 months.
The actual number could be higher, El Universo daily noted, citing
the reluctance of health officials to alarm the public and concerned
dairy ranchers who fear wary consumers could reduce their milk
purchases.
The bat-attributed deaths have been reported in Ecuador's eastern
Amazon jungle provinces of Zamora Chinchipe and Pastaza, where
residents have decided to undertake efforts to eliminate the flying
marsupials.[Vampire Bats are mammals, not marsupials. If these are
really flying marsupials, then they are not vampire bats. - Mod.TG]
Vampire bat saliva contains an anticoagulant 20 times stronger than
any other known anti-clotting agent, as well as an anesthetic that
reduces the likelihood victims will feel the initial bite, which
allows the bat to lap up the blood of its oblivious, sleeping prey.
Javier Rodriguez, a regional agro-cattle health service director,
told the daily he is awaiting the results of laboratory tests to
confirm the cattle died from rabies.
He noted, however, ranchers are well aware of rabies symptoms, which
include paralysis.
Eating beef from cattle that die from bovine rabies is not harmful to
humans, because the virus is not found in the blood, tissue or milk,
but rather only attacks the brain, producing paralysis and death,
Rodriguez said.
From 1996 to 2000, a large number of cattle died due to an outbreak
of bovine rabies transmitted by vampire bats in the Condor mountains
in Ecuador's Morona Santiago jungle province.

[Vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) are small (25-35 grams), winged
mammals, with a wing span of 25-35 cm and a body about the size of an
adult's thumb. They use echolocation to find their prey. Having once
found their prey, they do use sharp teeth to make an incision and lap
the blood as it flows from the wound. Vampire bats do not chew their
food, rather they lap it, and consequently have fewer teeth than
other bats. As noted in the article above, the vampire bat saliva is
better at keeping blood from clotting than any known medicine.
Vampire bats may one day help prevent heart attacks and strokes,
according to many bat researchers.
Clinical signs of rabies in cattle may include evidence of
neurological disease, loss of coordination (specially in hind legs),
excessive salivation, anorexia, tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness,
dyspnea, aggressiveness, and in some cases, diarrhea and pneumonia.
Rabies is preventable in cattle with a vaccine.
Rabies is known to be transmitted by the 'bite' of the vampire bat
because the virus resides in the saliva. Rabies is identified through
testing of the brain of a deceased animal. Although the cases
referenced above in Ecuador are highly likely to be rabies,
ProMED-mail would appreciate confirmation. - Mod.TG]
