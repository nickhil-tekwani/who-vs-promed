Poliovirus weekly update as of 20 Feb 2019, World Health Organization
------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 3
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2019: 6
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 33

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2019: 0
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 104

Headlines
- On [19 Feb 2019], the 20th IHR Emergency Committee, including members, advisers, and invited member states, convened to discuss the status of international spread of poliovirus. The committee unanimously agreed that the risk of polio spread continues to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and proposed an extension of Temporary Recommendations for an additional 3 months. The recommendations come amid outbreak notification of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 in Indonesia and Mozambique, respectively. The official WHO statement and the Temporary Recommendations will be issued shortly.
- The GPEI has developed the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan 2018-2020, incorporating newer strategies and innovations to help endemic, outbreak, and high-risk countries measure and enhance sensitivity of their surveillance systems.
- WHO is seeking input on draft guidance for managing human exposure to live polioviruses in facilities such as labs and vaccine plants. The document is open for public comment, and WHO is particularly seeking feedback from national authorities for containment and others working in public health.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan: 2 cases of WPV1 and 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- 1 WPV1 case was reported in the past week from Ghorak district in Kandahar province. The onset of paralysis was on [12 Jan 2019]. This the 2nd WPV1 case reported in 2019 so far. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: 3 from Kandahar district in Kandahar province and 1 from Jalalabad district in Nangarhar province. All the samples were collected on [26 Jan 2019].
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- 2 cases of WPV1 were reported this week: 1 in Hangu district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 1 in Lahore district in Punjab province. The onset of paralysis for both cases was on [20 Jan 2019]. The total number of WPV1 cases this year is 4. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 12.
- 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from Jacobabad and Hyderabad districts in Sindh province, and 1 each from Kurram in KPTD province and Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Samples were collected from [15-28 Jan 2019].

Nigeria
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34. The most recent cVDPV2 case was reported from Baruten LGA in Kwara state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- No positive environmental samples were reported this week.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of multivalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder province, with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2019 through 5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- The most recent cVDPV2 AFP case was reported from Mufunga-Sampwe district in Haut-Katanga province with onset of paralysis on [7 Oct 2018].

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample, also from Waberi district, Banadir province, collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on 21 Mar 2018.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected, from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018] in a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province), and one isolated from a community contact of the case reported on [10 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2.

Indonesia
- No cVDPV1 cases were reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked (cVDPV1 isolates were detected, from an AFP case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and from a sample of a healthy community contact, in Papua province collected on [24 Jan 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

[The 3 additional WPV1 cases confirmed in the above report had been covered on ProMED-mail prior posts, having been reported in the media (see Poliomyelitis update (15): Afghanistan (KD) 20190219.6324856 and Poliomyelitis update (14): Pakistan, Indonesia 20190215.6317666 for the original reports).

The good news is that while it is too early to draw any conclusions, thus far this year (2019) there have not been any cases of cVDPV-associated paralytic polio with dates of onset in 2019 confirmed. Time will tell if this will continue.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 - Papua New Guinea [20 Feb 2019]
-----------------------
On [26 Jun 2018], an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was declared in Papua New Guinea following laboratory confirmation of cVDPV1 isolation in 2 healthy community contacts of the index case. Since the declaration, a total of 26 confirmed cVDPV1 cases have been reported in the following 9 provinces: Eastern Highlands (6), Enga (5), East Sepik (4), Madang (3), Morobe (3), Jiwaka (2), Gulf (1), Southern Highlands (1), and National Capital District (NCD) (1). The last laboratory-confirmed case reported having experienced the onset of paralysis in late October 2018. Environmental surveillance continues on a bimonthly basis in Port Moresby and Lae to complement active acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case search efforts.

Public health response
To date, there have been 5 rounds of Supplementary Immunisation Activities (SIAs) conducted from July to December 2018. Consultants from WHO and UNICEF have been deployed to provide technical support during pre-campaign preparations and implementation to ensure high quality SIAs and improve AFP case detection. The 1st round of SIA targeted children under 5 years of age in 3 high-risk provinces. The 2nd round included children under 5 years of age in all 9 provinces. The 3rd and 4th rounds of SIA included National Immunisation Days (NIDs) that were aimed at children less than 15 years of age and achieved a coverage of 93% and 97%, respectively. The 5th round of SIA was a sub-national campaign conducted in 4 priority provinces (NCD, Central, Enga, and Angoram district in East Sepik province). Planning is currently ongoing for additional NIDs in 2019.

AFP surveillance continues to be enhanced, and all provinces are now reporting cases of suspected AFP. As Papua New Guinea shares a border with Papua Province, Indonesia, cross-border surveillance and immunization has been discussed. An SIA has also been implemented in Papua Province, Indonesia, in addition to the strengthening of surveillance efforts.

WHO is working with partners to support the government of Papua New Guinea to undertake appropriate outbreak response measures in accordance with the requirements under the Temporary Recommendations of the IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus and standard operating procedures of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

WHO risk assessment
WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread of poliovirus from Papua New Guinea to be low.

Circulating VDPVs are rare, though well-documented strains of poliovirus can emerge in some populations that are inadequately immunized. A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. While 5 SIA rounds have been conducted in 2018, there remains a need for additional SIAs/NIDs in areas of low coverage to strengthen routine immunization programmes. The risk of further spread of cVDPV1 within the country remains a great concern due to poor routine immunization coverage. The emergence of cVDPV1 strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine immunization coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.

On 5 May 2014, the director-general of WHO declared the international spread of poliovirus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations [IHR 2005], issued Temporary Recommendations to reduce the international spread of poliovirus, and requested a reassessment of this situation by the emergency committee every three months.

WHO emphasizes the need for full implementation of outbreak response measures of the internationally agreed standard, and WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, particularly, those with frequent travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health (http://www.who.int/ith/en/) recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of bivalent oral poliovirus (bOPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. Travellers should be provided with a written record of such vaccination, preferably using the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Some polio-free countries may require travellers who are residents in polio-affected countries to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. The International Travel and Health country list provides a summary of country's requirements for incoming travellers.

Papua New Guinea Launches Comprehensive Outbreak Response To cVDPV Detection

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Reading the above summary of the outbreak of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea, I can't help but see the parallels with the early identification of cVDPV1 in Indonesia and the cVDPV2 in Mozambique - identification of the cVDPV in an AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) case and in a contact of that case. So the question remains: Has Indonesia and Mozambique been able to increase active surveillance in the involved provinces and in other provinces in their countries? As said above, only time will tell.

It is promising that the date of onset of paralysis of the most recent case in Papua New Guinea was in late October 2018, almost 4 months ago.

[3] Pakistan: vaccine refusals, media report
Date: Fri 22 Feb 2019
Source: The Nation [edited]
https://nation.com.pk/22-Feb-2019/several-parents-refuse-to-administer-anti-polio-drops-to-children


Parents of scores of children have reportedly refused polio vaccination for their offspring during the ongoing anti-polio campaign in Rawalpindi. The refusal cases were reported in several streets of Munawar Colony, a thickly populated area located on Adiala Road and controlled by Police Station (PS) Saddar Bairooni. Official sources disclosed to The Nation on Thursday [21 Feb 2019] that scores of parents have stopped the anti-polio teams from administering polio drops to their children during an ongoing anti-polio campaign in Munawar Colony. They said the anti-polio teams have also been threatened by the family heads when they tried to convince them for allowing them to put polio drops in mouths of children under age 5 years old, they said.

Sources said the anti-polio teams have brought the matter into notice of district government authorities. A meeting is expected to be held soon under the chair of DeC in this regard. The authorities would evolve a plan to approach and convince parents who did not allow health workers to administer polio drops to their children, sources said.

Talking to The Nation, a female health visitor said the families residing in streets bordering with Global and Roots Schools opposite Dhama Mor have refused to allow polio drops to be administered to their children. "Don't visit and knock our door ever as you administer polio drops with dirty hands that may put the lives of our children into danger," the lady health worker quoted a family head as saying. When contacted, DC Muhammad Ali Randhawa said the parents are not allowed legally for refusing the polio teams from administering polio drops to children.

He said he would send the senior polio workers and the assistant commissioner to the area for counselling with the families. He also said adequate security would be provided to the polio teams and that the aim of district government was at to make Rawalpindi a polio-free city.

[This media report above presents a glimpse of the challenges facing Pakistan in terms of interrupting transmission of the WPV. In addition to this report of refusals in Rawalpindi, there has been widespread media coverage of a famous Pakistani actor whose wife allegedly refused to vaccinate their child and his being charged for the incident (see https://tribune.com.pk/story/1915477/4-fawad-khan-speaks-amid-polio-controversy/). While the child in question is apparently adequately vaccinated, it doesn't help the national program efforts to have such media coverage suggesting they support non-vaccination. - Mod.MPP]
