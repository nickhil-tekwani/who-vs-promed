Bali rabies deaths list: update
-------------------------------
Chronic shortages of post-exposure vaccines continue. Case reporting
continues to be erratic. Unofficially, the Bali human rabies death toll is
now approaching 80. Officially, about half of the victims died of
"encephalitis" rather than rabies.

The Bali Animal Welfare Association is now vaccinating up to 870 dogs per
day, averaging more than 500, but still, less than half of the dog
population has been vaccinated.

The government is still putting much of their effort into culling dogs, but
the culled total is still less than the dog birth rate, as some recent
newspaper articles have finally acknowledged. A local newspaper, Nusa Bali
(Tue 4 May 2010) states that there are now rabies cases and 43 fatalities.
Denpasar, NusaBali records another fatality, [that of] a 69 year old
resident, caused by rabies virus [from] dogs, cats [or] monkeys. (note that
so far there have been no cases, not even vaguely suspected, involving cats
and monkeys. Many people in Bali are obsessed with the alleged risk that
rabies might infect the temple monkeys, which are a major tourist draw, but
the monkeys don't hang out where dogs do -- if both are in the same
courtyard or alley, they keep to opposite sides and keep a wary eye on each
other. As to cats, they exist in Bali, of course, but are not highly
visible, since dogs tend to monopolize any food sources that they can,
leaving a relatively narrow niche for mousers who go where dogs cannot.)

The following information was gathered by Sanglah Hospital as of Mon 3 May
2010), According to Dr Ken data for suspect Rabies patients who were
treated in the Sanglah Hospital, from October 2008 is recorded 77 rabies
cases and 43 fatalities, 27 of them were rabies positive. (Deciphering this
last sentence requires a degree of clairvoyance. The remains of many people
who are believed to have died from rabies have not been tested, and there
is some dispute as to the accuracy of the testing method used in
postmortems in Bali.)

[Since the last report posted on ProMED-mail on 9 Apr 2010 the number of
human deaths from rabies virus infection has increased from at least 42 to
at least 47 currently (although unofficially the toll is estimated to be at
least 80). The list of officially confirmed cases illustrates a widespread
geographic distribution of cases, the wide span of ages of the victims, and
the apparent absence of any non-native inhabitants.
