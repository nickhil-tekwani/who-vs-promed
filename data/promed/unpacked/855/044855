A total of 14 402 cases of severe diarrhoea, including cholera cases, has

Kabul province, Central region, where nearly 7 000 cases have occurred. Out
of 9 samples tested, 5 were laboratory-confirmed as cholera [we understand

A significant increase in the number of suspect cholera cases was noted in
Kunduz province, North-Eastern region and various provinces in Southern
region during the week 3-9 July [1999.
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has organized a cholera task force
including representatives of the MOPH, WHO, UNICEF, Medecins sans frontieres
and Save the Children Fund (US). Data collection from hospitals and other
health centres was organized in Kabul city. WHO distributed drug supplies
through its suboffices in
the regions and arrangements are being made to procure more supplies.
Regions where no cholera cases have been reported have been alerted and task
forces formed within the diarrhoeal disease surveillance system.
Discussions were held with the MOPH, UNICEF and the World Food Programme in
Kabul to prepare the implementation of control activities including
chlorination of wells, mass awareness campaigns and construction and
installation of microfilters for the provision of safe drinking-water at
public places in Kabul city.
Cholera is endemic in the country and outbreaks occur every year. In 1998,
around
10 000 cholera cases (including suspect/acute diarrhoea cases) were reported
in Kabul alone, and in 1997 around 4 000 cases (including suspect cases)
were reported.
