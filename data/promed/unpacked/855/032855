Abstract
--------
Avian scavengers, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_), have potential to translocate infectious agents (prions) of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases including chronic wasting disease, scrapie, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. We inoculated mice with fecal extracts obtained from 20 American crows that were force-fed material infected with RML-strain scrapie prions. These mice all evinced severe neurological dysfunction 196-231 d postinoculation (x = 198; 95 percent CI: 210-216) and tested positive for prion disease. Our results suggest a large proportion of crows that consume prion-positive tissue are capable of passing infectious prions in their feces (p = 1.0; 95 per cent CI: 0.8-1.0). Therefore, this common migratory North American scavenger could play a role in the geographic spread of TSE diseases.

Abstract
--------
Mechanisms for the spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases, including chronic wasting disease (CWD) in North American cervids, are incompletely understood, but primary routes include horizontal and environmental transmission. Birds have been identified as potential vectors for a number of diseases, where they ingest or are exposed to infected material and later shed the disease agent in new areas after flying substantial distances. We recently identified American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) as having the potential to translocate infectious prions in their feces. Our results suggest that this common, migratory North American scavenger is capable of translocating infectious prions to disease-free areas, potentially seeding CWD infection where no other initial source of pathogen establishment is forthcoming. Here we speculate on the role avian scavengers, like American crows, might play in the spatial dissemination of CWD. We also consider the role mammalian scavengers may play is dispersing prions.

Abstract
--------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy afflicting the Cervidae family in North America, causing neurodegeneration and ultimately death. Although there are no reports of natural cross-species transmission of CWD to noncervids, infected deer carcasses pose a potential risk of CWD exposure for other animals. We placed 40 disease-free white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) carcasses and 10 gut piles in the CWD-affected area of Wisconsin (USA) from September to April in 2003 through 2005. We used photos from remotely operated cameras to characterize scavenger visitation and relative activity. To evaluate factors driving the rate of carcass removal (decomposition), we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a generalized linear mixed model. We recorded 14 species of scavenging mammals (6 visiting species) and 14 species of scavenging birds (8 visiting species). Prominent scavengers included American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_), raccoons (_Procyon lotor_), and Virginia opossums (_Didelphis virginiana_). We found no evidence that deer consumed conspecific remains, although they visited gut piles more often than carcasses relative to temporal availability in the environment. Domestic dogs, cats, and cows either scavenged or visited carcass sites, which could lead to human exposure to CWD. Deer carcasses persisted for 18 days to 101 days depending on the season and year, whereas gut piles lasted for 3 days. Habitat did not influence carcass decomposition, but mammalian and avian scavenger activity and higher temperatures were positively associated with faster removal. Infected deer carcasses or gut piles can serve as potential sources of CWD prions to a variety of scavengers. In areas where surveillance for CWD exposure is practical, management agencies should consider strategies for testing primary scavengers of deer carcass material.

[Our heartfelt thanks to Sukie for these very interesting articles. While fresh faeces are unattractive to grazing animals, the infectious component of such faeces is very robust and will survive long after the faecal decomposition, which of itself will foster active grazing growth and be attractive to grazers.

Bryan Richards, <brichards@usgs.gov>, emerging disease coordinator of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, has graciously shared with me his regularly updated USGS map of known CWD distribution in North America since 2005: http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/chronic_wasting_disease/index.jsp. This valuable map of CWD in Canada and the US is good up to and including February 2016. With thanks. - Mod.MHJ
