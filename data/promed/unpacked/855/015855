Where did the coronavirus come from? The story we've been told is that it started off in bats and then jumped into humans some time late last year [2019] at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan. It's a neat tale -- but the problem is, nobody actually knows whether it's completely accurate. In this programme, we're exploring the possibilities, the evidence, and the gaps in the evidence...

[This is a very interesting set of interviews well worth reading or listening to, on the origin of SARS-CoV-2, spillover events, adaptation. It argues against the virus originating in the Virology lab in Wuhan, or in Wuhan at all, but rather hypothesizes a more likely origin in rural southern China. - Mod.LK]

[In COVID-19 update (369): India CHWs [community health workers] face shields, social distancing, WHO, global 20200821.7700947, there was a JAMA article describing a study where the addition of face shields protected community health workers (CHWs) from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 while doing household contact tracing visits. Prior to the addition of face shields, there were several cases of COVID-19 among the CHWs, but once face shields were added there were no additional cases. It is noteworthy that the face shields were added on top of masks, which is consistent with the media report above cautioning on the use of face shields alone. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Selected countries: 3 Sep 2020 case and death updates
[An editorial decision has been made to eliminate this section. Today's update is the last that will have this section. I will continue to monitor these countries as I think there are lessons to be learned from them and will share impressions when indicated. - Mod.MPP]


[A] China: National Health Commission, 85 102 total cases, 4634 deaths (25 new cases -- all imported; 8 new cases in Hong Kong)
http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/202009/cac8f60f53084af3a1a5a447fc11186e.shtml

[B] South Korea: 20 842 confirmed cases, 331 deaths (198 new cases -- 9 imported, 189 locally transmitted)

[The 22nd consecutive day with more than 100 newly confirmed cases. In the past 2 weeks, there has been an increase in mortality reported as well. Notices 537 and 538 (the latest analyses of the ongoing outbreak are at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030) provide details on clusters as of 00:00 hours [4 Sep 2020]. Of the locally transmitted cases, 68 are in Seoul, 55 are in neighboring Gyeonggi province, and 20 are in Chungnam; 14 of the 17 provinces have reported locally transmitted cases. Level 2 restrictions are being implemented, with no indoor dining and no in-person church services. - Mod.MPP]

[C] Italy: 272 912 total cases, 35 507 deaths [comparative 7-day averages have gone up by 14.5% from the preceding 7 days]

[The 7-day average comparison continues to show a decreasing change in the increase in confirmed cases, suggesting the increased transmission is slowing down. - Mod.MPP]

[D] Iran: 380 746 total cases, 21 926 deaths
https://ifpnews.com/irans-coronavirus-cases-hit-380000-health-ministry

[E] USA: 6 335 244 total cases, 191 058 deaths [comparative 7-day averages are going down by 3.9% for daily case counts and reported mortality has gone down by 15.1% for reported deaths]

[With the greater availability of antigen testing for quick results, many states are not counting those individuals as confirmed cases. A map showing the testing rate per 100 000 population by state can be seen at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#testing. On that same page are the figures on total tests performed and total positive tests; the overall positivity rate remains at 9%, while the 48 hour positivity rate was 7.9%. - Mod.MPP]

[F] Spain: 488 513 cases, 29 234 deaths [14-day population-based rate: 212.98 /100 000, up from 7.74 on 25 Jun 2020 and up from 211.84 on 2 Aug 2020]

[A repetitive comment (for those who have read this before): These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing though possibly slowing down over the past few days, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, where there have been major increases in reported cases. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 3 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept3_1599188683.pdf

- The Americas region reported 45.5% of daily case numbers and 65.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.5 million cases. The USA and Brazil are dominant followed by Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

- The European region reported 14.1% of daily case numbers and 7.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.3 million. Spain dominant followed by France, Russia, Ukraine, and Israel.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.8% of daily case numbers and 5.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 2.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.79% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.5 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 32.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 19.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.4 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Noteworthy is that the regional cumulative case count for South East Asia has now surpassed that of Europe, with daily newly confirmed cases almost 3 times that of Europe.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 3 Sep 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (84 156), followed by Brazil (44 728) and the USA (44 507) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.1%). A global total of 5813 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (2-3 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (12 026), Spain (8959), Colombia (8235), France (7157), Peru (6708), and Mexico (5937), and 28 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 5.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.3%.

Impression: Unchanged from recent days. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. The global 7-day averages seem to reflect a small increase in reporting confirmed cases, although deaths are decreasing. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
