Phytophthora palmivora (E.J. Butler) commonly known as bud rot, has become
epidemic in the coconut plantations of Kerala State in India. The disease
is presently concentrated in the Kuttyadi region in Kozhikode district -
one of the most productive coconut seed belts in the State. The disease
could spread further or infect other trees too, experts warn.
The prolonged rains in the last season had created a conducive climate for
the disease to persist in the high altitude regions and spread further, Mr.
J. Manmohan, Deputy Director, Department of Agriculture, said. In the
Kuttyadi region alone, a recent survey found that in an area of 1564 ha,
9,503 palms (nearly six per cent) have already been affected. About 3,460
palms out of those affected will have to be totally cut and burnt. The
cumulative loss suffered by the farmers in the region has been put at Rs.
1.41 crores. [According to one of my Indian colleagues, at the moment there
are about 40 rupees to $US 1.00; 1 lakh = 100,000 rupees, and 1 crore = 100
lakhs or 10,000,000 rupees. Then, Rs 1.41 crores would be apporximately $US
352,500 - Mod.PKA].
Prophylactic spraying of Bordeaux mixture and Bordeaux paste has been
recommended for palms that could yet be saved. The State Government will
compensate the farmers at the rate of Rs. 500 for each palm that has to be
cut and removed. The Government will also bear the cost of chemicals and
the spraying charges, the State Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Krishnan
Kaniyamparambil, has announced.
