Re: Undiagnosed mortality, camel - UAE (03): RFI 20140623.2560302

[As part of its tracking activities of non-official information, the OIE picked up the above ProMED posting and asked clarification from its Delegate of the UAE. Below is an extract of the information that was sent to the OIE on 26 Jun 2014 by the Delegate, Eng. Saif Al Shara, Assistant Undersecretary, Agricultural & Animal Affairs Sector, Ministry of Environment & Water (MoEW), Dubai, UAE]:

Since the beginning of June [2014], when information started to circulate in the local press about an unknown disease affecting camels in the North of Al Dhaid, in the Central region, the MoEW instructed the Veterinary Office of the Middle Region to investigate and visit camel establishments in the area in order to examine them and to ask their care keepers about the observed health situation of their camels.

An investigation team composed of veterinarians working in local veterinary clinics visited the area where the mentioned camel mortality was mentioned to the press.

In the visited area, there are 40 premises close to a camel racetrack, including approximately 1100 racing camels. According to the investigations, individual, intermittent death cases have been observed involving a few animals, most of which were purchased from distant locations requiring long distance transportation to this area. Also, these camels are specially raised for racing and are treated in a way to increase their competitions results. They are generally in poor hygiene conditions and have nutritional problems. This could explain the observed sporadic death cases.

In addition, the workers mentioned that they have not noticed any increase in the mortality rate above the one occurring in general conditions this year [2014] and during the last 2 years, which contradicts what was quoted by the information that was circulated in the media. The team visited the municipality of Al Dhaid and was told that no report on high mortality in camels had been received. They also visited the local public health authorities and were told that there was no recorded human disease in relation to contact with camels.

We instructed the local team to continue investigations and sample sick and dead animals, if any, in the same area and send the samples to the laboratory to search for the etiology.

The private veterinarian, quoted in the press about results of his animal [camel] treatments, was asked by the Veterinary Office of the Middle region, why he had not notified the high mortality to the concerned authorities as prescribed by the law in force; he mentioned that for him there was no need to notify, since they were normal cases of common respiratory signs which could be treated, which is in contradiction to what he said to the press.

The MoEW will inform the OIE about the results of the coming investigations and about laboratory sample testing results. If there is a pathogenic agent identified that should be notified to the OIE, as per the requirements of Article 1.1.3. of Chapter 1.1. "notification of diseases, infections, infestations and epidemiological information," we will officially notify it.

[It is a relief to note that, at least according to the official information as updated above, no epizootic of significance nor a zoonotic disease which clinically affects camels could be confirmed in the central region of Dubai, this, in contradiction to media reports covered in 3 ProMED-mail postings published on 15, 16 and 23 Jun 2014 (see in "See Also" section below).

We are grateful to Dubai's Ministry of Environment and Water's firsthand clarifications in response to ProMED-mail's requests for information. Their handling of our RFIs pertaining to this event is exemplary.

Complementary results of lab-tested samples, even if negative, will be much appreciated. - Mod.AS
