On [2 Sep 2021] officials at the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) confirmed a horse residing at a private facility in Washington County with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), a neurologic disease resulting from equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). The affected horse, an 18-year-old Quarter Horse mare unvaccinated for EHV, experienced onset of clinical signs on [26 Aug 2021]. Signs included ataxia (incoordination) and recumbency (down and unable to rise). She was subsequently euthanized.

Thirty-one additional horses at the facility were exposed. MBAH officials have placed the facility under quarantine.

[Other articles indicate the horse in question "had attended 3 different shows in the area in August [2021]. The Board of Animal Health has reached out to those locations to alert attendees."

EHV 101
-------
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture confirms new cases of West Nile virus and EHV-1 in Oregon. [For information on the horses with West Nile virus, please see ProMED archive 20210923.8695268. - Mod.TG]

On 9 Sep 2021 Oregon State Veterinarian, Dr Ryan Scholz, DVM, received a report equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHV-1) was diagnosed in one horse and suspected in a 2nd horse on a private farm in Linn County.

A 3rd horse on the same farm tested positive for EHV-1, with a 4th and 5th horse exposed. 2 of the affected horses were euthanized. A preliminary investigation shows none of the 5 horses have been moved off the farm or in contact with other horses in the past 4 weeks. As a result, Scholz placed the farm under quarantine.

EHV-1 is highly contagious. While there are no known exposures linked to the Linn County farm, Scholz recommends horse owners concerned about exposure monitor their horse's temperature [usually twice daily. - Mod.TG] and contact their veterinarian if a fever or clinical signs develop. EHV-1 testing is generally not advised in asymptomatic horses. More information is available from Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) [https://www.equinediseasecc.org].

EHV-1 is a reportable disease in Oregon. Veterinarians must report suspected cases to the Oregon State Veterinarian.

The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs but thus far there is no vaccine for the neurological form of the disease.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent. - Mod.TG]
