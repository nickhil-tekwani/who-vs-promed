Bay State families worried about mosquitoes after a Holbrook teen
died from a bite are trying to keep eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]
at bay -- some dousing their children in repellent. The 13-year-old
boy died of EEE 27 Aug 2004.
State officials say the disease is not at all common, but still
cautioned residents to use insect repellent outdoors, wear protective
clothing, empty standing water and fix screen windows and doors.
The boy's death comes less than 2 weeks after a 64-year-old
landscaper from Brockton succumbed to the disease, which has no
treatment and carries a 30-50 percent mortality rate [see 1st ref.
below]. The virus has been detected in 18 mosquito samples taken from
7 communities in southeastern Massachusetts [in 2004].
"Prior to the other fatality this year, there had not been a case
since 2001," said Alfred DeMaria, state director of Communicable
Disease Control. DeMaria said EEE usually manifests 5-7 days after
exposure with the 1st symptoms being fever and muscle aches. He said
unlike West Nile virus, which typically affects elderly people more
severely, EEE seems to be just as dangerous for all ages.

State health officials yesterday reported a pony living in a Dedham
stable died of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a mosquito-borne
virus that can kill humans.
Dedham Board of Health Director Frank Scurti said he was notified by
state officials of the case -- the 1st of its kind that he knows of
in Dedham. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health, there have been 80 cases of EEE statewide since the virus was
first described in 1938, with most occurring in Norfolk and Plymouth
counties.
The virus is spread by mosquitoes that contract EEE from birds that
live in freshwater swamps. There is no known cure, and 3 out of 10
people who contract the disease die, according to the state health
department. Scurti said that since there is no vaccine, the best way
to protect against contracting EEE is to avoid mosquitoes.
