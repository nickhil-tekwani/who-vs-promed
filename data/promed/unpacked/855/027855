In the past, CCHF cases were reported from Gujarat. Check WHO information on CCHF cases in India/Gujarat
http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/links/CCHF_Fact_Sheet_SEARO.pdf?ua=1.

There is another article which provides specific symptoms for CCHF; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334974.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has not been reported previously from India. Initial clinical features of dengue fever and CCHF are similar, and it is very difficult to differentiate and diagnose CCHF. Common clinical features of CCHF include high grade fever with chills, headache, body ache, myalgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness and bleeding from multiple sites. Laboratory investigations showed cytopenia, raised prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), raised creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as altered liver and renal functions. Patients with the above symptoms can rapidly progress to bleeding from multiple sites and death compared to dengue fever. It is crucial to recognize CCHF at early stage to institute ribavirin treatment and also to prevent nosocomial spread of disease to health care workers. We are describing the 1st 4 cases of the recent CCHF outbreak in Ahmedabad.

One confirmed and [other] additional suspected cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, a viral haemorrhagic fever, have been reported in Gujarat in India. This is the 1st time that CCHF cases have been documented in India. As of 19 Jan [2016], 3 deaths have occurred in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, including an attending doctor and nurse. WHO India and SEARO are collaborating with the government of India to provide technical support to respond to the situation.
