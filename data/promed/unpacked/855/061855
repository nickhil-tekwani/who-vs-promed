Headlines
- The Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) has confirmed the isolation of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) from environmental samples (ES) in London, United Kingdom (UK), which were detected as part of ongoing disease surveillance. It is important to note that the virus has been isolated from environmental samples only -- no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. Recent coverage for the primary course of DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccination, which protects against several diseases including polio, in London suggests immunization coverage of 86.6%. [see section [3] below]

Summary of new polioviruses this week:
- Pakistan: 2 WPV1 cases

[At the global level, looking at confirmed cases to date comparing 2022 with 2021, there is a significant increase in both WPV1 associated AFP cases (12 vs 2) and cVDPV associated AFP cases (154 vs 108).

The 2 reported cases of WPV1 associated AFP refer to the 9th and 10th confirmed cases in Pakistan. The total number of WPV1 associated AFP cases with dates of onset in 2022 is now 12, including the 2 importation events into Malawi and Mozambique earlier this year (2022).

In the past week, there were 4 countries reporting cVDPV activity -- 2 with AFP cases (DR Congo and Yemen) and 2 with positive environmental samples (Madagascar and Nigeria).

In addition, the UK (London) reported identification of a vaccine derived poliovirus (type 2). As the UK does not use the live attenuated vaccine, the vaccine virus must have been introduced through importation from a country that has used OPV2-containing vaccine. (see section [3] below).

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

Headlines
- The 5th meeting of the Regional Subcommittee on Polio Eradication and Outbreaks was convened on 14 Jun 2022 by WHO's regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari. The meeting comes at a time when Afghanistan and Pakistan, as the last 2 endemic countries in the world, continue their efforts to stop wild poliovirus transmission, and several countries in the Region are responding to circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses. "The continued presence of any circulating poliovirus in any country of the Region has catastrophic consequences for children who are paralyzed, and poses a threat to national, regional and global health security. The need for regional solidarity, collaboration and collective action has never been greater," said Dr Al-Mandhari.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) detected in environmental samples in London, UK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) has confirmed the isolation of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) from environmental samples in London, United Kingdom (UK), which were detected as part of ongoing disease surveillance. It is important to note that the virus has been isolated from environmental samples only -- no associated cases of paralysis have been detected. Recent coverage for the primary course of DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccination, which protects against several diseases including polio, in London suggests immunization coverage of 86.6%.

Initially, vaccine-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) had been isolated from samples taken from the same site between February and May 2022. Genetic analysis suggests that the new VDPV2 and previous SL2 isolates have a common origin, still to be identified, but the technical definition and criteria for 'circulation' of VDPV2 are not met at this time. Additional sewage samples collected upstream from the main waste-water treatment plant's inlet are being analysed.

Investigations and response by the UK Health Security Agency are ongoing to:
- assess both origin and risk of circulation associated with these isolates;
- strengthen poliovirus surveillance including enterovirus and environmental;
- explore routine immunization catch-up of children who are under-immunized, including of families that have recently arrived in the UK from countries with recent use of type 2-containing oral polio vaccine; and,
- enhance communications about this incident to health professionals and caregivers.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with a high volume of travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level and at the lowest administrative level to protect children from polio and to minimize the consequences of any new virus being introduced.

Any form of poliovirus anywhere is a threat to children everywhere. It is critical that the GPEI Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 is fully resourced and fully implemented everywhere, to ensure a world free of all forms of poliovirus can be attained.

Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) - Mozambique
------------------------------------------
Outbreak at a glance:
On 15 May 2022, a case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported in Mozambique through the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN). Results of the genomic sequencing analysis indicate that the current WPV1 isolate is genetically linked to a strain detected in Pakistan in 2019 and similar to a case of WPV1 reported in Malawi in February 2022.

As part of response measures following the confirmation of the case in Malawi, 2 rounds of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) campaigns have been conducted in the country, with more than 4.5 million children vaccinated.

The risk of international spread, particularly across the South East region of Africa remains high, due to persisting sub-optimal immunity and surveillance gaps, and large-scale population movements.

Description of the outbreak:
On 15 May 2022, the GPLN reported the confirmation of a case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Mozambique. The case is a 12 year old girl with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), with onset of paralysis on 25 Mar 2022, from Changara district, Tête province bordering Zimbabwe and Malawi. Two stool specimens were collected for testing on 1 and 2 Apr 2022. On 14 May 2022, the samples were confirmed to be WPV1 by National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa. The child had previously received 3 doses of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) but no inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Genomic sequencing analysis indicates that the newly confirmed case is linked to a strain that had been circulating in Pakistan in 2019, similar to a case of WPV1 reported in Malawi in February [2022].

National and subnational authorities continue to be supported by partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), notably by experts of the African Rapid Response Team, the GPLN, UNICEF and local organizations. Surveillance across the sub-region continues to be strengthened. The detection of the current case underscores the need for a large-scale, rapid, multi-country emergency outbreak response across South East Africa, in line with revised international polio outbreak response SOPs. The foremost priority is to continue to implement the sub-regional emergency response, by continuing to conduct large-scale, rapid and high-quality response campaigns.

WHO risk assessment
Detection of a case of WPV1 in Mozambique, and the 2nd case in the South East region of Africa, confirms ongoing WPV1 transmissions in the sub-region.

WHO considers that there is a continuous high risk of international spread of WPV1, particularly across the South East sub-region of Africa, due to persisting sub-optimal national immunity and surveillance gaps, and large-scale population movements. The risk is further increased due to the decreased immunization rate related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The risk of spread associated with the concurrent cVDPV2 outbreak is currently assessed as moderate due to historical and epidemiological evidence suggesting that WPVs have a significantly higher propensity for geographic spread than cVDPVs. However, a comprehensive outbreak response to both strains is urgently being implemented, as both strains have the capacity to cause paralytic disease in children.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travels and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas should be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from affected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, ensure the vaccination of residents and long-term visitors and restrict at the point of departure travel of individuals, who have not been vaccinated or cannot prove the vaccination status.

The latest epidemiological information on WPVs and cVDPVs is updated weekly on the GPEI website.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to Mozambique based on the information available for this current event.

https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2022/06/16/two-new-polio-cases-reported-in-north-waziristan/


Two new poliovirus cases surfaced in North Waziristan on Wednesday [15 Jun 2022], taking the total number of cases in Pakistan to 10 this year [2022]. According to the health department, one case was reported from Dosali area and the other from Mir Ali. A 12 month old boy in Dosali and an 11 month old boy in Mir Ali were found positive for the disease.

According to a preliminary report, both cases showed that the children had never received vaccination during the routine immunization drives for the polio virus after their family turned away vaccinators.

It is pertinent to mention here that all the 10 children confirmed with polio virus as of June this year [2022] belong to North Waziristan.
