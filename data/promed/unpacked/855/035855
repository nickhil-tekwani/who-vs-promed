Vietnam detected nearly 8000 cases of dengue fever infections,
including 4 fatalities, in the 1st quarter of 2006, a year-on-year
rise of 20 percent, a local health agency said Thursday.
Most of the cases were reported in southern localities like Ho Chi
Minh City, Soc Trang and Dong Thap provinces, where weather
conditions and local people's habit of storing water in containers at
their houses favor the development of mosquitoes -- the disease's
transmitter, said the Preventive Medicine Department under the Health Ministry.
To cut the number of new infections, the department is asking
localities nationwide to keep on cleaning environments around their
accommodations, including keeping water containers clean and killing
mosquitoes and their larvae.
Vietnam reported 49 400 cases of dengue fever infections, including
51 fatalities, in 2005, down 32.7 percent and 49.5 percent from the
previous year, respectively, according to the country's General
Statistics Office.

While a 6-year-old girl from Padra tested positive for dengue even in
tests conducted by the government on Tuesday, 6 more dengue-positive

officials in Padra town. The 6-year-old [girl] and the other patients
all reside in the posh locality of Padra, near Padariya Chowk. The
first detection of a dengue case was in Padra town, located barely 30
km from Vadodara. While screening 100-odd homes in the residential
vicinity of the patient, 6 cases of mild dengue were found, said Dr K B Patel.

Paraguayan health authorities warned on Tuesday that the dengue
epidemic that is already affecting 215 people may spread to other
regions, due to trips at Easter.
They explained that the disease epicenter is in the capital, the
residents of which [will likely be traveling] to other localities and
this could cause infection through the bites of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, the dengue-transmitting agent.
Health Minister Teresa Leon said other infection sources could
develop in the interior of the country within a few days.
The most probable areas for the spread of infection are Ciudad del
Este, 205 miles East of this capital and southeastern Encarnacion, in
Itapua department, where there is a great influx of people and
overcrowding, she said.
Although health authorities are insisting on implementing preventive
measures, dozens of doctors said the health system uses mainly
curative and [supportive] methods.
