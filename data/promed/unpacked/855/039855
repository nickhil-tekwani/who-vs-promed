The News Office of China's Ministry of Agriculture announced yesterday [2
Nov 2007] that Asia type-1 foot and mouth disease [FMD] had occurred in
Jiaqiao Village, [situated at] Qiuzhi Township, Qumalai County, Yushu
Prefecture in Qinghai Province.

On 31 Oct 2007, Qinghai Province veterinary agencies reported that yaks on
a farm developed Asia type-1 FMD on 24 Oct 2007. The farm had a total of 58
yaks and 19 fell ill. FMD of the Asia-1 type was confirmed by the National
FMD Reference Laboratory.

After the outbreak, Qinghai Province veterinary agencies, in accordance
with relevant animal epidemic prevention laws, implemented containment,
slaughter, disinfection, emergency vaccination, and other comprehensive
prevention and control measures. The outbreak has been effectively
controlled. A total of 58 sick yaks and [in-contact] yaks from the same
herd were slaughtered and another 1357 susceptible animals have undergone
emergency vaccination.

[The yak -- a wild, shaggy-haired ox (_Bos grunniens_ ; picture at
<http://project-himalaya.com/i-khumbu/s2-yak.jpg>) -- occurs on the Tibetan
Plateau in northern Xizang Province (Tibet) and western Qinghai Province of
China. Its historic range included mountains and plateaus of western China,
northern India, Nepal, and parts of Mongolia. Domesticated yak, used as
work animals or raised for meat and milk, are distributed more broadly
across the highlands of central Asia. Like all cloven-foot animals, it is
susceptible to FMD. Undiagnosed deaths in yaks were reported from Qinghai
in April 2005. - Mod.AS]

China curbs foot-and-mouth outbreak in Qinghai
----------------------------------------------
China has contained an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the
north western province of Qinghai, the Agriculture Ministry said.

Local authorities have culled 58 cows [according to the above Chinese
source, the animals were yaks. - Mod.AS], after tests confirmed on 30 Oct
2007 the presence of Asia type-1 FMD at a village in Yushu county, the
ministry said on its website ().

FMD does not affect humans and outbreaks are relatively easy to control,
but the disease can have a serious impact on the livestock industry by
reducing meat and milk production.

Outbreaks that resulted in the slaughter of more than 1000 animals were
reported around China last year [2006].

[According to the 1st 2007 quarterly report of the World Reference
Laboaratory (WRL) for FMD (see 20070514.1535), outbreaks of FMD serotype
Asia-1 were reported in China in January [2007] in Gansu and Xinjiang
provinces and in February [2007] in Qinghai Province. In January [2007],
there were also reports of a FMD outbreak in a Yuen Long pig farm in Lau
Fau Shan, Hong Kong. The 2nd quarterly report (Apr-Jun 2007) indicated,
without specifying the serotype involved (which may be assumed to be Asia-1
or O), that FMD outbreaks have continued to be reported in Gansu (affecting
pigs and dairy cattle) and Qinghai (affecting cattle).

China submitted to the OIE on 19 Jan 2007 an immediate notification report
on the Asia-1 outbreak in Gansu. Six follow-up reports have been sent
later, the last one -- on 5 Jul 2007 -- addressing an Asia-1 outbreak in
cattle in Qinghai. For a summary of all the said reports, with map, see
