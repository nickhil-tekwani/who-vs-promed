Aflatoxin poisoning reported in Mutomo
--------------------------------------
Eight suspected cases of aflatoxin poisoning have been reported at
Mutomo mission hospital in Eastern Province.

Meanwhile, 18 samples of maize taken from the National Cereals and
Produce Board (NCPB) Kitui depot have been found to be contaminated
with aflatoxin.

Mutomo District medical officer of health Dr James Gachini said the
cases being handled at the mission hospital were from Kibwezi
district and Mutha division in Mutomo district.

Dr Gachini told the press on Thursday [24 Jun 2010] that surveillance
of grains being carried out in the area was being hampered by lack of
co-operation by farmers who failed to avail their maize for testing.

Two of the patients are still admitted at the hospital while the
other 6 were treated and discharged.

In Kitui Central, Nzambani, Mutito, and Kitui West districts, 48 per
cent of samples tested by the public health department were found to
contain aflatoxin poison that can cause liver cancer and death.

District public health officer [DO] Johnson Muinde said the 18 bags
from where the samples were taken and found to be contaminated had
been seized. He said other samples were taken from retail outlets for
animal feeds.

"Besides NCPB, other samples were confiscated from commercial stores
and households but no replacements have been done so far," said
Muinde.

He said 176 samples had been tested using Rapid Aflatoxin Testing Kit
and those above the World Food Programme (WFP) levels would undergo
further tests at the National Public Health Laboratory.

Muinde said some of the samples had as high as 100 parts per billion
(ppb) levels of contamination against the benchmark of below 10 ppb
set by WFP.

Kitui district aflatoxin surveillance committee meeting chaired by DO
1 Peter Onyango said that concrete measures would be taken to ensure
nobody consumed contaminated grains.

The government earlier this year [2010] announced that it would
purchase contaminated maize from farmers especially in the larger
Eastern province and parts of Coast province to ensure it was not
consumed by unsuspecting wananchi (citizens) [...] over 70 percent of
all maize harvested in the regions in the last season was
contaminated with deadly aflatoxin.

In 2004 at least 150 people are said to have died mostly from Eastern
Province after unsuspectingly consuming maize contaminated with
aflatoxin at the height of a severe drought.

Scientists say the occurrence of aflatoxin was endemic in the area
with the soil being a major contributor to the growth of mold in
addition to high moisture content and high temperatures.

Suggestions have also been made that farmers in the region should
grow maize for production of fuel rather than food.

[Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of
mold: _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _A. flavus_
is common and widespread in nature and is most often found when
certain grains are grown under stressful conditions such as drought.
The mold occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains
undergoing microbiological deterioration and invades all types of
organic substrates whenever and wherever the conditions are favorable
for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content
and high temperature. At least 13 different types of aflatoxin are
produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered the most toxic.
While the presence of _A. flavus_ does not always indicate harmful
levels of aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for aflatoxin
production is present (source
<http://archive.gipsa.usda.gov/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.pdf>).

Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic
for humans. Animals are susceptible to acute death and liver damage
when exposed to high doses, but seldom develop cancer following
long-term low-level exposure. The toxicity varies between different
species, but data from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in
1974, which involved moldy maize and in which nearly 100 people died,
suggests that the toxicity of aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere
between that for the dog and that for the rat. The involvement of
aflatoxins with human cancer is more complex and remains to be
defined (source
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/capacity/en/2.pdf>).

Any of the produce fed to animals, may produce clinical signs in the
animals, including a decrease of production, such as a drop in milk
production.
