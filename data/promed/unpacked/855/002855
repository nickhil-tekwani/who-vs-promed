Cases of Malaria rising in Moscow
------------------------------
Despite its relatively northern location, Moscow is experiencing a growing
malaria problem. The number of reported cases has doubled during the past 5
years, the city's health authorities said Wednesday. Nikolai Filatov, head
doctor at the city's health inspection service, said the number of
registered malaria cases grew from 112 in 1997 to 214 in 2001. A total of
728 people have been infected with the disease between 1997 and 2001. This
year, 56 people have been diagnosed with malaria, 5 more cases than during
the same period last year. Filatov said there are a number of reasons behind
the increase.
Malaria has begun spreading to cooler climates across the world, especially
in the last 50 years, and Moscow has the ingredients needed for the disease
to take root: already-infected people and the genus of mosquito called
_Anopheles_. Last year, 69 percent of the capital's rivers, ponds, lakes,
and swamps were populated by the _Anopheles_ mosquito. The genus includes a
number of mosquito species capable of carrying the malaria parasite and
transmitting it to humans. More than 1400 hectares of wetlands were treated
with insecticides in 2001 after they were found to have mosquitoes capable
of carrying malaria, Filatov said. This year [2002] the area to be treated
has increased to some 1600 hectares.

[We presume that the cases are _P. vivax_ and that they became infected in
Moscow and were not imported from malaria-endemic areas like Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan. In 1997 Russia as a whole reported only 31 cases
of autochthonous malaria to the WHO regional office for Europe, compared to
the 112 cases cited above as having been diagnosed in Moscow alone in 1997.
This indicates either that the majority of cases were not infected in
Moscow, or that the real number of cases is higher than reported to the WHO
regional office. - Mod.EP]
