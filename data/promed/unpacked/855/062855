Queensland Health is investigating another 5 potential _E. coli_ infections among Ekka visitors after going public with 4 confirmed cases on Fri 23 Aug 2013. The possible new cases were identified after Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young issued an initial health alert when 3 children and a 33-year-old woman tested positive to the potentially-deadly Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_.

It is believed the initial quartet, from 4 separate families who went to the Ekka on different days, developed the infections after visits to the show's animal nursery. Late yesterday [25 Aug 2013], a Queensland Health spokesman confirmed 5 new unconfirmed infections were being investigated after new patients came forward with symptoms at the weekend.

"We have had further notifications, but they are unconfirmed because we are waiting for tests," he said. "They are people who have had symptoms from the same source area after our notification."

Ekka management have flagged a possible review of animal handling procedures in the wake of the health scare.

A spokeswoman last night [25 Aug 2013] said organisers had been assisting authorities by contacting animal exhibitors at the show and passing on contact details to state agencies. As yet, no specific animal has been identified as the source of the outbreak.

[The Ekka (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekka) is the annual agricultural show of Queensland, Australia. Its formal title is the Royal Queensland Show, and it is held at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. It was originally called the Brisbane Exhibition; however, it is commonly called the Ekka, which is a shortening of the word exhibition. The Ekka is Queensland's largest annual event with recent shows drawing more than 400 000 visitors. There are now 9 suspected or proven cases of EHEC.

The American CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/spotlight_an_exhbts.htm) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:

"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
Use hand-washing stations.
Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

Food and drinks:
Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
Do not share your food with animals.
Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

Children:
Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
Hand washing should be supervised." - Mod.LL
