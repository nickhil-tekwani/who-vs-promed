El Paso County Public Health announced on Wednesday [26 May 2021] the plague has been confirmed in a domestic pet on the north side of downtown Colorado Springs.

The announcement comes soon after the department confirmed multiple squirrels had tested positive for the plague in the Old North End area of Colorado Springs. The health department wants to remind the public to protect themselves and the public from the plague by simply recognizing what you can look for and what you can do.

Plague is not uncommon for rock squirrels, prairie dogs, and other species of ground squirrels and chipmunks in Colorado. Pets can get plague by catching and eating infected rodents and rabbits or by being bitten by infected fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or directly infect other animals and their owners. Plague is treatable if caught early on, but there could be life-threatening complications if treatment is delayed.

From El Paso County Public Health:
----------------------------------
What to look for: If you notice an unusual number of dead wild rodents in your area, contact El Paso County Public Health at 719-578-3199 and select the option for Environmental Health. Do not handle sick or dead animals.

What you can do: Because plague is regularly found among wild rodents in El Paso County, it is important to always follow these precautions:
- Do not feed or touch wild animals, such as prairie dogs, rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, and other rodents.
- Do not touch sick or dead animals.
- Make sure your residence is as rodent-proof as possible.
- Before and while hiking, wear insect repellent to protect from fleas.
- Protect pets with appropriate flea control -- consult your veterinarian.
- Keep pets and children away from wild animals.

[Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, small rodents, sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel or other rodents, or other animal or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives."
