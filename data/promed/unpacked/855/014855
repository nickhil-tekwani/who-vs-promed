Caribbean region: West Nile virus confirmed in 2 birds in Puerto Rico
-----------------------------------------------
The Secretary of the Department of Health, Dr. Johnny Rullan, stated today
that Puerto Rico has now joined the group of countries from the Caribbean
region with confirmed West Nile virus (WNV). He indicated, in a press
conference, that the presence of the virus had been confirmed, in 2 of 183
birds captured last February 2004, in the area of the former US Roosevelt
Roads Navy Base in Ceiba (southeastern Puerto Rico). The studies were
performed at the New York Health Department and at the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center in the U.S.
Rosangelie Toledo, an epidemiologist currently working at the Epidemiology
Division in the Department of Health, commented that the virus was found in
2002 in birds from the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, as well as in birds
and horses in Mexico. In 2003, it was found in horses in El Salvador.

[The epidemiology is hard to understand without knowing the migratory
status of the positive birds. If they were resident species, then the virus
is already endemic there, having been so since 2003. If they were
over-wintering migrants from the north, then they had a chronic infection,
since they probably arrived in Puerto Rico last December 2003. If they were
north-bound migrants from South America, that implies a focus somewhere in
Brazil. Perhaps our colleagues in the NY State Arbovirus Lab can enlighten
us? - Mod.JW]
