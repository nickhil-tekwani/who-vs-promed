The wild poliovirus type 1 has paralyzed a one year old child in the mountainous region of north west Pakistan -- the 3rd such case reported in the country this year [2022]. Earlier in January this year [2022], Pakistan marked an achievement with no new polio cases in a year, but the authorities detected the country's first case of the debilitating neurodegenerative disease in April [2022]. The samples of the infected child were taken on [7 May 2022] and it was learned that the boy had not been vaccinated against the crippling disease.

The health ministry expressed concerns over the detection of more poliovirus cases in the country as the country of 221 million has reported 2 cases in 2022 so far. All the cases have been reported in North Waziristan [Bannu division of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province]. Some media reports suggest that the resurgence of wild polio is linked to 'fake finger marking'. The vaccinators reportedly mark the fingers of the vaccinated children but the people resisted vaccination.

Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease that is usually spread through contaminated water or food. Invading the nervous system, the disease can cause total paralysis within hours. Polio historically thrived in the borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan where militants attacked and even killed anti-polio teams. Around 70 polio workers have been killed in militant attacks since 2012 in the north western region of the country. Anti-polio drives have been running since 1994, while many people still considered it a Western conspiracy. In the most recent incident, a police officer guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred after unidentified gunmen fired at him in Kohat district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on [Sat 14 May 2022].

[This is now the 3rd confirmed case of WPV1 associated paralytic disease in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan. The virus is clearly still circulating there and there are pockets of unvaccinated susceptibles. The article points out the challenges faced by the polio workers in terms of misinformation, falsification of vaccination information, and safety issues (see section [5] below).

[The prior weeks of reporting have multiple cases and countries reporting either AFP cases associated with cVDPV2 (cVDPV2 associated AFP involving DR Congo, Nigeria, and Mozambique) and unfortunately multiple positive environmental samples with cVDPV2 in Djibouti and Yemen. Noteworthy is there are now more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than in all of 2021, and the numbers of cVDPV cases are close to the same reported up to this period in 2022.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Palestinian Authority: vaccination
Date: Fri 13 May 2022

https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/palestinian-ministry-health-launches-polio-campaign-bethlehem


On [Mon 16 May 2022], the Palestinian Ministry of Health will launch round 1 of a polio vaccination campaign targeting all children under age 5 in Bethlehem and Jerusalem. The vaccination campaign is scheduled to run over 3 days: [Mon 16 May 2022] through [Wed 18 May 2022]. Vaccination, using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), is free and will be offered at maternal and child centres and UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency] centres throughout Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

Palestine has been polio-free for more than 25 years, thanks to a robust routine immunization programme and a strong culture of vaccine acceptance. But following the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) in sewage outflow in Wadi Alnar site, where there is a junction between wastewater coming from inside the green line with wastewater coming from Bethlehem and Jerusalem, the Ministry of Health has decided to launch a preventative vaccination campaign to boost children's immunity in the 2 areas deemed most at risk: Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

"It is all of our duty to keep Palestine polio-free by making sure that our children under the age of 5 receive the polio vaccine every time it is offered. I encourage every parent to make it a priority to vaccinate their children -- for their sake, and for Palestine," said Dr Mai al-Kaila, minister of health, Palestine.

The vaccination campaign is being carried out with support from WHO, UNICEF, and UNRWA's Palestine country offices. "WHO's Palestine office has provided technical support to the Ministry in planning and executing this campaign, drawing on the extensive expertise of our regional polio eradication programme. Palestine is in a strong position thanks to its routine immunization programme and to the value Palestinian parents put on childhood immunizations, but the regional risk of polio is increasing and it is absolutely crucial that we reach and vaccinate every child under age 5 in the target areas," said WHO's Occupied Palestinian Territory representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn.

"It is critical that every child can access their right to a life free from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. UNICEF and its partners in this campaign are making every effort to ensure no child in Palestine will be affected by this debilitating disease. It is a duty upon all of us to keep Palestine polio free," said UNICEF's special representative to the State of Palestine Lucia Elmi.

Round 2 of the campaign will take place in June [2022] and will offer all children under the age of 5 a 2nd 2 drops of polio vaccine, further boosting their immunity. Children living outside of Jerusalem and Bethlehem do not currently require an additional dose of oral polio vaccine. If their routine immunizations are up to date, they are well protected from poliovirus and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

Poliovirus primarily affects children under age 5 and can lead to lifelong paralysis. It can easily be prevented through vaccination. Parents are urged to accept polio vaccines every time they are offered.

The vaccination campaign in Palestine is part of the global effort to eradicate poliovirus, spearheaded by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

[5] Pakistan (Punjab): polio worker assaulted
Date: Fri 13 May 2022
Source: The Nation [edited]
https://nation.com.pk/2022/05/13/anti-polio-team-assaulted-in-westridge/


An anti-polio team came under attack by a man at Khalid Bin Waleed Road when the team members rang a doorbell of a house to collect data about the children under the age of 5 years old, informed sources on [Thu 12 May 2022]. Westridge police have registered a case against the attacker on the complaint of the victim, an anti-polio team worker, they said. However, the police have failed in nabbing the accused even after over 15 days, sources said.

The female supervisor and other members of the anti-polio team have threatened to launch a protest demonstration outside the office of deputy commissioner (DC) Rawalpindi against the apathy of police and high-ups of the district health authority.

According to sources, a member of the anti-polio team, lodged a complaint with PS [police station] Westridge on [27 Apr 2022] that she along with her [male] colleague were on a door-to-door campaign to collect polio vaccination data of children less than 5 years old in Salmanabad on Khalid Bin Waleed Road. She added she rang the doorbell of a house to enquire from family about the presence of any child for polio vaccination when [the assailant] appeared from somewhere and started abusing her. She alleged the man attacked her with an iron pipe which she hardly managed to avert. She said she took refuge in a nearby house to save her life when the man caught [her male colleague] and attempted to beat him with an iron pipe. However, she said [her colleague] also ran away from the scene. The police filed the case and started an investigation with no arrest so far, sources said.

A female supervisor of anti-polio teams told The Nation that she along with victim workers had become a shuttlecock between the offices of DC and DHO Rawalpindi to get justice, but it was in vain. She said police are also humiliating the victim woman and not arresting the accused. She appealed to the chief secretary of Punjab, RPO [regional police officer], and CPO [city police officer] Rawalpindi to take action against the DC and SHO [station house officer] of PS Westridge for not providing the polio workers with justice.
