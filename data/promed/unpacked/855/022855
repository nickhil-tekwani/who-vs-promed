An increase of reports of canine distemper in raccoons has prompted the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to issue a warning to affected areas, including Lafayette Parish. The outbreak has been reported from Lafayette to southeast Louisiana.

Distemper has several similar symptoms to rabies, and include discharge from the nose and eyes, seizures, coughing, emaciation and unusual behavior. The virus is usually fatal.

Though distemper does not affect humans, it can infect raccoons, foxes, coyotes, skunks and unvaccinated dogs. It spreads through body fluids or droppings from infected animals.

How can you protect your pet? The best prevention is to make sure your dog is vaccinated. You should also make sure to feed your pets indoors, and secure garbage cans so that raccoons can't open them.

Children should also be kept away from sick raccoons and other wildlife, the LDWF advises.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing similar behavioral signs might be rabid. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
