Montgomery County, Maryland, Horse Tests Positive for EHV-1
-----------------------------------------------------------
A horse stabled in Montgomery County, Maryland, has tested positive for the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and is being treated by a private veterinarian.

The horse had been outside Montgomery County for breeding for more than 2 weeks before returning home on Monday [13 Apr 2015]. The horse began showing mild respiratory and neurologic signs on Tuesday [14 Apr 2015] and was seen by a private veterinarian, who reported the suspected neurologic illness to the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) as required by law. Laboratory tests conducted by MDA confirmed the diagnosis. The horse's condition is improving.

Other horses at the farm are now being tested as are horses that were in contact with the ill horse at the breeding facility. Those results will not be available until 16 April 2015. Both farms are presently under a 28-day investigational hold while MDA inspectors perform epidemiologic and infectious disease testing.

Stables near the one where the sick horse resides have been notified of the situation and owners cautioned to monitor horses at their premises carefully.

The MDA's Animal Health Program is monitoring the situation closely. Owners should contact their private veterinarians to arrange for EHV testing if a horse exhibits significant temperature elevations or neurologic signs. Veterinarians are required to report equine neurologic syndrome to MDA.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The owners of the property where the horse is stabled is being very proactive by notifying other boarders of the situation. This one case has the potential to expose a number of horses.

Monitoring temperatures twice or more daily is a way to get an early indication that the horse may be infected with this disease. It is also an early indication that veterinary attention is necessary to give the animal the best chance of survival. Rest for the affected animal is very important to potential recovery.

It was only a few weeks that a horse from returning to Maryland from a Pennsylvania show brought this disease back to Maryland. Horse owners should be cautious.

This disease tends to move rapidly and vigilance is very necessary. - Mod.TG
