------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 primary school students have been hospitalized for food poisoning,
after a lunch at their school canteen on Thursday [16 Feb 2006], in
southernmost Hainan Province, according to the local government.
3 of the children were in critical condition, according to the
People's Hospital of Haikou City, where the students are being
treated.
The children are from the Changmao Primary School in Haikou, the
capital of the tropical island province. They fell sick at around 2
p.m. on Thursday [16 Feb 2006] after having noodles for lunch at the
school canteen.
Some children vomited and had stomachache and skin redness, said the
doctors with the hospital.
Tests showed that the children were poisoned by nitrite, which is
usually found in salt, said the doctors.

[Sodium nitrite is used in food preparation to fix the colors in preserved
fish and meats. It is also important (along with sodium chloride) in
controlling the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which causes botulism.
Lunch meats, hams, sausages, hot dogs and bacon are usually preserved this
way -- see:
<http://sci-toys.com/ingredients/sodium_nitrite.html>.
It is NOT usually found in salt -- but it looks just like salt and has been
sold as salt by unscrupulous merchants. - Mod.JW]
