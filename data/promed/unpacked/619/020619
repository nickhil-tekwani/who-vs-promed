CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states,
including Colorado, and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak
of listeriosis. Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by
eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_.
Investigators are using DNA analysis of Listeria isolated from
patients to identify cases of illness that may be part of this
outbreak. The _Listeria_ bacteria are obtained from diagnostic
testing; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is used to determine
DNA fingerprint patterns. Investigators are using data from PulseNet,
the national subtyping network made up of state and local public
health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that
perform molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

As of 5pm EDT on 20 Sep 2011, a total of 55 persons infected with the
4 outbreak-associated strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been
reported from 14 states. All illnesses started on or after 4 Aug 2011.
The number of infected persons identified in each state is as follows:
California (1), Colorado (14), Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Maryland
(1), Montana (1), Nebraska (4), New Mexico (10), Oklahoma (8), Texas
(9), Virginia (1), West Virginia (1), Wisconsin (2), and Wyoming (1).
Listeriosis illnesses in several other states are currently being
investigated by state and local health departments to determine
whether they are part of this outbreak.

Patient ages range from 35 to 96 years, with a median age of 78 years
old. Most ill persons are over 60 years old or have health conditions
that weaken the immune system. 59 percent of ill persons are female.
Among the 43 ill persons with available information on whether they
were hospitalized, all were hospitalized. Eight deaths have been
reported, 2 in Colorado, one in Maryland, 4 in New Mexico, and one in
Oklahoma.

About 800 cases of Listeria infection are diagnosed each year in the
USA, along with 3 or 4 outbreaks of Listeria-associated foodborne
illness. The foods that typically cause these outbreaks have been deli
meats, hot dogs, and Mexican-style soft cheeses made with
unpasteurized milk. Produce is not often identified as a source, but
sprouts caused an outbreak in 2009, and celery caused an outbreak in
2010.

The death toll has risen to 8 in an outbreak of listeria traced to
Colorado-grown cantaloupes, officials said Wednesday [21 Sep 2011].

The CDC said that a person in Maryland died from eating the tainted
produce. Four deaths have been reported in New Mexico and 2 in
Colorado, and one person has died in Oklahoma.

The CDC said 55 people in 14 states have now been confirmed as
sickened from eating the cantaloupes. On Mon 19 Sep 2011, the CDC
reported 4 deaths and 35 illnesses in 10 states.

The death count, the highest in a known food outbreak since tainted
peanuts were linked to 9 deaths almost 3 years ago, could go even
higher. The CDC said illnesses in several other states potentially
connected to the outbreak were under investigation.

Health officials have said they think the number of illnesses and
deaths could continue to grow because the incubation period for
listeria can be up to a month. Unlike many pathogens, listeria
bacteria can grow at room and refrigerator temperatures. The FDA and
CDC recommend anyone who may have one of the contaminated cantaloupes
throw it out immediately.

About 800 cases of listeria are found in the United States each year,
according to CDC, and there usually are 3 or 4 outbreaks. Most of
these are traced to deli meat and soft cheeses, where listeria is most
common. Produce has rarely been the culprit, but federal investigators
say they have seen more produce-related listeria illnesses in the past
2 years. It was found in sprouts in 2009 and celery in 2010.

While most healthy adults can consume listeria with no ill effects, it
can kill the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. It is
also dangerous to pregnant women because it easily passes through to
the fetus. In the current outbreak, the median age of those sickened
is 78, according to the CDC.

[In the 2 days since the last update, the number of cases has
increased from 35 to 55, the deaths from 4 to 8, and the states
involved from 10 to 14. As noted in the AP report, this _Listeria_
outbreak is quickly approaching the number of deaths associated with a
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium outbreak linked to peanut
butter in 2009, although more than 600 cases were reported.

More cases are likely to be included in this growing outbreak in the
days to come. - Mod.LL]
