As of 29 Mar 2016, a total of 16 confirmed and probable mumps cases were reported in Minnesota, according to the Minnesota Department of Health [MDH]. On average, fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the state.

In North Dakota, 14 cases have been reported since 24 Feb 2016. Most were in Ward County. On average, fewer than 3 cases are reported in North Dakota each year. [See ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA (08): (ND) 20160403.4136830 for post from North Dakota reporting these 14 cases age 14-86, and commentary. - Mod.LK]

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that causes swelling and tenderness in the salivary glands, cheeks and jaw, said Anita Cardinal, public health nurse and director of Inter-County Nursing Service in Thief River Falls [Minnesota]. Other symptoms include a low-grade fever, a headache, muscle aches, and a loss of appetite. Up to 30 percent of those with the illness exhibit no symptoms, according to MDH.

Mumps can spread 3 days before the person shows signs of the illness to 5 days after the symptoms have appeared. The most contagious period is 48 hours before the symptoms appear. There is no treatment for mumps, but individuals can receive care for their symptoms.

Mumps may be prevented with vaccinations. Cardinal noted that the mumps vaccine (as part of the MMR vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella) is typically given to children 12 months to 15 months old. Another booster shot is given at 4 to 6 years old.

Cardinal also encouraged people to cover their coughs and use proper handwashing techniques. In addition, she noted that people shouldn't share eating utensils or beverage containers.

If people suspect they have mumps, they should call their healthcare provider. Mouth, throat and/or blood samples may be collected to confirm the diagnosis. They should also stay home for 5 days after the swelling has started.

Health officials at Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana] are on high alert after patients with mumps were detected on campus. Students, staff and faculties demonstrating symptoms of mumps were asked to refrain from entering the West Lafayette campus.

Tippecanoe County health officials are working closely with officials from Purdue to abate possible outbreak by containing the 5 patients with mumps and tracing possible contacts.

Mumps is caused by a viral infection and can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing. Therefore, health officials are on top of the situation to control the quick spreading of the infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. These symptoms can manifest 12 to 25 days after the virus infect the host. It incubates in the body until the patient's immune system goes down.

Gail Walenga of the Purdue University Student Health Center encouraged people within the vicinity to stay home if they have shown signs of mumps. Do not risk going out, unless it is an urgent one.

They were also advised to check on their immunization records and update whether they had the latest shot for MMR (mumps, measles and rubella). There are members of the population who are at high-risk for mumps.

Medicine.net listed down the risk factors:
- Failure to be immunized completely (2 separate doses) with exposure to those with mumps.
- Age: The highest risk of contracting mumps is to children between 2-12 years of age.
- Season: epidemics of mumps were most likely during the winter/spring seasons.
- Travel to high-risk regions of the world: Africa, general Indian subcontinent region, and Southeast Asia. These areas have a very low rate of vaccination.

[Adults born in 1957 or later who have not been vaccinated or have not had mumps should get vaccinated. College students, teachers, healthcare personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for mumps. Mumps is part of the combination vaccine, MMR, that also protects against measles and rubella.

Serious complications of mumps are more common among adults than children. Rare complications caused by mumps include infections of the brain and spinal cord, arthritis, kidney and pancreas problems, deafness, and inflammation of the ovaries.

As recently as 2006 and 2009-10, the US experienced large mumps outbreaks. The ages affected by outbreaks can vary. In 2006, most cases were in people age 18 to 24; in 2009-2010, the majority was in adolescents age 11 to 17.

The Indiana State Department of Health has reported mumps outbreaks at 4 universities as Purdue University in West Lafayette becomes the latest school to report an outbreak of the viral vaccine preventable disease.

School and local and state health officials are investigating 5 confirmed or probable cases of mumps on the West Lafayette campus. In addition, the collaboration is working to identify and directly notify anyone who may have been in close contact with these cases, and advises faculty, staff, students and members of the community to educate themselves on the symptoms, transmission and prevention of mumps.

In addition to Purdue, state health officials have reported 45 mumps cases on 3 other campuses -- Indiana University in Bloomington (17), Butler University [in Indianapolis] (24) and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) with 4.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms for mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides. Mumps is spread from direct and indirect contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets, which can be transmitted by sneezing and coughing. People with mumps can spread their infections for up to 2 days before and 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Anyone with symptoms is highly encouraged to stay home and avoid others to prevent the further spread of illness and to seek care as soon as possible.

Mumps is caused by a virus, so antibiotics are not indicated. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection but can range from 12-25 days. Generally, mumps is a mild illness, and some people may not have any symptoms. While complications and more serious issues can result from a mumps infection, they are generally rare, with a 1 percent to 3 percent complication rate.

At this time, university members are encouraged to check their vaccination records with their primary-care provider and obtain copies if needed. Currently, the best way to prevent mumps is to be vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR. Individuals born after 1957 who have not had 2 doses of vaccine or are unable to find their records are encouraged to seek advice from a health care provider or contact the local health department on receiving an MMR vaccine. Persons born before 1957 are considered to be immune to mumps due to the high rate of infection prior to routine vaccination. Two doses of vaccine are only considered around 88 percent effective at preventing infection, so some people who have been fully vaccinated with 2 MMRs may still contract mumps.

Practicing good hygiene habits -- such as regularly washing your hands with soap and water, sneezing and coughing into a tissue or your elbow, and avoiding the sharing of drinks, food and utensils -- is a good way to prevent illness and transmission. Additionally, if you believe you may have symptoms of mumps, isolating yourself from contact with others and seeking care as soon as possible could prevent additional spread of mumps.

Students or staff with symptoms -- even if they have received a MMR vaccine -- should stay home and call ahead before going to an urgent care or the Purdue Student Health Center. If students have concerns about possible symptoms, they should contact the Purdue Student Health Center or their primary-care provider. Treatment for mumps is geared toward alleviating symptoms. Bed rest, a soft diet and a pain reliever for aches are often recommended.
