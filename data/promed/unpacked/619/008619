Disease affects deer in Harding County, South Dakota
----------------------------------------------------
A common disease is killing white-tailed deer in part of Harding County in
the northwest corner of South Dakota (United States), the Game, Fish and
Parks Department (GF&P) said.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is prevalent in late-summer periods of
high temperatures and drought. It is often fatal to deer and is not a
health risk to humans, the department said.

EHD has been most significant in hunting unit 335B in Harding County.
Hunters planning to apply for a leftover license in that area might want to
apply for a leftover license in a different unit, the GF&P said.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an acute, infectious, often fatal
viral disease of some wild ruminants. This malady, characterized by
extensive hemorrhages, has been responsible for significant epizootics in
deer in the northern United States and southern Canada. A similar
hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2
diseases are antigenically different, although there are similar clinical
signs. The first occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred
in 1955, when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_)
succumbed in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new
disease of deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic disease" was suggested
to describe its main clinical and pathological features. Since these
initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics have occurred in
white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Alberta,
Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred in Missouri, Washington,
Nebraska, Iowa, and British Columbia.

South Dakota, Missouri, and Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of
EHD, and the disease might be considered enzootic in these areas. Since the
initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have succumbed. The mode of
transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly or gnat.
_Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector in North
America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer
(as in Michigan, New Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single
epizootics that do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as
experienced in South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the
disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.

Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer develop
signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of
the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and
fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively,
develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and finally become unconscious.
Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood result in a blue appearance of
the oral mucosa, hence the name "bluetongue".

Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass
into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die. The gross and
histological lesions of EHD are characterized by extensive hemorrhage,
ranging from pin-point to massive in size, and involve different tissues
and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be exempt from
hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart, liver,
spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging is the
result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together with
degeneration of blood vessel walls. Because of its very high mortality
rate, EHD can have a significant effect upon the deer population in a given
area, reducing numbers drastically. Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted
to other wild ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals but
rarely causes disease. In all probability the virus does not infect humans.
Presently there is no evidence that it does cross into humans.
