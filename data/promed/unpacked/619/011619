An outbreak of canine distemper among raccoons has killed hundreds, and
probably thousands, of the animals in the Denver area, a state health
official said. [Family dogs appear to have escaped the disease. John Pape,
epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment, confirmed last week that the disease swept through the raccoon
population starting last winter and peaked after the spring mating season.
However, it still poses a threat to dogs, which can contract the airborne
disease through direct contact with a raccoon, sharing food or sniffing
areas where raccoons have urinated or defecated. Denver animal control
director Doug Kelly said few of the sick raccoons were found in the city.
But officials in suburban Lakewood, unincorporated Jefferson County and
Aurora reported severe outbreaks. And northern suburbs reported outbreaks
as well, TriCounty Health spokesman Gary Sky said. Littleton animal control
officer Claire Fife said the contagion appears to be part of a natural
cycle that reduces the raccoon population every 7 to 10 years.
