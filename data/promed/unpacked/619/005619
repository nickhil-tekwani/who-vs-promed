A cluster of Legionnaires' disease centered on a single apartment building [CO-OP City] in the Bronx has sickened 3 people over the past year, leading to 1 death.

The New York Department of Health stresses that this is not considered an outbreak. The affected building, in CO-OP City, does not have a cooling tower, so they're looking at internal plumbing to see if the bacterium is there.

The water is safe to drink, but they're advising residents of the building who are over 50 [years of age] or have underlying medical conditions to avoid showering until the investigation is completed.

"The Health Department is currently investigating 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease in 3 connected buildings at CO-OP City in the Bronx that occurred in the last 12 months," the health department said in a statement. "All of the patients who became ill had conditions that increase the chances of getting Legionnaires' disease. One of the [3] patients, who was very elderly, has died. The other 2 individuals have been discharged from the hospital. As always, adults with flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention. _Legionella_ testing should be considered by clinicians based on history, symptoms, and other findings."

Officials said the 1st case was last year [2017], while the last 2 were in the last 60 days.

Legionnaires' disease is not contagious and is easily treatable with antibiotics. People get Legionnaires' disease by breathing in water vapor containing the bacteria. _Legionella_ bacteria are present throughout the environment. Like other types of pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease can be severe and even deadly, especially for people of advanced age and those with a compromised immune system.

Authorities say an average of 200 to 500 Legionnaires' cases are reported in New York city annually, and the Department of Health routinely evaluates the plumbing system of all residential buildings with 2 or more cases occurring among residents within one year.

At this time, this is not considered an outbreak or related to cooling towers.

The agency has notified elected officials and the community board, and has notified tenants by putting flyers in each apartment. A total of 3 buildings share the same plumbing system.

Additionally, because of the community cluster in CO-OP City in 2014 associated with a cooling tower, the health department is proactively sampling active cooling towers in the vicinity.

Individuals at higher-risk include those aged 50 or older (especially if they smoke cigarettes), people with chronic lung disease, and those with compromised immune systems. People in these groups should take the following precautions:
- Don't take a shower, even a cool shower, since it could create water vapor (mist). Instead, take a bath, but fill the tub slowly. Try to minimize your time in the bathroom while the tub is filling.
- It's fine to wash dishes, but fill the sink slowly to avoid creating mist.
- It's fine to drink cold water from the tap, but start with cold water when heating water for tea, coffee or cooking.
- You do not need to wear a mask.
- It is important to continue to wash your hands.

After the outbreak in the South Bronx in 2015, the health department announced a comprehensive plan to reduce the risk of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in the city, including implementation of the toughest cooling tower regulations in the nation, the hiring of more inspectors and training of existing city personnel to inspect towers if needed, expanding lab capacity, and speeding up community notification.

[CO-OP City (short for Cooperative City), located in the Baychester neighborhood in the northeast Bronx borough of New York City, is the largest cooperative housing development in the world. CO-OP City, with a population of 43 752 residents, is the largest single residential development in the United States; it is situated on 20 percent of 320 acres of what was previously a swamp, constructed between 1966-73, with 15 372 residential units, in 35 high-rise buildings, from 24 to 33 floors high, and 7 clusters of townhouses (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-op_City,_Bronx). CO-OP City also has 8 parking garages, 3 shopping centers, a high school, 2 middle schools and 3 grade schools, 6 nursery schools and day-care centers, a power plant, a 4-story air conditioning generator, a firehouse, office space for doctors, lawyers, and other professionals, at least 15 houses of worship, and an adjacent shopping mall with a 13-screen multiplex movie theater, department stores, and a supermarket (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-op_City,_Bronx). A map of the Bronx showing the location of CO-OP City can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Co-Op+City,+Bronx,+NY+10475.

People usually acquire _Legionella_, the cause of legionnaires' disease, after inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, frequently from a building's cooling tower. The news report above says that because the affected building in CO-OP City does not have a cooling tower, the source of this outbreak of legionellosis is not thought to be related to cooling towers. However, the infection can possibly be acquired by inhaling contaminated aerosols wafted on air currents downwind from buildings in the vicinity that do have cooling towers. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passers-by who were walking on Broad Street in front of the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 legionnaires' disease outbreak occurredl, but who had never entered the hotel (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

Also _Legionella_ can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as very debilitated people. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 3 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
