[The New World screwworm, _Cochliomyia hominivorax_, is a primary parasite of warm-blooded animals. Before its eradication from North and Central America, it caused devastating losses among livestock and wild animals. In its natural state it is alive only on the living flesh of mammals and birds. The damaging effect of the screwworm is easily seen on domestic animals.
