Another five confirmed cases of dengue fever were reported from various
hospitals in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed
cases to 36 this year. This information was released by Dr. Harsh Vardan,
Minister of Health in Delhi.
Malaria and dengue have also been reported from adjacent states. One death
due to _Plasmodium vivax_ infection was reported from Ballabhgarh, while
at least five other patients were undergoing treatment.
Control measures have been stepped up for the past two months and both the
government and the public appear to be actively involved in ensuring that
the breeding places of mosquitoes are reduced. There appears to be no
cause for panic this year.
