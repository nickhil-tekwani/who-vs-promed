AVIAN INFLUENZA (82): VIET NAM, VACCINE PROBLEM

Last month [April 2007], Vietnamese authorities halted the use of an
Italian vaccine against bird flu strain H5N9 for geese, as the liquid
serum had settled into layers of distinct colors inside the sealed
bottles. In response, Merial, the Italian company that sold the
vaccines, said the phenomenon is normal and the bottles must be
shaken before use, a fact indicated on the bottle instructions.
Before the ban, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health and Merial's
distributor in Viet Nam, Viphavet, also had [an argument] over quantity.
The vaccine is distributed in 500 ml-serum bottles, which contain
1000 doses (the ministry bought 9 million doses in 2006). This
packaging format is suitable for the crowded farms in the north of
the country. In the south, however, the farms are small and
households raise just a few geese each.] Southern localities
protested they could not use the large volume of doses [being
supplied], prompting the ministry to ask Merial to [repackage the
doses in smaller vials,] while ensuring the same quality.
Viphavet did not officially reply whether it had agreed to the new
bottling protocol, and by that time, the serum [had settled] into
layers, making it difficult for it to be blended back [this statement
does not agree with the one above stating that it can be blended by
simply shaking the bottle. - Mod.JW].
Experts said [that as a result of] the ban, the time between
vaccinations has been prolonged, which could nullify the effect of
the inoculations.

[Failure to read the label and to strictly follow instructions can
ruin an important vaccination campaign.
The situation described will sound very familiar to anyone involved
in animal mass vaccinations, irrespective of species, geography,
disease, and vaccine type. Most vaccine manufacturers will instruct
vaccinators to discard the remaining vaccine in a partly used vial or
bottle; this has, obviously, practical and economic implications.
Some producers will allow -- with selected vaccines -- the continued
use of the same vials/bottles in adjacent farms but only during a
limited time-span. This will rarely be the case with freeze-dried,
live-attenuated vaccines, which have to be diluted and kept chilled.
In tropical and subtropical regions, the cold-chain for vaccines is a
basic requirement.
Ideally, packaging formats should be available according to the
relevant farming systems; this has its price: so we are back to economy.
Last but not least, a reminder: vaccines should be approved for use
only if they are registered and their manufacture, testing, bottling,
labeling (including user instructions), and distribution are
officially approved, certified, and controlled by the State
authority. The field application of the vaccine in compliance with
the instructions, should be controlled by the veterinary authority. - Mod.AS]
