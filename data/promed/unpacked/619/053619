The Temporary Control Zone in Norfolk has been lifted this evening
[13 Sep 2007] following negative laboratory results for foot and
mouth disease (FMD).
The current disease situation remains that one case of FMD has been
confirmed on a farm in Surrey and, as previously announced, animals
at a farm adjacent to the infected premises are also being
slaughtered on suspicion of disease.
Initial sequencing tests of the virus have shown it to be type 01
BFS67. This is the strain found in the August 2007 outbreak. A full
epidemiological investigation into the source of the outbreak is ongoing.

Tests have shown that the latest outbreak of FMD in Surrey involves
the same strain that infected herds last month [August 2007]. Chief
vet Debby Reynolds said the strain found at Egham was "generally" the
same as the strain from Pirbright research site, 10 miles away.
The government is facing criticism that it was too quick to declare
Britain FMD-free last week [3-7 Sep 2007].
A movement ban is in place, and the EU has stopped animal exports.
The infected cattle in the latest outbreak are on a farm 10 miles
from the Pirbright site, and the disease was confirmed only a week
after the previous restrictions on cattle movements were
lifted. Surrey County Council said the area at the centre of the
outbreak is grazing land attached to Milton Park farm, while the
animals on the land are owned by Hardwick Park farm. A 10 km (6.2
mile) control zone has been set up around the area.
Cattle and pigs at another farm nearby were also being slaughtered on
suspicion of infection, Defra said.
Chief vet Dr Debby Reynolds said up to 300 cattle were being culled
on the farm and a "small number of pigs."
The president of the National Farmers' Union has spoken of "the real
state of despair" among his members.
Protection zone: all premises containing livestock will be inspected
by vets and will be subject to restrictions on movements of animals,
animal products, some vehicles, and some activities.
Surveillance zone: restrictions on movements of susceptible animals,
animal products, manure, and some activities. No restrictions on the
movement of non-susceptible animals, such as pets, vehicles, or on
slaughter for private consumption.
Peter Kendall said this latest outbreak was "much worse" than last
month's [August 2007] because it had come at a time when livestock
farmers needed to move their animals and send them to market. Mr
Kendall attended an emergency meeting of politicians, animal health
experts and officials, chaired by the prime minister, to plan the
government's next response to the outbreak.
Earlier, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said there was "absolutely
no truth" in Conservative leader David Cameron's suggestion that the
chief veterinary officer had been pressured to declare Britain clear
of the disease too soon for economic reasons. He said immunisation of
livestock was being considered.
"The puzzling thing is it's more than 30 days since the last
confirmed outbreak. The incubation period for foot and mouth is 2 to
14 days," he said.

The Crown Estate has asked the public to support its decision to
close the majority of Windsor Great Park for general public
access. Measures, including placing disinfectant pads at park gates,
were immediately introduced upon news of the outbreak at a farm near Egham.
But the moves were strengthened last night (Wed 12 Sep 2007) as the
Crown Estate announced that the Windsor Half Marathon, the Ladies 10
k Run and a number of guided walks would not go ahead. A
spokesperson for the Crown Estate said: "Signs are being put up, and
we hope that people will understand that these measures must be put in place."
The full statement, which includes a list of the areas of the royal
park now closed, reads: "The Windsor Estate falls within the 10-km
radius surveillance zone set by DEFRA today following the outbreak of
FMD in Egham, Surrey. We will be cooperating fully with DEFRA on
this. Following recent news from DEFRA that this is a confirmed case
of FMD, The Crown Estate has decided now to close the majority of
Windsor Great Park for general public access, in the interests of
protecting tenant farm stock and Crown Estate livestock. The closure
is likely to remain in force until further advice has been received
from DEFRA suggesting that it is safe to reopen. We will inform the
public when the park will reopen via the local media and our website.
The areas closed to the public include: The Long Walk from Albert
Road to the Copper Horse statue, The Deer Park, The Savill Building
and Savill Garden, Virginia Water, Valley Gardens plus all car parks
servicing these areas (Blacknest, Wheatsheaf/Virginia Water, Valley
Gardens and Savill Garden). Stag Meadow, the north section of the
Long Walk remain open to the public. In addition, all events due to
take place in the park in the near future have been cancelled,
including the Ladies 10k run on 29 Sep 2007 and Windsor Half Marathon
on 30 Sep 2007. The 3 guided walks due to take place over the next 2
weeks have also been cancelled."
Race director Peter Hier told the Observer today [Thu 13 Sep 2007]
that neither the Windsor Half Marathon nor the Ladies 8k Run could be
relocated or rescheduled this year.

[Generally, sheep are regarded as FMD virus (FMDV) "maintenance
hosts;" pigs are FMDV "amplifiers," and cattle are "indicators."
Though deer have been found experimentally to be less effective
disseminators of FMDV than domestic ruminants, they are susceptible
to disease and should not be excluded as potential vectors.
Certainly, this is one of the issues currently being investigated in Surrey.
The worst-case scenario will be the involvement of pigs, which are
extremely prolific virus producers. - Mod.AS]
