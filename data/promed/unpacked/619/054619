Light leaf spot levels highest since 1995
-----------------------------------------
Light leaf spot in oilseed rape is at its highest level since the
epidemic of 1995 a Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs]-funded survey of commercial oilseed rape crops has revealed.

In autumn 2008 light leaf spot affected 9 percent of crops and 1.8
percent of plants (compared with 12.2 percent of crops and 1.7
percent of plants in 1995). Incidence of the disease last autumn
[2008] was also markedly higher than the long-term mean. Crops in the
south east have been affected at this growth stage for the 1st time
since 1997.

Regional analysis confirms trends noted in previous years with the
highest incidence of disease recorded in the north and some in the
West Midlands, says the Central Science Laboratory [DEFRA], which
conducted the survey as part of its Crop Monitor service.

Growers are advised that as light leaf spot remains active at very
low temperatures, the cold weather could lead to more damaging
attacks of the disease than usual. Fungicide use last autumn [2008]
was low because of the later sowing and the slow development of phoma
leaf spot.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In the UK, it has been reported to cause
considerable yield losses of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_) of up to
1.5 t/ha estimated at [GBP] 40 million [approx. USD 57 million] per
year.

Leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless
until lesions appear on older leaves. Developing pods are often
infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. LLS
is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer
oilseed rape, and vegetable brassicas. Disease management includes
varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, disease
monitoring, and timely fungicide applications.

Phoma leaf spot and stem canker (blackleg) is caused by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_. For more information see link below.
