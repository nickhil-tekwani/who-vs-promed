Obviously, e-mail does not like tables. Please find below the content of the
table (or what was supposed to be a table):

We apologise for the inappropriate presentation in the initial message. [No
need to apologize, this happens all the time. Your latest submission is in a
very useable format. Thanks for taking the time. -- Mod CHC]
re: Moderator's question as to the Pacific DEN-2 virus outbreak: "Will this
epidemic be monitored to death or are some intervention methods being
applied?"
Each country applies intervention methods according to the guidelines in use,
and within its [the country's] possibilities. Also, information exchange
through the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network has favoured the
pooling of extra resources --e.g., in equipment and insecticides--for
supporting the control efforts of countries like in the Cook Islands.
It is worth notice that following the early warning and update messages on
dengue sent to the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network -- includes all
the Heads of Health services of the Pacific countries and territories --
preventive actions were taken in several countries "at risk" like Fiji, where
an extension of the actual epidemic was/is possible -- due to various factors
such as the susceptibility of its population to DEN-2 virus, post-cyclonic
conditions and recent heavy rains, and its situation as transit point for
many air travelers. Avoiding an epidemic is probably the best intervention
that could be done.
On the other hand, although DEN-2 cases are still diagnosed in New Caledonia,
their number remains low and there is no such an outbreak as in 1995 or 1996.
This is probably the result of good vector control activities.
To conclude, we also would like to refer to the recent message posted by our
colleague Scott Richie [Dengue - Pacific area (02) 970429121853] from
Cairns, Australia, to emphasise that interventions do obviously take place in
the Pacific, and that the ultimate aim of our network is to favour
appropriate intervention, [Not to "monitor to death", which were my poorly
chosen words. -- Mod] As Scott said, "Perhaps we were all too busy to
notify". But of course we very much value and appreciate a critical look on
the outputs.
