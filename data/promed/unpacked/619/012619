The Kruger National Park [KNP] is recovering from an outbreak of anthrax, which occurred earlier this year [2012]. The waterborne disease mostly affected buffaloes. [Read on for explanation. - Mod.MHJ]

The park last experienced a similar outbreak in 2010 and this time it had a negative effect on visitors. The park's northern section manager Ben van Eeden says they have now purified the affected water sources. The Kruger Park receives just under 300 000 tourists a year.

At the same time, the Limpopo Tourism Agency says it aims to use this month [September 2012] to increase the number of domestic visitors to all tourist destinations, this as the country is observing Tourism Month.

[The outbreak in roan antelope appears to be over, and from this report has been replaced by buffaloes dying.

For those puzzled by the comment above about water being a source of infection, the following should be of interest: "While most animals are susceptible to the disease, kudu, waterbuck, roan antelope, and buffalo are more vulnerable to infection due to their feeding habits. Birds cannot be affected, but vultures, especially, are known as carriers of the spore. After feeding on an infected carcass, vultures wash themselves and defecate in shallow, stagnant pools and so shed millions of spores in the water where the spores then usually settle at the bottom of the pool. The herd activity of buffalo in these pools stirs the spores to the surface where, mostly the bigger bulls drink. This year (2010), notably half of the number of carcasses found was buffalo." [see ProMED-mail 20101105.4011]

This was 1st noted in Namibia about 50 years ago with small ponds and cattle troughs getting contaminated, and later confirmed in South African parks. The problem appeared when the park authorities installed water troughs to delay the seasonal migration out of the park (and away from tourists) at the beginning of the dry season. And vultures will fly fair distances, up to 10 km (6.2 mi), to bathe at a preferred site. We, Jason Blackburn and myself, have noted the same risk of contaminated sediment in water troughs in west Texas, where the turkey buzzards would have bathed themselves after feeding on the infected cow carcass laid out nearby. However it is a temporary contamination lasting probably only a few months, that is, 12 months later it was negative.

A good brief review of anthrax in the KNP is provided on their website at http://www.krugersafari.com/anthrax.html:
"Anthrax is an acute fatal bacterial disease with almost worldwide distribution. Outbreaks tend to occur in cycles of between 5 and 20 years, and the Lowveld is no exception. In the past, the Kruger National Park has experienced several major epidemics of this disease, which were documented in the early 1960s, early 1970s, and again in the early 1990s. All mammals (including man) are susceptible, but some (such as kudu and buffalo) are more vulnerable than others. To date, mortalities have been confirmed in 9 species. The disease is spread to water points by scavengers, and vegetation is contaminated by blow flies. Resistant bacterial spores may remain dormant in the soil for many years, until certain environmental factors trigger another outbreak. In most species, the major clinical sign of anthrax is a sudden death, and frequently, dark tarry blood leaks from one or more of the body openings. Lions may become infected when feeding on anthrax carcasses, and in infected lions, the head and face are frequently swollen. Although this disease is invariably fatal, history has shown that anthrax functions as a natural population control mechanism in wildlife, with minimal risk of species extinction." - Mod.MHJ
