A suspected outbreak of anthrax disease, which is zoonotic in domestic animals, is reported to have appeared in some parts of Longleng District in Nagaland, in which several cattle, mithun and goats have died. According to official sources, Longleng District Commissioner M. Shayung Phom in an order has imposed a ban on slaughtering, selling and importation of cattle, mithun and goats with immediate effect until further order.

The DC Longleng stated that "necessary action against defaulters will be initiated as per the prevention and control of infectious and contagious diseases in animal Act 2009 and other relevant sections of law," sources said.

[This is a truncated report, as we were unable to get access to the full UNI report. Clearly samples have been submitted to the appropriate state diagnostic laboratory and the results are awaited.

Nagaland is one of the easternmost states of India. Longleng district is one of the 11 districts of Nagaland. It is the 8th least populous district in the country (out of 640). The people of that district are known as Phom; they are one of the major tribes of Nagaland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longleng_district).

Although livestock is highly characteristic of the high Himalayan way of life in general, with yaks and sheep being predominant species until recently, the mithun, or gayal (_Bos frontalis_), is the most prominent animal exploited by Eastern Himalayan groups. The mithun is a semi-domesticate, managed in fenced tracts of forests rather than being kept in or near villages. Outside northeast India, mithun are primarily imported for the purpose of cross-breeding with other bovids, for example, in Bhutan. It is very common among Eastern Himalayan languages to find lexical sets denoting fauna in which the mithun is lexicalized as a "prototypical" meat animal, with all other terms being derived. Terms for "mithun" in other languages of Arunachal Pradesh are typically cognate with Aka fu, suggesting that this is probably not a case of semantic shift from a wild species. The implication is that the semi-wild mithun was seen as the core species, and the true domesticates such as cattle, which arrived subsequently, as marginal to the system.

In Nagaland, the animals are kept semi-wild and live in herds, being watched over by special caretakers assigned by the villages or the owner of the herd. They respond to a horn kept specially for the individual caretaker or actual owner to call them. From birth until the time of butchering or market, the mithun remain in the herd, and roam mostly freely throughout the forests.

The gayal is the state animal of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. Gayals play an important role in the social life of the people in Arunachal Pradesh. Marriages are not fixed until the bridegroom's family gives at least one gayal to the bride's household. Gayals are left in the forest, where they usually stay within a small perimeter. Females are usually aggressive when with calves, and there are instances known when people have been severely injured after being gored by one. Males are usually more docile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayal).

As cattle, goats, and mithun have different feeding habits -- cattle are grazers; goats, browsers or bushes and shrubs; and mithun, forest feeders -- this is not a minor trivial outbreak in some village community. The report noted it occurred in "some parts" (plural) of Longleng. We must await further clarification.

Between January 2010 and December 2019, OIE has no reports of anthrax for Nagaland, and the zoo tiger was only a suspected anthrax case (see Anthrax - India (11): (Nagaland Zoological Park) tiger, susp, RFI 20181012.6087688). So they are either underobserving anthrax cases if they are occurring, which would also presume underdiagnosing. On the other hand, anthrax may be truly absent from Nagaland. Thus, confirmation or not is important. - Mod.MHJ
