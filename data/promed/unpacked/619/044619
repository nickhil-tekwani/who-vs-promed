More people have tested positive for salmonella following a sickness outbreak linked by health officials to a spicy food street festival. The total affected with sickness and diarrhea has risen from 200 to 250 since figures were released on Thursday [7 Mar 2013] after the Street Spice event last week [28 Feb-2 Mar 2013] in Newcastle.

Health officials said that 8 people had tested positive for salmonella, which has doubled from the 4 already announced. Newcastle City Council is trying to identify the source of the sickness which has struck down some of the 12 000 people who attended the event. Officials want anyone who was there, whether they fell ill or not, to complete a confidential online questionnaire at http://tinyurl.com/streetspice.

Stephen Savage, director of regulatory services and public protection, said: "The event organizers are cooperating fully and we are continuing to investigate the source of the outbreak. "Please can anyone with symptoms contact Regulatory Services and Public Protection at the City Council on 0191 278 7878."

Dr Kirsty Foster, of the Health Protection Agency and chair of the outbreak control team, said: "Initial investigations have not yet identified a definite source of infection however we are working closely with the organizers of the event to determine the source of infection. "Anyone who is concerned about symptoms suggesting salmonellosis should contact their GP or out of hours service in the 1st instance. Those affected should not return to their place of work until their symptoms have ceased for 48 hours."

[The epidemiological investigation to try to pin down the food vehicle of this expanding outbreak is ongoing and ProMED-mail awaits more information including the serotype of _S. enterica_ identified.

This outbreak is reminiscent of the Chicago, Illinois (USA) outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg in 2007 when more than 700 persons became ill. The vehicle was found to be hummus, a creamy puree of chickpeas and tahini (sesame seed paste) seasoned with lemon juice and garlic, and a popular spread and dip in Greece and throughout the Middle East. - Mod.LL
