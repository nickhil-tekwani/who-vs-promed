The source of the contamination that sickened well over 100 in
northern Saratoga Springs remains a mystery. The _Campylobacter_
bacterium was most likely spread through the city's water supply. But
as yet, water department crews have been unable to even find evidence
that the bacteria was in the water, let alone its source.

"What we think might have happened is a one time contamination." said
Lance Madigan of the Utah County Health Department. Still, he said we
may never know for sure. "It takes a few days for people to get sick.
a few days to go into the doctor, a few days to get the test results
back, a few days for us to get the results. And by the time we go to
test it's not there anymore."

Saratoga Springs Mayor Mia Love said they're not giving up on the
search for answers. Mayor Love said they're even testing the city's
pressurized irrigation system for contamination. One theory is that
somewhere the hookups for the 2, parallel systems might have been
switched causing the contamination.

ABC 4 News will continue to follow the investigation in Saratoga
Spring and will pass along the results.

[It is not clear if the municipal water supply was the source of the
campylobacter outbreak and exactly how many cases and cases confirmed
to be campylobacteriosis were found. Another source may have been the
cause. As can be seen in the report below, no evidence of
contamination of the water supply was found despite the boil water
warning. - Mod.LL]

Northern Saratoga Springs residents will have to continue to boil
their water for a while. Saratoga police spokesman Cpl. Aaron Rosen
said the city is awaiting test results on a well believed to be the
source of a _Campylobacter_ outbreak in the city. The city is
treating the water with chlorine to kill any bacteria.

While the initial hope was to have the well cleared up within 48
hours, Rosen said the city is playing it safe. "We don't want to get
people's hopes up," Rosen said. Once the city gets the all-clear from
the Utah County Health Department, it will let people know they can
use the water again.

Since Thursday night [13 May 2010] , residents have been ordered to
boil water before using it for drinking, cooking or washing.

Lance Madigan, Utah County Health Department spokesman, said the
county found 7 cases of campylobacteriosis. He said the only common
factor was that all 7 people live in northern Saratoga Springs.

The affected subdivisions are Harvest Hills, Aspen Hills, Sunrise
Meadows, Dalmore Meadows, Summer Village, Sunset Haven, Sierra
Estates, Riverbend, The Cove at the Jordan River, The Gables,
Sergeant Court, Daybreak at Harvest Hills, and Hillcrest
condominiums. Westlake High School and Harvest Hills Elementary
School and Lakeview Academy are also in the affected area.

Mount Olympus Waters dispatched a 6000-gallon tanker truck to provide
free water for residents. Larry Mullenax, Mount Olympus vice
president, said the company will provide 2 1-gallon containers of
water per person. But if people bring their own containers, the
company will fill them for free.
