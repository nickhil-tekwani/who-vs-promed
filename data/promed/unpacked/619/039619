- No. 42
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: March 1996).

Emergency report
------------------
Extracts from the monthly reports of Kazakhstan for May to September
1998,
received on 20 Oct 1998 from Dr Shakhaidar J. Tursunkulov, President of
the Veterinary Committee, Ministry of Agriculture, Astana:
Location No. of outbreaks
-------------------------------------------
South Kazakhstan region 1
Dzhambul (Jambyl) region 2
Kzyl-Orda region 1
Alma-Ata (Almaty) region 1
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
-----------------------------------------
species bovine
susceptible ...
cases 172
deaths 172
destroyed ...
slaughtered ...

Causal agent: FMD virus type O.
Control measures during reporting period: the necessary restriction and
sanitary measures were applied.
- Outbreak in South Kazakhstan: quarantine imposed on 25 Apr 1998 and
lifted on 18 May.
- First outbreak in Dzhambul: quarantine imposed on 14 May 1998 and
lifted
on 13 June.
- Outbreaks in Alma-Ata and Kzyl-Orda: quarantine measures lifted on 10
July
1998.
- Second outbreak in Dzhambul: quarantine imposed on 18 Sep 1998.
[As we have noted with late and absent regulatory reports to WHO on a
range
of diseases, the problem is not limited, unfortunately, to diseases
afflicting
humans. While 'better late than never', in the case of such highly
contagious
infections like FMD, delayed reporting helps no one and only reflects
badly on the procastinators - Mod.MHJ]
