U.S. Consulate Mailbag Has Anthrax
---------------------------------------------
MOSCOW (AP) -- A diplomatic mailbag sent from Washington to the U.S.
consulate in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg tested positive for anthrax
[_B. anthracis_] spores, consular officials said Tuesday. The consulate
asked the Russian State Center for Medical-Epidemiological Control to test
6 mailbags after an employee of the State Department's mail facility in
Virginia was diagnosed with anthrax on 25 Oct.
The first round of tests uncovered no traces of anthrax, but a second test
found spores in one of the bags, a consulate statement said. "We understand
that since 2 tests were required to detect spores, the amount of anthrax in
the bag was negligible," the statement said.
One employee at the consulate has been taking antibiotics to ward off the
disease, but he has not shown any symptoms. None of the few dozen employees
has displayed any anthrax or flu-like symptoms, the statement said.
The area of the consulate where the mailbag had been stored was thoroughly
cleaned on 26 Oct and will be cleaned again as a precaution, a consular
spokesperson said. The source of the anthrax was unclear, and the consulate
did not say whether anyone outside the consulate had contact with the
mailbag. The consulate is continuing to work full-time as usual, the
spokesperson said.
A top Russian health official said that as of last week, 252 envelopes
containing suspicious white powder had been received in Russia, but none of
them have proved to contain anthrax.
