Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has been investigating a local hepatitis A outbreak. The outbreak investigation is ongoing. It has been challenging because of the long incubation period of the disease (15 to 50 days) and the difficulty experienced to contact many individuals sickened with the illness who are homeless and/or illicit drug users. To date, no common source of food, beverage, or other cause has been identified; as a result, the source of the outbreak remains undetermined.

Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by county staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office.

The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.

San Diego County Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 15 Aug 2017
-----------------------------
Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations
333 / 11 (3.3%) / 232 (70%)

Please note: Table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county, only those that are local-outbreak-related. Also, data are provisional and subject to change.

[The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A (HAV) in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase.

Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)
---------------------------------
5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)
4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)
31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)
12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)
27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)
26 Jul 2017 / 275 / 194 (71) / 7 (2.5)
1 Aug 2017 / 295 / 202 (68) / 10 (3.4)
8 Aug 2017 / 312 / 215 (69) / 10 (3.2)
15 Aug 2017/ 333 / 232 (70) / 11 (3.3)

In the past week, 21 cases have been reported with one additional death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear whether the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. An epidemiologic curve showing the date of onset of symptoms of cases over time could assist in this regard.

Thus, it remains unclear whether the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear whether the fatalities occurred in those individuals.

Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors, while MSM [men who have sex with men] practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading.
