Two more fatal cases of hantavirus infection have been confirmed in the
interior of Sao Paulo state. They occurred in the beginning of May, in the
rural zone of Guariba municipality. The area is not close to that in which
2 other fatal cases occurred this year.
There is still no information about animal reservoirs in the region.

[We would appreciate it if someone in Brazil or elsewhere could tell us
whether these cases are being investigated epidemiologically? We can only
assume these have been cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. - Mod.CHC
