This property on which both sheep and cattle are run is in the Narrandera
area of western New South Wales in the anthrax belt. Anthrax was last
diagnosed on the property in 2001. Only the cattle [had] been vaccinated
since that time. There were 90 sheep on the property (3 months to 2 years
of age) of which 4 died of anthrax (one ewe and 3 lambs lost over a 3 day
period). Most are lambs ready for slaughter. Clinical signs: Bloody
discharge from crow-picked eye and enlarged spleen. All cases sudden death.
The surviving animals are under quarantine and will be vaccinated and kept
in quarantine for 42 days before they can be sold. Unfortunately for the
owner, the property is drought-affected and there is no feed available.
There is a severe drought in most of NSW.

[From Michael's account the primary diagnosis was made from necropsy
("enlarged spleen") prior to laboratory confirmation at Camden. The
admirable aspect of this outbreak is that action was prompt. All too often
with sheep, help is not sought until the carcass heap (50-100 sheep) cannot
be ignored, by which time the soil contamination is significant, thus
ensuring continuing outbreaks in subsequent years. There are a number of
useful points here:
- 3 lambs and one ewe affected: the majority are 'lambs' which will be some
6+ months old and therefore free of any passive maternal immunity that
might have existed in this flock in spite of their not being vaccinated.
- widespread drought: anthrax outbreaks in dry summers is a constant
phenomenon. The sheep will have grazed whatever they could find right down
to the ground, which increases their chances of ingesting contaminated
soil. Plus the heat stress will have reduced their innate resistance,
thereby allowing a minimal exposure dose to find a less resistant victim.
Traditionally it is held that spores wash down to the lower, moister areas
of a pasture and concentrate there. Whether this is true awaits careful
study. But the survival of itinerant and non-migrant spores will be better
in moist soils for a variety of reasons, including a more even temperature
compared to the wide daily fluctuation in dry soils (cold at night, hot
during the day). The easiest way to remember the epidemiology of anthrax is
that it is based on the probability of effective exposure to an infective
dose of viable spores.
- last (known) outbreak in 2001: many years ago Max Stern told me that from
his experience in Natal in the late 1930s, a pasture would stay
contaminated for between 3 months to 3 years. This obviously relates only
to initial surface contamination and not to animal anthrax graves, which
can remain a risk for decades. My experience with this disease generally
confirms what Max said. This is why it is so important to ensure that herds
and flocks are protected by annual vaccination for at least 3 years after
any sporadic outbreak.
Thanks to Michael for this report. - Mod.MHJ]
