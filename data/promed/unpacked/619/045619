2005/2006 Human Influenza Vaccine Composition: Request for Information
-----------------------------------------------
As a matter of public interest, I would like to pose a question to my
clinical virology colleagues around the world (not to the ProMED-Mail
moderators).
This year's influenza vaccine (2005/2006) composition is: A/New
Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) like strain (used IVR-116),
A/California/7/2004 (H3N2) like strain (used NYMC X-157 derived from
A/New York/55/2004), B/Shanghai/361/2002 like strain (B/Jiangsu/10/2003)
However, in the Adventis Pasteur Vaxigrip influenza vaccine packet
insert, by each strain there is a "**" sign, which is labeled "hemagglutinin."
Therefore, it suggests that this vaccine (which is split virion) does
not contain the N1 component of the H1N1 vaccine, and therefore may
offer no cross-protection against H5N1 via antibodies induced to the
common N1 antigen.
I am not sure what the other influenza vaccines contain in this
regard, and I would like to hear from my clinical virology colleagues
what their experience and thoughts are on this.
