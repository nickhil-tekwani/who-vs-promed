Parasite kills endangered tigers in Pakistan zoo
-----------------------------------------------
A blood parasite that has killed scores of tigers in India and
Bangladesh has now killed 2 endangered Bengal tigers at a zoo in
Pakistan, officials said on Friday [21 Apr 2006]. The tigers died in
Lahore Zoo on Wednesday [19 Apr 2006], victims of the "Trypanosoma"
parasite, which is spread by flies and mosquitoes, Nasir Saleem, a
deputy director of the zoo, said. The parasite is known to have
killed over 100 tigers in India and Bangladesh in the last 6 months.
Zoo director Mohammmad Yousuf Pal said the parasite killed 8 tigers
in Pakistan in 1995 and 1997. "We are taking every precautionary
measure and treatment to ensure it does not become an epidemic in our
country," he said. The Bengal tiger is endangered because of poaching
and loss of habitat, with less than 3000 left in the wild today.
India alone had an estimated 40 000 tigers at the beginning of the
last century.

[In a comment to suspected trypanosomiasis in humans in 2004
(20041216.3323), it was stated that the species of _Trypanosoma_,
such as _Trypanosoma evansi_, are widely distributed in Central and
South America and also Asia and infect domestic and wild animals,
causing animal trypanosomiasis. In the absence of tsetse flies, other
biting flies, such as tabanids and stable flies, are the vectors.
There are many species of trypanosomes, some of which occur outside
Africa. - Mod MS.]
[It is possible that this is _Trypanosomiasis evansi_, but a previous
report of trypanosomiasis in tigers in India (20000724.1224) turned
out be food poisoning. Suspected human cases of trypanosomiasis were
reported from India in 2005 but never confirmed, and ProMED does not
consider human cases to have been confirmed in Southeast Asia. More
information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
