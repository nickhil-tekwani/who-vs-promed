[1] Germany: transportation restrictions to Australian sporting events

Melbourne Cup and Olympic horses await clearance for imports from Germany [this particularly plays into events documented further down in this report - Mod.TG]

The confirmation of a case of glanders in Germany in January 2015 led to a 6-month ban on the export of any horse that had been in Germany in the past 6 months. As well as thoroughbreds aimed at the Melbourne spring [held annually during October and November], the travel ban could affect whether Australian equestrian horses can be brought home from Europe ahead of the Rio Olympics [5-21 Aug 2016].

The restricted period ends on [30 Jul 2015] and the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) declared on [14 Jun 2015] that Germany was free of glanders. However, government protocols have to be followed before the travel ban can be lifted and the Department of Agriculture is not expected to decide how to proceed with the matter until next month [August 2015]. This means leading international horse transport company IRT will have to wait for advice as to when it can open its quarantine facility in Germany and transport horses to Australia.

"It is going to be touch and go if [the German horses] can get into the 1st shipment for the [Australian] spring," IRT managing director Chris Burke said. "They have to be quarantined in England and be in there by [9 Sep 2015] for that 1st shipment. It comes down to if the clearances are made in time."

The horses cannot even be moved into quarantine until the ban is lifted because they would compromise all horses coming from Europe, so there are some nervous owners sweating on the decision. The Department of Agriculture has indicated "if there are sufficient surveillance data to confirm the country is again free from glanders, imports from Germany should be able to resume."

"The Department of Agriculture in Australia has to get detailed information from the German department to show that there is not a glanders risk," Burke said. "Apart from the Melbourne Cup [3 Nov 2015] horses, there are dressage horses and show-jumpers that are competing in Europe, which want to return to Australia to compete before Rio. At the moment, any horse that has been in Germany since last November [2014] cannot come out to Australia."

[2] Brazil (Rio de Janeiro): military horses, pre-Olympic event
Date: Tue 28 Jul 2015

The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed on [Tue 28 Jul 2015] that there are 17 diagnosed cases of horses with glanders, not including the 2 diagnosed earlier. All the animals are quarantined in Cananea Island, in Sao Paulo, and will be used for studies of the disease before being terminated. Glanders is a deadly disease for horses, and easily transmitted among animals, through contact with contaminated secretions, urine or feces, for example. Humans can also be infected by contact with contaminated excretions as this is a zoonotic disease. [see below. - Mod>RNA]

A week before the Equestrian test event for the Rio 2016 Games, scheduled for 6 Aug 2015, the outbreak can increase, as there are hundreds of horses undergoing tests after finding an outbreak in the Military Deodoro complex sector 4. This area, the Army Equitation School, is located about 550 m [0.35 mi] from the Olympic Equestrian Centre (COH), where the Olympic tournament will be held next year [2016], for the best horses in the world.

The federal agency did not say how many of the 17 horses isolated on the island are from Deodoro, but there are animals from Rio and other states. The ministry said that despite the new cases, the picture is not epidemic or a threat to health security of Olympic events -- the COH is in sanitary isolation since February [2015]. Next week [week of 3 Aug 2015], 72 international observers will come to Rio de Janeiro to follow the test event, between horsemen, members of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), and equestrian confederations from several countries. Besides getting information about the track details and facilities, the conditions of biosecurity sanitary isolation will be investigated.

The glanders outbreak exposes the fragility of Brazilian sanitary control for the disease. As the national laboratories have not got an ISO certificate for the diagnosis of glanders, the federal government had to send samples of 584 horses from Deodoro to Germany. The Ministry of Agriculture says it is negotiating the delivery of results in the "shortest possible time".

As 14 horses of Deodoro sector 4, the focus of glanders, participated in competitions of the Brazilian Equestrian Society in April [2015], the most traditional country club, located in Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas [Rio de Janeiro], was closed on the night of [Mon 27 Jul 2015] so that their horses could be examined. The direction of the Equestrian Society reported that their animals are [already] subjected to bimonthly glanders tests and there has never been a diagnosis of glanders on the site. The activities and internal tournaments of the club are continuing in spite of the prohibition of entry and exit of horses. Only in cases of need for surgery will horses be allowed to leave the grounds.

[3] Brazil (Rio de Janeiro): 880 horses potentially exposed
Date: Wed 29 Jul 2015
Source: Folha de Sao Paulo [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.JW, edited]
http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2015/07/1662123-as-vesperas-de-evento-teste-ja-sao-880-cavalos-do-rio-com-suspeita-de-doenca.shtml


The Ministry of Agriculture begins on Thu 30 Jul 2015 the 2nd blood draw in Rio horses [potentially exposed to] glanders, an incurable disease transmitted by bacteria that can infect humans. In total, 880 horses are suspected [more likely this is the number of horses exposed - Mod.TG] of having the disease in the city.

As Folha revealed on [Wed 22 Jul 2015], the government suspended the termination of 45 animals suspected of having the same illness at the Army Equitation School in the Deodoro zone west of Rio. There, in all 584 horses are [contacts]. Besides these animals at the Deodoro school, which will host the equestrian test event of Rio-2016 from [6 Aug 2015], another 96 police and military horses and 250 horses of SHB (Brazilian Equestrian Society) have been [exposed to the] disease.

Despite the number, the Ministry of Agriculture does not characterize it as an epidemic and, yes, as a preventive action. According to Folha newspaper, the investigation began after a horse that was in Deodoro between February and November 2014, was diagnosed with glanders in February this 2015. As a result, all horses that may have had contact with the infected horse are being investigated.

In February [2015], 2 horses in Deodoro expressed disease and they were referred to the Cananea Island Quarantine Station, where scientific studies of the disease will be conducted followed by termination of the animals. Currently at the base there are 17 infected horses.

Sought by Folha, the SHB said glanders tests are conducted periodically, every 60 days, by the institution and that the measure taken by the ministry is only preventive. The elite Rio club has the most expensive horses in the city, some valued at BR one million [USD 300 000]. Already the military police said that animals suspected of [exposure to] the disease are isolated and awaiting the [test] results from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Sought by Folha, the International Equestrian Federation said it was advised of the case of possible contamination of glanders, but trusts the Ministry of Agriculture for effective sanitary isolation of the test event. The threat of contamination by the Army horses occurs close to the day of the equestrian test event of the [Rio] Olympic Games in 2016, which will receive national competition horses. The Riding School is 350 meters [0.2 mi] away [550 m according to the report in [2] above], while international protocol determines a minimum radius of 200 meters [0.12 mi] from the event area.

The 1st blood sample from the animals was taken between 3 and 14 Jul 2015, in all 584 horses in the Deodoro Complex, where the school is located. According to military information, the ministry had informed that these animals showed 17 positive results for the disease; another 18 were inconclusive. Because of the collection, the Army rented stalls to separate the animals suspected of the disease. They were assembled outside the school, near the main pedestrian access. The move there is [to make sure that there is] no possibility of contamination of other animal sites.

According to the military, the ministry came to warn the school verbally that 45 horses would be terminated on 22 Jul 2015, because of the proximity to the test event. Therefore, the command Army ordered ditches to be dug to bury the animals, according to an official report to the Folha. The animals would be killed humanely. The same day, Army officials questioned the test because it considered it flawed and, in a meeting between the Ministry of Agriculture and the military, it was decided that a new trial [had to be] done. One day after the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the information [that there would be] a new test.

At the request of the military, [blood] will be sent for analysis with a total of 3 test batteries at a laboratory in Germany, since Ministry of Agriculture laboratories do not yet have an international standard certificate. The result of the 3 batteries should be released in October 2015. [This seems a bit late for the event. - Mod.JW]

[Mormo (in English, glanders) is a contagious infectious disease of equines, acute or chronic, usually fatal, caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, and characterized by the development of ulcerated nodules that are most commonly found in the upper airway, lungs ,and skin. Felines and other animals are susceptible to infection which is usually fatal. Humans can be infected and the microorganism (_B. Mallei_) is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.

The disease, one among the oldest known and that used to be prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently the disease has been reported in some countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, and countries in Africa. Glanders is one of the diseases contained in the list of diseases for mandatory reporting to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).

The bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ a clonal pathogen, can be found in nasal secretions and skin ulcers of infected animals. The transmission of glanders occurs commonly from intake of water or food contaminated with nasal secretions and exudates eliminated from infected animals, contact with contaminated equipment (saddles, harness) and by eating contaminated equine meat. The microorganism is susceptible to heat, light, and disinfectants, but it can survive in contaminated areas for 1-2 months; humidity favors survival of the bacteria. The polysaccharide capsule is an important factor of survival and virulence.

After an incubation period of about 2 weeks, the infected animal usually has a high fever followed by a purulent nasal discharge, respiratory, and septic signs. Death occurs in a few days. Chronic disease is common in horses and presents a set of debilitating symptoms, with nodules and ulcers on the skin and in the nasal cavities; in such situations the infected animal can live for years, continuing to spread the microorganism. In some cases the infection can be latent and persists for long periods. Clinically, the disease can be in the form of nasal, pulmonary, and/or skin.

In the nasal form nodules arise in septum and turbinates. Nodules progress to irregular edged ulcers; star-shaped scars are characteristic after the resolution of the ulcers. In the early stage, submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous, adhering to the skin and deep tissues in advanced stages of the disease. In the pulmonary form, inflammatory nodules with caseous or calcified centers are found in the lungs. With the progression of the disease areas of consolidation and pneumonia may be present. The nodules may break and eliminate the inflammatory content into the bronchial tree, spreading the infection to the upper respiratory tract. In the cutaneous form nodules arise along the lymphatic vessels, especially on the extremities. The nodules may degenerate to form ulcers with drainage of highly infectious purulent material. The liver and spleen may have typical nodular lesions. Histologically, vasculitis, thrombosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration can be seen.

Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation (nodules, ulcers, scarring, impaired general condition of the animal); however, such signs/symptoms can occur late after infection. Laboratory diagnosis should be made as early as possible. Culturing _B mallei_ from lesion material confirms the diagnosis. A delayed hypersensitivity test may be done by inoculation of mallein (a glycoprotein secreted by _B. mallei_) leading to purulent conjunctivitis and edema 24 hours after inoculation. A test based on complement fixation can also be used for screening, but the ELISA test, although more sensitive, is not being routinely used. PCR can be used for specific identification.

There are no vaccines. Prevention and control depend on early detection and eliminating infected animals in addition to quarantine and complete disinfection. Treatment, administered only in endemic areas, which does not lead to microbiological cure, is the use of doxycycline, ceftazidime, gentamycin, or streptomycin. Sulfa drugs (including in combination with trimethoprim) seem to be effective in prevention and glanders treatment. (http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis). - Mod.RNA

A test that may not be validated and putting this number of horses at risk at this critical time is a disaster for Brazil. It will highlight any sanitary problems and laboratory issues as well. The minister was correct to send the samples to a lab approved to test for this disease. Let us sincerely hope these exposed horses are negative on this round of testing. - Mod.TG

"For glanders-free countries, there are [OIE] recommendations on importing equines. An international veterinary certificate is required attesting that the animals showed no clinical signs of glanders and were kept in an exporting country free of the disease for at least 6 months prior to shipment." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/GLA-EN.pdf. It appears foreign horse owners will not be able to comply, therefore will be unable to repatriate their show horses? Further information would be welcome.

OIE WAHID's latest information shows continuing glanders in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states in 2014 (red circles on map; zoom in), but there have been no immediate or continuing event reports for Brazil in 2015. The OIE report and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974. - Mod.JW
