Chronic wasting disease was found in a deer that died this spring near Montrose, prompting officials to offer free testing of roadkill and deer killed by hunters.

Chronic wasting disease affects the brains of deer, elk and moose in North America and is fatal. It causes them to lose coordination and starve. Biologists don't know how the disease is transmitted and there is no proof that eating the meat of affected animals has caused human health problems, said Joe Lewandowski, spokesman for the southwest region of Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

The diagnosis brings to 77 the number of game-management units in which chronic wasting disease has been found. Colorado has 186 game-management units. It's the 1st time a deer infected with the disease has been found in southwest Colorado. Deer harvested or found dead on roads in the 3 game-management units around Montrose -- 62, 64 and 65 -- can be tested at no charge by Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The heads of animals from other units can be tested for $25.

Though the discovery is a 1st for the area, chronic wasting disease has long been known in the northern tier of Colorado counties, Lewandowski said. It's unknown where or how the deer contracted the disease. "It might have wandered down from up north," Lewandowski said.

Wildlife officials were called this spring by a private property owner who said the deer, a buck, seemed sick. The buck collapsed and died within about 10 minutes of biologists' arrival, Lewandowski said. "It's good that we got to it right then," because decomposition can make a necropsy more difficult.

Anyone who sees a deer, elk or moose acting strangely or looking sick is urged to contact the nearest Parks and Wildlife office so a wildlife officer can inspect the animal.

The northwest division of Parks and Wildlife last year offered a drawing for a rifle to encourage hunters to turn in heads for testing. No decision has been made whether to do the same this year, but the agency is establishing a database of affected ungulates, said Mike Porras, spokesman for the northwest region of CPW.

[Chronic Wasting Disease has been found many times in deer and elk in Colorado. This particular region, 77, represents a slight expansion of the disease.

Testing hunter-killed animals and road kill is part of the surveillance of many states. - Mod.TG
