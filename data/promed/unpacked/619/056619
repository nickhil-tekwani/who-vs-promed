Brazil: Rabies Deaths in Para State Following Vampire Bat Attacks
---------------------------------------------------
13 deaths, possibly due to rabies, have occurred in the Amazonian town of
Portel in the state of Para (Northern Brazil). 2 of these deaths have been
confirmed. The others are being studied.
Rabies transmission was due to vampire bat attacks, which are reported as
being not unusual in the area. The outbreak is apparently under control.
More than 680 persons have been vaccinated in the last few days. The last
death occurred on Thu 1 Apr 2004.

[Rabies has not been adequately controlled in some areas of Brazil. During
the course of 2003, there were 17 reported and confirmed human cases,
almost all in the north (Amazonian Region) and northeast. Rabies
transmitted by dogs is rare in other areas of the country, whereas rabies
associated with vampire bat attacks on humans is not infrequent in the
Amazonian region. Such attacks usually occur when bats are deprived of
their usual source of food, such as domestic pigs and cattle. - Mod.LJS]
[Elsewhere (Australia, Chile, Europe, and North America), insectivorous
bats are usually associated with transmission of rabies virus to humans. -
