Horses from Mexico likely source of piroplasmosis outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
Officials believe 2 horses that entered Florida from Mexico are
behind the state's outbreak of piroplasmosis.

It is the 1st time the blood-borne parasitic disease has occurred in
the United States in 20 years. [Not so, there was a case of
piroplasmosis in Indiana in 2004. - Mod.TG]

At its height, 25 properties were under quarantine and about 200
horses were undergoing testing. At one stage, 7 properties had horses
testing positive for the disease.

There are now 13 premises under state quarantine, with only one farm
still having positive horses on the premises.

Florida agriculture officials said premises were being released from
quarantine only after negative testing and an extended time since
exposure to the disease.

The disease can be spread by ticks, but extensive surveillance has
found no evidence of the presence of the types of exotic tick which
carry the disease. Domestic ticks with the potential to carry the
disease have also been tested for piroplasmosis, but the results have
been negative.

The evidence still indicates that transmission of the disease has
been by management practices, possibly involving the use of needles,
and not by a natural tick vector.
