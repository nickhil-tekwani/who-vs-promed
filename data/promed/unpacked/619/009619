Medical Impact of Use of Antimicrobial drugs in Food Animals
WHO Consultation, Berlin, Germany, 13-17 October 1997.

There is increasing concern about the extent to which bacteria pathogenic in
humans have acquired resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Use of
antimicrobial drugs in food animals is known as potentially adding to the
development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of medical relevance.
However, the real scope of the medical impact of the use antimicrobials in
livestock production is generally unknown. WHO intends to organize a
scientific consultation on the medical impact of use of antimicrobial drugs
in food animals in October 1997 in Berlin. The objectives of the
consultation are:

- to review the knowledge of the medical risks regarding
antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of public health significance
associated with the use of different antimicrobial drugs in food
animal production

- in the context of the development of the WHO Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring to define the needs on monitoring
of emergence, mechanisms of development and spread to man of
antimicrobial resistance in food and animals at national and
international levels

- to obtain an international consensus on how to tackle the
identified problems.

WHO will invite about 25 experts in the field of emergence and monitoring
of antimicrobial resistance, infectious control in community settings as
well as on feed additives, food animal production and veterinary medicine,
infectious disease control and antimicrobial resistance monitoring in animal
and food production. Draft scope and purpose of the meeting and a
compilation of the major subject areas to be discussed could be obtained
from the below address. Comments would be appreciated until 15 April 1997.
