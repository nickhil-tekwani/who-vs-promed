In an outbreak that so far has puzzled health officials, a potentially
damaging fungus is infecting the eyes of a small but growing number of
people in South Florida and elsewhere who wear soft contact lenses, Miami
researchers said on Wednesday [29 Mar 2006].
The fusarium fungus typically strikes soft-lens wearers only rarely, but a
dozen [12] in South Florida have been infected since January [2006] in the
biggest reported outbreak in the country, a chief at the University of
Miami's Bascom Palmer Eye Institute said. Federal health officials are
working with local officials to investigate outbreaks here and in other states.
"We have no idea why this is happening to contact lens wearers," said Dr
Eduardo C Alfonso, an eye surgeon and chairman of ophthalmology at Bascom
Palmer. "I'm getting phone calls almost every hour from people around the
country seeing infections among people wearing contact lenses."
In a typical year, Bascom Palmer sees an average of 21 patients with
fusarium infections, virtually all among people with eye trauma that lets
the fungus penetrate the cornea, the eye's clear protective coating. Only a
few patients infected since 2000 have been lens wearers, Alfonso said. But
so far this year, the center already has seen 21 cases, 12 among lens wearers.
The fungus poses a small but real worry for the estimated 29 million
Americans with soft lenses. One possible explanation, Alfonso said, is that
soft lenses that are not cleaned well may not let enough oxygen reach the
eye, causing small damaged areas, especially when worn for long periods of
time. "When you wear a contact lens ... it creates a little trauma on the
surface skin of the eye, so the fungus can get in and cause an infection,"
Alfonso said.
People typically are infected by touching their eyes with fingers that have
come in contact with the fungus, or if the fungus gets on the lens. The
fungus is common in soil and plants in tropical regions like South Florida.
It can also survive in colder climates.
To reduce the risk of infection, Alfonso said, he recommends that wearers
clean their lenses well and not wear them while sleeping, even those models
approved for overnight use.
In February [2006], health officials in Singapore reported 39 cases of
fungal infections among lens wearers, and 3 cases were reported in the New
York metropolitan area. In recent days, Alfonso said, he has heard from eye
specialists in Tampa, Atlanta, Texas and California who also had cases.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of the outbreak
and is working with local health officials to figure out what is happening,
CDC spokeswoman Christine Pearson said. At least 4 research projects have
started in the past 4 weeks in Florida and other states, Alfonso said, and
Johns Hopkins University eye specialists are tracking the outbreaks.
Fusarium is not contagious, but it can be serious. Infections often go
undetected and are hard to diagnose, giving the fungus time to spread. In
severe cases, about 20 percent of the time, the eye becomes so clouded that
the patient requires a cornea transplant.
The condition can be treated with an anti-fungal drug called natamycin, but
it is more difficult to defeat than more benign and common eye infections
caused by bacteria, Alfonso said.
Eye specialists nationally began noticing a slight increase in fusarium
infections about 4 years ago, Alfonso said. But the number of cases made a
big jump since the start of 2006.

Investigators probing the outbreak of fungal keratitis among contact
wearers in Asia are now looking into similar cases reported in the United
States.
It was in [February 2006] when sales of Bausch & Lomb's [B&L] ReNu
multipurpose solution were halted in Hong Kong and Singapore following the
abnormally high number of reports of fungal keratitis in the 2 cities.
In an update on the unusual outbreaks of fusarium keratitis, the global eye
care giant said it was aware of reports of cases in other countries,
including Malaysia and the United States, the former telling B&L to
'ascertain the safety' of its ReNu product. However, this week B&L
commented that initial evidence from Singapore suggests the cause of
infections is not related to a specific lens care product.
According to the Singapore health authorities, most of the contact
lens-related fungal keratitis infections in that country involved patients
with histories of poor contact lens care practices' said a B&L spokeswoman,
adding that the company is implementing consumer education programmes to
raise public awareness of the importance of good hygiene and proper lens care.
As the normal incidence of these infections in many markets is not
well-understood, the company is working with health authorities to improve
reporting of cases, and has contacted corneal specialists and treatment
centres throughout the world to assess whether there are unusual trends in
any other regions.
Laboratories in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the US are culturing clinical
isolates of Fusarium from patient samples to identify the genetic make-up
of the organisms and to determine whether they are different from the
strain used in industry-wide standard biocidal efficacy testing. In
addition, the clinical isolates will be used to conduct biocidal efficacy
testing with all the leading brands of lens care products.
B&L is collaborating with the Singapore National Eye Centre, which is
conducting a case control study to assess whether any common factors,
beyond contact lens wear, existed among the patients with infections.
The company also is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to investigate and track the incidence of these infections
around the world, and has asked the famed Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns
Hopkins University to implement a surveillance program in leading corneal
treatment centres throughout the United States.

[ProMED-mail posted on the increase in fusarium keratitis associated with
contact lens wearers in Singapore (see Fusarium keratitis - Singapore:
alert 20060223.0596 for background and information on the organism
involved). In that report, there was mention of a voluntary recall of the
above-mentioned contact lens solution. Several weeks later, there was an
alert issued on the New York City and New Jersey Health Alert Networks on 3
cases of fusarium keratitis in contact lens wearers seen by a single
provider in the region.
It now appears as though this problem is more widespread, with cases
occurring in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and now multiple states within
the USA. The 2nd article above suggests that the contact lens solution was
"absolved" from culpability. That being said, none of the reports to date
(neither the alerts out of Singapore nor the newswire alerts of the
increased recognition of this problem in the USA) have provided data from
the studies to allow for independent clarification of possible associations.
From all reports available publicly, this increase in fusarium infections
appears to be associated with use of soft contact lenses. There are
multiple types including long-wear disposable, 2-week disposable, and daily
disposable soft contact lenses as well as non-disposable daily-wear soft
lenses. In the 1st category, lenses can be worn up to a month prior to
discarding/changing lenses; in the 2nd category lenses are to be removed
every night, cleaned and soaked in a cleaning solution (such as the
initially implicated solution in Singapore); and in the 3rd case, the
lenses are to be discarded every evening and a fresh pair used the
following day. Long-wear daily lenses are also cleaned nightly and soaked
in a cleansing solution.
Given the paucity of publicly available information on the findings of
investigations to date, ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate information
from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak. Obvious questions surround
what types of contact lenses are being affected, and what ancillary
products appear to be implicated. - Mod.MPP]
