Typhoid fever? - Kenya (Embu): RFI 20010223.0348
Date: Fri, 2 Mar 2001 19:19:35 +0300
From: Sam Kariuki Ph.D. <SKariuki@WTRL.OR.KE>

Our laboratory received 23 blood cultures from the admissions at the Embu
Hospital. 6 of these grew _S. typhi_ that were multiply resistant to
ampicillin, amoxyclav [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. They were
sensitive to nalidixic acid [a quinolone, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin
[a fluoroquinolone. However, the zone sizes [for susceptibility testing by
disk diffusion for nalidixic acid (20 mm) and ciprofloxacin (24 mm) were
much lower than for sensitive _S. typhi_ (32-34 mm). These results have
been passed on to the Ministry of Health for further action. We are also in
the process of doing further molecular analysis to ascertain if this
outbreak was caused by [an earlier isolated MDR [multiply drug-resistant
_S. typhi_ strain from sporadic cases.

[This is the first indication we have had from Kenya that _Salmonella
typhi_ was actually isolated from some of the patients, and ProMED-mail is
grateful for the information from the front lines. - Mod.ES
