A woman, 68, was admitted last Fri 25 Jun [2021] to the Hospital Rio Hortega of Valladolid in Northern Spain with a suspected case of Crimean-Congo fever, which is caused by tick bites.

According to health sources, the woman has been isolated since then, and samples have already been sent to the San Carlos Institute in Madrid. If results come back positive for the disease, then this would be the 2nd case in just over 2 months, as on 26 Apr [2021], the general directorate of Public Health and its Epidemiology Service confirmed one other in the province of Salamanca.

According to the regional government, the patient in Salamanca was a 59-year-old man, a farmer who by profession was in constant contact with animals.

The man had presented to hospital with tick bites, where the appropriate tests were positive for Crimean hemorrhagic fever, or Congo fever, as it is commonly known. This was later confirmed by the San Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid.

Regarding the prevention of tick bites, the health authorities remind everyone of the importance of wearing appropriate clothing and footwear during field trips, as well as using repellants for both people and pets.

They also insist that ticks that may have been attached should be removed as soon as possible and properly, preferably by healthcare professionals. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus, the main transmission mechanism of which is the bite of the _Hyalomma_ genus tick, although it can also be transmitted from person to person through contact with the patient's blood or fluids, which can occur especially in healthcare personnel when they are not properly protected.

On 18 Jun 2021, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 2 cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Spain during 2021. Both cases were identified in the autonomous community of Castile-Leon, the 1st in Salamanca in April [2021], and the 2nd in Leon in June [2021]. Both cases have been linked to tick bites.

On 10 Jun 2021, regional public health authorities of Castile-Leon reported a 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of CCHF in 2021. The case is a woman with epidemiological information suggesting exposure to tick bites in Leon. The case is currently in a stable condition, and close contacts are being followed-up by the regional health authorities. This is the 1st known human case of CCHF in Leon.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered an emerging or even a probable re-emerging pathogen in southern Europe. Presence of this virus had been reported previously in various regions of Spain with a case report from the same region in June 2020 and one case in May 2021 (see https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/publications/hps-weekly-report/volume-54/issue-25/cchf-in-salamanca-spain/), while the new case has been reported from Valladolid, a city in northwest Spain.

Transmission potential of CCHF in potential hot spots can be reduced by timely identification of the disease and implementation of barrier-protection and patient-isolation practices. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

Furthermore, enhanced awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and laboratory confirmation should be emphasized among health-care providers in areas with potential circulation of CCHF virus. Standard precautions, preferably combined with contact and droplet precautionary measures, should be taken when caring for patients presenting with haemorrhagic fever syndrome. Laboratory tests on patient samples present a high risk of transmission and should only be conducted under appropriate biological containment conditions. - Mod.UBA
