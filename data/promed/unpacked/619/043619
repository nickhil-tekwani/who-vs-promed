*** The sales ban would take effect in 2011 for oysters harvested in
the Gulf during warm months.***

Federal officials plan to ban sales of raw oysters harvested from the
Gulf of Mexico [during the warm weather months] unless the shellfish
are treated to destroy potentially deadly bacteria, a requirement that
opponents say could deprive diners of a delicacy cherished for
generations. The plan has also raised concern among oystermen that
they could be pushed out of business.

The Gulf region supplies about two thirds of USA oysters, and some
people in the USD 500 million industry argue that the anti-bacterial
procedures are too costly. They insist adequate measures are already
being taken to battle germs, including increased refrigeration on
oyster boats and warnings posted in restaurants.

About 15 people die each year in the USA from raw oysters infected
with _Vibrio vulnificus_, which typically is found in warm coastal
waters between April and October. Most of the deaths occur among
people with weak immune systems caused by health problems like liver
or kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, or AIDS.

"Seldom is the evidence on a food-safety problem and solution so
unambiguous," Michael Taylor, a senior adviser at the Food and Drug
Administration, told a shellfish conference in Manchester, New
Hampshire, earlier in October 2009 in announcing the policy change.

Some oyster sellers say the FDA rule smacks of government meddling.
The sales ban would take effect in 2011 for oysters harvested in the
Gulf during warm months.

"We have one man who's 97 years old, and he comes in here every week
and gets his oyster fix, no matter what month it is," said Mark
DeFelice, head chef at Pascal's Manale Restaurant in New Orleans.
"There comes a time when we need to be responsible. Government doesn't
need to be involved in this."

The anti-bacterial process treats oysters with a method similar to
pasteurization, using mild heat, freezing temperatures, high pressure,
and low-dose gamma radiation. But doing so "kills the taste, the
texture," DeFelice said. "For our local connoisseurs, people who've
grown up eating oysters all their lives, there's no comparison"
between salty raw oysters and the treated kind.

Treated oysters are "not as bright, the texture seems different," said
Donald Link, head chef and owner of the Herbsaint Bar and Restaurant
in New Orleans.

Until the 1960s, raw oysters were rarely eaten in the summertime. (The
old adage was never eat oysters in the months without an R in them.)
But changes in harvest patterns and advances in refrigeration and
post-harvest treatment have made the industry a year-round business.
About three fifths of the Gulf's oysters are harvested during the warm
months.

The FDA is promoting a ban because high-risk groups are not heeding
warnings about raw oysters, and millions of other people may not know
they are vulnerable. The FDA contends treating oysters would not
affect the taste and would save lives. "Oysters that undergo
post-harvest processing treatment will rarely pose a problem," Taylor
said, "while those left untreated can have deadly consequences." The
FDA cited California as the best example. In 2003, California banned
untreated Gulf Coast oysters and since then "the number of deaths
dropped to zero." By comparison, between 1991 and 2001, 40 people died
in California from the infection.

The rule would not affect oysters harvested outside the Gulf. Oysters
are harvested up and down the West and East coasts, but the bacterium
is not found in such high concentrations there.

[ProMED-mail thanks Celeste Whitlow for contributing this posting. It
is important to note that not all cases of _V. vulnificus_ infection
are acquired by eating raw oysters. The disease can also be acquired
from saltwater exposure itself and has also been linked to other
bivalve molluscs such as clams.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic [salt-loving],
Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine
environments and associated with various marine species such as
plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams and crabs), and finfish. It is
found in all of the coastal waters of the USA, usually in the warmer
areas of the Gulf Coast. Cases of illness have also been associated
with brackish lakes in New Mexico and Oklahoma. Environmental factors
responsible for controlling members of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and
in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased
dissolved organics.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with
seawater harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on
coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The
ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemic" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with
underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism
can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the
microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock,
rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 per cent). Over 70
per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions
(shown at

A reasonable discussion of the disease in humans can be found in
ProMED-mail posting "Vibrio vulnificus, salt water exposure - USA (TX)
20070719.2317". There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are
normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage
contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur
in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including
immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes.
So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range
of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern
geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.
