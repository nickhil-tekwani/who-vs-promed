Meningitis Outbreak Prompts Italian Region to Consider Mass Vaccination
---------------------
Health authorities in northern Italy are considering a mass
vaccination program against meningitis after an upsurge of the
disease in Lombardy.
"There is no reason to dramatize: so far the recorded cases are
within the norm. But if more cases are reported in the coming days,
we will evaluate the possibility of vaccination for people at risk
and children," Dr. Vittorio Carreri, director of the Lombardy Region
Health Prevention Unit, told Reuters Health.
Despite a [meningococcal] meningitis C vaccination campaign that was
launched in September 2002 in Lombardy, fear of the infection has
spread in the region around Milan. In the villages of Abbiategrasso
and Magenta, 6 kilometers from Milan, 7 cases have been recorded in a
month. In the case of a 15-year-old boy, the disease has been fatal.
The specific pathogen responsible for these cases has yet not been
identified. The results of the tests will be available in the next
few days, Dr. Carreri said. Last year Lombardy recorded 187 cases of
meningitis.

Steep Increase in Meningitis Seen in France
---------------------------------------------
France has recorded a sharp in cases of invasive meningococcal
disease for the year 2002 so far. The French Health Watch Institute
(InVS) announced on Wed, 4 Dec 2002, a 32 percent increase since last
year.
The rate of [meningococcal] meningitis C infection rose from 0.14 per
100 000 people to 0.35 per 100 000 between 1996 and 2001, a return to
pre-1990 levels, said Isabelle Bonmarin of the InVS. "So far this
year, the rate is now 0.47 per 100 000."
"Type C, which represents 43 percent of all cases in 2002 according
to provisional data, is on the increase while Type B is on the
decline," she explained.
Bonmarin said the InVS would issue a meningitis alert where there
were 2 cases per 100 000 among inhabitants in areas where 5 cases had
been recorded over the previous 12 months. The alert procedure would
allow time for figures provided by regional health authorities to be
double checked, taking into account, for example, people who had
recently traveled. One problem, she explained, was that in such cases
the incidence was recorded in the patient's hometown rather than
where the disease was actually contracted.
Bonmarin told Reuters Health that access to vaccinations would not be
restricted to any threshold, although she admitted this position
could change. France regularly organises vaccination programmes in
response to particular incidences of [meningococcal] meningitis C in
particular areas and often at the start of the new school year,
targeting those off to college.
A 3-month pilot meningitis C vaccination campaign was launched on 21
Oct 2002 in the Landes, Pyrenees-Atlantiques, and Hautes-Pyrenees
regions among 300 000 people aged between 2 months and 25 years.
Bonmarin said information had been more readily available during a
similar program in the Puy-de-Dome in January 2002 because the
targeted population was smaller.

New guidelines for public health management of meningococcal disease
-----------------------
Newly revised guidelines for the public health management of
meningococcal disease have been published in the United Kingdom, as a
result of recent changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal
disease, together with the introduction of new vaccines and an
accumulation of new evidence on risk evaluation and control methods
(1). The guidelines cover pre-admission management, investigation of
suspect cases, the role of public health, public health action after
a single case, prophylaxis in healthcare settings, and the management
of clusters. The guidance contains detailed revisions on the use of
antibiotics before admission to hospital, the rationale and
indications for chemoprophylaxis, and the use of new vaccines. All
recommendations within the review are graded according to the level
of evidence on which they are based, probably the first European
guidelines to do so (2).
