A farmer is the 6th victim of hantavirus infection in Bolivia
-------------------------------------------------------------
LA PAZ: Health officials reported today that a 25 year old is the 6th victim
of [a hantavirus infection since the beginning of this year; 2 of [the 5
other cases have died. The new case appeared in Bermejo, 1700 kilometers
to the south [of La Paz}, a town located on the border with Argentina where
5 people were reported with the disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome?, 2
of whom have died. The farmer was transferred to Oran, a northern Argentine
city, where he is receiving medical attention. His situation is stable.
Hantaviruses [are transmitted by rodents and [virus infection may cause
damage to lungs and kidney - the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The primary
symptoms are fatigue, fever and intense abdominal pains. People are infected
when [they come into contact with materials contaminated with urinary or
fecal waste of infected rodents. According to the authorities, intensive
hunting of vipers and other natural predators of these [rodent hosts is one
of the [factors promoting spread of [human infection. Recent sanitary
studies have identified Bermejo as an endemic zone [for hantavirus
infection. The Minister of Health, Guillermo Cuentas, stated today that it
is possible that there will be more cases presenting in the future.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first recognized as a consequence of
infection with the hantavirus now known as Sin Nombre virus. Subsequently
several distinct hantaviruses, associated with different rodent hosts and
with different geographical ranges, have been identified throughout the
Americas. The nucleocapsid antigen of Sin Nombre virus, however, reacts
with antibodies to all the presently known Western Hemisphere hantaviruses.
It would be useful to have precise information on the identity of the
hantavirus (and its specific host) associated with these cases of
presumptive hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in southern Bolivia and, in
particular, it relationship to the virus responsible for cases of human
infection in adjacent regions of northern Argentina. (For the record, a
correspondent has pointed out that Bolivia was omitted from the list of
countries reproduced in the Moderator's comment to the post entitled
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: update, 7 Dec 2000). - Mod.CP
