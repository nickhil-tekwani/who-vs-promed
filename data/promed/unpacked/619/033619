A total of 15 cases of cholera have been found in the largest prison in Havana, the Combinado del Este, reports the independent agency Hablemos Press, which quoted sources within the prison. The cases, several reported as serious, were transferred from the intensive care room at the National Hospital of Inmates to the IPK (Institute of Tropical Medicine Pedro Kouri), as well as to hospitals such as Calixto Garcia and Salvador Allende.

In a telephone conversation with [an inmate], it was also made clear that 2 ambulances from the Emergency Medical System (SIUM) went to the prison with remarkable speed and toward the hospital center known as the Covadonga with 2 infected inmates who were in critical condition.

According to the report, by 1 Sep 2013, there were 53 cases with diarrheal symptoms, although it is not known how many of them were placed in quarantine. Another of the measures in force was the partial restriction of the visits and the entry of food and beverages brought by the families of prisoners, with the aim of avoiding contamination from the outside.
