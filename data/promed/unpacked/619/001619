Abstract

Background
The medium and long-term effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection on survivors are unknown. Here we studied the medium-term effects of COVID-19 on survivors of severe disease.

Methods
This is a retrospective, case series of 200 patients hospitalised across 3 large Birmingham hospitals with severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection 4-7 months from disease onset. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical, laboratory, imaging, lung function test, quality of life and cognitive assessments.

Results
At 4-7 months from disease onset, 63.2% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness, 53.5% complained of significant fatigue, 37.5% reduced mobility and 36.8% pain. Serum markers of inflammation and organ injuries that persisted at hospital discharge had normalised on follow-up, indicating no sustained immune response causing chronic maladaptive inflammation. Chest radiographs showed a complete resolution in 82.8%; and significantly improved or no change in 17.2%. Lung function test (LFT) revealed gas transfer abnormalities in 80.0% and spirometry in 37.6% patients. Patients with breathlessness had significantly high incidence of comorbidities, abnormal residual chest X-ray and LFT (p under 0.01 to all). In all parameters assessed and persisting symptoms there was no statically significant difference between patients managed on hospital wards and on ITU groups. All patients reported a significantly reduced quality of life in all domains of the EQ-5D-5L quality of life measures.

Conclusions and Relevance
A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe illness experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, pain, reduced mobility, depression, and reduced quality of life at 4-7 months from disease onset. Symptomatic patients tend to have more residual CXR and LFT abnormalities.

[Even though noting abnormalities 4-7 months from disease onset of patients with severe disease, these investigators found that most COVID-19 survivors had good recovery from their illness and complete resolution of laboratory and imaging abnormalities. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients continued to experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, pain, and reduced quality of life. - Mod.UBA]

A team of scientists from the United States has recently compared the immune response elicited by natural severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Their findings reveal that, unlike vaccination, natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a robust interferon response together with an induction of cytotoxic gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.

Background
Since its emergence in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found associated with highly heterogeneous clinical presentation, ranging from mild illness to acute respiratory distress, severe cardiovascular complications, multiorgan failure, and death.

Regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, studies have shown that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients present with lymphopenia, which is defined as a lower than normal level of blood lymphocytes. Moreover, alterations in the level and activity of specific immune cells, such as activated CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, plasma cells, and monocytes, have been found to influence the clinical consequences of COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 recovered patients, robust memory B, and T cell responses together with neutralizing antibody response has been observed.

Because of its significant involvement in the virus entry into host cells, the spike glycoprotein on the SARS-CoV-2 envelop is considered to be the most immunogenic component. This makes the protein the primary target for vaccine development. Studies investigating anti-COVID-19 immunity have shown that both natural infection and vaccination induce a strong protective immune response against the spike protein.

In the current study, the scientists have performed multimodal, single-cell sequencing to characterize and compare the host immune responses induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination.

Study design
For single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA sequencing, the scientists collected blood samples from 5 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 3 BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals, and 2 individuals without infection or vaccination. They performed a multiplex bead-binding assay to measure the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals.

The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine that contains a prefusion-stabilized full-length spike protein as a vaccine antigen.

Important observations
By conducting sequencing analysis, the scientists characterized transcriptional profiles and surface marker phenotypes in peripheral blood immune cells isolated from COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. The findings revealed a significant difference between immune responses induced by natural infection and vaccination.

Specifically, the scientists observed that the frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and key myeloid cells (monocytes and dendritic cells) in the blood increased significantly in COVID-19 patients. However, they did not observe any such alteration in immune cell subsets in vaccinated individuals. The immune response observed in COVID-19 patients highlights the urgent need for developing innate immune cells (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells) from myeloid progenitors.

By analyzing transcriptional signature in myeloid cells, the scientists observed that the expressions of genes associated with type I and type II interferon production increased significantly in COVID-19 patients but not in vaccinated individuals. These observations highlight the involvement of interferon signaling pathways in triggering inflammatory immune responses against viral infection.

Regarding humoral immunity, the scientists observed a comparable induction in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers among COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. In contrast, they observed a significantly increased frequency of circulating plasmablasts in COVID-19 patients but not in vaccinated individuals. With further analysis, they observed that the plasmablasts from COVID-19 patients were highly enriched for genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, type I and type II interferon responses, fatty acid metabolism, and mTORC1 signaling, whereas, the plasmablasts from vaccinated individuals displayed gene enrichment for TNF-NFkB signaling pathway.

By specifically analyzing the B cell clonal expansion, the scientists indicated that the increased interferon response during SARS-CoV-2 infection might have induced the differentiation of plasma cells in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the vaccine seemed to trigger the expansion of circulating memory B cells.

Furthermore, they observed enrichment of activated T cells and natural killer cells with a high level of cytotoxic effector functions in COVID-19 patients. However, they could not detect such an immune signature in vaccinated individuals.

Study significance
The study findings identify a notable difference between the immune responses induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. While the vaccine-induced immune response is mainly associated with viral clearance and protective immunity, an immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 significantly increases the risk of heightened inflammation and immunopathology.

Abstract [abridged]
"Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination elicit potent immune responses. A number of studies have described immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, beyond antibody production, immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we performed multimodal single-cell sequencing on peripheral blood of patients with acute COVID-19 and healthy volunteers before and after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to compare the immune responses elicited by the virus and by this vaccine. Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling of immune cells, coupled with reconstruction of the B and T cell antigen receptor rearrangement of individual lymphocytes, enabled us to characterize and compare the host responses to the virus and to defined viral antigens. While both infection and vaccination induced robust innate and adaptive immune responses, our analysis revealed significant qualitative differences between the 2 types of immune challenges. In COVID-19 patients, immune responses were characterized by a highly augmented interferon response which was largely absent in vaccine recipients. Increased interferon signaling likely contributed to the observed dramatic upregulation of cytotoxic genes in the peripheral T cells and innate-like lymphocytes in patients but not in immunized subjects. Analysis of B and T cell receptor repertoires revealed that while the majority of clonal B and T cells in COVID-19 patients were effector cells, in vaccine recipients clonally expanded cells were primarily circulating memory cells. Importantly, the divergence in immune subsets engaged, the transcriptional differences in key immune populations, and the differences in maturation of adaptive immune cells revealed by our analysis have far-ranging implications for immunity to this novel pathogen.

Introduction
Our multimodal analysis revealed dramatic alterations in the frequencies and transcriptional programs of many immune subsets in response to infection and highlighted differences in the breadth of immune response observed upon infection and vaccination. In COVID-19 patients, transcriptional profiles of many immune populations were characterized by augmented interferon (IFN) signaling, upregulation of genes associated with cytotoxicity, and changes in metabolic pathways. Analysis of peripheral immune cells following vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine revealed alterations of transcriptional programs of several immune populations consistent with immune activation, but the highly augmented IFN signaling and cytotoxic signature observed in COVID-19 patients were largely absent. We observed robust antibody response in both COVID-19 patients and immunized individuals, with vaccination inducing a remarkably consistent IgG and IgA response to S protein. Interestingly, the nature of clonal B and T cell responses differed dramatically between infected and vaccinated individuals, suggesting that inflammatory responses associated with infection influence the trajectory of the adaptive immune response. While both infection and vaccination elicit vigorous immune responses, the difference in the nature of immune populations engaged and in maturation of adaptive immune responses is likely to impact the durability of protective immunity."

[3] COVID-19 in Children
Date: Wed 21 Apr 2021

Even as cases drop among vaccinated Americans, the coronavirus still can spread among unvaccinated people, who will be disproportionately children.

Like many parents, JN, a pediatrician at Washington University in St. Louis and a dad to 3 teens ages 19, 17, and 15, now lives in a mixed-vaccination household. His 19-year-old got vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson's shot 2 weeks ago and the 17-year-old with Pfizer's, which is available to teens as young as 16.

The 15-year-old is still waiting for her shot, though a bit impatiently now. "She's like, 'Dude, look at me here,'" Newland told me. "'Why don't you just tell them I'm 16?'" But because certain pharmaceutical companies set certain age cutoffs for their clinical trial, she alone in her family can't get a COVID-19 shot. She's the only one who remains vulnerable. She's the only one who has to quarantine from all her friends if she gets exposed.

In America, adults are racing headlong into a post-vaccination summer while kids are being left in vaccine limbo. Pfizer's shot is likely to be authorized for ages 12-15 in several weeks' time, but younger kids may have to wait until the fall or even early 2022 as clinical trials run their course. This "age de-escalation" strategy is typical for clinical trials, but it means this confusing period of vaccinated adults and unvaccinated kids will not be over soon. And the pandemic will start to look quite different.

How different? Vaccination is already changing the landscape of COVID-19 risk by age. In the U.S., hospital admissions have fallen dramatically for adults over 70 who were prioritized for vaccines, but they have remained steady -- or have even risen slightly -- in younger groups that became eligible more recently. This trend is likely to continue as vaccines reach younger and younger adults. Over the summer, the absolute number of cases may drop as mass vaccination dampens transmission while the relative share of cases among the unvaccinated rises, simply because they are the ones still susceptible. The unvaccinated group will, of course, be disproportionately children. By dint of our vaccine order, COVID-19 will start looking like a disease of the young.

This means vaccines are working, but it also means many Americans are flipping how they think about COVID-19 risk. Adults who spent the past year worrying about their elderly parents are now worrying about their kids instead. The risks are not equivalent, of course: Kids are 8700 times less likely to die of COVID-19 compared with those older than 85. But "even if the risk is not particularly high, you're still going to be extra protective of your kids," says Sandra Albrecht, an epidemiologist at Columbia. "It's just human nature."

In coming months, parents may find themselves going back to normal while their kids still have to wear masks indoors. "It's a very strange relationship to feel protected when your kids are still not," Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, told me. But some 30 million households have children still too young to be vaccinated; in these families, parents and caretakers, especially of the youngest children, will have to keep navigating this incongruous world.

The biggest risk factor to consider for unvaccinated kids, experts told me, is simply how much COVID-19 is spreading in the community. The U.S. is currently vaccinating at a good clip, and even partial herd immunity will slow transmission of the coronavirus. Seasonal effects may drive case numbers even lower in the summer. "If there's very little virus circulating, that's a pretty low-risk situation," says Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Colorado.

Experts have pegged the threshold where general restrictions can relax at 5000-10 000 cases per day, the point at which risk of COVID-19 is roughly comparable to risk of the flu. (For context, the 7-day average of daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. reached a low point of 20 000 last summer and peaked at 250 000 during the winter surge; that number has since plateaued at 70 000.)

Not everyone will feel comfortable with the same level of risk though. Even before the pandemic, O'Leary points out, parents with children who have high-risk medical conditions were very careful about, say, traveling during flu season. COVID-19 might be another reason for these families to be vigilant.

But already, momentum in the country is shifting toward reopening. States are ending their mask mandates and COVID-19 restrictions. How low cases go in the U.S. later this year [2021] will depend on the speed at which we inoculate harder-to-reach populations, as well as continued vigilance among the still-unvaccinated. Letting up after a year of social distancing is tempting, but as my colleague Katherine Wu writes, our vaccine cheat days add up.

Variants may also influence case levels, but it's not entirely clear how much. Early on, scientists in the U.K. thought the B.1.1.7 strain might be disproportionately more contagious among children than among adults, but the pattern has not held up. That may be because the variant was 1st detected after schools in the U.K. opened in the fall, explains Oliver Ratmann, a statistician at Imperial College London who has modeled the implications of the variant for kids. Then schools closed and mobility patterns changed over the holidays, which complicated the preliminary trends. The earlier pattern of B.1.1.7 in kids might just have reflected who had a chance to spread the virus at the time, especially because U.K. schools took fewer precautions, such as mask wearing, compared with many in the U.S. The evidence on whether this variant causes more severe illness is also mixed.

What is clear, though, is that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than the original virus among all age groups. In some places, that could tip the balance toward rising cases, but other factors are clearly at play too. For example, Michigan has a lot of B.1.1.7 cases and is experiencing a terrible COVID-19 surge, but Florida, which also has high numbers of B.1.1.7, is not. "The variants don't help, but they're not fully to blame," Nuzzo said. The same precautions that worked before -- including good ventilation, masking, and social distancing -- still work against B.1.1.7.

All of these concerns could come to a head in schools, which are one of the main places where unvaccinated people -- e.g., kids -- will congregate. As the U.S. is already seeing, school outbreaks do happen, but they can be contained with precautions in place. This means younger kids, who likely won't get vaccinated before the fall, may have to continue to wear masks indoors. But the benefits of in-person schooling are significant enough, experts told me, that schools should open even if kids can't get shots yet.

The trickier question is what kids can do outside of school when it comes to playdates, sports, and extracurricular activities. In Michigan, officials have suggested that high-school athletics and the socializing around sports -- rather than classes themselves -- are driving the uptick in cases among teens. Parents and kids will have to decide together which risks are worth taking. Newland told me his 15-year-old daughter sees her core group of friends and plays sports. But she's decided to keep taking virtual classes, even though her risk of contracting COVID-19 at school is low, because exposure to any cases at school could trigger a quarantine that keeps her from playing sports, which is important to her. That's the tradeoff they've decided to make, but they'd of course prefer not having to make it. As Newland said, "I feel much better about my other daughter, who got vaccinated at 17."

At least 15-year-olds have an end in sight; they are likely to be eligible for Pfizer's vaccine soon. Parents of younger kids may have to keep making these split decisions a lot longer. In their strange world, a dinner party with their adult friends is fine, but a birthday party for their 5-year-old could still spread the virus. When I asked several experts about a hypothetical party for unvaccinated preschoolers in the fall, they told me they would continue to think about ways to reduce risk, such as keeping the gathering small and outdoors. These assessments are hard to make in advance: We don't know exactly what the situation will look like and how much the virus will still be circulating. Perhaps COVID-19 will have faded enough that people won't be spending every waking minute thinking about the virus anymore. Perhaps not.

To make these decisions more difficult, the situation probably won't be the same everywhere in America. Already, rural residents report less interest in getting the shots than people living in cities and suburbs. Whether because of vaccine hesitancy or unequal access, "I think there's going to be a huge amount of variation geographically," says Whitney Robinson, an epidemiologist at UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. The virus may continue to circulate in pockets of the country where not enough eligible adults are vaccinated. These adults plus still-ineligible kids could add up to a pretty large pool of susceptible people.

Ultimately, the risk to unvaccinated kids later this year [2021] depends on the actions we take now. The faster we vaccinate and the better we suppress cases through other measures, the safer the situation will be for anyone who remains uninoculated in the fall. Then, finally, parents can stop telling kids to do things that they themselves are not doing, which, as former kids I think can agree, is literally the worst.

["Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. Many of them have no symptoms. Those that do get sick tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness.

A potentially severe and dangerous complication can occur in children. Called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), it can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. In this condition, different body parts, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs, can become inflamed.

Symptoms of MIS-C can include fever lasting more than a couple of days, rash, bloodshot eyes (redness of the white part of the eye), stomachache, vomiting and/or diarrhea, a large, swollen lymph node in the neck, neck pain, red, cracked lips, a tongue that is redder than usual and looks like a strawberry, swollen hands and/or feet, irritability and/or unusual sleepiness or weakness.

Many conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of MIS-C. Your doctor will 1st want to know whether your child has been around someone who has tested positive for the virus and will ask about all of the above symptoms. Results of the physical examination, a COVID-19 diagnostic or blood antibody test, and other medical tests that check for inflammation and how organs are functioning can support the diagnosis of MIS-C.

Doctors have had success using various treatments for inflammation, as well as treatments to support organ systems that are having trouble. While there have been some deaths, most children who have developed MIS-C have recovered" (excerpted from https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-outbreak-and-kids).

Until everyone is vaccinated, there is going to be a risk of infection to those who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2. Avoiding large gatherings and wearing masks as well as maintaining some distance from each other will help children as well as unvaccinated adults protect themselves from infection. Fortunately, the disease is generally milder in children, with exceptions for children with exacerbating health conditions. - Mod.LK]
