The bacteria causing melioidosis are on the move, according to the Northern Territory Health Department, which says at least one person has died from the disease this wet season. The bacterium, _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, which lives in soils and muddy water in the NT, the Kimberley region of Western Australia and northern Queensland and South East Asia, comes to the surface after drenching rains. There have been 6 cases in the NT this wet season [2014], and there are likely to be more.

The NT typically has 35 to 45 cases per wet season, though sometimes the figure is as high as 100, and in the 2013 wet season, there were 66 cases.

It can be contracted through drinking groundwater, cuts and abrasions, or breathed in after it has become aerosolized in windy weather, according to NT Centre for Disease Control director Vicki Krause. "We recommend people who are at increased risk of melioidosis to not go out in stormy and windy times," she said. "80 per cent of cases are people who have underlying risk factors."

The risk factors include having a weak immune system, being diabetic or overusing alcohol, she said. People with kidney disease and lung disease, and those undergoing cancer or steroid treatment will have weak immune systems, she said.

The disease is known as "Nightcliff gardener's disease", after a suburb in Darwin where the bacteria are known to live in the soil. People sleeping on bare dirt are also at risk of contracting the disease. The health department said the melioidosis victim was an elderly man but would not give further details.

It advised people to wear waterproof footwear around mud, soil and areas of pooled water, and to wear gloves when handling soil or mud-soaked items.

[Most of the reports of melioidosis from Australia originate in the Northern Territory; however, the disease is also endemic in Queensland, which is east of the Northern Territory. The disease usually occurs during the rainy season and may be accentuated by extreme flooding from rain and also from tsunamis, as occurred in 2005 in Thailand. A few cases were diagnosed after survivors returned to their home country of Finland.

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ exists as an environmental saprophyte living in soil and surface water in endemic areas (South East Asia and northern, tropical Australia), particularly in rice paddies. In endemic countries, the organism exists primarily in focal areas and is not equally distributed throughout the landscape. Sporadic cases have been reported to have been acquired in parts of Africa and the Americas. The organism may exist in a viable, non-cultivable state in the environment, interacting with other organisms, particularly protozoa, which might explain its adaptation to an intracellular niche. Two outbreaks in Australia have also implicated potable water supplies rather than surface water as a potential source of the infection.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in the endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 per cent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 per cent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
