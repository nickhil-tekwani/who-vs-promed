Plant Dis. 85:678, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-0416-01N, 2001.
Accepted for publication 25 Mar 2001.
Viral symptoms were present in a dwarf recurrent population (99RP17) of rye
(_Secale cereale_) at the North Florida Research and Education Center in
Quincy, Gadsden County, FL, during the winter and spring of 2000. Symptoms
and distribution of the infected plants in the field were similar to those
caused by Soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV; acronym WSBMV), which was
first recognized in North America in 1919 (4) and found in Florida in wheat
in 1970 (3).
[On the basis of symptoms, SBWMV-infected rye plants have been observed in
North America (4). Interveinal, non-continuous, chlorotic areas of leaves
and stunting of plants in patchy patterns occurred in four locations (0.8
to 1.6 km between locations). Incidences of the disease ranged from 3 to
15%. Leaves and roots of more than 25 plants were assessed. Using light
microscopy, after staining with Calcomine Orange 2RS/Luxol Brilliant Green
BL (1), amorphous, vacuolate inclusions were observed in all assayed
leaves. With electron microscopy, rigid rods were [seen with a bimodal
distribution of particle lengths that conformed to size distributions found
originally in wheat in 1970 in Florida.
Leaves with symptoms were sent to Agdia Inc. (Elkhart, IN) and samples were
strongly positive for SBWMV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Cystosori of _Polymyxa graminis_ were detected from a few roots of
symptomatic plants. While these associations are suggestive of SBWMV, and
rye is a reported host of SBWMV, the possibility of this virus being
soilborne rye mosaic virus exists (2). Such a differentiation will require
nucleotide sequence analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
a furovirus infecting field-grown rye ... in North America.

[An abstract in PLANT DISEASE (83:1074, 1999) provides evidence that
Soilborne rye mosaic virus (SBRMV) is likely a new species of the genus
Furovirus. It was reported in 1999 to occur on rye in West Zealand,
Denmark. Immunosorbent electron microscopy of sap from infected wheat using
an antiserum to furovirus-like particles from infected rye in Germany
resulted in distinct decoration of virions. Based on an analysis of the
complete genome and comparisons with isolates from wheat, sequence identity
of the Danish isolate compared to that of SBWMV was only 74 percent. SBRMV
was reported to infect rye and triticale in Germany in 1998. Further
details on SBRMV can be obtained at the following URL:
