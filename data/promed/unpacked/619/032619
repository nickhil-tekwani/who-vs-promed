Arizona and New Mexico: West Nile virus reaches Navajo Nation
-------------------------------------------------------------
ALBUQUERQUE: West Nile virus has reached the Navajo Nation after 2 horses
tested positive for the disease, including the first equine case in
Arizona, tribal officials said on Thu 14 Aug 2003. Tests for the disease
were pending on 3 other horses from the Arizona side of the reservation,
said Scott Bender, special projects veterinarian with the Navajo Nation
Veterinary and Livestock Program. Word of the first evidence of West Nile
virus on Navajo Nation [Reservation] has raised fears among tribal
officials that the mosquitoborne illness may spread to humans as it enters
its peak season.
The tribal administration mobilized executive divisions and departments "to
block a potential mass outbreak of the virus on the Navajo Nation," Navajo
vice president Frank Dayish Jr said on Thursday. "Most importantly, we must
take immediate and necessary precautions to protect young children and
elderly, diabetic patients, and individuals with high-risk illness," he said.
The equine cases were reported in the central portion of the expansive 16.2
million acre reservation, which stretches from the north western corner of
New Mexico into north eastern Arizona and south eastern Utah. The first 2
confirmed horse cases are in Newcomb, New Mexico, and Nazlini, Arizona,
Bender said. The Arizona Department of Health Services confirmed the
Nazlini case is the first equine case in that state.
Test results from 2 other horses from the Window Rock (Arizona) area and a
third from the community of Many Farms, north of Chinle, Arizona, were
expected within the next several days. Earlier this week, West Nile was
detected in a mosquito pool in Arizona for the first time. The virus was
first detected in New Mexico in August 2002 in horses from Quay and Curry
counties. Thursday's announcement brings the number of equine cases in New
Mexico to 82. Eight human cases have also been reported this year in the
state, but no one has died from the disease. Bender said the virus would
have reached the reservation sooner had it not been for extremely dry
conditions. "It would have been here last year had it not been for the
drought," he said.
The tribe began trapping and testing mosquitoes 3 years ago for several
viruses, including West Nile virus. Since 1 May, Bender's program has also
been testing 3 chicken flocks on the Arizona side as markers for possible
infection because mosquitoes feed on the chickens daily, Bender said. Last
week, the Navajo Nation's Tribal Council announced it would spend more than
USD 131 000 to vaccinate horses and start a public information campaign
about West Nile virus. Tribal officials were concerned that the disease
could spread quickly among an estimated 50 000 horses on the reservation,
especially given recent heavy rains that left many pools of water. Health
officials plan to visit all 110 communities on the reservation over the
next month and to vaccinate about 5000 horses.
In New Mexico, state public health veterinarian Paul Ettestad has said more
cases can be expected. New Mexico became the 41st state to see a human case
of the mosquitoborne disease in July when a woman in Valencia County was
diagnosed with a fairly mild infection.
