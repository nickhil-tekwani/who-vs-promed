During 18 Feb and 23 Mar 2010, the New Jersey Department of Health
and Senior Services (NJDHSS) had been notified of 8 cases of soft
tissue infections following buttock injections for cosmetic purposes.
Preliminary information suggests that the injections might have been
performed by unlicensed medical providers. The NJDHSS, in conjunction
with local health officials, is working with the NJ Department of
Consumer Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Criminal
Investigation Unit to identify the involved unlicensed provider(s)
and implicated product(s).

All cases involve African-American women with a median age of 26
years (range: 22-42 years) residing in Essex, Morris and Union
Counties. They reported receiving injections during November
2009-February 2010. The incubation periods range from 2 to 4 weeks.
Case-patients reported receiving injections of unknown substances,
including "hydrogel" (2),"botox" (1), "gel filler" (2), and "biogel"
(1) into the buttocks. They presented at local hospitals with
cellulitis and abscesses at the injection sites; all required
hospitalization with a median length of stay of 13 days (range: 7-19
days). Patient care included incision and drainage of wounds. No
deaths have been reported.

Microbiologic data performed at the clinical laboratories suggested
_Nocardia_ spp. as the etiologic agent in 7 out of the 8 patients and
_Rhodococcus equi_ in one patient. Available isolates have been
submitted to CDC _Actinomycete_ laboratory for confirmation of
identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular
strain typing.

Though health-care providers evaluating persons with infections
following such injections should consider typical organisms such as
_Streptococcus_ and _Staphylococcus_ spp., atypical organisms such as
_Nocardia_, _Rhodococcus_ and _Mycobacterium_ spp. should also be
considered. Patients infected with these atypical organisms can often
present with more indolent skin lesions and do not respond to the
usual empiric antimicrobial regimens.

[Two additional cases of soft tissue infection following unlicensed
injections for cosmetic purposes have been reported from 2 additional
counties in the USA state of New Jersey since the last ProMED posting
on this outbreak (Nocardiosis, unlicensed injection-induced - USA:
(NJ) 20100312.0800). One additional case involved _Nocardia_, and the
other involved _Rhodococcus_. Nocardia are gram-positive branching
filamentous bacilli that belong to the order of Actinomycetales,
which also includes _Mycobacterium_, _Corynebacterium_, and
_Rhodococcus_. Both _Nocardia_ and _Rhodococcus_ are weakly
acid-fast. The description of the outbreak from the New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services above also mentions that the
patients described use in the injected material of "hydrogel",
"botox", "gel filler", or "biogel", not bathtub "caulk" that was
mistakenly reported previously.

_Nocardia_ can be found everywhere in the environment: soil, organic
matter, and water. Human infection usually occurs following direct
inoculation of the skin or soft tissues or by inhalation. Subsequent
dissemination via the blood stream may follow, most commonly to the
central nervous system and soft tissues and mainly in
immunocompromised patients. Nosocomial outbreaks of nocardiosis have
been reported in immunocompromised patients, most commonly in renal
and heart transplant recipients
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC228943/pdf/341014.pdf>).
Outbreaks of nocardiosis in oncology and transplant wards and
surgical wounds have occurred from fomites, hospital construction
with resultant contaminated dust, and health care worker hands.

Soft tissue infections at sites of cosmetic surgery or injections,
following use of contaminated injectable solutions, skin markers or
antiseptics, reported by ProMED in the past (see below), have usually
involved non-tuberculous mycobacteria, such as _M. fortuitum_ and _M.
chelonae_ (Safranek TJ, et al. _Mycobacterium chelonae_ wound
infections after plastic surgery employing contaminated gentian
violet skin-marking solution. N Engl J Med 1987; 317: 197-201,
abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/4/197>). These
microorganisms are found in water, as well as in sewage and dirt
worldwide.

The results of the epidemiological investigation of the current
outbreak in New Jersey, which should include speciation and
genotyping of the isolates, are eagerly awaited. The New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) wishes to alert the
public and health professionals in New Jersey and the adjacent states
of New York and Pennsylvania to look out for additional cases.

interactive map of the USA at <http://healthmap.org/r/01a4>. The 3
adjacent New Jersey counties, Essex, Morris and Union Counties where
cases were identified, can be located on the map at
