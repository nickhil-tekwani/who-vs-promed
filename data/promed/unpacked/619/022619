SARS situation fact sheet 30 Apr 2004 from the Medical Department Public
Office
-------------------------------------
Betweem 10 AM 29 Apr 2004 through 10 AM 30 Apr SARS coronavirus (Co-V)
infection has been confirmed in one of the previously suspected cases from
Anhui Province.
Necropsy results on the mother of the index case from Anhui revealed
antibodies against the SARS Co-V and viral nucleic acid [?polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) studies] were positive from autopsy specimens. These
results, combined with the clinical and epidemiologic evidence, led to a
confirmation of the diagnosis of SARS.
Update on situation in Anhui
----------------------------
The index patient continues to improve, with 7 consecutive days without
fever. 39 close contacts have been released from observation.
Update on situation in Beijing
------------------------------
The nurse who cared for the index patient is now 14 consecutive days
without fever. The nurse's aunt continues in serious condition. 4 suspected
cases are still in isolation in Ditan hospital. 43 close contacts have been
released from observation.
In summary, since 22 Apr 2004, Anhui Province has reported 2 cases
[confirmed by China MOH, but pending international independent laboratory
confirmation], Beijing has reported 3 cases [confirmed by China MOH, but
pending international independent laboratory confirmation] and 4 suspected
cases of SARS. There have been no reports of suspected or confirmed cases
from other provinces.

[Since the last update, there have been no new reports of suspected or
probable cases of SARS. Necropsy results from a previously reported
suspected case (the mother of the index case in Anhui) are now available
and show laboratory evidence of SARS Co-V infection as determined by the
laboratory in China. Independent laboratory confirmation is still pending.
Hence, as of 30 Apr 2004 there are now 5 probable cases and 4 suspected
cases of SARS reported in this current outbreak related to
laboratory-acquired infection. - Mod.MPP]
