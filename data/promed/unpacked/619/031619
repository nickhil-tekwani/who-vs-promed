The Directorate of Health Surveillance on Mon 30 Oct 2017, confirmed 2 new cases of brucellosis and with those there are 4 officially diagnosed cases [3 students and a teacher - Mod.LL]. In addition, there are 44 people suspected of being infected with the bacterium.

The director of Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Public Health, Águeda Cabello, reported that students from the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Asunción (UNA) were infected with _Brucella_ after being in contact with livestock goats from the practice center of the San Lorenzo campus. All confirmed cases had contact with animals between the months of July and September 2017.

After the zoonotic disease in veterinary students became known, 420 samples were taken within the Faculty. Health Surveillance received 129 results, of which only 2 cases tested positive. Subsequently, 125 samples were tested and from that group the 2 additional positive cases were confirmed, this Mon 30 Oct 2017, adding to 4 officially.

For this reason, the Public Prosecutor's Office accused the dean of the faculty of the crime of commercialization of harmful foods, since the outbreak occurred in 14 goats and despite being aware of it the sale of milk from these animals continued. For her part, the dean denied hiding the cases and said that as soon as she found out, she suspended the sale.

[ProMED would like more information about how many of the diagnosed and suspected cases of brucellosis had symptoms consistent with clinical brucellosis and how many were asymptomatic but with positive _Brucella_ serology alone. Likewise, whether the organism is known to be _B. melitensis_.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.

The City of Asunción, Ciudad de Asunción (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunción), is an autonomous capital district, not a part of any department. The metropolitan area, called Gran Asunción, includes the cities of San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Lambaré, Luque, Mariano Roque Alonso, Ñemby, San Antonio, Limpio, Capiatá, and Villa Elisa, which are part of the Central Department. The Asunción metropolitan area has around 2 million inhabitants. - Mod.LL]
