1. Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] serotype O has been confirmed in a ranging beef cattle herd in Kibbutz Ortal, Golan Heights [HaZafon/Northern district]. This strain is similar to the one identified in other recent outbreaks.

2. In the fattening beef cattle of Kibbutz Shamir, Upper Galilee [HaZafon/Northern district], 30 clinical FMD cases were observed in a group of 300 fattening male calves. This group was vaccinated a month ago.

An FMD outbreak in December [2018] is unusual and concerning. Farmers and practitioners are advised to verify and adhere to the timely application of primary and booster vaccinations.

[Since April 2018, FMD serotype O has been affecting cattle, sheep, wild ruminants (gazelles, captive deer), and wild boar in north and northeastern Israel. This included 2 separate events. In the 1st event, between April and July [2018], 10 outbreaks were reported from the valleys area, adjacent to the Jordanian border. This event involved cattle (mainly free-ranging beef cattle herds, but -- exceptionally for Israel -- also one dairy operation), a sheep flock, and several wild ruminants (gazelles, captive deer); see summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26394. The causative agent of this event was genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15). This event was declared as resolved on 16 Jul 2018.

A 2nd event started 5 Sep 2018 in Upper Galilee and the Golan Heights, adjacent to the Lebanese border, and is still continuing. So far, 11 of the outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, summarised with a map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27895. The said 11 outbreaks involved free-range and fattening beef cattle, gazelles, and wild boar. The virus lineage of the 2nd event was reportedly O/ME/PanAsia-2, apparently slightly different from the substrain behind the earlier 2018 event. It is assumed that the origin of the 1st event was in Jordan, while the 2nd event originated, most probably, from Lebanon or Syria.

Since several of the recorded cases, including the one in Shamir described above, involved vaccinated animals, there is a concern that the vaccine applied in the annual vaccinations and revaccinations did not confer full protection, particularly in young animals.

The vaccine applied in Israel during 2018 was composed of the following FMD strains (3 serotypes, 7 strains):
- O Manisa
- O 3039
- O Israel 85
- O PanAsia 2
- A/G-VII-2015
- A Iran 05
- Asia-1 Shamir

Following recent analyses, the Israeli veterinary services (VSAH) contemplate the use, in the near future, of vaccine strain "O Turkey 5/09," which seems closer to the current field strains. The composition of the multivalent vaccine and the vaccination policy are about to be reviewed, taking into consideration the accumulated experience, the regional FMD situation, and the high susceptibility of the national dairy herd signified by extremely high milk records. - Mod.AS
