Health authorities in Western Australia have identified 25 more cases of
[infection/colonization by vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus_
(VRE) in Perth hospitals, in what was believed to be the worst
outbreak of the bacterium in Australia. But the Health Department
believed it was making good progress in eradicating the resilient [VRE
organisms, the latest outbreak of which began at Royal Perth Hospital
last month [September 2001.
There were now a total of 69 patients [known to be carrying the
bacterium in Perth, 58 of whom were hospital patients. Seven of the
remaining 11 cases were linked to the hospital outbreak, but 4 were
considered secondary cases, meaning the patients picked up the
bacterium from separate sources.

[It is unclear from this report whether all of the "patients" have been
actively infected with VRE, or whether some of that number are
persons who have been identified as "colonized" by VRE upon
screening hospital personnel and patient contacts. Further information
would be welcomed.
A nice discussion of the emergence and epidemiology of VRE through
1998 may be found at the following URL:
