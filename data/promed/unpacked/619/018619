AQIS admits New Caledonia disease bungle
----------------------------------------
The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) admits that cattle have
been affected in New Caledonia with a tick disease because of a paperwork
error. AQIS says that last November [2007] it allowed cattle vaccinated
with a live tick fever vaccine to go to New Caledonia again[st] that
country's laws. Now the fever has infected cattle in that country.

Director of quarantine, Conal O'Connell, says normally, with
double-checking, this shouldn't happen: "This appears to have happened by a
transcription error." Australia is sending over its chief vet, but could be
hit with compensation claims and major clean-up costs.

Some livestock exporters are worried the outbreak could hit Australia's
reputation for exporting disease-free animals. But the quarantine service
is maintaining Australia's reputation is so good that other markets won't
be hit.

Tick disaster after fresh AQIS bungle
-------------------------------------
An embarrassing bungle by Australian quarantine authorities has exposed the
entire New Caledonian beef herd to the potentially disastrous tick fever
and could leave taxpayers with the cost of a major clean-up. Agriculture
minister Tony Burke revealed yesterday [11 Mar 2008] that the Australian
Quarantine Inspection Service had allowed Australian cattle to be exported
to the island nation last year after being vaccinated against the disease.

Cattle vaccinated with the disease can pass it on to ticks and New
Caledonian import laws require cattle to instead be drenched to kill ticks.
Mr Burke said the cattle exported from Australia on 23 Nov 2007 had
infected ticks in New Caledonia, which were passing the disease to local
cattle.

The bungle follows widespread criticism of AQIS last year after equine
influenza entered Australia and paralysed the multi-million-dollar racing
industry for months.

The equine influenza affair is being examined in detail by former High
Court judge Ian Callinan. And AQIS is facing a wider review by Roger Beale,
a former secretary of the Department of Environment and Heritage.

Tick fever, also known as babesiosis, can devastate cattle herds. It occurs
in eastern and northern Australia and despite being under control, costs
the Australian beef industry up to AUD 28 million [USD 26,336,874.84] a year.

Mr Burke met French ambassador Francois Descoueyte late yesterday to
discuss Australian efforts to repair the damage caused by the bungle. He
earlier told parliament it was possible to treat affected cattle in New
Caledonia with a chemical called Imazol, which would kill the tick fever
organisms in the cattle and prevent further transmission of the disease to
ticks.

However, it is understood Mr Burke was continuing to meet exporters last
night about the more serious problem of eradicating the disease among the
New Caledonian tick population. "I am advised that the export of vaccinated
cattle to New Caledonia has allowed the disease to enter their tick
population and cause a disease outbreak in their local cattle," Mr Burke
told parliament earlier. "While information on this issue is still coming
to hand, it seems clear, first of all, that there was a certification error
by AQIS, and that as a result of that error there may be a significant
impact on the beef industry in New Caledonia."

He said the Government was working with the Queensland Tick Fever Centre.
It was unclear last night about the cost of the clean-up program or whether
New Caledonian cattle producers would have any case for compensation
because of the AQIS error.

Sources said attention was instead being focused on finalizing treatment plans.

Mr Burke said he would ensure that Australia met all of its obligations to
New Caledonia. And he said he hoped the Beale review into AQIS would help
strengthen Australia's quarantine arrangements. "It is critically important
both for the protection of biosecurity in Australia and for our neighboring
countries to which we provide a service under agreed protocols that our
quarantine and biosecurity services are robust," he said.

A spokesman for Mr Descoueyte last night confirmed the ambassador met Mr
Burke late yesterday. The pair had agreed to work together on tick fever
problem, particularly through co-operation between their respective science
agencies. "We are still establishing the facts of the situation," the
spokeswoman said.

[The 1st article only refers to tick fever, which may be a complex of
disease common in the northern and eastern regions of Australia. However,
the 2nd article indicates it is babesiosis. To give the reader some
insight, both diseases and vaccines are discussed in this comment.

Tick fever refers to a disease complex. The 3 pathogenic parasites
transmitted by the cattle tick (_Boophilus microplus_) are _Babesia bovis_
(previously called _Babesia argentina_) and _Babesia bigemina_, both of
which cause babesiosis, and _Anaplasma marginale_, which causes
anaplasmosis. _B. bovis_ is the commonest cause of tick fever. _B.
bigemina_ is very widespread in the enzootic tick area but outbreaks of
disease caused by it are uncommon. _A. marginale_ ranks between the 2 as a
cause of disease.

This particular tick fever complex is endemic in the northern region of
Australia. There are 3 types of vaccines available: the new live product
and 2 others that are trivalent vaccines.

The cattle tick (_B. microplus_) is the most serious external parasite of
cattle in northern Australia. It transmits tick fever and if uncontrolled,
can cause serious losses to the cattle industry.

The cattle tick favors cattle, but infestations occur on buffaloes, deer,
camels, horses and sheep. Cattle ticks may occasionally be seen on donkeys,
goats, dogs, and pigs. When cattle are heavily infested, ticks can be found
anywhere on the body. The main places to look on a lightly infested animal
are the escutcheon, tail butt, belly, shoulder, dewlap, and ear.

Infested cattle lose condition due to "tick worry" and loss of blood. Heavy
infestations can kill calves and even adult cattle. Animals in poor
condition are especially vulnerable. Previously unexposed cattle become
heavily infested until they build up a degree of resistance. _Bos indicus_
cattle (tropical breeds) and their crosses, develop a greater degree of
resistance than do _Bos taurus_ (British and European breeds).

Cattle ticks transmit the organisms that cause tick fever, which is a
serious blood parasite disease of cattle. This disease can be lethal to
susceptible animals. Others may suffer severe loss of condition. Hides of
infested cattle are damaged by tick bites, and their value is reduced. In
severe cases the hides may be unsaleable.

Horses also suffer from tick worry and loss of blood from cattle tick
infestation. They rub and bite affected areas, causing severe skin lesions.
After a period, however, horses develop strong resistance to cattle tick.
The cattle tick has little effect on other hosts.

Ticks can be killed by dipping or spraying cattle with an appropriate
chemical (acaricide). Ticks can, however, develop resistance to acaricides.
Larvae produced by engorged adult females are used by a CSIRO laboratory in
Brisbane to check ticks for acaricide resistance. Contact your local Stock
Inspector if you suspect poor tick kill.

Cattle ticks can be controlled using resistant cattle, strategic treatments
with chemicals, pasture spelling or combinations of these methods. In the
Northern Territory cattle tick control is usually limited to the use of
resistant cattle and treatment is usually limited to cattle awaiting export
or those moving to or through tick free areas.

_Anaplasma marginale_ is a different type of parasite to Babesia, but is
similar in that it is spread by the cattle tick and also invades and
destroys the red blood cells of cattle.

In specially stained blood from infected cattle, _A. marginale_ organisms
viewed under an ordinary microscope are seen as black, irregular-shaped
dots, usually at the edge of infected red blood cells. As the infection
progresses, more and more red cells contain parasites and are destroyed.
The disease is usually more protracted than babesiosis, and anaemia,
jaundice and ill-thrift occur. Red water is not seen, but the urine may
become brown in colour. As with babesiosis, animals which survive the acute
disease become carriers of the infection.

Anaplasmosis can also be readily spread in small amounts of infected blood.
Procedures such as dehorning, castration, vaccination and collection of
blood samples may spread the disease within a herd if precautions are not
taken against the transfer of blood on surgical instruments and needles
from infected to non-infected cattle. Biting flies can spread anaplasmosis.

Both articles serve to emphasis the importance of checking carefully the
paperwork as well as working closely with producers and the importers of
the animals. Certainly such an error leaves the agency in a precarious
position. Hopefully provisions of the cattle dip and perhaps manpower
assistance to New Caledonia will quickly get the disease and the ticks
under control.
