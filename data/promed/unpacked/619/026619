Hong Kong Officials Find New Case of Bird Flu
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials said samples from several chickens found dead in a poultry
shop on Wed, 18 Dec 2002 tested positive for avian flu in the second
outbreak of the viral disease this month.
A probe will be conducted to determine whether more than 20 chickens from
the retail outlet on Hong Kong's rural Lantau Island had the same strain of
virus that once killed 6 people here, authorities said.
As a precaution, 60 other birds from the shop were immediately slaughtered,
the Food and Environment Hygiene Department said in a statement. Officials
also ordered the shop closed Thu, 19 Dec 2002 for disinfecting, it said.
Earlier this month, the Hong Kong Jockey Club found 31 dead birds in a park
in the center of a horse track. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department found 2 geese among the dead birds that tested positive for
avian flu.
It remained unclear whether the geese contained the deadly H5N1 virus,
which crossed over from birds to humans in 1997 and prompted officials to
slaughter all 1.4 million chickens in Hong Kong. Officials have since held
mass poultry slaughters and imposed stricter hygiene standards on the industry.
Many Hong Kong people prefer to buy their poultry live in markets, where
chickens are packed into cages as they wait to be slaughtered on the spot
so customers can take them home as fresh as possible.
