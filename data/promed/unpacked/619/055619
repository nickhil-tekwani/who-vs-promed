SENASA was alerted to new cases of anthrax in the rural area of Santa Rosa, so the Provincial Board of Zoonosis reiterated the preventive measures. The cases are in addition to those previously presented in the towns of Bernasconi and Guatraché.

From the Provincial Zoonosis Table (made up of the Ministries of Production and Health, SENASA, INTA, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Veterinary Medical College), they emphasized that "early detection and immediate notification of anthrax cases are essential to the implementation of prevention, control and surveillance measures by the competent bodies."

Anthrax is an acute disease, highly contagious [no, only slightly contagious but very infectious], that preferentially affects ruminants, being [infectious] to other animals, including humans, which is why it is considered a serious zoonosis. Its suspicion in both human and animal cases is mandatory notification. The responsible agent is the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, which, when it comes into contact with oxygen, forms a spore that is resistant to severe climatic conditions and that allows it to survive in the environment.

These spores can remain viable in nature for long periods of time in dry food, animal by-products such as wool and hides, contaminated objects, and soil. When ingested by a susceptible animal, such as cattle and other herbivores, this spore goes back to the vegetative form, beginning to generate the toxins that are responsible for the death of the animals.

The disease is characterized in bovines by presenting sudden death, with bloody discharge from the natural orifices (mouth, nose and anus), in which the etiological agent is present. Diagnosis in people is clinical-epidemiological; treatment is with antibiotics and prophylaxis is also indicated in the case of people who have been exposed to animal carcasses.

There are vaccines for animals but not for humans. In this sense, producers were asked, as the main preventive action, to vaccinate the cattle annually and systemically starting at 6 months of age, preferably in spring. In fields with a history of the presence of the disease, 2 applications per year were recommended, with an interval of 6 months between them, in order to enhance immune responses.

Clinical signs in people
------------------------
They appear according to their route of entry, manifesting themselves in different ways:

- Cutaneous carbuncle or "bad grain": It is the most common form of presentation; the bacteria enter through the skin, where it produces a lesion with the appearance of grain or injury that becomes an ulcerative lesion surrounded by vesicles and progresses to a black scar. It is painless [but itches]. If specific treatment with antibiotics is not carried out, the individual may die from septicemia.
- Digestive or intestinal anthrax: It is acquired through the consumption of meat from sick animals and causes abdominal discomfort, fever, septicemia, and death. The mortality rate is variable.
- Respiratory or pulmonary anthrax: It is spread by inhalation of spores and causes fever, malaise, cough, chest pain, and severe respiratory failure. The mortality rate is usually 100%.

Precautionary measures
----------------------
- Do not carry out the necropsy or "skinning" of animals suspected of anthrax to avoid the spread of spores in the environment. If the presumptive diagnosis of anthrax arises after the opening of a corpse, measures should be taken to disinfect the elements used in it, as well as the clothing and footwear of the personnel.
- Do not handle or consume products derived from animals with signs of disease.
- The [carcasses] should not be burned because this practice causes the spread of spores and favors respiratory infection. [Not true.] The [carcasses] must be buried and covered in the same place where they were found, following the indications of SENASA.

Vaccinate animals at risk
-------------------------
The intervention and participation of a veterinary professional is essential to make the corresponding diagnosis, which allows confirming the etiology of the death of the animal or animals.

[Unfortunately, this report provides no information on this recent outbreak in La Pampa. We must await backup information from Azul [Laboratorio Azul Diagnóstico, Buenos Aires - Mod.ML].

This report contains a body of misinformation:
- Anthrax is only mildly contagious and instances where this had occurred are rarely reported.
- Carcass disposal is most efficient by burning. Though spores have been recovered from the smoke, the numbers are not significant and downwind dispersal will significantly reduce the concentration of spores landing downwind. Buried anthrax carcasses can result in contagious soil in the grave site and in the soil column above the carcass. The area should be well sprayed with disinfectant.
- Human cases: Cutaneous cases respond well to antibiotics, especially doxycycline, but otherwise carry a 3% to 10% risk of mortality. Mortality in human gastroenteric cases is variable, and repeated exposures provide protection. This results in folk not taking the risk of contaminated meat seriously. Pneumonic anthrax carries a high risk of mortality, but it responds well to antibiotics and the active removal of the bloody fluids in the thoracic cavity, as the antibiotics do not remove the anthrax toxins. They only kill the organisms. The removal of the bloody fluids also applies to cutaneous lesions and significantly to the fluid in the abdominal cavity. The optimum protection in humans is not vaccination but livestock vaccination and the proper control and surveillance of the disease in livestock. Both sides win when the disease is rare or absent in animals. - Mod.MHJ
