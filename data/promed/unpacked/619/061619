China's north western Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has reported an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced on Monday [2 Jul 2012]. The disease has killed 1600 chickens raised by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), a unique economic and semi-military government organization of about 2.5 million people.

A total of 5500 XPCC-farmed chickens showed symptoms of suspected avian flu on 20 Jun 2012, according to the MOA. The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory on Monday [2 Jul 2012] confirmed the epidemic was H5N1 bird flu after testing samples collected at the farm, the MOA said.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 156 439 chickens have been culled and safely disposed of to prevent the disease from spreading, according to the MOA.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.
