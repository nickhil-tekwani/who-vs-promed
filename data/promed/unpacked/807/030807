Local horse dies from EEE
-------------------------
A horse has died from a case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in
Scotland County, North Carolina, a state official confirmed on Wednesday.

Carl Williams, state public health veterinarian, said health officials
verified that a local horse contracted EEE and had to be put down on 12 Aug
2009. Williams said while this is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in the
county in 2009, other counties have also had equine deaths from the disease.

"Horses act as sentinels for this particular disease," Williams said. He
said the disease is likely to be "circulating in the mosquito population."
He recommends humans to wear long-sleeved shirts, limit their outdoor
activity, and use insect repellant. Williams also suggests that horses be
vaccinated for the disease. There is currently no human vaccination for EEE.

A person familiar with the incident said the horse died in the southern
portion of the county, near the South Carolina border.

EEE is a mosquitoborne viral disease that causes disease in humans, horses,
and some bird species, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). The disease has a high mortality rate. There is an
approximate 50 per cent survival rate. About 5 people in the United States
contract the disease annually.

While this is the 1st reported case in Scotland County in 2009, 3 counties
-- Robeson, Bladen and Columbus -- form a cluster that have had 4 reported
veterinary cases and 5 reported sentinel cases of the disease.

Two more Virginia cases of equine encephalitis confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------
The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has confirmed
2 more positive cases of EEE in horses for 2009, bringing the total
statewide to 8.

Most of the cases have been in the Tidewater area with one from Loudoun
County. The Loudoun horse was a 28 year old female pony with multiple
medical problems, including kidney disease. The case in Loudoun is unusual.
Normally cases of EEE are located within or close to the Tidewater area of
Virginia.

The other new equine case is a 7 year old female miniature horse from
Southampton County. Neither horse had been vaccinated for EEE.

The Loudoun horse was euthanized, but at last report, the Southampton horse
was still alive. An 11 year old female alpaca from Surry County also tested
positive for EEE but recovered on her own. VDACS considers this a
presumptive case of EEE, along with a goat from Chesapeake that died last
month.

To date there have been 3 equine cases of EEE in Chesapeake, two in
Suffolk, and one each in Loudoun, Prince George and Southampton counties.

"EEE is a serious condition," explains Dr Richard Wilkes, state
veterinarian. "And unlike West Nile Virus, few horses survive the disease.
There is no cure, but there are effective vaccines. So far this year, all
of the positive EEE horses had not been vaccinated or hadn't been
vaccinated recently for the disease. With a rainy spring and summer and an
increase in the mosquito population, I'm not surprised that we're seeing an
increase in the incidents of EEE, but I am disappointed that horse owners
in the high risk areas of the state are not vaccinating."

VDACS encourages horse owners to vaccinate their horses every 6 to 12
months against EEE. This is particularly important in the south eastern
region of Virginia, where many veterinarians recommend the 6-month
vaccination interval. Vaccination includes an initial shot, with a booster
6 weeks later, then boosters every 6 to 12 months. Vaccinations must be
administered correctly and in a timely fashion to be effective. There is no
vaccine for goats or emus.

Generally, EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes. Prevention methods besides
vaccination that help to protect all species include destroying standing
water breeding sites for mosquitoes, use of insect repellents such as DEET
and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times,
usually dusk to dawn.

For more information on EEE in animals, consumers should contact the Office
of the State Veterinarian or consult their local veterinarians.
