Anthrax spread among intravenous drugs users
--------------------------------------------
A 42-year-old woman from Rochester who injected herself with heroin contaminated with anthrax died in London at the King's College hospital.

This is the 3rd death which has been recorded in the UK during an outbreak of anthrax among drug addicts. According to experts, the anthrax was caused by infected heroin. The Health Protection Agency says that since June 2012, several European countries have reported 13 cases of anthrax among intravenous drug users.

A total of 6 occurred in the UK (4 in England, 1 in Scotland, and 1 in Wales). And earlier in the year, 2 drug addicts died in Blackpool[England]due to the bacterial infection.

In order to become infected with anthrax, it is enough to breathe or swallow its spores. Physicians do not exclude the rapid appearance of new victims. Moreover, anthrax threatens not only those who inject the drug intravenously.

Dr. Fortune Ncube notes: "Anthrax is treatable with antibiotics, if therapy is started early. Therefore, physicians should be immediately alert when drug addicts report suspicious symptoms like infections of soft tissues or blood poisoning."

Woman dies after injecting herself with heroin contaminated with anthrax
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The death is the 3rd in Britain linked to an outbreak of anthrax among drug users believed to have used contaminated heroin

A woman has died after injecting herself with heroin contaminated with anthrax. An inquest has been opened after a 42-year-old woman, from Rochester, Kent, died at King's College Hospital in London on 9 Dec 2012. The cause of death was given as anthrax and intravenous drug abuse.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said 13 cases of anthrax among people who inject drugs have been reported in several European countries since June; 6 of the cases have occurred in the UK, including 4 in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales. Earlier this year, 2 drug users died in Blackpool after contracting the bacterial infection. The HPA said the source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin.

Anthrax is an acute bacterial infection that normally infects humans when they inhale or ingest anthrax spores. [Also cutaneous infections follow from butchering infected carcasses. - Mod.MHJ]

Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in infections among people who inject drugs at the Health Protection Agency, said: "Anthrax can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is therefore important for medical professionals to be alert to the possibly of anthrax infection in heroin users presenting with signs and symptoms
- which include severe soft tissue infections or blood poisoning - to prevent any delays in providing treatment.

"It is possible that further cases may be seen in people who inject heroin. People who use drugs may become infected with anthrax when the heroin they use is contaminated with anthrax spores. This could be a source of infection if injected, smoked or snorted -- there is no safe route for consuming heroin or other drugs that may be contaminated with anthrax spores."

Dr James Sedgwick, interim director of the HPA's Kent Health Protection Unit, said: "In light of this recent case in Medway, we have advised local agencies to talk to their service users who inject drugs about the risk of anthrax infection.

"People who inject drugs often experience skin infection but we strongly advise them not to ignore signs such as redness or excessive swelling around injection sites, or other symptoms of general illness such a high temperature, chills, severe headaches or breathing difficulties.

"They should seek medical advice quickly in such circumstances generally but particularly now because we have concerns that some batches of heroin in circulation may be contaminated with anthrax. Early treatment with antibiotics is essential for a successful recovery."

[The previous outbreak of anthrax in Europe was registered in 2009/2010 and was also associated with contaminated heroin. Then the outbreak affected 119 people in Scotland, 5 in England, and 2 in Germany. - Mod.NP

We must thank our Russian correspondents for finding this more detailed report on this recent case in Kent. The HPA originally had her living in Medway, and reported word for word in The Guardian. Since then I have been checking with HPA colleagues for information -- blank -- and repeatedly checking UK newspapers and the HPA website -- blank. Obviously a Cantab education can blind one to more proletariat news sources. So thanks again to our Russian colleagues, who appear to have mined the Daily Mail report. - Mod.MHJ
