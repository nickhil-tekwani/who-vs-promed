Avian flu in Tebessa: Analysis indicated that the 4th death was due to H5N1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
El Khabar was informed from a well-informed source that the laboratory analysis for a sample from a 40-year-old male who died in Sharia, Tebessa [province] was positive for avian influenza. This is the 4th death due to severe pneumonia in Sharia, Tebessa.

The source indicated that the 3 people died after being transferred to Constantine Hospital and they had the same symptoms including severe cough and dyspnea. The analysis of samples was done by the Pasteur Institute. The doctors in the university hospitals in Constantine recommended another testing for confirmation.

There is news about another 3 cases transferred to Constantine Hospital. These cases are not necessarily from Tebessa.

There is investigation to find out if the infected people consumed chicken meat. The manager of health in Tebessa indicated that they are taking all measures and they will transfer all suspected cases. He indicated that besides the 4 dead people there are 4 other cases in Constantine and Annaba in the intensive care.

Tebessa is the capital city of Tebessa province, Algeria, 20 km (about 20 mi) west from the border with Tunisia.

If this case(s) is reconfirmed by the WHO, it will be the 1st case reported from Algeria. However, in the absence of any reports of H5N1 in poultry, I am skeptical. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this from knowledgeable sources in the region. - Mod.DK

H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The virus has been reported throughout the years also from Europe, in poultry and wild birds, without human cases. Highly pathogenic refers to the virus's ability to produce serious disease in poultry, according to internationally agreed pathogenicity criteria. Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, 844 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003.

Most human cases of "highly pathogenic" H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses.

H5N1 usually does not spread between people.

There have been no reported infections with these viruses in birds, poultry, or people in the United States.

You cannot get infected with these viruses from properly handled and cooked poultry or eggs.

Since 2003, 844 human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by 16 countries. About 53 percent of these people died from their illness http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/. - Mod.DK

In view of the recent occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in poultry in southeast France (see Avian influenza (202): France (DD) backyard poultry, HPAI H5N1, spread 20151201.3833041), the possible circulation of this (potentially zoonotic) virus in the region deserves alertness. In the past, there was a single report on a suspected case in a hen in Algeria (see Avian influenza (70): Algeria, RFI 20070414.1243; the RFI remained unanswered). Information on the surveillance in poultry and wild birds applied in Algeria and other Maghreb countries will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
