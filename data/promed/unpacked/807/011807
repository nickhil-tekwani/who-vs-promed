It took less than 3 weeks for the FMD to resurface in South Korea,
which in January [2010] had affected the country for the 1st time in
8 years. The country is scrambling again to contain further spread of
the highly contagious disease that mainly affects cloven-hoofed
animals including pigs, cattle, and goats. [In fact, this is not
"further spread"; the January 2010 outbreak was caused by FMDV
serotype A; the current outbreak is caused by a new introduction of a
different FMDV serotype, namely FMDV-O. - Mod.AS]

According to the ministry, animals on the farm on Ganghwa Island, 58
km [36 mi] west of Seoul, started showing signs of the FMD symptoms
on Thursday [8 Apr 2010]. Quarantine officials immediately took
precautionary measures by closing off the farm and limiting movement
of people and vehicles in the area.

The ministry said that they are still investigating the exact cause
of the outbreak. The owner of the farm had recently made a visit to a
region in [a] neighbouring country that reported an FMD outbreak last
week [week of 5 Apr 2010]. [According to another media-sourced piece
of information, the country visited by the owner was specifically
named as China. - Mod.AS]

So far, 5 cases [animal holdings?] of FMD have been confirmed since
Friday [9 Apr 2010], according to the farm ministry, as it said more
than 26 000 animals at 211 farms around the affected area will be
culled to contain the disease from spreading to other regions.

[The Veterinary Authorities of South Korea submitted an immediate
notification on the outbreak to the OIE one day after its initial
discovery, namely on 9 Apr 2010. The notification addressed the 1st,
single outbreak and included a map showing the location. It is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9126>.

As apparent from the newswire above, the disease, caused by FMDV
serotype O, is spreading, but the rate of spread and precise number
of outbreaks is not clear. A follow-up report, to include further
details of the outbreaks and available, official information on the
possible source of the virus, should have already become available.

Both serotypes A and O are spreading in China, with serotype O
demonstrating its traditionally known high invasiveness and wide
spectrum of species susceptibility (large and small ruminants, pigs).
