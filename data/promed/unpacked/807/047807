Avian Influenza Virus A (H1N7) Circulating among Humans in Egypt
----------------------------------------------------
The National Influenza Center (NIC) in Egypt and the WHO Influenza
Collaborating Centre in the UK reported the isolation of Avian Influenza A
(H1N7) from 2 human specimens. They refer to 2 infants, both aged 1 year,
residents of Ismaillia, who recovered after presenting a fever and cough.
The father of one of them is a poultry merchant who frequently traveled
between Isamillia and Damietta. In this last town, avian influenza virus A
(H1N7) was isolated from 5 wild ducks between 18 and 22 Apr 2004, from
samples taken from a market of hunted migratory birds.
Additional preliminary investigation tested negative in 75 human samples
collected in Ismaillia and in 13 samples from migratory birds from the same
market. No influenza outbreak has been reported among poultry in Egypt. At
present, there are no public-health implications from this event.

[This is an intriguing piece of information, requiring further details
regarding the make-up of this H1 strain. The refs on a previous A(H1N7)
virus strain isolate are to be seen in the following references:

characterisation of an influenza A virus of unusual subtype (H1N7) isolated
from pigs in England Arch Virol 1997; 142(5): 1045-50.

Egypt is predominantly a Muslim country, where pig breeding is not
expected; however, a substantial number of pig holdings are maintained by
the Coptic population. - Mod.AS]
