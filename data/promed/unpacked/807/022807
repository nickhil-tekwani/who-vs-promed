Domestic goats are suspects in spread of disease to bighorn
sheep
-----------------------------------------------
A pneumonia-like disease that once raced through several Hells
Canyon bighorn sheep herds is resurfacing, foiling efforts of wildlife
managers to restore the sheep.
A decade ago, as many as 300 sheep were killed by the bacterial
disease pasteurella. It first swept through Hells Canyon bighorn
sheep herds in 1995, killing sheep on the western side of the
canyon from the Grand Ronde River to the Imnaha River. Now,
herds that had no exposure to the 1995 outbreak are becoming
sick.
Biologists from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife suspect domestic goats
grazing near the rim of the canyon have infected the Big Canyon
herd that roams just north of Pittsburg Landing on the Idaho side of
the river.
Frances Cassirer, a wildlife biologist for the Idaho Department of
Fish and Game at Lewiston, directs efforts to restore the sheep to
Hells Canyon. She and her partner, Vic Coggins, of the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife at Enterprise, worry this latest
outbreak will spread to other healthy herds in Hells Canyon.
The biologists say circumstantial evidence points to the disease
being transmitted by domestic goats that are used to fight noxious
weeds on the canyon rim. A goat herd as large as 4000 has
grazed on a private ranch on the benches above Big Canyon for 3
out of the past 4 years, and the goats appearance coincides with
drops in herd numbers.
The goat owner, Ray Holes of White Bird, said the biologist's
accusation was made out of convenience. He knows his goats
carry pasteurella, the bacteria causing the illness, but said the
goats and sheep have not had contact close enough to exchange
diseases.
"It was an easy thing for them to point to [me]. There were goats
and bighorns on the same side of the river and, by air miles, not
very far apart. "It's an assumption that would make sense, but as
far as we know there has never been any contact." He said
herders and guard dogs deter wild animals. The animals must be
close enough to touch noses or exchange mucus through sneezing
and coughing to transfer the disease.
Cassirer and Coggins want to keep goats away from wild sheep
herds in Hells Canyon and canyons of southeastern Washington
and northeastern Oregon. "I think most of the land management
agencies are on board with that," Cassirer said. "But, obviously, not
all the private landowners are. It would be nice to get the word out
for people who are concerned about bighorn sheep to try different
[weed control] methods."
Coggins proposes moving the goats away from the canyon's rim to
remove them from the area where the sheep herd grazes. Holes
said the demand for him to relocate is unfair. He said the sheep's
propensity to roam would continue to push him further away, and he
contends sheep would become ill even if his goats were moved.

[Pasteurellosis in sheep and goats is caused by _Pasteurella_ spp.
Most often those are _P haemolytica_ and _P. multocida_, as
these organisms are often commensal with the tonsils and
nasopharynx of healthy sheep and goats. These are nonmotile,
non-spore-forming aerobic gram-negative coccobacilli. There are
16 serotypes of _P.haemolytica_ that are currently recognized.
Generally, it is a respiratory disease, but also manifests as
septicemia, arthritis, meningitis & mastitis.
Pneumonic pasteurellosis is caused most often by _P. multocida_
in sheep and goats and can lead to high mortality and great
economic loss. Transition from infection to disease appears to be
facilitated by various stressors including concurrent infections,
changes in climate, pasture, or feed, and other management
factors. - Mod.TG]
