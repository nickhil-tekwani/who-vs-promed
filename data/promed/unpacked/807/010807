[Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most contagious disease of mammals and has a great potential for causing severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. There are 7 serotypes of FMD virus (FMDV), namely, O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and Asia 1. Infection with one serotype does not confer immunity against another.

Typical cases of FMD are characterised by a vesicular condition of the feet, buccal mucosa and, in females, the mammary glands. Clinical signs can vary from mild to severe, and fatalities may occur, especially in young animals (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf).

It is likely that the deaths which occurred were in younger animals, since, as indicated above, fatalities are more common in young animals.

FMD is endemic in several parts of Asia, most of Africa and the Middle East. In Latin America, the majority of countries apply zoning as a control measure and are recognized free of FMD with or without vaccination. The disease remains endemic in only a few countries. Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, Central and North America and continental Western Europe are currently free of FMD. However, FMD can occur sporadically in typically free areas (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/FMD-EN.pdf).

For this specific outbreak, the serotype is not available because no samples were taken. Serotypes isolated from countries which border Guinea can be obtained from the following WRLFMD (Pirbright) web links:

OIE's WAHID section entitled "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence" shows the information on the outbreaks reported in the African region from 2005 (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail; note: to see the information on FMD, choose the region, scroll to the disease and choose the time period).

A map showing the outbreaks of FMD in the African region can be obtained from http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (note: to view the information on FMD, scroll down to the name of the disease, choose a time period, and zoom in over the country of interest within that region).
