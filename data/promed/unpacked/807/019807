[A week with no wild poliovirus (WPV) isolates. And another week of evidence of transmission of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in multiple African countries. This week involved countries include Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, with Cote d'Ivoire and Niger not reporting acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, but positive environmental samples (ES). A note of caution -- Mali's reported cases had dates of onset in 2020... hence a significant delay in confirmation.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Gambia - suspected cVDPV associated cases, RFI

https://www.freedomnewspaper.com/2021/08/11/breaking-news-there-are-suspected-vaccine-derived-polio-virus-cases-in-the-gambia-health-minister-samateh-tells-freedom-newspaper-2/


The West African nation of The Gambia has discovered some suspected cases of the vaccine derived polio virus, its health minister Amadou Lamin Samateh told Freedom Newspaper in a phone interview on Wednesday morning [11 Aug 2021]. Health minister Samateh said some samples have been taken and sent to Dakar, Senegal to confirm if there is vaccine derived polio virus in the country. "They did an assessment. They take samples from sewage and when they take samples from sewage, they have a way for checking the virus with those things and samples are checked. That's the alert I got, the day before yesterday [10 Aug 2021]. And they also sent some samples to Senegal to confirm whether there is vaccine derived polio virus in The Gambia or not and we are preparing a statement and a vaccination campaign," Dr Samateh remarked.

Samateh said the vaccine derived polio virus has been discovered in neighboring Senegal and Guinea. He added that his ministry has since been on the vigilance to monitor possible suspected cases. Samateh says based on the preliminary samples that they have tested; their findings have revealed that there are suspected polio cases in the Gambia.

"I cannot confirm as we speak, because we had a preliminary meeting a day before yesterday [10 Aug 2021], let me get the information, then I can update you. If they are able to detect those viruses in the stools and so on, I told you, they were testing sewage samples and presumably it came from the stools of people who used those sewages. So, the assumption is there would be vaccine derived virus in the country, but we want confirmation so that we give the people what is important. And the idea is, the team is putting strategies. If at all it is found, so that we roll into vaccination campaign for that. I don't want to give any premature information. Give me the opportunity to give you the correct information as soon as possible," he added.

"We have some suspected cases in the country and then we also have detected this is in the sewage and want confirmation so that we can move on," Samateh told me.

[In the 30 Jul 2021 update from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples were reported in the Western Region. The isolates were identified as genetically linked to the Jigawa outbreak in Nigeria (see Poliomyelitis update (17): global (cVDPV1, cVDPV2 Uganda/Gambia) Pakistan, Nigeria 20210730.8557717). Following the identification of positive environmental samples in areas not previously known to have had ongoing transmission of poliovirus (either WPV or cVDPV), countries do active surveillance (searching) for AFP cases in areas surrounding the location of the sewage samples.

The above media report suggests that AFP cases may have been identified in the country, although the tone of the media report suggests an attempt to embarrass the government. More information on this from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
