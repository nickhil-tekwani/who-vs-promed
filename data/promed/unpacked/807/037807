Avian influenza situation in Indonesia
--------------------------------------
As of 2 Mar 2011, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a
new confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus.

A 26-year-old female from Karawang District, West Java Province
developed symptoms on 30 Jan 2011. She was hospitalized on 3 Feb 2011,
and was treated with oseltamivir, but died on 8 Feb 2011.

Initial investigations indicate the case bought poultry meat at a
traditional market and took home chickens that were slaughtered after
purchase and prepared at the market.

Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus.

Of the 172 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 142 have been
fatal.
