1. On 24 Oct 2008, the Secretariat of Health Surveillance (SVS) of
the Ministry of Health (MoH) received notification of deaths of
primates of the genus _Alouatta sp._, [howler monkeys] in the
municipalities of Tres Passos and Tiradentes do Sul in the
northwestern part of Rio Grande do Sul state. The deaths of the
animals occurred, respectively, on 30 Sep 2008, in the district of
Santo Antonio and the municipality of Tres Passos, and on 15 Oct 2008
in a place called Alto Cacador in the municipality of Tiradentes do
Sul. This region is on the border with Argentina, where circulation
of yellow fever [YF] virus was recently confirmed in the province of
El Soberbio [see ProMED archive no. 20081023.3353].

Deaths of monkeys have been reported as well in the municipalities of
Santa Rosa and Santo Cristo, which are under investigation.

2. Samples were collected in the municipalities of Tiradentes do Sul,
Santa Rosa and Santo Cristo. The sample from the monkey in Tiradentes
do Sul was confirmed for YF [virus], consistent with [results from]
histological examination and with positive immunohistochemistry.

3. The municipalities of Tres Passos and Tiradentes do Sul make up a
region of the state that has recorded YF epizootics in primates in
the years 2001-2002. Currently, these municipalities are classified
by the Ministry of Health as an area of YF transition, with a
recommendation for [YF] vaccination.

4. Among the actions undertaken, the assessment of the coverage of
vaccination against YF in the area of transition noted that:
- The area is composed of 52 municipalities, and the population is
estimated as 545 051 inhabitants;
- Between January 2001 and August 2008, 589 576 doses of [YF]
vaccine were given, and the estimated proportion of the population
vaccinated was 108.2 percent;
- The [YF] vaccination rate for one-year-old children in 2007 was
90.9 percent, corresponding to 5888 doses of the vaccine applied.
- In 2008 up to the month of August, vaccine coverage for this age
group was 79.8 percent [The use of one place of decimals implies a
statistical accuracy which is not warranted. - Mod.JW].

5. The Ministry of Health recommends the following actions:
- Intensify vaccination of people older than 9 months of age in
forested areas, for visitors (10 days before visiting) and residents.
- Intensify public education concerning YF.
- Orient local health services for immediate notification of
suspected YF cases.
- Conduct field investigations to verify new [YF] epizootics [in
non-human primates] and visitors or residents who present YF [virus
infection] symptoms.
- Carry out entomological investigations in [YF] epizootic areas to
identify the [mosquito] species present and to search for the virus.
- Verify areas and municipalities where recent reports of epizootics
in [non-human] primates, suspected human cases or human deaths [have
occurred] without diagnosis.
- Perfect the flow of information between municipalities, health
regions and State Secretariats of Health to favor opportunities for
information [flow] and response of health services.
- Maintain the population and health professionals informed,
reiterating the importance of epizootics in [non-human] primates as
an event that signals the risk of occurrence of YF [cases].

[Howler monkey mortality is a well known indicator of the presence of
the sylvan cycle of YF virus transmission in South America.
Maintenance of an immunized human population in these areas is
critical to prevent spill-over of the virus into urban and suburban
areas where the competent mosquito YF virus vector _Aedes aegypti_ is
abundant, and a significant proportion of the human population is unvaccinated.

A map of the specific municipalities where the YF monkey mortalities
occurred is presented in this report, available at the URL indicated.
