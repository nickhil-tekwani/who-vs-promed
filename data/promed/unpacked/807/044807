TB outbreak halts export of Zambia's lions
------------------------------------------
The United States has blocked the import of lions from Zambia for its zoos
because of an outbreak of tuberculosis among the big cats, a Zambian
official said on Friday. Zambia is home to thousands of lions, which are
in demand from zoos and safari parks in the United States, Europe, and
other places. Animal rights groups are opposed to this trade, arguing that
it is immoral to remove a wild animal from its natural habitat.
"Zambia is eligible to export lions and other wildlife under the Africa
Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), but we cannot do so at the moment because
our lions have tuberculosis," Moses Simemba, Zambia's AGOA manager, told
journalists. AGOA is a preferential trade agreement between the US and
several African countries.
Simemba said the outbreak was in the Kafue National Park in central Zambia.
Bovine tuberculosis, the most common strain of the disease, afflicts lion
populations and can spread to humans. Lions usually contract it from their
prey.
"This is costing the country a fortune from loss of export revenue,"
Simemba said.
The spread of disease via live animals or animal products is a growing
global concern.
