State minister for Primary Health Care Dr Emmanuel Otaala has
confirmed a cholera outbreak in Butaleja district. The 1st suspect
case was reported on 29 May 2008 and later confirmed on 30 May 2008.
This was after samples of stools were examined at Busolwe hospitals.
By 9 Jun 2008, 36 cases had been reported with 4 deaths registered.

A baseline survey on the impact assessment of the cholera outbreak in
Butaleja was carried out by the Uganda Red Cross Society, Tororo
branch. This was followed by different efforts coming together to
contain the outbreak, which included social mobilization that was
carried out by the surveillance teams as well as community education
of cholera prevention and control.

The areas affected include Kachonga Sub County, Doho-Hibira,
Nabiganda C, Hamuseru village, Mazimasa, Magugu-Doho, and Hanjehe all
found in Butaleja Sub County.

An outbreak of cholera has been reported in a remote village of Mbale
District; it has already claimed 3 lives and leaves many others at
risk. Bubulo west MP George William Wopuwa says the epidemic is
blamed on the dry season that has forced people to consume polluted
water from rivers, specifically from the Manafwa River, which flows
through this affected area.

Cholera has infected almost 6000 south Sudanese and killed at least
44 in 2008, with more than half dying within the past 4 weeks,
officials from the South Sudanese Health Ministry said on Wednesday
[11 Jun 2008].

"From previous experience it always starts (in the south) and goes
north," South Sudan's director for preventable medicine John Rumunu
said. The epidemic has now reached Bor town, in the center of South
Sudan, he said.

A 2005 peace deal ended more than 2 decades of north-south civil war
and established a semi-autonomous southern government, but the
conflict left the region's health infrastructure desperately undeveloped.

Some 700 people died from the waterborne disease in 2006 and around
25 000 were affected. In 2008, outbreaks have occurred in several
southern towns, Rumunu said, including the southern capital Juba
where cases in nearby army barracks first raised the alarm in May 2008.

[4] Cholera - South Africa (Mpumalanga)
Date: Tue 10 Jun 2008

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200806101084.html>


On Tuesday [10 Jun 2008], 2 more cases of cholera were confirmed in
Barberton bringing the total number of reported cholera cases to 13
in the past 2 weeks. All the victims, including the 2 men who died,
are believed to be illegal gold miners who drank contaminated
underground water while digging for gold in abandoned mineshafts at
the Sheba mine.

"We currently have 4 patients at the Barberton hospital and the
others have since been discharged," said spokesperson for the
Mpumalanga Department of Health Mpho Gabashane, who added that the
town's water supply has tested clear of cholera and remains safe to
drink. He said the department was monitoring the situation.

The miners live in a nearby informal settlement called Sharlock,
where the department has distributed sachets of clean water in case
the miners return to the mines. They were reported missing by their
families and the police found them after searching the abandoned
mines on 29 May 2008.

Gold has been mined in Barberton for the past 200 years and illegal
miners continue to search for the valuable mineral. They are thought
to sneak into the networks of abandoned tunnels in small groups of 6
or 7 and live and sleep underground for days and even weeks at a time
while searching for gold ore. Some of the tunnels are almost 100
years old, but connect to modern gold mines still being used by
commercial companies, resulting in clashes with mine security.

the hospital. While 3 had been admitted, as they were serious, none
tested positive for cholera using the hanging drops test, he said.

_Vibrio cholerae_ has broken out in the troubled southern Kandahar
province, affecting 129 people in the Spin Boldak border town alone,
the health director said. Dr Abdul Qayyum Pukhla told a press
conference at the Governors House in Kandahar City 129 cholera cases
had been reported in the district, bordering the Balochistan province
of Pakistan.

He accompanied a team of medics to the district, where patients were
provided with the requisite health services and tribal elders briefed
on preventive measures. The disease has broken out in 5 villages
inhabited by 800 families, which use stream water for drinking.

He pointed out the people of Spin Boldak were hit by the ailment for
a 3rd year in a row, largely owing to a lack of clean drinking water.
A Spin Boldak resident told Pajhwok Afghan News over the telephone
that 8 people had already died of the infection. He said most of the
dead were children and old people. For his part, Dr Pukhla said he
had not received any report from health clinics in the town about the deaths.
