A 3 year old girl was admitted to our hospital with cough and mild shortness of breath and low grade fever for one day. She became asymptomatic the following day and, with a normal peripheral white blood count and normal chest radiogram, she was discharged only to be recalled several days later because a blood culture drawn upon admission was growing a small Gram negative bacillus that did not grow on MacConkey agar. At that time, she was totally asymptomatic and afebrile. She had no ill contacts, no significant travel, was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and there were 2 dogs in the house, an adult given to the family by friends 8 years ago and a puppy obtained from a breeder.

A follow up blood culture was obtained, which also became positive for the same appearing Gram negative bacillus, after which she was readmitted, and another blood culture also revealed the same small, unencapsulated Gram negative coccobacillus that grew aerobically, was catalase-positive and identified by the New York City Department of Health and Human Services as _Brucella canis_.

Subsequently, the adult dog was found to be antibody positive for _B. canis_ and was found to be blood culture positive for the organism. The puppy was blood culture and antibody negative.

_Brucella canis_ was initially recognized as an agent causing canine abortions by Carmichael in 1967 (1). Subsequently, human infections were diagnosed, primarily in laboratory workers as well as dog owners. It was subsequently clearly shown by a group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1975 (2) that routine brucella agglutinin testing is not helpful for _B. canis_ infection in dogs or humans and a more specific assay is now available (3).

The manifestations of _B. canis_ in humans can be minimal or can be an indolent bacteremia, as in this case. Complications of this infection can occur including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms and granulomatous hepatitis (3).

This disease in people is somewhat difficult to diagnosis and is underreported. Urine from infected dogs is one of the main sources of infection to people.

In dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal transmission. This organism primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal, and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. In utero infections occur. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.

Dogs often become chronically infected with _B. canis_ and can shed this organism for prolonged periods. Although some dogs clear the infection after a year (generally with treatment), others remain bacteremic for 5 years and possibly longer.

_B. canis_ can also be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp. can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.

Humans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. _B. canis_ is zoonotic, but the virulence of this organism for humans may be low, although it may be higher than has been reported in the past. Under-reporting of this disease may skew the reporting statistics. Under-reporting may occur because the disease is difficult to diagnose, and many physicians do not have the disease on their zoonotic radar.

_B. canis_ infections in humans resemble brucellosis caused by other _Brucella_ species. Some people infected with _Brucella_ remain asymptomatic, which is one reason for the difficulty in diagnosis and the resulting subsequent under-reporting. In symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Oral lesions were reported in a child concurrently infected with _B. canis_ and cytomegalovirus, and resolved with antibiotic treatment for brucellosis. Another patient with a _B. canis_ infection had fever of unknown origin. Some patients with brucellosis recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis, and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis, and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes. Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Deaths are usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.
