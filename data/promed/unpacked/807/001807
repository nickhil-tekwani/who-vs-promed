It has been a year since the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19. The coronavirus was 1st seen in China, and to a large extent the Chinese government took control of it. Now, an incident has come to light in China which has shocked the government. A large number of coronaviruses have been found in ice cream in Tianjin, northern China. A company called Tianjin makes this ice cream. Now Chinese authorities are investigating the people who eat this ice cream.

Meanwhile, authorities have seized all of Tianjin's products. According to a report, about 1600 employees of the company have been laid off and tested. Of these, around 700 employees have been found infected with corona. Cleanliness has been introduced. Locals have been urged to contact the health department if they have recently eaten this ice cream.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for officials to find out who ate the ice cream.

[The World Health Organization (WHO) states that it is unlikely for people to contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging, and that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route. Furthermore, there is no evidence that people can catch Covid-19 from cooked food, according to the WHO. The virus causing Covid-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to those at which other known viruses and bacteria are killed. Thus, food such as eggs and all meat -- including poultry -- should be cooked to at least 70 C [160 F].

Likewise, the Singapore Food Agency posted on its website that it is "not aware of any evidence" suggesting that the virus can be transmitted to people via food or food packaging and equipment.

However, it added that contact with these items is "no different" from contact with common surfaces such as lift buttons and doorknobs, which could be easily contaminated with the virus. The risk of possible transmission through these surfaces remains low. Still, it is important to maintain good personal hygiene.

At present there is no conclusive data that SARS-CoV-2 on food packaging poses a significant risk for infection, particularly when compared to the more common transmission through respiratory droplets. The SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and smaller sized particles passed through the air, underscoring the importance of mask-wearing.

Given that the virus tends to survive longer in colder temperatures, the conditions at these facilities tend to be more favourable for its transmission and spread. The clusters of infection of COVID-19 among workers in slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities in many countries can be attributed to factors that promote transmission of virus directly between workers, such as crowding, poor ventilation, and shouting in close proximity due to high ambient noise levels. Workers may go to work when infected, they may live in crowded housing, and travel on crowded transport. Environmental contamination at the work site is likely to be prolonged due to low temperatures, metal surfaces, and lack of UV light.

While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no COVID-19, initiating an outbreak, is an important hypothesis. It is necessary to understand the risk of an item becoming contaminated and remaining so at the time of export, and of the virus surviving transport and storage conditions.

Efforts to avert the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks seeded by contaminated food must begin at the source, that is in food processing premises. These efforts include frequent hand washing, cleaning of food contact surfaces, materials and utensils. Fitness to work protocols should be in place, and unwell staff should be excluded. At food processing and packaging plants, workers should be given every protection to keep themselves free from infection and to prevent it from spreading to the food; workers should be tested regularly, given financial support if they test positive so they can isolate at home, and have access to masks, gloves, sanitizer and disinfectant in the workplace.

In receiving markets at the other end of the supply chain, food cannot be decontaminated; however, added precautions to ensure good hand hygiene and regular cleaning of surfaces and utensils is important. Consumers should wash their hands after touching uncooked products and ensure that food is well cooked.

We already know that the virus can also be present on surfaces, and public health officials continue to urge people to wash their hands carefully and avoid physical contact with others. In general, the colder and dryer that conditions are, the longer the virus can survive on surfaces. Wiping down countertops, handrails and other surfaces is a common way to ensure safety. Some people have also gone to the extreme of disinfecting packages brought into their homes, both by themselves and by delivery services. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Updates on Variants
[A] Philippines:
Date: 23 Jan 2021

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1387421/uk-covid-19-variant-already-detected-in-ph-as-early-as-dec-10-says-expert


An infectious disease expert on Sat 23 Jan 2021 said that the Covid-19 variant that originated from the United Kingdom had already been detected in the Philippines as early as 10 Dec 2020, but it was too early to tell whether it was indeed that variant.

During an online press briefing, Dr. Edsel Salvana from the Department of Health-Technical Advisory Group (DOH-TAG) said samples from one of the 16 patients who were recently found to be positive for the UK variant were collected last 10 Dec 2020.

That date, according to Salvana, was 4 days before the UK reported to the World Health Organization that it detected a variant for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was on 14 Dec 2020.

"10 Dec 2020 was the earliest that we have detected it, but there are samples that we actually looked back at to make sure there was no widespread transmission in the country. This was part of the reason why we're actually looking for samples from October, November, and December 2020; these are retrospective samples," he said. "We haven't detected anything from October and November 2020, and one was detected from December 2020, so this person probably entered the country; he was from the UK or wherever; he may have carried the UK variant, but that variant was not identified because the problem hadn't been announced to the world yet."

There are currently 17 cases of the UK variant in the Philippines. The 1st case was a 29-year-old businessman from Quezon City, who came from a flight from Dubai. His case was announced by the DOH on 13 Jan 2021.

Salvana, meanwhile, said that the one-month lag time was early, compared to that of the UK, which took them 3 months to detect the new variant.

https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-digest-germany-detects-1st-case-of-brazilian-variant/a-56307893


The new coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil has been detected for the 1st time in Germany.

The state of Hesse's minister of social affairs, Kai Klose, said on Fri 22 Jan 2021 that a patient in the western German state tested positive for the Brazilian variant. According to Klose, the infected person flew into Frankfurt Airport, Germany's busiest hub, from Brazil on Thursday [21 Jan 2021].

According to Ciesek and Klose, the infected person had no symptoms. Ciesek said that a PCR test apparently confirmed that the man had the strain 1st identified in Brazil but that confirmatory sequencing results were still pending. The variant is thought to spread more easily, and to perhaps carry a higher risk of reinfections than the typical COVID variant, but Ciesek said there were as yet no indications of it causing worse symptoms in patients.

Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases said the variant detected in Brazil is similar to the one from South Africa and that an "increased transmissibility is considered conceivable." The institute said it continues to closely monitor the variant in Germany.

Germany's total coronavirus pandemic death toll also crossed the 50 000 mark on Fri 22 Jan 2021, the RKI added. The country reached the grim milestone as health authorities recorded 859 new coronavirus deaths in 24 hours. In Germany, authorities count all deaths of people who died with a potential connection to COVID-19 as coronavirus-related deaths. That means people recorded as having been infected with COVID-19 alongside preexisting illnesses, but whose deaths cannot be conclusively attributed to that condition, are also counted as a COVID-19 death.

The country has been under lockdown since mid-December 2020. Sweeping restrictions that have seen most areas of public life shuttered are set to remain in place until 14 Feb 2021.

The new lockdown appears to be having an effect. Germany has recorded a consistent drop in cases, according to its 7-day cases incidence metric.

Authorities hope to bring the 7-day incidence rate back down to below 50 to allow the resumption of contact tracing.

https://www.thelocal.no/20210123/norway-imposes-tough-lockdown-after-outbreak


Norway's capital Oslo and 9 neighbouring municipalities will impose strict shutdown measures, including the closure of all non-essential stores, after an outbreak of a more contagious coronavirus variant, 1st identified in Britain, the Norwegian government said on Sat 23 Jan 2021.

From Sat 23 Jan 2021, the very strict measures will be introduced across 10 eastern municipalities.

Shopping centres and other non-essential stores will be closed from noon local time on Sat 23 Jan 2021; organised sports activities will be halted, and schools must rely more on remote learning, the health ministry said in a statement.

"We are putting in place the strictest measures since last March [2020] in 10 districts," said Health Minister Bent Hoie.

"In some places, we are going even further than in March 2020," he told a press conference, adding that it will make "daily life difficult for many."

All public events, indoors and outdoors, are cancelled apart from burials. Restaurants will be limited to takeaway services.

The measures will remain in force until at least 31 Jan 2021 following the detection of the British variant in a home at Nordre Follo, 30 km (18 miles) from Oslo.

Two pensioners at the home, aged over 90, were found to have died with the variant, the public health institute said on Fri 22 Jan 2021.

A total of 22 employees and 12 retirees have been found to have coronavirus at the home, but it is yet to be established whether they have the variant.

The authorities have so far been unable to trace the origin of the cluster or a link with Britain.

"We are doing what we can to stop this with strong measures in order to regain control quickly and lift the toughest measures," the minister said.

The minister has requested that those who live in one of the 10 municipalities covered by the measures do not travel to other municipalities that are not covered by the measures.

"The effort that everyone who lives in this area in the next few days will make is an effort for the whole country. It is uncertain to what extent the mutation has spread to other municipalities, and the situation is confusing," the minister added.

https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/kraftige-tiltak-i-10-kommuner-etter-utbrudd-av-den-engelske-virusmutasjonen/id2829738/


To stop the outbreak of the English virus mutation in Nordre Follo, the government has decided that from Sat 23 Jan 2021 at 12.00, very strict measures will be introduced in a total of 10 eastern municipalities. The municipalities themselves wanted the government to decide on the measures.

"This is a very serious situation, and we must do what we can to stop the outbreak. There is high mobility in the area with a large number of commuters from Nordre Follo to Oslo every day. If the virus mutation spreads in Oslo, it will be very difficult to prevent it from spreading to the rest of the country. The government is, therefore, introducing strong measures in 10 municipalities," said Minister of Health and Care Services Bent Hoie.

It is currently uncertain to what extent the mutation has spread to other municipalities, and the situation is confusing. Therefore, it is necessary to implement measures in municipalities with a lot of contact with Nordre Follo. The measures will initially apply to the municipalities of Enebakk, Frogn, Indre Ostfold, Moss, Nesodden, Nordre Follo, Oslo, Vestby, Valer, and As. At the meeting that the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the National Institute of Public Health had with the municipalities and state administrators in Oslo and Viken yesterday [22 Jan 2021], there was agreement in the municipalities on the need for coordination.

"We are now introducing the strictest measures since 12 Mar 2020 in the 10 municipalities. In some areas, we are going even further than in March 2020. I know that this will lead to a demanding everyday life for many, and that many will face an uncertain time. We are now doing what we can to stop this outbreak with strong measures so that we can quickly gain control and ease the most intrusive measures. Together, we have managed to beat down the infection several times, and together we can manage it again," says Hoie.

The English virus mutation was 1st detected in nursing home residents at a nursing home in Nordre Follo, with a possible spread to a kindergarten. During Fri 22 Jan 2021, 17 new positive cases were detected with the English mutation. Five of these are connected to the nursing home in Nordre Follo.

The English virus mutation is far more contagious than the variants that have dominated Norway so far. The National Institute of Public Health considers that the risk of the mutation spreading is great, both within Nordre Follo and to other municipalities. This ongoing outbreak cannot be traced directly to immigrants from the United Kingdom, which has so far been the case for the other cases of this virus in Norway.

The government recommends that people in these 10 municipalities who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill or dying if they become infected now live more sheltered. They should keep an increased distance (preferably 2 meters [6.5 feet]) to others than those they live with or who are correspondingly close. They should receive help with purchasing, and sick leave can be assessed by a GP.

Those who live with (or who are similarly close to) people who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill or dying if they become infected should also live more secluded, otherwise they should keep an increased distance from the people in risk groups. If it is not possible to live more secluded, replacement housing can be assessed by the municipalities. It is important that people in the risk groups and their loved ones wear face masks when in contact with the health service, where it is not possible to maintain distance.

These are the new measures for the 10 municipalities. The measures will initially apply until 3 Jan 2021:

- Everyone should avoid home visits and gatherings in their own homes. Exceptions to the recommendation are necessary home services and visits to people who are in the last phase of life. Single people can be visited by or visit one or 2 regular friends or one permanent household. Children in kindergartens and primary schools can have visits from their own cohort.

- Everyone should avoid travel that is not strictly necessary. Travel to work must be considered strictly necessary. For the vast majority, there will still be requirements for a home office.

- The municipalities and county municipalities should introduce strengthened measures in public transport; this may, for example, be that only up to 50 per cent capacity is used in the means of transport.

- One-on-one businesses, such as hairdressers, should introduce reinforced measures such as the use of face masks in situations where it is not possible to maintain a distance of one meter or to reduce or temporarily remove treatment options that involve close face-to-face contact.

- It is recommended that the municipalities and the population in the relevant municipalities consider testing on days 7-10 during the infection quarantine period. It should also be considered whether household members of close contacts who are in quarantine infection should also be quarantined if there is a suspicion of infection of the mutated infection variant.

- All events outside the home are prohibited, both indoors and outdoors, with the exception of funerals and burials.

- Mandate for home office for all who can. Employers must ensure that employees work from home as far as is practically possible. Employers must be able to document that employees have been informed of how this is to be carried out in the company.

- Shops are closed. Exceptions are made for grocery stores, pharmacies, and petrol stations. The wine monopoly will also be closed and will not be open in the period 23-31 Jan 2021.

- When it is not possible to keep a distance of at least one meter, in addition to short-term passes to other than household members, [facemasks] must be used.

- Masks should be worn in public places such as shops, on public transport and indoor station areas, restaurants when picking up takeaway, in common areas in shopping malls if they are open because there are pharmacies and grocery stores in the malls, and in religious and philosophical houses in connection with funerals.

- The obligation to wear a face mask applies correspondingly to employees in places where it is not possible to keep at least one meter away from visitors. This does not apply to employees in places where other infection control measures have been implemented for the employees, such as the use of visors, partitions, and the like.

- Passengers must wear a face mask in a taxi. The mask must be put on before the passenger gets into the taxi and must not be removed until the journey has ended and the passenger has gotten out of the taxi. The obligation to wear a face mask applies correspondingly to the driver when there are passengers in the taxi.

The obligation to wear a face mask does not apply to children under 12 years of age, nor to those who for medical or other reasons cannot wear a face mask.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (172 913), Brazil (61 121), and the UK (33 552) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 14 197 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 22 Jan to late 23 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, France (23 924), Mexico (21 007), Russia (20 921), Colombia (15 551), India (14 891), Portugal (15 333), Germany (12 428), Italy (13 331), South Africa (12 271) and Indonesia (12 191). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 52 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 21.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 5.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are almost 650 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 48 days hours -- 100 000 less than Thursday (21 Jan 2021) -- and over 99.3 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.13 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports, although there is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 4 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.UBA]
