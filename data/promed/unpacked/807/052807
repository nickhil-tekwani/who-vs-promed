An overabundance of common bacteria in the canal water, due to recent warm weather, is believed to be responsible for multiple bird deaths, and there may be more to come.

Over the last week [last week of June 2020], residents in New Islington have reported seeing dead and sick geese along the Ashton Canal. The RSPCA and Canal & River trust have been called out on several occasions to remove the birds, and it has now been determined that the birds most likely died of avian botulism.

A Canal & River Trust spokesperson said:

"Unfortunately, several dead geese were found on the Ashton Canal over the weekend. Our team attended the site to investigate the cause of the incident. It appears that there has been a suspected outbreak of avian botulism, which is a naturally occurring bacterial infection that can affect wildfowl in the water and is more common in the summer with warm conditions.

"We've notified DEFRA of the incident and supported them with their investigation. The dead geese have now been removed, and we will continue to monitor the situation. We would like to thank the public for making us aware."

The RSPCA reported on Twitter that they had rescued 3 sick geese and retrieved 2 dead ones from the canal on Monday [29 Jun 2020].

Unfortunately, avian botulism tends to affect large numbers of birds at once, and infections can stick around for a long time. This means we may see more birds affected by the disease in Manchester, including other species. Dead birds can be reported to DEFRA on 0345 933 5577, and any sick birds should be reported to the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999. Sick birds may be moving strangely or struggling to move, as the disease causes paralysis.

Waterfowl can catch this disease from botulinum toxin in the water, and from eating maggots or any part of a dead infected bird. There is a very low risk to humans, although the public should refrain from touching the birds and practice normal hand hygiene. There is also a low risk to pets, so it is advisable to keep dogs out of the water and keep dogs on leads near alive and dead birds.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and, to a lesser extent, type E. - Mod.PMB
