Scientists who analyzed 67 H5N1 avian influenza viruses from across
Africa report that the viruses fall into 3 distinct sublineages, or
families, and that some have mutations that make them resistant to
antiviral drugs.

The scientists also found that some of the African viruses have
genetic markers that are characteristic of human flu viruses rather
than avian strains, according to their report, published yesterday
[18 Mar 2009] in the online journal PLoS One [see abstract below].

"These findings raise concern for the possible human health risk
presented by viruses with these genetic properties and highlight the
need for increased efforts to monitor the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses
across the African continent," says the report by a large
international team of scientists. The group includes several from
African countries and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

Lethal H5N1 viruses made their African debut on Nigerian poultry
farms in January 2006, the report notes. Soon afterward, the virus
cropped up in Egypt, Niger, and Cameroon, and in April 2006, it was
found in Sudan, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, and Ivory Coast. The virus
surfaced in Ghana and Togo in mid-2007 and in Benin in December 2007.
All but 2 human cases of H5N1 disease in Africa have occurred in
Egypt, whose official case count is 58, with 23 deaths. Nigeria and
Djibouti have each had one human case.

The scientists looked at 494 H5N1 gene sequences from 67 African
isolates, including the complete hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene
segments, all collected between February 2006 and early 2008 and
representing all 11 affected countries. The analysis also included
hundreds of gene sequences from European and Middle Eastern H5N1 viruses.

The researchers determined that all the African viruses belong to
clade 2.2 and are related to the H5N1 viruses that have been
circulating throughout Europe, Russia, and the Middle East since late
2005. Clade 2.2 traces back to the outbreak of avian flu in thousands
of migratory birds at China's Qinghai Lake in the spring of 2005, the
article notes.

Detailed analysis of the hemagglutinin genes showed that the viruses
fall into 3 sublineages (labeled I, II, and IV). All 3 groups "had
been co-circulating since the beginning of the epidemic in Africa,"
suggesting that all 3 had been introduced into Africa separately, as
reported in previous studies, the report says. Just how the 3 groups
entered Africa and spread so rapidly is still unclear. But the
viruses emerged in Africa when related strains were present in
European migratory birds, "and such birds may have played a
significant role in the introduction of the virus," the scientists write.

The 3 sublineages had geographic dimensions, but the patterns were
complex. All the Egyptian isolates were in sublineage IV, which they
shared with isolates from Gaza and Israel. Strains from Burkina Faso,
Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Cameroon formed a single cluster in
sublineage I. However, the authors found all 3 groups in Nigeria, a
finding that agreed with an earlier study. Viruses collected in Sudan
were in sublineage I and closely related to those from Nigeria,
Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast rather than to those from nearby Egypt
and Djibouti. Overall, the findings "may suggest that a certain
degree of geographical segregation has occurred in Africa" since the
initial viral introductions, the report states.

In searching signs of antiviral resistance, the team found 4 bird
isolates from Egypt carrying a mutation linked with resistance to the
older class of flu drugs, the adamantanes (amantadine and
rimantadine). They also found viruses from 2 human cases in Egypt
that had a mutation (known as N294S) that confers resistance to
oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and slightly reduced sensitivity to zanamivir
(Relenza). However, no mutations conferring resistance to oseltamivir
or zanamivir were found in any of the African viruses from birds.

The authors also found a number of isolates with genetic markers
usually found in human flu viruses rather than avian strains. In
particular, they checked the African viruses for 13 genetic markers
consistently found in the flu viruses that caused the pandemics of
1918, 1957, and 1968. They found 2, both in the PB2 gene. One of
these, known as E627K and associated with increased H5N1 virulence in
mice, was found in all the African isolates. Another was found in
just 2 bird viruses from Egypt.

In other findings, the report says that 2 different reassortant
viruses representing combinations of 2 of the 3 sublineages were
found in Nigeria in 2006 and 2007. One of these became the
predominant strain in Nigeria's poultry in 2007. "The continued
circulation of A/H5N1 viruses in the African continent not only
affects the local economy but also impacts on animal and human
health," the report states. It concludes with a call for constant
efforts to monitor and control avian flu across Africa.

David A. Halvorson, DVM, an avian flu expert at the University of
Minnesota in St. Paul, said the report appears to confirm that there
were 3 separate introductions of H5N1 into Africa and that those
strains continue to circulate. Further, he said the study shows that
genetic sequencing "shows evidence for international spread within
Africa as well as evidence for local spread and that there have been
no additional introductions since the 1st ones." Halvorson also
commented that the findings regarding antiviral resistance are not
surprising: "These mutations are typical of viruses as they circulate
in a host. It seems they can mutate to resistance without any
antiviral compound present."

Despite the prevalence of avian H5N1 influenza virus in poultry in
Africa, so far there have been only 2 human cases (one fatal)
anywhere outside of Egypt. The results of phylogenetic analyses are
consistent with 3 separate introductions of avian influenza virus
into Africa. Although the viruses now present in Africa are similar
to strains previously found in European migratory birds, the evidence
that migratory birds played a major role in the spread of avian
influenza virus into Africa remains circumstantial.

The preceding CIDRAP report is based on the paper by Cattoli G, Monne
I, Fusaro A, et al., entitled "Highly pathogenic avian influenza
subtype H5N1 in Africa: a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and
molecular characterization of isolates," published in PLoS ONE 4(3):
e4842. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004842

Abstract:

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/H5N1 was 1st officially
reported in Africa in early 2006. Since the 1st outbreak in Nigeria,
this virus spread rapidly to other African countries. From its
emergence to early 2008, 11 African countries experienced A/H5N1
outbreaks in poultry, and human cases were also reported in 3 of
these countries. At present, little is known of the epidemiology and
molecular evolution of A/H5N1 viruses in Africa. We have generated
494 full gene sequences from 67 African isolates and applied
molecular analysis tools to a total of 1152 A/H5N1 sequences obtained
from viruses isolated in Africa, Europe and the Middle East between
2006 and early 2008. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of the 8 gene
viral segments confirmed that 3 distinct sublineages were introduced,
which have persisted and spread across the continent over this 2-year
period. Additionally, our molecular epidemiological studies
highlighted the association between genetic clustering and area of
origin in a majority of cases. Molecular signatures unique to strains
isolated in selected areas also gave us a clearer picture of the
spread of A/H5N1 viruses across the continent. Mutations described as
typical of human influenza viruses in the genes coding for internal
proteins or associated with host adaptation and increased resistance
to antiviral drugs have also been detected in the genes coding for
trans-membrane proteins. These findings raise concern for the
possible human health risk presented by viruses with these genetic
properties and highlight the need for increased efforts to monitor
the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses across the African continent. They
further stress how imperative it is to implement sustainable control
strategies to improve animal and public health at a global level."
