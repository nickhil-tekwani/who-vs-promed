An outbreak of bovine rabies detected in eastern Bolivia
--------------------------------------------------------
The Prefecture of the Bolivian Department of Santa Cruz (East)
confirmed today [29 Apr 2009] an outbreak of bovine rabies that has
already killed at least 74 heads of cattle in the south of the
region, about 200 kilometers [124 mi] from the border with Paraguay.

The director of the Agricultural Health Department, Juan Ascarron,
told EFE that laboratory analysis had confirmed the existence of
"bovine rabies or wild rabies" in an area known as La Junta, also
about 200 kilometers south of the city of Santa Cruz, the capital of
the department.

Ascarron explained that this phenomenon is "not extraordinary"
because rabies in Bolivia is an endemic disease, especially in areas
where there is a greater presence of bats, which transmit the
disease, such as the eastern lowlands.

"When this vampire or this bat is infected, its habit of sucking
blood can lead to transmission of the disease to the cattle" added
the official.

Ascarron rejected reports in the media which stated surprise at the
outbreak given a recent vaccination campaign in the area and
clarified that it [the campaign] began once they already had
information of bovine deaths.

"They took samples at the same time they were vaccinating. Once
rabies occurs there is no cure. He clarified that the live animals
were vaccinated, and they need between 3 and 4 weeks to raise
protective antibodies."

The veterinarian also reported that his department is in "the process
of giving booster doses of vaccine, to get better coverage" for the
protection of the animals.

[Vampire bats are often the culprit for spreading this disease and an
influx of bats generally prompts a vaccination campaign.
Interestingly rabies is a method of controlling the vampire bats as
they will die off.

Sometimes these rabies outbreaks are associated with deforestation of
an area, thus causing the bats to lose part of their habitat and
enter areas where they may not have been previously seen before. -
