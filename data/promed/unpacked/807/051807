Health authorities are still trying to stamp out a bacterial-disease
outbreak that began in Dubuque this summer.
Dubuque County has reported 154 confirmed cases of shigellosis this
year [2001, compared with 4 last year, said Kevin Teale, spokesman
for the Iowa Department of Public Health. In Dubuque County, 50
more people have had suspected cases of the disease.
The illness commonly attacks children and causes severe diarrhea. The
outbreak received national attention Thursday when it was featured in a
weekly publication [MMWR of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.
Public health investigators traced the source to an unchlorinated
wading pool in Dubuque's Eagle Point Park, where they believe a child
with diarrhea probably spread the disease into the water in June [2001.
Several dozen people who visited the pool came down with shigellosis.
The pool has been closed since 15 Jun 2001, but the ailment has
continued to spread in the area. Teale said it tends to hit child-care
operations.
Because of the outbreak, 7 people have been hospitalized. Teale said in
serious cases, dehydration can lead to kidney problems.
The report included several tips to prevent such an outbreak. It said no
one should swim while suffering diarrhea, because even special swim
diapers do not offer sufficient protection. Children should regularly be
taken to the bathroom during swim outings, and they should wash their
hands thoroughly. They also should not drink pool water.
Chlorination of the pool water might have cut down on the number of
cases but would not have been a guarantee against infection, Teale said.
Proper hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent the disease's
spread in child-care settings, the report said.
Even with the large Dubuque outbreak, the state has seen fewer cases
of shigellosis this year than last, Teale said.
