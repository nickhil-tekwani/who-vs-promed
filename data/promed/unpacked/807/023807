More than two dozen cows in Canada's beef-producing province of Alberta have
died from anthrax this summer, but the industry said Monday cases of the
deadly disease were isolated and not a growing problem.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed this weekend 2 cows that died
recently on a farm near the central Alberta town of Rocky Mountain House had
anthrax, bringing the number of cases during the past 2 months to 28. The
government agency quarantined the farm, as it did after previous similar
cattle deaths starting in late June [1999. All were from 6 farms in the
same region, about 150 km northwest of Calgary.
The province's C$11-billion cattle industry moved quickly to attempt to calm
residents and export customers that humans were in no danger of catching
anthrax. "These animals, when they're dead, they're buried, they're limed.
You can never take a dead animal through the food system anyway, so it's not
transferable through meat," Gary Sargent, general manager of the Alberta
Cattle Commission, said. "There is no human food safety or health safety
concern here."
All cattle that were not infected on the 6 farms were vaccinated against
anthrax, he said. Rainy weather this summer probably unearthed soil carrying
bacterial spores that had been buried for decades, he said. The cattle were
then exposed as they grazed.

[The rain hypothesis may explain the initial affected farm, but not the
subsequent cases. One must ask why the subsequent affected farms are either
contiguous with the first or within a few kilometers. Some are uphill not
downslope. Puzzling. But it is certainly a very localised problem. - MHJ
