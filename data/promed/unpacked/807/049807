[1] Case count rising

The death toll from a strange disease that is devastating parts of
northern Uganda has now reached 38. Another 91 people are also
reported to be infected and suffering from the unknown disease, which
scientists from the Uganda Virus Research Institute are trying to
establish. A team of health experts has already been dispatched to
northern Uganda to monitor the situation, but also try and establish
the cause of the disease.

Ministry of Health officials said yesterday [4 Dec 2010] that
preliminary laboratory tests conducted by local and international
researchers have tested negative for the deadly Ebola, Marburg,
Crimean-Congo fever, Rift Valley fever and typhoid. "Further tests
are being run to identify the disease," said Dr Kenya Mugisha, the
director general of health services in the health ministry.

Dr Mugisha said the yet-to-be-established disease has, since 10 Nov
2010, been reported in the districts of Agago, Pader, Abim, Lamwo,
and Gulu. According to the Ministry of Health, the affected patients
complain of severe headache, dizziness, and a mild fever at the onset
and then progress with pain in the abdomen together with diarrhoea
and vomiting.

The general public has now been urged to avoid eating sick and dead
domestic animals, to observe personal hygiene including hand washing,
and to report suspected cases to the nearest health facility.

Comment
------------
There are discrepancies in the reports about the new undiagnosed
disease in Uganda. The disease was 1st recognized in Northern Uganda
in Kitgum district. Now I read about the help of scientists from
Tanzania. This is strange, because Tanzania has a border with Uganda
in the south, not in the north. The next border in the north is
Southern Sudan. Here you can see that there are too many rumors in
Uganda. The high death rate in Kitgum is a fact.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Manfred Peters for this comment. The number of
cases and fatalities continues to rise, but confusion remains about
the cause and nature of the outbreak. The suggested diagnosis of
plague contained in the preceding report from the region is no longer
mentioned. Clarification of the situation in Northern Uganda is still
awaited. Forthwith, ProMED-mail will only post new reports from the
region when greater consistency is apparent.

The districts in the Northern Region of Uganda affected by the
outbreak can be located using the map at
