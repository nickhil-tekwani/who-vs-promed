Algerian authorities have announced the death of a 2nd person in a recent cholera outbreak that has left dozens hospitalized. The latest fatality, like the 1st one, was a resident of Boufarik, a town in Blida province some 30 km [18.6 mi] south of the capital, Algiers, according to a health ministry statement carried by the official Algerie Press Service on Sat 26 Aug 2018. Another Boufarik resident was reported dead on 23 Aug 2018. Overall, 139 people have been hospitalised across the country since 7 Aug 2018, with at least 46 cases confirmed as cholera, the ministry said.

As of [Fri 24 Aug 2018], cases were reported in the provinces of Blida, Bouira, Tipaza, Medea, and Ain Defla, as well as the capital.

Reda Daghboush, the director of Boufarik hospital, confirmed in a statement that cholera was the cause for the death of the 2nd victim, an elderly woman who also suffered from "other chronic diseases".

In an interview with the Huffington Post, Mohamed Bekkat Berkani, president of the National Council of the Order of Doctors lamented the state of health in the country, saying that he regretted that the Pasteur Institute -- the body in charge of preventive healthcare and infectious diseases in Algeria -- was neither capable of controlling the "epidemic" nor identifying its origin.

A number of Algerians have also expressed anger on social media after Zoubir Harrath, director of Pasteur Institute, told a news conference earlier this week that "cholera outbreaks have occurred in Chad, Niger, Yemen ... not just in Algeria."

Health authorities in Algeria announced late on [Thu 23 Aug 2018], the outbreak of cholera, saying there have been 41 confirmed cases out of 88 suspected who are getting medical treatment at hospitals in northern Algeria. The ministry specified that the highest number of cholera affected cases was recorded in Blida province, 50 km [31 mi] south of Algiers, as 50 people have been admitted, including 22 confirmed cases.

In the capital Algiers, 14 people are suspected of being affected, including 5 confirmed cases. In Tipaza province, 50 km [31 mi] west of Algiers, 18 people are hospitalized, of which 11 confirmed cases. 6 other cases including 3 confirmed were identified in the province of Bouira, 100 km [62 mi] southeast of Algiers.

All of the suspected cholera cases are currently in isolation at different hospitals receiving medical treatment, noted the source.

The ministry denied the reports that the cholera outbreak is due to water contamination. Experts of the ministry said the outbreak is probably due to contaminated fruits and vegetables, urging populations to take prevention measures.
