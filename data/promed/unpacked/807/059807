[1] WHO Update
-------------
Date: Sun 21 Apr 2013
Source: World health Organistion (WHO), Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China - update
http://www.flu.org.cn/en/news_detail?action=ql&uid=&pd=&newsId=17122

As of 21 April 2013 (18:00CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 6 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and one fatal case from Shanghai Municipality. Of the latest laboratory confirmed cases, 5 are from Zhejiang Province and one is from Shanghai Municipality.

The patients include:
- a 68 year-old male from Shanghai Municipality who became ill on 13 April 2013;
- a 68 year-old female from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 12 April 2013;
- a 76 year-old male from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 8 April 2013;
- a 81 year-old male from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 12 April 2013;
- a 58 year-old male from Zhejiang Province who became ill 16 April 2013;
- a 79 year-old female from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 13 April.

Additionally, 1 patient earlier reported from Zhejiang Province has died.

To date, there are a total of 102 [now 104] laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 20 [now 21] deaths. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. Currently, 70 patients are being treated in hospital and 12 patients have been discharged.

National authorities continue to implement prevention and control measures. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

China confirms 104 H7N9 cases, 21 deaths
----------------------------------------
BEIJING: During the 24-hour period ending at 4 p.m. on Mon 22 Ap r 2013, China confirmed 2 new cases of human H7N9 avian influenza -- both reported in Zhejiang province. The National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 104 [now 104] H7N9 cases have been reported in China, including 21 that have ended in death. Of the total, 13 H7N9 patients have been discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment, and the other 70 patients are being treated in designated hospitals, according to the commission.

A total of 33 cases, including 12 that have ended in death, have been reported in Shanghai; 24 cases, including 3 deaths, have been reported in Jiangsu Province, and 40 cases, including 5 deaths, in Zhejiang Province. Anhui Province has reported 3 cases, with one ending in death. Beijing has reported one case and 3 cases have been reported in Henan Province.

China officially confirmed the human cases infected with the H7N9 virus late last month. According to the commission, China's confirmed H7N9 cases are isolated and there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission.

Another 2 cases of H7N9 bird flu were confirmed on Monday [22 Apr 2013] in east China's Zhejiang Province, bringing the province's total number of infections to 40, said local authorities.

The patients, a 54-year-old female office clerk from the provincial capital of Hangzhou and a 32-year-old farmer from the neighboring Jiangxi Province, are receiving treatment in 2 local hospitals [in Zhejiang], according to the provincial health department.

A 41-year-old patient, who tested positive for H7N9 on [17 Apr 2013], recovered and left hospital on Monday morning [22 Apr 2013], according to the department. So far in Zhejiang province, 5 people have died of H7N9 bird flu and 2 have been discharged from hospital after making a full recovery.

Shandong Province (suspected)
-----------------------------
A 36-year-old man suspected of being infected with H7N9 was found in Zaozhuang City of east China's Shandong Province on Monday [22 Apr 2013], the 1st case discovered in the province, according to the provincial health department. The man's sample has been sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.

[Shandong province is the next province north of Jiangsu. Jiangxi province shares borders with both Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. It is not clear whether the farmer became infected in Jiangxi or Zhejiang, but perhaps H7N9 originated in Jiangxi, or even further south, and is moving north with summer migrating wildfowl. - Mod.JW]

[4] From SARS to H7N9
---------------------
Date: Sat 20 Apr 2013

From SARS to H7N9: will history repeat itself?
----------------------------------------------
China will never forget the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), for which it paid such a heavy and painful price a decade ago. According to WHO, from 1 Nov 2002, to 31 Jul 2003, 648 of the 7082 probable cases of SARS in mainland China and Hong Kong died. Many of the patients were front-line health workers. At that time, in the wake of its initial negative response to SARS, as well as proof of its fragmented and ineffective public health system, the Chinese Government's international reputation and domestic credibility were seriously damaged.

10 years on, the shadow of SARS is again hovering over Chinese hearts with the emergence of the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus. By the time The Lancet went to press, 63 confirmed cases of H7N9 human infection,including 14 deaths, had been reported over a wide area, ranging from eastern China (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces), west of those (Henan province), to northern China (Beijing). Unavoidably, there are pervasive worries that history might repeatitself.

SARS coronavirus and H7N9 virus share some similarities. Neither virus had been reported in human beings previously. Worldwide, people of all ages have had little protective immunity, and there is a global pandemic threat. Both viruses can lead to severe disease, characterised by high fever, severe respiratory symptoms, and deaths. Additionally, the sources fuelling human infections of both viruses remain to be determined. SARS coronavirus is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir (perhaps bats) that spreads to other animals (civet cats) and then to the first infected human beings in southern China in 2002. As for H7N9 virus, the animal reservoir seems to be poultry. However, some patients had contact with poultry just before falling ill, whereas others had not.

Unlike SARS coronavirus transmission, sustained transmission of H7N9 virus between human beings has not yet been found. Worryingly, genetic changes among H7N9 virus suggests adaptation to mammals, as discussed ina World Report (see:
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60868-5/fulltext) in this issue, and further adaptations can be expected. The mutations of H7N9 virus might not be controllable, but China's efforts to track and contain the outbreak of H7N9 can be managed and monitored.

As for SARS's legacy, China is now better prepared to deal with the H7N9 outbreak. The Chinese Government's response to H7N9 has been much swifter and more transparent than it was in the SARS outbreak, which has earned praise from the international community. "We are very satisfied and pleased with the level of information shared and we believe we have been kept fully updated on the situation", said Michael O'Leary, WHO's representative in China. Having boosted investment enormously in the public health system since SARS, China has established and strengthened national and local surveillance systems to prevent and control diseases and has also expanded its laboratory capacity. Additionally, China's collaboration and communications with WHO and international scientific communities have been increased and strengthened.

The national and provincial government response, however, is not without controversy. There is debate within the Chinese news media and among the public that Shanghai might have deliberately delayed reporting cases of H7N9 human infection. The first infection in man was identified on Feb 19, but no public announcement was made until March 31. Treatment strategies against H7N9 virus infection are also being questioned. Chinese Government officials have suggested that people try the unproven indigowoad root (known as banlangen in Chinese) to prevent H7N9 virus infection. Furthermore, the efficacy of peramivir injection to treat H7N9 infection is as yet unclear, but this antiviral drug received accelerated authorisation on April 6 by the China State Food and Drug Administration to treat H7N9 human infection. Another weak link lies in China's agricultural departments. Unlike people, poultry infected with H7N9 virus show few symptoms, making detection very challenging. Health officials have acted promptly upon laboratory confirmation of cases, but can agricultural officials catch up with speed tracing to identify the
animal origins of H7N9 virus?

China is once again back in the spotlight with the H7N9 virus outbreak, which will be a test not only for its health and agricultural systems, but also for its political system, and for the new Minister of Health, Li Bin. H7N9 presents China with the opportunity to prove its openness and ability to rapidly share information from its well-developed surveillance system and strong research capacity.
