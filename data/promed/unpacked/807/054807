[The numbers of animals exposed, 559 cattle and 448 horses, reinforce that this report refers to a village community, not a single entity. The areas at risk of anthrax in Kazakhstan are largely in the eastern half of the country and border the national borders of the country. This outbreak is smack in the middle of a high risk zone. The various genomic strains found in this country spatially cluster specifically; see:
