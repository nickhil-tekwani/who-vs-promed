Romania/Turkish avian influenza
-------------------------------
"In view of the positive results of the 1st laboratory tests
for the isolation of the avian influenza (AI) virus, the
European Commission will, by emergency procedure, ban all
imports of live birds and feathers from Turkey," said
European Commission health spokesperson Philip Tod. "Imports
from Turkey of all other poultry products, with the
exception of heat-treated meat, which [treatment] kills the
AI virus, are banned."

Tod refuted any suggestion that the EU is being more lenient
on acceding country Romania than candidate Turkey. "The
Commission takes its decisions on the basis of fact. In
Romania, there is a suspicion of avian influenza, but
nothing has yet been confirmed after 4 days of tests. The
situation in Turkey is different, as AI has been confirmed
even if we do not yet know which type," said Tod.

Turkish officials finally informed the European Commission
on 9 Oct 2005 of an outbreak of AI in an open-air turkey
farm in the Balikesir region of north western Anatolia. Some
1800 turkeys, 1700 of which died after the 1st clinical
signs, were registered positive on 1 Oct 2005. "All
remaining birds in the farm have been killed and all
carcasses destroyed. Disinfection has been applied. The
origin of the outbreak is unknown," said Tod.

Following Turkey, this weekend [8-9 Oct 2005], avian
influenza finally hit Romania, dealing a blow to the
country's poultry industry. At Ceamurlia-de-Jos in the
Danube Delta region, at a distance of 100 km from the border
with Bulgaria, some 40 ducks and one chicken have died.

"Further tests are required and are being carried out. As of
now, these tests have not confirmed the presence of avian
influenza in Romania," said Tod. "All other poultry on the
farm have already been killed and carcasses destroyed.
Samples have been taken from 3 ducks and 2 chickens."

Information on suspicion of avian influenza in Romania and
Turkey
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Romania

In the evening of Fri 7 Oct 2005, the Commission services
were informed of a suspicion of avian influenza (AI) in
Romania. The suspicion has arisen in a backyard flock with
53 chickens/hens and 47 ducks located in the municipality of
Ceamurlia-de-Jos in the Danube Delta region, at a distance
of about 100 km from the border with Bulgaria. In this
flock, 40 ducks and one chicken have died, while the other
poultry (mainly chickens/hens) had no clinical signs of
disease. All other poultry in the farm have already been
killed and carcasses destroyed. Samples have been taken from
3 ducks and 2 chickens.

The ducks' blood samples have resulted positive for
antibodies against AI virus, while the 2 chicken samples
were negative. These findings alone do not lead to the
confirmation of avian influenza virus infection (including
highly pathogenic AI virus H5N1, that is, the virus strain
circulating in Asia), in particular because the finding of
antibodies in ducks cannot be considered as a rare event and
could be due to prior infection with low pathogenic AI,
while the ducks' deaths could be due to diseases other than
AI.

Samples from the dead ducks are also being tested for the
detection of avian influenza virus (virus isolation test on
embryonated eggs: highly pathogenic AI should kill the
chicken embryos in 3-4 days) at the Romanian laboratory.
After 4 days, as of Sun 9 Oct 2005, this test has not given
any positive result so far; however, a "2nd passage" in eggs
is now being performed.

In relation to these findings, the Romanian authorities have
undertaken strong actions, including the stamping-out of all
poultry in the farm in which the ducks died and in several
other backyard/family type farms in the surrounding,
rigorous controls at the border of the "restricted zone"
established around the suspected farm, disinfection, etc.
Samples from some poultry and dead wild swans have been
taken on Saturday [8 Oct 2005] in the village concerned and
its surroundings and have been sent to the laboratory in
Bucharest for testing.

During the weekend [8-9 Oct 2005], the Romanian veterinary
authorities have remained in close contact with the European
Commission's services and asked for technical support and
laboratory reagents.

A community expert team made of Jorgen Westergaard, former
highly experienced Commission official (Deputy Head of Unit
in SANCO E2), Ruth Manvell, from the Community Reference
Laboratory for AI, Weybridge, UK, and Guus Koch, from the
National Reference Laboratory for AI in the Netherlands is
arriving in Bucharest today, 10 Oct 2005, bringing all
necessary laboratory reagents requested by Romania.

It is expected that, by Wed 12 Oct 2005, the ongoing
laboratory tests should confirm or exclude with a high
degree of certainty the occurrence of AI; further tests
indicating whether the virus is highly pathogenic or not and
for the final characterization of the virus type would take
2 days more.

The European Commission will review the situation once these
test results are received and will act immediately in
accordance with the results.

Turkey

On Sun 9 Oct 2005, the European Commission's services have
been informed of an outbreak of AI in an open-air turkey
farm with 1800 turkeys, 1700 of which died after the 1st
clinical signs were detected on 1 Oct 2005. All remaining
birds in the farm have been killed and all carcasses
destroyed. Disinfection has been applied.

The origin of the outbreak is unknown. The farm is located
in the Region of Balikesir, in the north western part of
Anatolia.

Laboratory tests (HI, ELISA and virus isolation on
embryonated eggs) have resulted positive for the avian
influenza virus, but the exact strain is not yet known, nor
is it known whether the strain is of high or low pathogenic
avian influenza.

The European Commission's services and the Community
Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza have immediately
offered assistance and laboratory support to the Turkish
veterinary authorities. The Turkish authorities will
probably send appropriate samples to the CRL, Weybridge,
probably today, 10 Oct 2005. Final virus characterization
will be available within 24/48 hours from arrival of samples
in the laboratory.

In view of the positive results of the 1st laboratory tests
for the isolation of avian influenza virus, the European
Commission will today [10 Oct 2005] adopt a decision by
emergency procedure to ban all imports of live birds and
feathers from Turkey. Imports from Turkey of all other
poultry products, with the exception of heat-treated meat,
which treatment kills the AI virus, are already banned.

[The EU statement is a timely update of the disease
situation in Romania and Turkey. Generally, the facts are in
line with the summary included in posting 20051010.2950,
based upon the information collected from newswires
published since Sat 8 Oct 2005.

Both Romania and Turkey have applied severe control measures
in relation to the animal health situation; the Romanians,
however, have reportedly decided to vaccinate thousands of
people within the affected region. This is an exceptional
precautionary step which needs explanation. If the news is
correct, the background might be sought in their decision to
follow the Dutch experience during the H7N7 outbreak there
in 2003. The Dutch vaccinated with the then current (human)
influenza vaccine (and applied prophylactic treatment with
neuraminidase inhibitors to) all people exposed to infected
poultry; they did not vaccinate poultry. Their reasoning was
the wish to prevent possible mixed infections of humans by
human and avian influenza viruses, which might lead to virus
reassortment; see 20030501.1092.

A better view of the current situation and conclusions that
will help further decisions, will, hopefully, become
available after the visit of the EU mission to Romania and
upon the completion of the OIE expert's mission to assess
the avian influenza situation of wildlife in Russia,
expected shortly (see 20051005.2906). Thus far, the role of
migratory birds in the spread of H5N1 is a matter of debate.
