The North Darfur Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) have reported that 81 cases of haemorrhagic fever were registered between 28 Aug-5 Nov [2014] in El Fasher, Dar El Salam, Kuma, and Tina localities. This includes 3 fatal cases.

An overwhelming 95 percent of the potentially fatal haemorrhagic cases is from El Fasher locality, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its news bulletin this week. The most cases, a total number of 35, in the 4 localities were reported 2 weeks ago.

Out of 22 blood samples, 15 tested positive for dengue fever. The results of re-confirmation tests by the WHO are expected to be released soon, the humanitarian office writes.

In South Kordofan, the state's Health Minister acknowledged the spread of hemorrhagic fever in a press release earlier this week. He revealed that 25 people were infected and have been isolated in hospitals, but no deaths have been reported.

[The report says: "Out of 22 blood samples, 15 tested positive for dengue fever. The results of re-confirmation tests by the WHO are expected to be released soon, the humanitarian office writes" -- but no confirmation has been reported in the 2 weeks since then. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and fatal dengue shock syndrome are rare complications of dengue, and there are no reports of widespread dengue-like fever in the region. Serological tests for dengue may cross-react with yellow fever antibodies. It is urgent to exclude YF, which was reported from neighbouring South Kordofan in November a year ago (2013). - Mod.JW

The samples were reported to have come from the North Darfur outbreak. No mention is made of samples having been taken during the outbreaks of undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever occurring in other localities in Sudan. If samples were taken and tested, ProMED-mail would be interested in the laboratory results. It is interesting that the Sudan Ministry of Health is launching a yellow fever vaccination campaign in the country.
