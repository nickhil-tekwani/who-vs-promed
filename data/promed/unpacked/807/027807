The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated [1 Jun 2018]:
- A total of 57 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 37 confirmed, 13 probable and 7 suspected.
- 7 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro, 3 in Iboko and 2 in Wangata. All of these cases are known contacts that were monitored by surveillance teams.
- The 5 suspected cases reported in the bulletin of Friday [1 Jun 2018] were negative
- No new deaths reported this day.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 902 people have been vaccinated, including 567 in Mbandaka, 169 in Bikoro and 166 in Iboko.
Medical care
- So far, 9 patients who were confirmed Ebola cases have been cured and have been discharged from the Ebola treatment center where they were hospitalized. The commissions of care and psychosocial follow-up have launched the National Association of Ebola Winners (ANVE) bringing together all the cured to ensure a better biological, psychological and social monitoring.
Logistics
- This [Fri 1 Jun 2018], the Ministry of Health has sent 40 new motorcycles to facilitate the work of surveillance teams deployed in the field. This batch of motorcycles adds to the 65 tons of drugs, 250 kilograms [551.16 pounds] of chlorine and 4 mobile laboratories already sent by the Ministry of Health.

1. Situation update
The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains active. On [Wed 30 May 2018], one new confirmed EVD case was reported in Iboko. Three laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously in Iboko (2) and Wangata (1) health zones) tested negative. There were no new suspected cases and deaths.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on [4 Apr 2018]), a total of 50 confirmed/probable EVD cases and 25 deaths (case fatality rate 50.0 percent) have been reported, as of 30 May 2018. Of the 50 cases, 37 have been laboratory confirmed and 13 are probable cases (deaths for which specimens were not obtained). 62 percent (23) of the confirmed cases came from Iboko, followed by Bikoro (10 cases, 27 percent) and Wangata (4 cases). Of the 25 deaths, 68 percent (17) occurred in Bikoro, 5 (20 percent) in Iboko and 3 in Wangata. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The outbreak remains localised to the 3 health zones initially affected: Iboko (25 cases and 5 deaths), Bikoro (21 cases and 17 deaths) and Wangata (4 cases and 3 deaths). Following ongoing data review and cleaning, one death has been moved from Iboko to Bikoro.

As of 29 May 2018, a total of 724 contacts have been recorded and are being followed up actively. Of these, 80 percent (579) were followed up on the day of reporting.

Context
On [Tue 8 May 2018], the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo notified WHO of an EVD outbreak in Bikoro Health Zone, Equateur Province. The event was initially reported on [Thu 3 May 2018] by the Provincial Health Division of Equateur when a cluster of 21 cases of an undiagnosed illness, involving 17 community deaths, occurred in Ikoko-Impenge health area. A team from the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), visited Ikoko-Impenge health area on [Sat 5 May 2018] and found 5 case-patients, 2 of whom were admitted in Bikoro General Hospital and 3 were in the health centre in Ikoko-Impenge. Samples were taken from each of the 5 cases and sent for analysis at the Institute National de Recherche Biom√©dicale (INRB), Kinshasa on [Sun 6 May 2018]. Of these, 2 tested positive for Ebola virus, Zaire ebolavirus species, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on [Mon 7 May 2018] and the outbreak was officially declared on [Tue 8 May 2018]. The index case in this outbreak has not yet been identified and epidemiologic investigations are ongoing, including laboratory testing.

[2] African aid response to DRC Ebola outbreak
[2 Jun 2018]. With Ebola at a 'critical point' in Congo, aid groups scramble to limit the outbreak
[Washington Post, edited] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/with-ebola-at-a-critical-point-in-congo-aid-groups-scramble-to-limit-the-outbreak/2018/06/01/d3bfbb1e-62d7-11e8-81ca-bb14593acaa6_story.html?noredirect=on [Byline: Max Bearak]

The 2 brothers of Adalbert Wanza made a 170-mile round trip voyage on foot, boat and motorcycle through Congo's dense rain forest to bring him, and ultimately the rest of the world, grave news.

A visitor had died while in their home village, Ikoko-Impenge. A local priest buried him with ritual honors, including giving the corpse its last food and drink. Days later, the priest and most of his family were dead, too. When he heard the story, Wanza, the Catholic bishop of Mbandaka, knew it could be Ebola, which is endemic in the forest, and contacted health officials. Lab tests would prove him right.

Over the next 3 weeks, the most serious outbreak of the virus since a devastating epidemic in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 spread from deep within the rain forest to bigger towns and finally to Mbandaka, a regional hub of nearly 1.2 million people at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers.

As of Friday [1 Jun 2018], 37 cases of Ebola had been confirmed, 4 of them in Mbandaka, where it can more easily spread. Twelve confirmed cases resulted in death, as have an additional 13 suspected or probable cases.

The outbreak has triggered a massive effort to contain it, led by the Congolese government and the World Health Organization, and aided by numerous aid groups. Dozens of health workers are bringing experience from the West African epidemic.

They are also bringing an abundance of caution. The WHO, aid groups and West African governments underestimated the last big outbreak, which started in Guinea in 2014. By the time resources were mobilized, Ebola was already in or on its way to the capital cities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

A sense of foreboding hangs over conversations among these groups, even as their work appears to have stemmed the outbreak's growth for the time being. The last confirmed case in Mbandaka was reported on [Tue 22 May 2018], but the horror of the past is still raw -- more than 11 000 died in the West Africa epidemic, and cases spread as far as Nigeria's largest city, Lagos, and Dallas in the United States.

"We must make sure we leave not even one stone unturned," said Pierre Rollin, an Ebola expert for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who is now in Congo. "Signs point to a diminishing number of cases, but there are no guarantees until we have gone weeks without any."

The aid community has gone into overdrive since the Wanza brothers' revelation in early May [2018], which helped alert the national government to the outbreak. Medical organizations are using every strategy available, including an experimental vaccine cleared by the WHO for "compassionate use." It was administered in the waning days of the West African epidemic, but this is its 1st deployment in the critical early stages of an outbreak. Hundreds have received the vaccine and there are supplies for thousands more.

Vigilance is crucial. The virus is not one of the most contagious -- it is transmittable through direct contact such as touching bodily fluids -- but symptoms can take days if not more than a week to show, meaning infected individuals can travel long distances and encounter many people before there's any inkling of their condition.

"The outbreak is at a critical point where good contact tracing is going to determine its extent," said Anne Rimoin, a researcher at UCLA who has worked with the Congolese government for 16 years on Ebola.

Contact tracing is the process through which everyone who has interacted with someone suspected of having Ebola is identified and monitored. To succeed, it requires the near-instantaneous creation of a network of informants who surveil movements of people in and out of areas where the virus is suspected.

A tip from one of these people-watchers is what recently led a team of 16 Guinean doctors to a riverside village on Mbandaka's outskirts. A woman had arrived in the village to stay with relatives after her husband died in an area near Ikoko-Impenge, where the outbreak seems to have begun.

Within a day, the doctors had set up a contact-tracing operation. But monitoring contacts isn't the only tool they have: The Guineans were flown in because they are the only ones with hands-on experience administering the experimental Ebola vaccine, during the end of the epidemic in their home country.

Because the vaccine is as-yet unlicensed, everyone who receives it must sign a consent form. Aid workers say that sometimes involves considerable persuasion.

"The lesson from West Africa is this: The concept of a vaccine is not something that someone in rural Guinea or Congo will understand in just 2 minutes," said Fatoumata Battouly Diallo, 31, the team leader of the Guinean vaccinators.

They try to communicate the danger in a way people can understand. "We say, 'You want to protect your family, right? You want to protect your people? Your signature and 5 seconds of pain is all that is required.'‚Äà"

This part of Congo, Equateur province, is the most neglected in a country that generally has little in the way of infrastructure. That underdevelopment complicates the response to Ebola, forcing aid workers to use scarce helicopters or motorcycles to reach affected areas. Roads are so bad it can take a full day to drive 100 miles in a truck.

The vaccines are particularly difficult to transport. They must be kept at a temperature of 76 degrees below to 112 degrees below and have been shipped from Geneva in special containers that can retain that temperature for up to 6 days.

Ironically, the region's underdevelopment has helped slow the outbreak, officials say. Compared with the parts of West Africa where the last epidemic took place, people in Equateur are poorer and travel less. Whereas Sierra Leoneans infected with Ebola were lured to bigger towns by better health facilities, Mbandaka doesn't have that same draw. And transport itself is more difficult in the rain forest. Most of it takes place on boats -- from smoke-belching steamers to cargo-bloated barges to slender pirogues carved by ax out of massive trees.

Although Congo may sorely lack infrastructure, it has one of the most successful Ebola response mechanisms in the world, according to researchers and aid workers. Congo is where Ebola is most prevalent, and the current outbreak is the country's ninth since 1976.

"It has been just amazing to watch how quickly the Congolese health ministry detects these outbreaks, even when they are in such remote areas," said Rollin, of the CDC. The health ministry's close monitoring of unusual or clustered deaths in the rain forest is credited with early outbreak detection, but in many cases the alarm bells are rung by locals, like Bishop Wanza's brothers.

Not everyone in Equateur is taking the outbreak seriously, however. About half of the dozen Mbandaka residents The Washington Post interviewed along the city's one fully paved road said Ebola was a conspiracy. Before the outbreak, foreigners were exceedingly rare in Mbandaka, and the recent influx of hundreds of aid workers has brought large amounts of cash into the city. That has caused many to believe that Westerners brought Ebola here to make money.

Upon seeing foreign aid workers passing by in their Toyota Land Cruisers, some locals have taken to shouting, "Mundele Ebola!" which means "white person's Ebola" in Lingala, Congo's lingua franca. These theories have complicated the process of getting consent for vaccinations in some cases, though most people have ultimately agreed.

"The community in Mbandaka is divided between those who are fearful and those who don't care one bit," Wanza said. "Some people are not aware of how serious this is."

The process of contact tracing can also alienate Congolese who are unfamiliar with Ebola. Suddenly, they are surrounded by strangers, sometimes including people speaking in foreign languages, asking them about every move they've made in the past few days. Their family compound is abuzz with disease detectives, who may be wearing protective gear, or pointing gun-shaped thermometers at their foreheads.

"It is a fact that foreigners are a cause of stress for people here," said Prudence Toukou, a psychologist working for the Congolese health ministry. She was attending to the family of a man who left a treatment center against doctor's orders and died soon after. "Their lives are suddenly invaded and it is hard to understand who these people are."

While invasive, contact tracing is the only way an outbreak of Ebola can be fully extinguished, said Jonathan Polonsky, who was at the same family compound as the government psychologist.

As he left, he assured the people gathered, "It's only 6 more days. And if we don't see anything, then we're clear."

[1 Jun 2018]. Africa CDC deploys volunteers to tackle Ebola virus disease in DR Congo
[Panapress, edited] http://www.panapress.com/Africa-CDC-deploys-volunteers-to-tackle-Ebola-Virus-Disease-in-DR-Congo--12-630549024-20-lang2-index.html

After recruiting and training 18 Congolese volunteers, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has deployed them to Equator province to support the response to Ebola Virus Disease in DR Congo.

The African Union Commission announced [Fri 1 Jun 2018] in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that the responders, who are former volunteers of the African Union Support to the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA) in the 2014-16 outbreak, also participated in the post-Ebola enhanced surveillance in DRC in July 2017 in the province of Bas-Uele.

Distributed in 4 subgroups, Africa CDC volunteers will be based in Mbandaka (headquarters of the province of Equator), Bikoro, Itipo (epicentre of the ongoing epidemic) and Iboko.

"This multi-disciplinary team is composed of epidemiologists, physicians, communication experts, infection prevention and control experts, and a data manager," said the Commission. "They will support the efforts of the Congolese government in epidemiological surveillance, case management, laboratory diagnostic, water, hygiene and sanitation as well as communication and social mobilization."

In the meantime, the Africa CDC on [Fri 1 Jun 2018] held a task force meeting to further plan for the AU support to the Ebola outbreak in DRC. The meeting, chaired by the Africa CDC director, Dr John Nkengasong, received a situation report on the current status and deliberated on the concept of operations.

[This latest daily brief from the DRC MOH [part 1 - 1 Jun 2018] reports 7 new suspected cases since the previous day [31 May 2018]. Although this sounds like a significant uptick, the key fact here is that all of them were known contacts under surveillance. Under such circumstances, upticks in new suspected cases may simply be a delayed consequence of earlier transmission events that were larger (in terms of people exposed) or more severe (high-risk exposure, such as an unsafe burial), or a combination thereof.

In this report, the sum total of reported cases is grouped under the rubric of "hemorrhagic fever," which is an unfortunate term in this context. As discussed in Ebola update (16) [Fri 25 May 2018], most cases of Ebola infection do not result in hemorrhagic manifestations. If most, or at least not all, of the 57 above-mentioned cases do not have hemorrhagic manifestations, then what clinical criteria are being used to define suspected and probably cases?

Ebola survivors should also be celebrated and supported by the community, and here in the DRC they will part of a newly created National Association of Ebola Winners.

We have previously recommended the periodic WHO situation reports, and here highlight excerpts from the latest (7th) WHO External Situation Report.

Other than the DRC health ministry itself, much of what we've learned about the Ebola epidemic there has come from international (read: Western, European, and American) responders. Yet Africans themselves have had the most personal, societal, and institutional experience with Ebola virus disease. This ProMED posting aims to redress some of this imbalance by featuring 2 articles in part [2] about pan-African expertise and contributions to Ebola control.

In this regard, the Washington Post article makes a number of trenchant points:
(1) Many Congolese people who are not health specialists, such as Bishop Wanza of Mbandaka, have learned to recognize the signs and symptoms of Ebola infection, and thus alert health authorities and assist in the all-important contact tracing efforts.
(2) Despite the relative lack of communications and transportation infrastructure, the Congolese health ministry is quick to recognize and respond to Ebola outbreaks.
(3) The sudden influx of more white people, bearing more cash, than local Congolese people have ever seen, can itself impose obstacles such as fear, mistrust, and crossed expectations.
(4) The people perhaps best equipped to overcome these obstacles are other Africans who already have experience in dealing with local customs and beliefs that can impact Ebola control efforts. The arrival of Guinean health professionals in Mbandaka is particularly noteworthy because they are essentially the only such group in the whole world with practical experience in administering the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and all that entails, including obtaining informed consent from locals who may be illiterate or know nothing about immunity against pathogens.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control, based at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, has also aided the DRC by dispatching volunteers with previous Ebola experience in areas other than vaccination, including epidemiology, infection prevention and control, and community outreach. The work of African Union volunteers during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic was generally under-reported and likely underappreciated in the West. At that time I personally worked with health professionals from Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Uganda and learned much from them: not only are African healthcare workers much more familiar with endemic diseases that can mimic Ebola (such as malaria, typhoid, TB, and hemorrhagic fevers), they were much more accustomed to delivering healthcare in limited-resource environments (i.e.; the Art of the Possible).
