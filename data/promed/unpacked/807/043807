With such heavy mortality in such a short time period, might avian
influenza H5N1 not be at play?

[Dr Taha's observation is in place and acknowledged. We have tried to
obtain information about on the availability of a laboratory
confirmation of the suspected avian infectious bronchitis (AIB)
outbreak(s) in the Gaza strip, as well as about the exclusion of
avian influenza. Such information, which should come from a local,
national, or regional reference laboratory, has not become available
so far and is hereby requested.

HPAI H5N1 is known to be circulating in Egypt, which borders the Gaza
strip. In addition, LPAI H9 virus is known to be circulating in the
region and deserves to be taken into consideration as a separate
pathogen or possibly in combination with the AIB virus. H9 vaccines
are commercially available and are applied in several Middle Eastern
countries. - Mod.AS]
