Minnesota TB investigation discovers an additional infected cattle herd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced today that a Roseau County
beef cattle herd has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB).
As part of the disease investigation, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health
TB-tested cattle herds within 10 miles (16 km) of an infected cattle herd
or infected whitetail deer. The newly detected Roseau herd tested negative
in 2005 and 2006, but during a 3rd, follow-up round of testing in November
[2007], one animal tested suspect for bovine TB. Tissue samples were
collected and submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory
(NVSL) in Ames, Iowa where a diagnosis of bovine TB was confirmed late last
week [14-20 Jan 2008]. Minnesota has now detected bovine TB in 9 beef herds.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has begun the
indemnification process, which consists of appraising the herd so that it
can be purchased from the producers and put down.
At this time, Minnesota's Modified Accredited Advanced TB status will
remain unchanged. Minnesota Board of Animal Health executive director and
State veterinarian Dr Bill Hartmann said that work will continue unabated
to return the state to TB-Free status. However, the discovery of any
additional herds could result in the downgrading of Minnesota's status.
"We are discussing with industry representatives and USDA what to do if
additional herds are found," said Hartmann. "And we are reviewing all
options including split state status. It is important that we gather all
the necessary information from USDA and we have to fully comprehend the
needs of the industry statewide. At that time we would be able to address
the best way to regain TB-Free status. Either way, we remain committed to
working with all of our partners to eliminate this disease."
The state's multi-faceted TB eradication effort includes the following
components:
- area testing: cattle herds located within 10 miles (16 km) of a
previously infected farm,
- disease investigation: herds that have had contact with one of the
previously infected farms, and
- statewide surveillance: a sampling of 1550 cattle herds across Minnesota,
all of which tested negative for bovine TB.
In all, about 347 000 TB tests have been performed since the disease was
discovered in Minnesota in July 2005.
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) conducted TB
surveillance of hunter-harvested whitetail deer in the affected area of
north west Minnesota. Over 3000 deer have been tested in this area since
2005, with 13 deer testing positive and an additional 4 testing presumptive
positive for the disease this past fall [2007].
Michelle Carstensen, DNR wildlife health program coordinator, said complete
test results will be available within the next several weeks. "Although
finding additional infected deer is obviously a concern, the good news is
that the prevalence of the disease remains low and is confined to a small
geographic region," Carstensen said. "The DNR is taking every precaution to
prevent bovine TB from spreading through the deer herd."
Due to preventative measures taken by the beef and dairy industries and
animal health officials, cattle infected with bovine TB pose little risk to
human health. The United States has actively pursued a bovine TB
eradication program since 1917, which includes food safety initiatives such
as milk pasteurization and specific examinations of internal organs for TB
at slaughter.
All cattle that enter the food supply are inspected at harvest by
inspectors that are trained to recognize and report any animals with
symptoms of TB and other diseases. It is this inspection process that led
to the discovery of the 1st infected herd in Minnesota.

[Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_. Although
this bacterium primarily affects bovines, it can affect a wide range of
mammals, including humans, swine, and deer.
Minnesota is to be congratulated for their diligence in trying to return
the state to the coveted "Free-state" status. Tuberculosis is a slow
insidious disease and it takes time to rout out a disease of this nature.
This article shows the concern of state officials by involving the wildlife
side so that a situation similar to that in Michigan does not develop.
Minnesota was designated as Modified Accredited State. This article implies
this may be at risk and the state could be downgraded in its status.
