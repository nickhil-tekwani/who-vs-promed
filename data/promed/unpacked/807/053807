International Medical Corps: country directors and other leadership positions with immediate openings
-----------------------------------------------
Dear Colleagues,

The Ebola crises continues, and the need for a deep roster of professional, experienced staff increases as the world's eye turns from this crisis that is likely to affect those in West Africa much more deeply and last for well beyond any of our early predictions.

International Medical Corps is now seeking the following positions, as their footprint has been growing, and those working in the field need your support. As a director and leader for IMC, you will continue to ensure the highest level of training in country for health care workers, coordinate direct patient care in EVD affected countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea), as well as work with preparedness response in at risk Mali.

If you are interested, or know of those interested, please forward this email and encourage simultaneous application on line at:
http://careers.internationalmedicalcorps.org/careers.aspx.

You will need to search by the number and apply directly to that position, whose Job Descriptions are listed below and enclosed as documents. Please do circulate widely; I'm happy to chat with anyone considering any of these positions and to discuss working with IMC in general, as I have been working with IMC as their technical advisor on Ebola since August 2014.

1. 14-896 Emergency Team Director, MALI
2. 14-1007 Country Director, LIBERIA
3. 15-002 Emergency Team Director, GUINEA
4. 15-022 Deputy Country Director, GUINEA
5. 15-038 Training Director, GUNIEA
6. 15-039 Training Coordinator, GUINEA
7. 15-044 Country Director, SIERRA LEONE

Thank you for your willingness to consider serving in this way.

Very Respectfully,

--
