Dengue claims 16 lives
-----------------------
The dengue epidemic has claimed 16 lives so far this year [2004], while the
number of suspected cases had risen to 3137 as of yesterday.

The highest number of cases have been reported from Gampaha (638) followed
by Colombo [the capital] with 632 cases and Kandy (542). Kurunegala and
Trincomalee have also recorded a high prevalence of dengue. Officials
warned that there was an increase in the number of dengue cases patients in
May [2004] compared to the previous month. "The number of cases reported

Dengue fever epidemic in central Java
-----------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is still spreading in Central Java province of Indonesia, Head
of Central Java Health Office, Dr. Krisnadjaya MS said. The health office
here has recorded 7160 dengue fever cases and 130 deaths in Central Java
Province during latest 5 months in this year [2004]. The disease morbidity
is 2.5 per 10 000 and the case fatality rate 1.82 percent.

The local health office recorded 2825 dengue cases in March [2004] with 33
deaths. Meanwhile, in April [2004] there are 841 cases with 18 deaths, at
the end of April the cases began to decrease and in mid-May the local
health office registered 256 cases of dengue with 6 deaths [i.e.
nationwide the epidemic is decreasing. - Mod.JW].

From 1 Jan to 30 Apr 2004, a total of 58 301 cases of dengue fever and
dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 658 deaths have been registered with
the Indonesian Ministry of Health. The case-fatality rate of 1.1 percent is
lower this year [2004] than in previous years. Although all 30 provinces
have been affected, outbreaks with unusually high numbers of cases have
been reported from 293 cities and districts in 17 provinces of the country.

DengueNet in India
---------------------
Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) have emerged
as a global public health problem in recent decades. In fact, the problem
has become hyperendemic in many urban, periurban and rural areas, with
frequent epidemics. The South-East Asia Region is one of the regions at
highest risk of DF/DHF, accounting for 52 percent of the global risk.
Dengue outbreaks now occur in India, as in other high-burden countries in
the Region, such as Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand.

Strengthening epidemiological and laboratory surveillance of dengue and
dengue haemorrhagic fever including, the implementation of DengueNet,(1) is
one of the priorities of the global and regional strategies for dengue
prevention and control. DengueNet is WHO¹s global data management system
created on the Internet to collect and analyse standardized epidemiological
and laboratory surveillance data with the objective to improve capacity for
effective national and international planning for the prevention and
control of epidemic dengue and DHF.

Following the pilot use of DengueNet in the Americas, a joint WHO
HQ/SEARO/WPRO meeting on DengueNet implementation in South-East Asia and
the Western Pacific was held in Kuala Lumpur on 11­13 Dec 2003.(2) The
objective of the meeting was to expand the pilot project to these 2
regions, building upon the lessons learned from the pilot project in the
Americas. Based on the recommendations of this meeting, 2 country workshops
were organized in India in March 2004, supported by the WHO/CSR and USAID
project to strengthen surveillance in India. The first took place in New
Delhi on 11­12 Mar 2004 with the northern states and the second in
Bangalore on 16­17 Mar 2004, with the southern states. WHO collaborating
centres attended both meetings. The proceedings and recommendations from
the New Delhi meeting were discussed at the Bangalore meeting to ensure
that the consensus recommendations addressed national issues, needs and
priorities. Experts from health service departments of all states and the
Delhi City Corporation, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
(NICD), the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, the WHO
Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, WHO
Representative for India and SEARO participated.

The main objective of the workshops was to strengthen disease surveillance
and response to vector-borne diseases using DengueNet as an entry point.
Work focused specifically on assessing current surveillance practices
(including the use of case definitions, reporting formats and mechanisms
for flow of information), laboratory facilities and tests for DHF, on
identifying and strengthening regional collaborative laboratories and on
establishing a framework for participation in DengueNet.

Experiences both from India and from the region on surveillance and control
were discussed. The need for an integrated approach to surveillance of
vector-borne diseases and application of lessons and experiences from
malaria and other vector-borne diseases was identified. The consensus was
to implement DengueNet in accordance with the Integrated Disease
Surveillance Programme (IDSP) that is starting in India. This would require
capacity building for disease surveillance and response at national, state
and district levels, through training of health workers and programme
managers and strengthening of laboratory services.

Given the vastness of the country, the heterogeneity of the disease burden
and the organizational network, the group recommended piloting the
participation of selected states in global DengueNet through focal points
at state and national level. States in which implementation would be
piloted included Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttaranchal.
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have a well-developed disease surveillance
system and a network of public health laboratories at both district and
state level, with strong linkages to national-level laboratories. Delhi,
following the recent dengue outbreak, has significantly improved its
surveillance system, including strengthening of laboratory services.
Uttaranchal, although lacking a good network of laboratories, was included
because of its close proximity to Delhi.

It was also decided to designate two WHO laboratory collaborating centres
(WHO CC) for northern and southern states to ensure practical use of these
facilities. Accordingly, NIV-Pune will continue as WHO CC for the south,
and it is recommended that WHO designate NICD to serve as WHO CC for the
northern states (following a request from NICD). The 2 centres would be
responsible for training, quality control, use of standard procedures and
networking at national and international level.

Based on the recommendations of the workshops, a follow-up meeting has been
planned to develop an activity plan for 2004 focusing on laboratory
strengthening, training, disease and vector surveillance, networking,
information sharing and reporting to DengueNet. NICD will take the lead
role in this follow-up activity, which is scheduled for the end of May
2004, working closely with all major stakeholders. (3)
