Region with 5 more suspected yellow fever [cases]
-------------------------------------------------
The 13th Regional Health Coordination Agency (CRS) reported yesterday
[6 Apr 2009],5 suspected cases of yellow fever [YF] in the Vale do
Rio Pardo. [They are] residents of Santa Cruz do Sul and Vera Cruz
and are hospitalized with symptoms similar to [YF] disease that has
killed one person in the region.

New tests will be done to identify whether [or not] there is [YF
virus] infection. The samples were sent to the Instituto Adolfo Lutz,
in Sao Paulo, and results should be available within a month. Until
then, there is a possibility that these patients will fully recover,
as occurred with another 4 residents of the region who had been
diagnosed with the disease. In addition to yellow fever, serology is
done for leptospirosis, as symptoms are
similar.

The patients had not been vaccinated and had contact with forest
areas. This reinforces the concerns about sylvan [jungle] yellow
fever [virus transmission cycle]. The urban type [of YF virus
transmission] has been eradicated in Brazil since 1942.

The report released yesterday [6 Apr 2009] raises the number of
suspected [cases of] the disease in Vale do Rio Pardo. Last week 5
positive cases were confirmed. One of these resulted in the death of
a farmer, a resident of Vera Cruz. In another death, it was not
possible to identify the cause of death. Besides these, the CRS is
awaiting the outcome of 5 other reports, which should be available by
the end of the week.

In the state since December of last year [2008], 13 people were
infected by the disease [YF] and another 6 died from yellow fever.
Due to the occurrence of these cases, the State Secretariat of Health
increased the number of municipalities considered as risk areas;
there are currently 182. In all [areas] they will apply vaccine to
residents and also to travelers. This measure is part of preventive
actions, since yellow fever has no drugs specific for its treatment.
So far over 73 000 people have been immunized.

One more person died Saturday [4 Apr 2009] with suspected yellow
fever [YF] in Piraju, 313 km [194 mi] from Sao Paulo [city]. The
victim, age 30 years, is the brother of another victim of YF who died
a week ago from the same disease. This is the 8th death in the city
of suspected yellow fever; 6 of these [cases] are confirmed, as well
as another 2 in central-west region of Sao Paulo [state] -- one in
Itatinga and one in Sarutaia.

According to the [Sao Paulo] state Secretariat of Health, 20 cities
in the region are in the [YF] risk area. In the municipality of
Itapetininga, the demand for vaccines increased and the supply is
gone. The Head of Surveillance Epidemiological said that he will
contact the government of the state to ask for more doses of vaccine.
