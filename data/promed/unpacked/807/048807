Rift Valley Fever, France ex Zimbabwe: not confirmed
----------------------------------------------------
On Thu 20 Oct 2011, a case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) imported into
France from Zimbabwe was reported by ProMED-mail (Rift Valley fever,
human - France: ex Zimbabwe (ME) 1st Archive Number: 20111020.3132).
As reporting of RVF is mandatory in France, the patient's samples were
sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Arboviruses for
confirmation.

The 1st serum, obtained at day 25 after symptom onset was
reinvestigated for the presence of anti-arbovirus antibodies (i.e.,
Dengue; Chikungunya; West Nile; Rift Valley fever). Only a borderline
IgM reactivity against RVF virus antigen was detected. A 2nd sample
obtained at day 67 after onset was found negative for both IgM and IgG
for all antigens tested. The lack of enhancement of IgM response and
no IgG seroconversion led us to conclude that the transient IgM
response in the initial sample was a non-specific reaction.
Consequently RVF infection has been classifies as 'not confirmed.'

Diagnosis of imported cases has proven to be valuable for the global
surveillance of arboviruses. Thus, clinicians should be aware that
pathologies (case definition; diagnostic procedures including
interpretation criteria), especially where mandatory reporting at the
national or the international levels, is required.
