Hepatitis E cases on rise in Mehsana town
-----------------------------------
There has been an increase in the number of patients suffering from
hepatitis E and jaundice in Mehsana town since September [2011].
Kasba, Hydri Chowk, Babi Vado, Faiza No Vado and Siddhapuri Bazaar
localities in old Mehsana town have recorded over 400 cases so far.
However, the health department has put the number at 68.

A resident of Babi Vado said there are as many as 400 people affected
by stomach ailments and seven are from his family alone. A
thirty-year-old patient said, "Water supply pipelines were damaged in
September when telephone cables were being replaced in our locality.
This led to contamination of drinking water. The civic body was
alerted, but it paid no heed to our complaints. The resident said, "We
picketed the municipal office on Wednesday, thus forcing,it to act on
the matter." Municipal chief officer R P Joshi said, "We have begun
replacing the pipes from Thursday though we have not found leakage
anywhere. Water in the affected area is being supplied through
tankers."

[Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis
E is a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies
have been implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally
contaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the
ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of sporadic
cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic spread of
the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats
and rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk factors for
hepatitis E virus infection are related to poor sanitation in large
areas of the world, and shedding in faeces. Person-to-person
transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for sexual transmission
or for transmission by transfusion. According to the GIDEON database,
around 2 million cases per year are estimated to occur nationwide in
India.

In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed by
recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual.
Symptomatic HEV infection is most common in young adults aged 15-40
years. A more fulminant form of hepatitis occasionally develops, with
mortality rates ranging between 0.5% - 4.0%. Fulminant hepatitis
occurs more often in pregnancy with a mortality rate of 20% among
women in late pregnancy. Further information can be obtained from the
WHO website at:

Mehsana is situated in Gujarat state near Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.
It can be located in the map of Gujarat at:

If this outbreak is due to fractured water supply pipes as suggested,
but refuted by the local authority, one might expect hepatitis A virus
infection to be equally prevalent. - Mod.CP.
