CAMPYLOBACTER JEJUNI SEROTYPE O:33: REQUEST FOR INFO
====================================================
Campylobacter jejuni (O:33) outbreak
We are investigating a foodborne outbreak of Campylobacter jejuni serotype
O:33 in Wisconsin. We had 16 confirmed and 66 probable case patients
associated with this outbreak. Our epidemiologic investigations implicated
tuna salad. It is our understanding that this strain of Campylobacter jejuni
is rare in the United States. Does anyone has information if this strain is
common in other parts of the world, and if so where? We are also interested in
knowing if this serotype has been associated with certain food items.
Thanks
