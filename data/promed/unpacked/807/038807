Scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bite of an insect living on the body of a rat, has assumed alarming proportions in Chitwan [district, Bagmati province]. As many as 284 people have been diagnosed with the disease in the district since mid-July [2022], according to vector control inspector Ram KC, who is the information officer of Chitwan Health Office. Of which, 55 patients [come] from Bharatpur Metropolitan City alone.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.

On 11 Oct 2022, Bharatpur Hospital issued a press release, appealing the public to be cautious of the disease after it was found in fever patients admitted at the hospital. Officials said most of the patients visited the hospital after a week of illness and showed complex symptoms.

The mites that [transmit] scrub typhus sit in the ears of rats or a shrew and cause the disease to transmit from rats to humans, Kandel explained. "Only after 5 days after the onset of fever, it can be tested to confirm whether one has scrub typhus or not," he said. "Some people may have a fever within a day or 2 but sadly it cannot be confirmed whether it's a symptom of scrub typhus until day 5."

People infected with scrub typhus develop fever, body aches, laziness, body cramps, and red skin. In 40 percent of the cases, a small wound with black scar is left where the mite has bitten the human. These symptoms are visible for the 1st week. After a week, the disease becomes complicated and challenging, blood pressure drops, kidney and liver are affected, and skin rashes can also be seen, Kandel said.

This neglected tropical disease has been emerging as a new health challenge in Chitwan. If the disease is not diagnosed and the medicine is not given in time, then the patient's condition can worsen a lot. The symptoms of scrub typhus include headache, body aches and muscle pain, a dark, scab-like region at the site of the chigger bite (also known as eschar), mental changes, ranging from confusion to coma, and enlarged lymph nodes, among other things.

Dr Kandel said that there are many patients in serious condition who need to be kept in the ICU at the hospital. If the disease is detected early, it can be cured easily. The disease may be prevalent in the community, Kandel said, because the disease is detected only when the patients in critical condition come to the hospital and are examined. "Apart from the hospital's data, there are so many infected people out in the district," he said.

According to KC, information officer of the Chitwan Health Office, the outbreak of this disease usually starts with the onset of monsoon and lasts until December.

KC suggests Chitwan residents to avoid going to the fields, squares, and bushes with body parts exposed. "Avoid going to possible places where rats can breed and if you must, take precautions," he said.

[The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake, with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to infected chiggers (larval mites), but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and a necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (the eschar). Other than the eschar, scrub typhus has no distinctive clinical features to make an accurate clinical diagnosis and the presence of an eschar in patients has been reported to vary widely.

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region, like Nepal.

The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions and have reported variable sensitivity (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.02181-16 and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20129967/). Having an accurate, available, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test for scrub typhus would be important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892940/#abstract-2title). Rapid point-of-care immunoassays for the detection of IgM antibodies to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ have been reviewed (<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13205-020-02389-w, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac10/bd6a10a0c9b97732925ecffe248581a7935e.pdf, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911186).

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd002150.pub2). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (https://doi.org/10.1086/425008). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2013.28.5.667 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924857909005615). - Mod.ML
