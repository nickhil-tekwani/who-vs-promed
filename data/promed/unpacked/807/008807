BLOOD SUPPLY, NEW SCREENING TEST - USA

The nation's blood supply is about to become safer: Blood banks will begin
next week phasing in sophisticated new genetic tests designed to wipe out
viral infections that occasionally slip into transfusions.
"This is the biggest thing that's happened in blood banking since the HIV
test," said James MacPherson of America's Blood Centers, which collects
about half the nation's donated blood. The vast majority of transfusions
already are infection-free. But the new gene testing, which should
encompass all blood transfusions by September, promises to make blood even
safer.
That's because the new "nucleic acid testing" can detect tiny amounts of a
virus, such as liver-destroying hepatitis C or the AIDS virus, before the
blood donor's body has even recognized the infection. Some of the tests can
detect as few as 10 copies of a viral gene.
Viral genes spread through blood faster than the immune system begins
forming antibodies to fight them, a reaction that may not occur until 20 to
80 days after infection. Today's blood testing depends largely on tests
that detect antibodies in an infected donor. So newly infected donors
sometimes slip through.
Nucleic acid testing, called NAT by blood banks, promises to close that gap.
It probably will eliminate the few cases of HIV annually caused by donated
blood, said Dr. Celso Bianco of the New York Blood Center. And experts
estimate it will prevent 84 annual cases of hepatitis C transmission
through blood, the majority.
The government hasn't mandated NAT-tested blood yet, because technically
it's still experimental: Genetic fingerprinting is commonplace in
laboratories, where it's called PCR, for polymerase chain reaction testing.
But how to test the entire blood supply raises questions, and blood banks
are trying different strategies.
Still, the Food and Drug Administration is strongly encouraging blood banks
to quickly begin genetic testing and hospitals to exclusively use
NAT-screened blood.
"Everybody with any familiarity with these tests knows this is such an
advance ... it would be a terrible mistake not to use it as soon as we
can," said Dr. Edward Tabor, FDA's associate blood director. So the FDA is
taking the unprecedented step of letting blood banks add NAT to all the
other blood safety tests they now perform in a nationwide research project.
FDA will monitor the data to decide which NAT method works best.
At first, NAT will hunt hepatitis C and HIV. But eventually, blood banks
may test for other contaminants.
The genetic tests also promise that if a brand new virus ever sneaks into
the blood supply as AIDS did two decades ago, blood banks could protect
Americans much faster, MacPherson said. "This is truly space-age
technology," he said.
NAT will cost more, about an extra $6 to $7 per unit of blood, which will
increase hospitals' spending on blood by about 5 percent. Although the FDA
is letting blood banks charge for the experimental testing, hospitals can't
recover the money from insurers. So some hospitals are questioning if it's
worth it. Responded Tabor: "FDA thinks the cost increase will be worth the
health benefit."
One of the NAT experiment's biggest questions is whether genetic testing
can be performed fast enough. Blood has a limited shelf life, and demand is
so great that much is transfused soon after it's donated. But NAT testing
takes 48 to 72 hours. That's probably fine for most transfusions of red
cells, which last 42 days after donation. But platelets expire in just five
days. So hospitals may transfuse platelets that the standard, FDA-approved
testing declared infection-free only to learn later that the extra genetic
test found a problem. Then they'll have to track down the blood recipient.

[NAT cannot detect a "brand new virus", only one that is related to an
existing virus. In other words, unless blood banks had already been
testing the blood supply with a generic retrovirus primer, they could not
have detected the AIDS virus earlier. That being said, this test is a
significant advance. Let's hope that public concern for their own health
will create a demand for the test even if it is not covered by insurance. -
