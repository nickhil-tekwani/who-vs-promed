A new case of bluetongue serotype 8 was confirmed in the department
of Correze (Saint Pardoux-Corbier). The location of this case
involves an extension of the restriction zone in the department of
Correze.

To date, 6003 cases of bluetongue have been recorded in France for
2008 (of which 6 cases were BTV-1). [thus 5997 by BTV-8. - Mod.AS]

10 cases of BTV-8 during 2008 are ascribed to infection by a
circulating virus [these are, namely, new cases, in contrast to the
other 5993 cases which are, in fact, animals found seropositive
during 2008 due to infection during the previous disease season, late
2007. - Mod.AS]

Additional information: 15 569 cases of bluetongue have been recorded
during 2007, of which 3 were due to BTV-1.

[The new cases are located in the red-coloured area in south-east
France, adjacent to the Spanish border, regions 42 and 43 on the map
available at:

It seems that the 2008 bluetongue season in south-east France has
started; information from other parts of France and from other
European countries is anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
