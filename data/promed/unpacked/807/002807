The [Panama] Ministry of Health has confirmed that 2 children from Darien
province have been added to the group of 8 individuals hospitalized with
equine encephalitis. The ministry indicated that they are children of 3
months and 13 years of age residing in Santa Librada de Yaviza and Punuloso
de Meteto. 6 of the ill individuals are under medical observation. The
total number of ill people is 28, most without serious illnesses.

This week [week of 14 Jun 2010], the Ministries of Health and of
Agricultural Development declared public health and animal health alerts.

[The total number of ill individuals in this report is not clear, but it
appears that out of a total of 28, 10 have needed hospital treatment. A 17
Jun 2010 report indicated that 5 children and "a number" of horses had
contracted equine encephalitis in the Darien area (see ProMED-mail archive
no. 20100617.2034). In any event, the number of individuals reported ill
with equine encephalitis has increased. As in previous reports, the
specific etiological agent is not mentioned, but presumably it is
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), as has been reported to OIE
for horses in Panama with VEEV, subtype unspecified
(<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9350>).

It would be of interest, assuming that the disease is VEEV, to know which
VEEV subtype is involved, as subtype IAB or IC can cause massive equine
epizootics over wide geographic areas with spillover to many humans.
Subtype ID usually causes a few sporadic cases. Mod.TG has an excellent
summary of VEE in ProMED-mail archive no. 20100617.2034. It is worth noting
that eastern equine encephalitis has also been detected in Panama.
