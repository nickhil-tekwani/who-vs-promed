Dutch foot-and-mouth leaps 140km. Several thousand animals will be slaughtered
------------------------------------------------------
A new case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been confirmed in the
Netherlands. It is in a remote region which has so far been unaffected by
the infection. The Dutch Government has confirmed a dairy farm in Ee,
near the country's northern coast has been infected with the disease. The
site is 140km (85 miles) from the area in the center of the country where
all the other 21 cases to be confirmed in the Netherlands had previously
been confined.
Ministry spokesman Gerard Westerhof said the source of the disease at Ee
was still unknown. "It is not likely there has been contact between
animals from this farm and farms [where the disease has been confirmed
earlier. We are investigating if it has been transferred by humans," he
said. He said around 3000 cows and several thousand sheep within a 2km
radius of the farm would be destroyed. A surveillance zone of 10km around
the farm is to be set up.
