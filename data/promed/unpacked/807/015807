Country & date: Brazil. 9 Feb 2006
Type: Unofficial
Issue: Follow-up: outbreak reported in Parana
Summary: Representatives from the National Animal Health Service
consider that at least 3 new outbreaks in Parana should be reported
to OIE based on serological results. They have indicated that in some
cases, they found 12 percent positive results in animals between 12
and 24 months old, when false positive results are expected to be
around 1 percent. Although the federal Animal Health Service
considers that these results and the epidemiological investigation of
the outbreaks show a "clear link" between these cases and the
outbreaks reported in Mato Grosso, the State of Parana Veterinary
Service does not want to recognize the FMD outbreaks in Parana until
the virus is isolated from animals located within the State.

[The producers in the state of Parana are willing to terminate the
animals, but do not want the serological results reported. They think
they will regain their 'free with vaccination' status faster if the
serological results are not sent to OIE, but only results of virus
isolation.
Not knowing the location of these serological positives may hinder
control of the disease, as movement of animals and products may not
be stopped. - Mod.TG]
