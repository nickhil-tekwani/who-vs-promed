A little plant that is part fungus and part alga is responsible for the
deaths of nearly 300 elk near here. The plant is a lichen known as
_Parmelia_ spp. that is abundant in desert soils around the state.
"We had lichen on the list of toxic plants that our veterinarians were
investigating," said Tom Reed, spokesperson for the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department. "We were faintly optimistic that this may have been the cause,
but didnt want to get our hopes up."
This past weekend, tests revealed that the lichen was indeed the cause of
the strange affliction that had taken down 295 elk in a months time. On 8
Feb 2004, 2 cow elk were discovered in the desert about 15 miles southwest
of Rawlins that could not rise and run when approached by agency personnel.
As field crews searched the area in subsequent days, the number of elk
afflicted slowly increased to nearly 300, scattered over a 50-square-mile
area of high desert in and around the departments Daley Ranch wildlife
habitat area. All exhibited the same symptoms: inability to rise from the
ground, while remaining alert and vocal. Elk that were not found and
euthanized by agency personnel died a slow, stressful death from starvation
or dehydration.
Scientists found parmelia in the stomachs of afflicted elk, starting an
exhaustive chain of investigation. That effort was borne out this weekend,
when captive elk that had been on a diet of parmelia went down with the
same symptoms, said Dr. Terry Kreeger, a veterinarian with the department.
Parmelia produces an acid that may break down muscle tissue, causing the
elk to lose strength, said Dr. Walt Cook, who has been working on this
incident non-stop since it was discovered more than a month ago. Cook and
colleagues at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory were instrumental in
narrowing down the laundry list of possible causes, but more work will need
to be done in coming weeks.
"We are going to need to do further necropsy work to explore the exact
physiology behind this," said Cook.
Additionally, officials are going to try to learn more about the lichen
itself and why, or if, it accumulated inordinately high amounts of acid
this year.
"There are a lot of factors well need to look at," said Reed. "Do elk eat
this lichen in normal years? If so, why hasnt this happened before? Does a
long history of drought weigh in somehow? If so, what are our management
options in the future? These are all questions we are going to try to
answer in the coming months. But weve answered the biggest and most
important question: What the heck is killing these elk?" said Reed.
"Its a huge relief for everyone involved. A lot of people worked their
tails off on this mystery. But we have some of the best minds in wildlife
science right here in Wyoming, and they came up with results."
Healthy elk that were wintering on the Daley Ranch southwest of here are
now following the receding snow line back toward the Sierra Madre
mountains, and 3 cows in that herd are wearing radio collars so biologists
can learn a little more about this elk population.
"Elk dont normally winter down on the Daley unit where they ate the
lichen," said Reed. "But for whatever reason, this year they moved in
there. Elk are incredibly adaptable, tough animals. Theyll get by on thin
rations and theyll make do somehow. But this year, nearly 300 of them paid
the price for that adaptability."
No other animals including horses, cattle, antelope, deer or scavengers in
the area were afflicted.

[_Parmelia_ spp. were incriminated in a muscular weakness syndrome in the
1950s. The author, Beach, blamed the condition on usnic acid (a common
lichen constituent). Unfortunately, limited additional work was done, and
usnic acid was never definitely proven (or disproven) as the cause of the
syndrome.
Usnic acid is marketed as a "nutriceutical" and apparently is hepatotoxic
in man and mouse (and possibly elk). Many other aromatic acids and
potentially toxic compounds are known to be present in various lichen species.
The literature contains some information that reindeer can tolerate high
lichen diets because of their protective rumen microflora.
South central Wyoming has been in a severe drought for approximately 5
years. Consequently, this may have been one the few foods available to the
animals. Elk may not have the same microflora in the rumen as reindeer.
Although microflora have some ability to adapt, if the lichen is suddenly
the major portion of the diet, the adaptation process would have been
overwhelmed.
If Game and Fish believes this to be the cause, then perhaps they could
supply supplement feeding to prevent such heavy consumption of the lichens
and thus prevent the deaths of these animals. ­ Mod.TG]
