Early in September 2015, in Yobe State in Nigeria, a 3-week old baby was brought to a doctor with corneal ulceration leading to immediate blindness. The doctor took a detailed history, and the only possible cause that he could find was the use of what the mother described as "eye drops", given to her as part of a pack to support the delivery. The doctor asked the mother to go home and bring in the "eye drops".

The contents of this bottle is chlorhexidine digluconate 7.1 percent solution packaged in a white plastic bottle apparently manufactured by Galentic Pharma (India) Pvt Ltd (http://www.galentic.com/). The problem with this is that chlorhexidine digluconate 7.1 percent is licensed for use in Nigeria as an antiseptic gel to be applied to the newborn's cord stump to prevent infection. Most people reading this will associate the container as the usual means of dispensing eye drops in Nigeria. It should never have been applied to the eyes, and therefore should never have been delivered in containers generally used for eye drops, especially when you are targeting an intervention at the poor living in mostly rural communities. It has been distributed in Yobe since March 2015.

What are the consequences so far? There are 5 known cases of irreversible blindness associated with the use of these drops already, 3 reported in Yobe State and 2 in Adamawa State. The 3 children in Yobe are 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 years old. All their parents were uneducated, their fathers are farmers. This will represent the socio economic circumstances of many people in the area. An unknown number of these containers were distributed to patients in Yobe, and Adamawa through government primary healthcare centres. The source of these bottles is not yet clear. They do not have a NAFDAC [National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control] number inscribed on them. It is not clear if they were distributed in other states in Nigeria. We have some very graphic pictures of the consequences of these drops on children, which we have decided not to show here.

What has been the response? Many astute and hardworking physicians and other health care workers have personally led advocacy campaigns and search efforts to retrieve as many of these bottles still in circulation. Our understanding is NAFDAC (http://www.nafdac.gov.ng/), whose vision is to "safeguard the health of the nation" and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) http://www.nphcda.gov.ng) have responded to this, as well as the Yobe State Government, trying to find and retrieve as many of the remaining bottles in circulation. The Yobe State Ministry of Health has reached out to all the Primary Health Care and Maternal and Child Health coordinators in the Local Government Areas with relevant information and apparently all the remaining stock of the drugs have been collected and as much as possible, those that were already dispensed traced and retrieved. It is clear that health workers did not actually prescribe the drugs for use in eyes but the packaging was misleading and parents mistakenly used these as eye drops. Local awareness campaigns have been carried out and the 3 children affected in Yobe are getting care and support. At the time of publishing this piece, none of the responsible agencies, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), or the Yobe State Ministry of Health has made any public announcement, and there is nothing on any of their websites.

If you are a clinician reading this, especially if you are practicing in northern Nigeria where the few cases have been reported, look out for the bottles in the image [shown at the source URL above] and retrieve these. Immediately contact relevant authorities with the information. Please inform any clinician that you know who deals with children on the situation and ask them to look out for these bottles. Distribution chains are generally weak and porous in Nigeria, but we know how well we can work together when there are concerted efforts.

[This report is from a blog in Northern Nigeria. There seems to be no official announcement from either the government, the company producing the medication, or a hospital. However, the warning regarding a medication that can be confused with something else is still necessary and appropriate.

Likewise, if this medication could be confused with a bottle the locals are familiar with as eye drops, then perhaps a company initiated recall should happen to stop this problem. - Mod.TG]
