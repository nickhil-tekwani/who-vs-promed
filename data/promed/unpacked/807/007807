[The total reported cases of cholera as of 3 Jan 2009 is now 33 212
and the number of cholera-related fatalities is 1640. This represents
increases of 1556 cases and 76 deaths since the last ProMED-mail
posting of 1 Jan 2009 data. The overall case-fatality rate is 4.93
percent, substantially higher than most outbreaks of cholera. This
likely reflects the difficulty in accessing adequate medical care in Zimbabwe.

In Limpopo, the overall number of confirmed cases is 1441, said its
provincial health spokesperson Phuti Seloba. He said 33 suspected
cases were reported at the weekend [3-4 Jan 2009] but these had not
been confirmed as cholera yet. Limpopo's cholera death toll since 15
Nov 2008 is 9.

The Western Province Health Department and Cape Town City Health say

being closely monitored. A 29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old woman,
both from Khayelitsha, are improving after being diagnosed with the disease.

there was a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe, the provincial health
department warned its workers to be vigilant.

A cholera scare has gripped residents of some parts of Accra,
especially those of the Okaikoi, Ablekuma, and Ayawaso constituencies.

Over the past 3 weeks, 32 cases of cholera have been recorded at
various hospitals and clinics. No deaths have been recorded. Poor
environmental sanitation and lack of potable water in the affected
areas have been identified as major contributors to the outbreak.

Giving statistics, an official of the Metro Public Health Department
of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) said 11 cases were reported
at Ablekuma, 20 at Okaikoi, and one at Ayawaso.
