Notable outbreaks:

series of subsequent outbreaks numbering almost 4000 cases, were ascribed
to a breakdown in drinking water supply following dissolution of the USSR.

(8901 cases; 95 fatal) to Kulyab and Tursunzade -- municipal water was
identified as the source.

2004: An outbreak (34 cases) in Shahrinav district was ascribed to
