Work Continues to Minimize the Temporary Actions by the United States
on Certain Agricultural Products
-----------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has worked to minimize the
temporary actions announced by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) on certain agricultural products entering the
United States (U.S.) from the Province of Quebec. The USDA temporary
actions were in response to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's
(CFIA) confirmation of Golden Nematode on a farm 20 km east of
Montreal, Quebec.
"We have had extensive discussions with the U.S. to reduce their
temporary trade requirements and have made substantial progress to
limit the number of products and areas affected in Canada," said the
Honourable Chuck Strahl, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
Effective Wed 23 Aug 2006, the temporary U.S. requirements will now
prohibit entry of the following articles from the Province of Quebec:
potatoes for seed, consumption, or processing; soil and related
articles; and grass sod. Also, the following articles may enter the
U.S. from the Province of Quebec if they are free of soil: plants
with roots; plant crowns and roots for propagation; true bulbs,
corms, rhizomes, and tubers of ornamental plants; root crops (other
than potatoes); small grains and soybeans; hay, straw, plant litter,
etc.; un-shucked ear corn; used containers, farm tools, and other
farm equipment.
Proof of the province of origin for the products affected in Quebec
has now been limited to the U.S. ports of entry along the Canadian
border east of, and including, the Detroit-Sarnia corridor. There
will be no process changes required for the ports of entry west of
this corridor.
The U.S. has also agreed that the existing export certification
processes for these products is sufficient. There will be no
modifications required to any export forms as long as the province of
origin is clearly indicated.
The CFIA has informed the provinces and industry of the new
requirements and will be working with them to facilitate
implementation of the requirements as quickly as possible.
The ongoing investigation in Quebec is a priority for the CFIA, and
Canadian officials will continue to work with the U.S. to minimize
trade disruptions as quickly as possible. USDA officials will be
arriving in the coming days to observe the CFIA investigation.
For more details on the temporary U.S. requirements, please see the
Industry Bulletin that has been distributed to Canadian provinces and
industries and posted to the CFIA website:

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the
potato cyst nematode (_Globodera rostochiensis_, PCN), which is also
known as the golden nematode (PCN/GN), especially in North America.
The PCN is found in many places where potatoes are grown including
Europe (see link for worldwide distribution map). There are 2 species
of PCN affecting potato crops. The white or pale PCN (_Globodera
pallida_) is now believed to be the more dominant species in Europe,
while the yellow or golden PCN (_Globodera rostochiensis_) still
causes serious losses in some areas.
In North America, _G. pallida_ was only known in Newfoundland, Canada
until 21 Apr 2006 and 13 Jun 2006, when it was newly detected in the
continental USA. Two infested sites in Idaho are now known
(20060423.1195, 20060805.2161).
_G. rostochiensis_ is known in New York State in the mainland USA and
on Vancouver Island, British Columbia and Newfoundland in Canada.
Because of effective Canadian and US quarantines, which have been in
existence for over 50 years, PCN/GN remained confined to portions of
Vancouver Island, Newfoundland and 9 counties within the State of New
York until the 15 Aug 2006 detection in Quebec Province, Canada
(20060816.2295).

On 20 Apr 2006, Canada put restrictions on the import of potatoes and
soil from Idaho, USA based on the detection of the pale PCN in Idaho.
This posting details the USA response to the 15 Aug 2006 detection of
the golden nematode in Quebec, Canada. It is to temporarily prohibit
entry of the following articles from the Province of Quebec: potatoes
for seed, consumption, or processing; soil and related articles; and grass sod.
In 2002, the potato industry was worth USD 952 million in farm cash
receipts, according to the Canadian government. Quebec accounted for
about 10 percent of Canadian production that year. Canada exported
about USD 52 million worth of seed potatoes to the U.S. and USD 127
million worth of table potatoes south of the border that year.
