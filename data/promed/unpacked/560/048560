Indonesia's death toll from avian influenza has risen to 6, and the
government has ordered more than a half-million tablets of anti-viral
medicine to fight the disease, the Health Ministry announced Monday.
6 people have died and 10 others have been confirmed with the virus --
though some of them have not shown any of its usual flu-like symptoms, said
I Nyoman Kandun, director general of Communicable Disease Control at the
Health Ministry. He said that 34 people have been hospitalized with
symptoms of avian influenza (H5N1 virus) across the country.
Health Minister Siti Fadila Supari said 200 000 tablets of the anti-viral
drug oseltamivir, known commercially as Tamiflu, would be available Tuesday
and another 200 000 tablets by Friday. Supari said that the medicine --
enough to treat 40 000 people at 10 tablets per person -- showed that the
government had things "under control." Tamiflu is the only treatment so far
proven effective against bird flu in humans.
It was unclear if the 6 dead included a woman who was suspected to have
died of the disease on Monday [26 Sep 2005]. The 27-year-old woman had been
treated for symptoms of the virus [infection] since last Thursday at the
government-designated hospital for suspected bird flu cases, said Dr.
Sardikin Giriputro. Giriputro, the hospital's deputy head, said initial
tests at the hospital showed the patient had contracted bird flu, but that
further tests would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has swept through poultry populations in large
swaths of Asia since 2003, killing at least 65 people and resulting in the
deaths of tens of millions of birds. Most human cases have been linked to
contact with sick birds. But the World Health Organization has warned that
the virus could mutate into a form that spreads easily among humans --
possibly triggering a global pandemic that could kill millions.
The Australian government on Mon 26 Sep 2005 pledged to help Indonesia
speed up its response to bird flu, saying it will donate enough anti-viral
medicine to treat 40 000 people to its northern neighbor to help it cope
with the illness. Canberra had previously pledged 10 000 courses of the
medicine to Indonesia. "They have been caught a bit short to tell you the
truth, and they're finding it difficult to handle," Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer told reporters in Adelaide.
Medication distribution was moving "a little more slowly than we would have
liked, but I think they're getting better organized now," he said. It was
not immediately clear if the 600 000 doses announced by Indonesia included
any of those pledged by Australia.

There are 42 reported human cases of avian influenza across Indonesia, but
only 10 patients have tested positive, Minister of Health Siti Fadillah
Supari said here on Monday [26 Sep 2005].
6 of the 10 people infected with bird flu have died recently, the minister
said. Supari said bird flu cases have been reported from at least 8
provinces in the country, with Jakarta having the highest case number of 28.
She made the remarks hours after the death of a 30-year-old housewife
during intensive hospital treatment for developing bird flu symptoms, the 6
death [from] avian influenza ever reported in the country.

A 27-year-old Indonesian woman died in a Jakarta hospital on Monday [26 Sep
2005] after suffering from avian influenza, and a 5-year-old girl who died
last week was suspected to have carried the disease, officials said on
Monday. The disease had already killed 4 people in the sprawling country
with the world's 4th [largest] population.
Sardikin Giriputro, deputy head of the hospital designated by the
government to treat patients with suspected bird flu, said the woman had
been admitted on Thursday. "It's confirmed H5N1," I Nyoman Kandun, who
heads disease control at the health ministry, told a news conference,
describing the most deadly strain of bird flu.
It was unclear how the woman got the disease, but she had been in contact
with chickens that died from an unknown cause. Many urban-area households
in Indonesia keep livestock, especially chickens, in their yards.
"According to her family, 15 chickens in her home died, but we don't know
whether the chickens had died because of bird flu or not," Giriputro had said.
Indonesia's health ministry now puts the death toll from bird flu at 6,
because a local test on a 5-year-old girl was positive. By World Health
Organization standards however, the final proof rests on the outcome of a
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which in the girl's case showed negative.
Bird flu has killed 65 people in 4 Asian nations since late 2003 and has
been found in birds in [European Russia]. The virus has spread to 22
provinces out of 33 in the Indonesian archipelago, killing more than 9.5
million domesticated birds since 2003. Indonesia said this week it would
cull poultry in areas where the outbreak was serious.
Giriputro said 5 out of 22 people who had been admitted to the hospital
were allowed to go home because they had been found not to have the
disease. Experts' greatest fear now is that the H5N1 virus, which has the
power to kill one out of every 2 people it infects, could set off a
pandemic if it gains the ability to be passed easily among people. While
they say the virus could have passed in a few cases from person to person
who had very close and sustained contact in the last 2 years, it has yet to
mutate into a form which would allow it to do that easily.
Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari said on Monday 20 000 doses of the
anti-viral drug Tamiflu were expected to arrive in Indonesia by Tuesday and
a further 20 000 would come by the end of this week. Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said Canberra will pay for a further 40 000 doses
of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu for Indonesia, on top of an initial 10 000
doses that Canberra said on Friday it would fund.

The Japanese government will send a team of experts to Indonesia to help it
find appropriate measures to combat avian influenza, which so far has
killed 6 people in the country, a Japanese envoy said here Monday [26 Sep
2005]. "The Japanese government decided today (Monday) to send a team
comprising 5 experts. They are expected to arrive in Jakarta tomorrow to
work for around one week," Deputy Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia,
Masafumi Kuroki told journalists.
Kuroki said the Japanese government's decision to send experts to Indonesia
was made at the request of the Indonesian government. "The team will gather
information about bird flu outbreak and give input to the Indonesian
government about how to handle the disease," he said.

[The number of cases of avian influenza in Indonesia shows signs of
escalating, and the situation is causing concern in neighbouring countries
as well as throughout the Indonesian archipelago. The Indonesian
authorities have identified at least 42 human cases and 6 deaths from avian
influenza virus infection. Not all the cases have exhibited signs of
disease, and a number of suspected cases have given negative test results.
Furthermore, one of the 6 fatal cases has yielded discordant test results.
There has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission of infection so
far, and it is still presumed that the human cases have contracted
infection directly from birds or poultry products. It is difficult to
evaluate the true significance of the present situation, as the WHO table
of laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza in humans in East Asia
(last updated on 22 Sep 2005) lists only 3 cases and 2 deaths in
Indonesia. It is also not clear how the Indonesian authorities intend to
make use of the antiviral drugs that they have solicited and been donated.
