A dead wild swan found in south eastern Romania earlier this month was found to be infected with H5N8 bird flu that has hit several countries in Europe, the country's veterinary and food safety agency (ANSVSA) said on Monday [28 Nov 2016]. Officials have imposed two areas of veterinary sanitary restrictions around the area, a 3-km protection area and a 10-km monitoring area, neither of which include commercial poultry farms.

Romania has also tightened controls of shipments of live birds and eggs from European Union countries where recent bird flu outbreaks have been discovered. "So far, based on our information, with the exception of the mentioned case, there is no suspicion that bird flu has appeared in domestic or wild birds on Romanian territory," ANSVSA said in a statement.

[H5N8 HPAI virus appeared in China in 2010, and has propagated to other countries since 2013. Recently, it has appeared elsewhere in Europe.
Some recent studies suggest that that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8. - Mod.PMB
