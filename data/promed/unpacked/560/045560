26 people were being received at 2 local hospitals as of 6 p.m. on Fri 11 Jul 2014 in response to a Hazmat emergency at Michigan's Adventure, said Joan Kessler, spokeswoman at Mercy Health Muskegon.

Muskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler has confirmed that a combination of chemicals were released in the area of the park's wave pool which combined to make chlorine gas.

The park is looking into the incident, Roesler said. At least 50 people were evaluated, some of which were individually hosed down in the Michigan's Adventure parking lot.

One witness in the park said she "got a splash of chlorine" and started coughing while finding it difficult to breathe. Other witnesses reported burning lips.

Multiple ambulance and fire officials responded to the scene as well as a Hazardous Material Response Team (Hazmat) just after 4 p.m.

[This article does not tell us how this combination of chemicals was released or by whom.

Most likely, there was some very low level of chlorine in the water of the wave pool, just as in any public swimming pool. So the question is where did more chlorine come from to result in chlorine gas? Have the 26 people been treated and released?

Humans can come into contact with chlorine gas during short-term, high-level exposures due to traffic or rail accidents, spills, or other disasters. By contrast, workplace and public (swimming pools, etc.) exposures are more frequently long-term, low-level exposures, occasionally punctuated by unintentional transient increases.

Acute exposures can result in symptoms of acute airway obstruction including wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea [difficulty breathing]. These findings are fairly nonspecific, and might be present after exposures to a number of inhaled chemical irritants. Clinical signs, including hypoxemia, wheezes, rales, and/or abnormal chest radiographs may be present.

More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to one percent of exposed individuals die. Humidified oxygen and inhaled beta-adrenergic agents are appropriate therapies for victims with respiratory symptoms while assessments are underway. Inhaled bicarbonate and systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids also have been reported anecdotally to be beneficial. Chronic sequelae may include increased airway reactivity, which tends to diminish over time. Airway hyper-reactivity may be more of a problem among those survivors that are older, those who have smoked, and/or have pre-existing chronic lung disease. Individuals suffering from irritant-induced asthma (IIA) due to workplace exposures to chlorine also tend to have similar characteristics, such as airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine, and to be older and to have smoked.

Other workplace studies, however, have indicated that workers exposed to chlorine dioxide/sulfur dioxide have tended to have increased risk for chronic bronchitis and/or recurrent wheezing attacks (one or more episodes) but not asthma, while those exposed to ozone have a greater incidence of asthma. Specific biomarkers for acute and chronic exposures to chlorine gas are currently lacking.

Animal models for chlorine gas inhalation have demonstrated evidence of oxidative injury and inflammation. Early epithelial injury, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway remodeling, likely diminishing over time, have been shown. As in humans, ALI/ARDS can occur, becoming more likely when the upper airways are bypassed. Inhalation models of chlorine toxicity provide unique opportunities for testing potential pharmacologic rescue agents.
