The laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed on [Thu 23 Dec 2021] that the first case of the Powassan virus (POW) has been detected in Columbiana County, Ohio. A Lisbon resident was suspected to have the virus and has been hospitalized since being admitted to Akron Children's Hospital in October [2021]. Health care providers, along with local health departments and the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), have worked in partnership to confirm the diagnosis.

POW is a tickborne illness that cannot be directly transmitted from person to person. In Ohio, the virus may be transmitted to people most commonly by the black-legged tick.

Symptoms range from asymptomatic to life-threatening neurological disorders. These symptoms may include headache, fever, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, and seizures, and the disease may be fatal. Illness onset from the time of the tick bite can range from one week to one month. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for POW.

According to CDC, about 100 cases of POW have been reported in the US during the past 10 years.

ODH's Zoonotic Disease Program plans to conduct surveillance in Columbiana County for ticks carrying the virus during the coming weeks.

The Columbiana County Health District has offered guidelines on how residents can avoid POW and other tickborne illnesses:
- walk in the middle of trails to avoid tall grass, brush, and leaf litter.
- use EPA registered repellents labeled for use against ticks on skin.
- treat clothing and gear such as pants, boots, socks, and tents with a product containing permethrin or wear permethrin-treated clothing and gear.
- wear long pants, long sleeves, and long socks. Tuck your pant legs into your socks.
- wear light colors to make it easier to see ticks.

[The severity of the illness or its neurological involvement is not stated in the above report. However, with hospitalization since October, the illness must be severe. Tick transmission of Powassan virus [POWV] to humans is active in the Upper Midwestern states of the USA. As noted in earlier posts, humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada.

There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and black-legged tick virus (lineage II), the likely lineage involved in the above case. Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 8 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

Residents and visitors in Ohio and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well-advised to heed CDC advice to avoid tick bites (see https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
