An often-overlooked cereal disease capable of causing yield losses of up to 30% could be lying unnoticed in more than half of English wheat fields. The fungus _Rhizoctonia cerealis_ is traditionally associated with sharp eyespot. However, research by Rumiana Ray, University of Nottingham, shows it can also cause damping-off much earlier in the season. Germinating seeds rot away in the soil, leading to reductions in crop emergence and plant numbers.

"It is well known that _Microdochium_ and _Fusarium_ species cause damping-off, but we didn't know _Rhizoctonia cerealis_ can do the same." A further study of more than 100 English wheat fields revealed that 57% in the North contained _Rhizoctonia cerealis_ in the soil, while in the Midlands 65% of wheat fields were infected, and the East had 47%.

"Rhizoctonia can cause yield losses of up to 30%," says Dr Ray. However farmers rarely target the disease. "Diversity of crop rotation and cultivations will have some effect." Wheat emergence was improved by up to 23% compared with untreated seed when a seed treatment was used. Under high disease pressure, the treatment also increased root length by 50%, almost the same length as in uninfected plants.

[The soil-borne fungus _Ceratobasidium cereale_ (previously _Rhizoctonia cerealis_) is known as the cause of sharp eyespot disease (SED) of wheat. The pathogen can also affect barley, oats, rye and some grass species and is prevalent throughout the temperate regions of the world. SED symptoms are sharply defined lesions on the outer leaf sheaths and the stem. Infected plants or tillers ripen and die prematurely producing white heads with shriveled kernels, and they often collapse. Infections are most serious when initiated on seedlings. Seedlings may be killed, or they may survive through the season and die before maturity. However, specific problems with damping off (i.e. rotting of stem base and crown) of young seedlings, as described above, appear to have been poorly recognised so far.

The fungus can be spread with plant material and soil, as mycelium or as small survival structures (sclerotia). While the pathogen is common, damage to crops depends on environmental factors. Disease development is favoured by cool, wet conditions and acidic soils. Disease management relies mainly on cultural practices, including improvement of plant vigour, reduction of inoculum, good drainage and crop rotation with non-host species. Fungicide treatments of crops are usually not considered reliable, in contrast to the success described above with fungicide seed treatments.

_Microdochium_ and _Fusarium_ species mentioned above are associated with cereal diseases such as head blights, ear rots and snow moulds (for example ProMED-mail posts 20190412.6417984, 20170330.4937800 and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
