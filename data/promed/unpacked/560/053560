["In February 2022, Japanese encephalitis (JE) was detected and confirmed in piggeries in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. On 4 Mar 2022, cases were detected in South Australia. There are currently more than 70 infected piggeries across the 4 states.

"On 30 Mar 2022, a rare case of JE in one alpaca was confirmed in the Adelaide Plains local government area. Alpaca, like horses, are a dead-end host.

"Also in March [2022], the Northern Territory Government confirmed that a small number of feral pigs from the West Daly region tested positive for JE. The testing was conducted in mid-March as part of a routine animal health survey conducted by the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy. Further surveys and testing of feral pigs, horses, and other animals for JE will continue as part of the northern Australia surveillance strategy for exotic diseases.

"The locations of infected piggeries are not published due to government privacy and biosecurity requirements. The disease is widespread so regardless of where you are, protect yourself and your animals against mosquito bites".
(Source: Australian Government https://www.outbreak.gov.au/current-responses-to-outbreaks/japanese-encephalitis)

"Most JE infections in people are asymptomatic, however, those with severe infection (which occurs in less than one per cent of cases) may experience neck stiffness, coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death. Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as the sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting.

"People should also try to prevent mosquito bites by using a mosquito repellent containing picaridin, DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on all exposed skin and reapply every few hours; wear long, light-colored and loose-fitting clothes; and covered footwear."
