A young girl, died on Thursday raising the unofficial death toll to 16
during the last three days as a result of outbreak of cholera at Sufaid
Dehri, on the outskirts of the provincial capital. Situation remained
tense on Thursday at the Hayat Teaching Hospital and Hayat Medical Complex
where influx of the affected people remained high and over 200 more
patients were brought for treatment.
According to hospital sources, about 183 patients reported alone to the
Hayat Teaching Hospital on Thursday where during the last four days, since
the outbreak of cholera on Sept 7, over 850 patients have been brought from
Sufaid Dehri. Whereas, according to an official handout, a total of 1,050
patients of gastroenteritis were provided free medical facilities during
the last four days at the four emergency centres set up, one each at
Hayatabad Medical Complex, Hayatabad Teaching Hospital, Lady Reading
Hospital and Haji Camp's children rehydration centre.
Talking to Dawn, Dr Zia-ul-Islam, administrator of Hayat Teaching Hospital,
said that according to preliminary reports of the laboratory tests of
drinking water and stool the epidemic was a viral disease caused as a
result of water contamination and not due to breakout of cholera. However,
final conclusion would be possible on the receipt of the detailed report
which would be available in 72 hours after the provision of samples to the
laboratories concerned, said the hospital sources. The official handout
has also put the number of deaths at nine, three registered at the
Hayatabad Teaching Hospital and six unregistered.
