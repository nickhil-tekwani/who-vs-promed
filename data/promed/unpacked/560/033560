Authorities confirmed on Monday [4 Feb 2008] a fresh outbreak of the
H5N1 strain of bird flu at a poultry farm on the outskirts of
Karachi, the 2nd case in 4 days in the city, a government official
said.

Authorities have found several outbreaks of the virus in poultry and
birds in North West Frontier Province and the capital, Islamabad,
since it was first detected in the country in early 2006. The 1st
human case, which resulted in a death, was confirmed in December
[2007].

The sale of chicken was dwindling, as more than 300 chickens died of
bird flu in Lahore, reported Channel Five.

The country was on high alert after bird flu cases were reported in
the country. The health authorities created special Isolation Wards
and vaccines were being provided to the hospitals to meet any
eventualities. [Since there is no human H5N1 vaccine available yet,
one wonders what these vaccines are. Does any reader know? - Mod.JW].

It is pertinent to add that chickens are brought from the suburbs of
the city to the market. The price of chicken also dropped in the city.
Before the outbreak of the bird flu, the chicken was being sold at PKR
110 per kg [USD 1.76], but the meat sellers reported a decline of PKR
30 [USD 0.48] in the prices after the cases were confirmed in Karachi.

The new outbreak was found on a farm only 300m (0.2 mi) from
where an outbreak was detected last week [28 Jan-3 Feb 2008].
"Samples taken from it were tested and found positive for H5N1," said
Food and Agriculture Ministry official Rafiq-ul-Hassan Usmani. "Some
500 to 600 birds died of the virus and the remaining 5500 chickens at
the farm are being culled now."

Elsewhere, more than 2000 chickens brought from Hyderabad died in
Mangora, Swat. The Tehsil Municipal Authority Mangora, on the public
complaint, while taking quick action took into custody the owner of
chickens and sent specimen of the dead chickens to laboratory to
check for bird flu.

Due to the death of such a large number of chickens the spread of
bird flu is feared in the area and the residents have stopped buying
chicken.

The official sources have confirmed the death of 2000 chickens while
according to independent sources, more than 2000 chickens have died.
The authorities have taken the alive and dead chickens into custody
and have sent the samples of the chicken to Islamabad for further
testing.

In Punjab 5000 chickens perished due to bird flu virus in village
Moor Charwan in Hujra Shah Moqeem at [a poultry farm.]

Panic has spread among the owners of the local poultry farms because
it is the 1st incident of bird flu in the area as the local residents
avoid purchasing of chicken and eggs due to fear of bird flu while
the business of chicken is declining in the market.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) has demanded [that] the
government provide subsidy for the import of vaccine for the
prevention of bird flu. They have also demanded that the law,
regarding the right distance (2 km - 1.2 mi) between 2 poultry farms,
must be implemented soon.

PPA leaders said that 1.5 million people were associated with this
industry while agricultural products, worth PKR 50 billion [about USD
800 million] were used in the poultry feed. They also said the virus
of bird flu dies at 60 deg C (140 deg F) but Pakistani food was
usually cooked at 100 to 120 deg C (212-248 deg F).
