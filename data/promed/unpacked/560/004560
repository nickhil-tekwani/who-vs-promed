Peanut stripe potyvirus, peanut - South Korea 20010709.1328
Date: 10 Jun 2001
From: Richard Hamilton <rihamilto@home.com>

The posting on Peanut stripe potyvirus on 9 Jul 2001 contained factual
errors that require correction. According to the 7th Report of the ICTV
(Virus Taxonomy, Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses, San Diego: Academic Press. 1162p), viruses formerly known as
Azuki bean mosaic, Blackeye cowpea mosaic, Dendrobium mosaic, Guar green
sterile, Peanut chlorotic ring mottle, Peanut mild mottle, and Peanut
Stripe are now considered to be strains of Bean common mosaic, not Bean
common mosaic necrosis.
Moreover, according to the International Code of Virus Classification and
Nomenclature (pp. 1065-1069 in the 7th Report), the generic name is no
longer part of the species name. Thus, the correct specific name is Peanut
stripe virus, not Peanut stripe potyvirus.
Finally, the reference to McKern et al., 1992 is incorrect. The correct
reference is: McKern, N.M., G.I. Mink, O.W. Barnett, A. Mishra, L.A.
Whittaker, M.J. Silbernagel, C.W. Ward and D.D. Shukla. 1992. Isolates of
bean common mosaic virus comprising two distinct potyviruses.
Phytopathology 82:923-929.
Other relevant studies include:
McKern, N.M., D.D. Shukla, O.W. Barnett, H. J. Vetten, J. Dijkstra, L.W.
Whittaker, and C.W. Ward. 1992. Coat protein properties suggest that azuki
bean mosaic virus, blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, peanut stripe virus, and 3
isolates from soybean are all strains of the same potyvirus. Intervirology
33 (3):121-134.
McKern, N.M., P.M. Strike, O.W. Barnett, J. Dijkstra, D.D. Shukla, and C.W.
Ward. 1994. Cowpea aphid borne mosaic virus-Morocco and South African
passiflora virus are strains of the same potyvirus. Archives of Virology
136 (1-2):207-217.
A more recent view on the taxonomy of legume-infecting potyviruses is:
Berger, P.H., S.D. Wyatt, P.J. Shiel, M.J. Silbernagel, K. Druffel, and
G.I. Mink. 1997. Phylogenetic analysis of the Potyviridae with emphasis on
legume-infecting potyviruses. Archives of Virology 142:1979-1999.
