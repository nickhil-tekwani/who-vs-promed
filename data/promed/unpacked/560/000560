In a cattle breeding company in the partido (county) of Benito Juarez,
Buenos Aires Province, some 42 Aberdeen Angus cattle started dying
suddenly in the 2 last weeks of July 2010. Death was characterized by
a blood extravasation from the natural openings of the carcasses
(mouth, nose, vagina, anus). None of the animals had been previously
vaccinated against anthrax.

The estancia veterinarian sent a blood sample for laboratory diagnosis
but it was negative for _Bacillus anthracis_; however the sample was
grossly contaminated. The veterinarian then sent a metacarpal bone
[the usual sample submitted for this disease in Argentina. - Mod.MHJ]
from the 2nd animal to die and this demonstrated _B. anthracis_. It
was injected subcutaneously into a white mouse, which died within 14
hours of inoculation.

No estancia gauchos [ranch cowboys] have been in direct contact with
any of the carcasses. The carcasses have been sprayed with 5 percent
formaldehyde and covered with a heavy plastic tarpaulin, which was
closely pegged down -- "Tapado controlado." After 240 days the bones
and any remaining tissues will be burnt. [This method reflects the
absence of trees, and firewood, in the Argentine pampas. What does
remain after 9 months is easily burnt. - Mod.MHJ]

[While the Argentine has an an active control and surveillance
programme it is plagued by owners who fail to vaccinate their stock.
In this case the laziness was very expensive. - Mod.MHJ]
