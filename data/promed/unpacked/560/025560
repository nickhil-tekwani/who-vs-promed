China has shared long-sought samples of the H5N1 bird flu virus, in
what many scientists view as a breakthrough in cooperation, the World
Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thu 28 Sep 2006. The samples, taken
from some of the thousands of wild birds which died in Qinghai Lake
in April 2005, have been sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
(CDC), a WHO Collaborating Center in Atlanta, for further analysis,
WHO officials said.
"My understanding is they have been shipped to a WHO Collaborating
Center now from the Ministry of Agriculture," WHO scientist Michael
Perdue told a news briefing. He said the animal samples, the first
from China in 2-1/2 years, should help scientists understand the
origin of a sub-type of the deadly H5N1 virus which later circulated
in Turkey and Africa but is genetically different from the one
hitting other parts of Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Leading scientists have repeatedly expressed concerns that China was
not sharing all genetic data from bird flu cases -- widely seen as
vital to track mutations and develop a vaccine against a human
pandemic. "Most people do see it as a breakthrough for cooperation,"
Perdue told Reuters.
The lake, a major stop-off point for migratory birds in the remote
northwestern Qinghai province, has become a focus for scientists
studying mutations of the virus. The Agriculture Ministry previously
had placed "certain restrictions" on sharing the virus samples, but
this had been resolved through negotiations, Perdue said without
giving details. He said the samples from birds which died at the lake
were shipped a week ago from a key Ministry of Agriculture laboratory
in Harbin to the CDC.
CDC officials expected to receive the samples later on Thursday and
it was hoped they would include additional animal samples requested
from China, he said. "We have to wait to see exactly what they
shipped," he said. Chinese scientists have published some analyses of
the samples, but the CDC is expected to carry out more sophisticated
testing with antibodies which will reveal variations of immune
responses, according to the WHO expert.
"It gives us an animal index case for birds to have the samples from
Qinghai Lake, which is the first time that particular type was
detected in China," Perdue told Reuters. "It will go into the global
collection we are making of the virus to see how it changes over
time," the American added.
Hualen Chen, head of China's national avian influenza reference
laboratory in Harbin, was among 70 scientists worldwide who last
month announced the launch of a global body to share genetic bird flu
data. China has shared samples from human cases, David Heymann, WHO's
acting special representative on avian influenza, said. The WHO has
confirmed 21 human bird flu cases including 14 deaths in China since
November 2005.
Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but has killed 148
people of 251 people confirmed as having the virus in 10 countries
since 2003, according to the Geneva-based WHO.

[The release by the Chinese authorities of virus samples isolated
from migratory birds at Qinghai Lake is a welcome development.
Determination of the genetic characteristics of these viruses is key
to understanding of the origin and spread of the H5N1 avian influenza
virus epidemic in East Asia and beyond. It is to be hoped that the
release of these samples by the Chinese authorities will encourage
free interchange of materials. Whether this constitutes a scientific
"breakthrough" remains to be determined. - Mod.CP]
