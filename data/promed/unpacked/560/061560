Norwalk-like virus outbreak in London hospital
----------------------------------------------
So far 90 patients and staff at Whipps Cross Hospital have contracted
[infection with] the highly infectious Norwalk-like virus (NLV), which
causes a form of gastric flu, the main symptoms of which are violent
diarrhea and vomiting. Non-essential operations have been cancelled, while
accident and emergency patients are being treated before they are
transferred to other hospitals in north east London.
NLV, which is airborne and is also transmitted through contact, can kill
the very young and very old. Victims of the outbreak have been kept in 11
wards, with access limited to a minimum. Non-essential staff are not
allowed to enter the affected wards and there is a ban on visitors until
the situation is under control. So far only 15 operations have been
cancelled and officials will today decide whether to close more areas of
the hospital and cancel more operations.
A patient began suffering from symptoms of the infection, otherwise known
as "winter vomiting disease", on Tue 21 May 2002. By Sat 25 May 2002 there
were 71 cases, with the figure rising to 90 on Sun 26 May 2002. Thus far 33
members of staff have been [affected by the infection], which lasts for up
to 48 hours. A hospital spokeswoman said: "We are not sure how the virus
entered the hospital and an investigation has begun. Nothing like this has
ever happened here before. We can only keep patients comfortable and make
sure that the staff treating them do not fall ill themselves. The virus has
not spread to any of the pediatric or maternity wards. Those who have
contracted the virus will be contained in the infected wards until their
symptoms have passed and the situation is under control."
In Jan 2002 large parts of Britain were hit by NLV infection, which was
first detected in Stirling, before reaching Hertfordshire, Sussex,
Hampshire, and Dorset. In the same month 12 hospitals across Scotland were
affected. Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary was the worst hit, with 283 patients
and staff struck down by the infection at its peak. That outbreak led to
200 operations being cancelled.

["Winter vomiting disease" is continuing to affect health care facilities
and schools throughout the the UK. The name is somewhat inappropriate since
outbreaks are continuing well into the late spring/early summer. It would
appear that there is little pre-existing immunity in the population to
check the epidemic; young and old being similarly at risk. The phenomenon
does not appear to be restricted to Britain, as similar outbreaks have
occurred in other parts of Europe during the same period - Mod.CP]
