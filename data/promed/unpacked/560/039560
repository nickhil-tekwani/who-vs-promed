A Description of a Similar Case in Australia
--------------------------------------------
I am currently looking after a male patient in Melbourne, Australia, with a
similar-sounding problem to the one talked about in the ProMED-mail post of
14 May 2001, referenced as "Viral enceph., imported - Germany ex Australia
20010514.0940".
He is 66 years of age and just returned from a 3-week fishing trip around
Kakadu and Darwin. Several days after his return, he started to become
febrile and drowsy. Headache developed and he became very confused. Imaging
with CT and MRI were not particularly helpful. CSF showed 196 neutrophils,
34 lymphocytes, and 5 erythrocytes and a protein assay of 0.55 g/l. PCR was
negative for herpes simplex virus and enteroviruses. Bacterial culture was
negative. Serology is pending for Australian encephalitis [i.e., Murray
Valley encephalitis virus infection, Japanese [encephalitis virus,
[other flaviviruses, and other less likely options.
We treated the patient with acyclovir initially (until the negative PCR and
MRI results became available), vancomycin (for _Listeria_ infection with
penicillin allergy), and later with cotrimoxazole (for both _Listeria_
infection and melioidosis due to _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_). The patient
has made a good recovery and I think the most likely diagnosis is [a viral
encephalitis.

[Confirmation of the viral encephalitis diagnosis would be appreciated, if
the serological tests yield positive results. - Mod.CP
