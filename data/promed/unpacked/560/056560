Salmonella outbreak at Winslow Arizona state prison
---------------------------------------------------
An "extreme" salmonella outbreak has been reported at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Winslow. The outbreak occurred in the Kaibab and Coronado Units. Officials say that the outbreak has been contained as of 7 Sep 2015. All of the units are displaying "open" status as of 23 Sep 2015. 240 of the 1426 inmates experienced the symptoms of salmonellosis.. The last time an illness was reported was on 7 Sep 2015.

The Arizona Department of corrections worked with public health officials to contain the outbreak. On-site medical care was provided to sick inmates. Lab samples were sent offsite for analysis.

The organism was found in a tossed salad that was served to both units on 31 Aug 2015, according to Andrew Wilder, director of communications for the Arizona Department of Corrections. Inmates began getting sick on 3 Sep 2015, which is within the window of incubation time for this bacterium.

It is not known which ingredient in that salad is responsible for the illness. There is a nationwide salmonellosis outbreak that is ongoing linked to imported cucumbers distributed by Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce of San Diego, California. The illnesses could also have been caused by cross-contamination in the kitchen, from a sick food handler, or from another food item in the salad.

While the investigation was under way, inmate meals were prepared off-site. Education about hand hygiene was given to staff and inmates. The facility was sanitized as well.

Prisoners are in a unique situation when it comes to foodborne outbreaks. Because they are literally a captive population, responsibility rests on the administrators and staff to make sure they are not suffering cruel and unusual punishment. They do not have a choice of where or what they eat.

There is no word on whether or not any inmates were hospitalized in this outbreak; according to officials, medical care was provided at the prison. In a typical salmonellosis outbreak, 20 per cent of patients are hospitalized because of the seriousness of their illness.

Food poisoning outbreaks at prisons are not uncommon. In 2011, more than 300 inmates and staff at prison in Pennsylvania were sickened with salmonella linked to contaminated chicken. An outbreak caused by _Clostridium perfringens_ found in chili macaroni sickened 152 teenagers and staff at 2 juvenile facilities in Kansas. And in Golden, Colorado in July 2007, an _Eschericha coli_ outbreak sickened 12 per cent of the 1200 inmates at that facility.

Like all large facilities where people are concentrated, prisons are at high risk of foodborne illness. Crowded conditions, which contribute to person-to-person spread of illnesses, can also play a factor in these outbreaks. A study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 stated that "food production in correctional facilities should meet minimum safety standards, including sufficient refrigeration facilities, training of food handlers, and exemption of ill food handlers from work."
