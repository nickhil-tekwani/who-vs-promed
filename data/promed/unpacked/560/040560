--------------------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today
that a 52 year-old man from the Graniteville section of Staten Island has
tested positive for West Nile virus. This patient became ill with symptoms
of meningitis on 15 Aug 2000, and was admitted to a local hospital on 18
Aug. The patient was released from the hospital on 25 Aug and is now at
home recovering. The laboratory results were obtained by tests performed at
the New York City Department of Health's laboratories, and specimens have
been sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for
further confirmation.

[This case is significant in that the patient is considerably younger than
previous cases, who were 63, 64, 78, 84 and 87 years of age. Five of the 6
West Nile virus-infected patients reside in Staten Island; the sixth
resides in Brooklyn. -Mod.CP
