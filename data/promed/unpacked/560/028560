Salmonella Goldcoast in tourists returning from Majorca, Sep-Oct 2005
-----------------------------------------------
An international outbreak control team (OCT) led by Health Protection
Scotland investigated an outbreak of _Salmonella_ [_enteritidis_ serotype -
Mod.LL] Goldcoast infections in tourists returning from Majorca in
September and October 2005 (1-3). The case definition agreed was as
follows: a case of gastroenteritis caused by serotype Goldcoast in a
patient who had visited Majorca one week before onset of symptoms, onset
being between 20 Sep and 19 Oct 2005.

A total of 148 cases of serotype Goldcoast meeting the outbreak case
definition were reported from around Europe between 1 Oct and 1 Dec 2005:
England and Wales (66), Scotland (28), Germany (17), Sweden (12), Norway
(8), Ireland (6), Denmark (4), Finland (4), and Majorca (3). The last
symptom onset date reported was 19 Oct 2005. The UK Health Protection
Agency Centre for Infections reported 116 confirmed cases in England and
Wales between 1 Oct and 1 Dec 2005, compared with 4 cases in the same
period in 2004.

Follow-up information was available for 112 cases (97 per cent). 83 cases
(74 per cent) reported recent foreign travel, and 73 of these (88 per cent)
reported Majorca as their destination. One case reported visiting Majorca
as part of a cruise. During investigations, 5 cases were deemed to be
secondary cases and were excluded, leaving 66 primary cases which met the
case definition. Of the 66 primary cases, all age groups were affected,
although half (33/66) of cases were under 5 years old (range 0-76 years).
55 per cent of cases were male and 45 per cent female. 5 patients were
admitted to hospital. Information on symptom onset dates, which ranged from
20 Sep to 19 Oct 2005, was available for 64 cases in the UK and a further
68 cases in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden.

The Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory (SSRL) reported 40 isolates of
serotype Goldcoast between 1 Oct and 1 Dec 2005, 28 of which fitted the
outbreak case definition. One patient reported visiting Majorca as part of
a cruise holiday. Patients' ages ranged from 0 to 80 years, and 61 per cent
of the cases were children aged 5 years or younger. Onset dates ranging
between 27 Sep and 11 Oct 2005 were available for 27 cases.

All tested isolates in the UK that met the case definition were fully
sensitive to antibiotics, and all have the same pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) profile, GldX2 (SSRL designation).

To generate hypotheses for disease transmission, 17 patients living in
various parts of England, Wales, and Scotland were interviewed at length
using a detailed standardized trawling questionnaire. Data from these
interviews did not generate a testable hypothesis about foods, outlets, or
other potential sources of infection.

The international outbreak control team was convened on 1 Dec 2005, and the
outbreak was declared over. Members agree that no further environmental or
epidemiological investigations were warranted.
