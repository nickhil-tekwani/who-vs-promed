Just a brief update on our situation here in NW Minnesota. We have had 2
cases of anthrax so far in NW MN, the first in Polk County between Red Lake
Falls and Crookston; a commercial beef herd with 10 deaths in a 50-cow herd.
The 2nd (yet unconfirmed by NDSU) is in southern Roseau County; 5 deaths so
far in a 560-cow beef herd. The remarkable thing with this case is that
this is the herd currently under quarantine and scheduled for depopulation
due to bovine tuberculosis. This is Minnesota's 1st TB case since 1971.
The Polk county case falls directly on one of the old Red River cart trails
mapped by ProMED-mail Moderator Martin Hugh-Jones in 2001. This is a new
area for anthrax, with no previous cases within about 50 miles. Same thing
with the Roseau county site. The nearest site was about 30 miles NW in 2001.
I am not certain how much vaccine has been used in the old anthrax-endemic
areas this year, but I will check on this.

[Thanks, Terry. The cattle trails project was to verify the traditional
belief that anthrax was related to the cattle trails of the 19th century.
We found that if your ranch/farm was in a county within some 10 km of a
cattle trail going from the south to the north, there was a significant
risk, approx. 10 percent, of historical anthrax in that county. This did
not apply to the emigrant trails from east to west. This made sense, as the
south-to-north trails, including those from Texas to California, involved
longhorn cattle moving from an historic enzootic region of southern Texas
and Louisiana. The east-west trails involved less cattle and these were
largely British breeds, mainly Herefords, from breeding areas without
anthrax. The Red River trails were to get people, goods, and livestock from
St. Paul up into northwestern Minnesota and on to southern Manitoba and
Winnipeg. - Mod.MHJ]
