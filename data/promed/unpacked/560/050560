Foot and mouth disease, rhinoceros - India: NOT
-----------------------------------------------
Should a note have been added following the ProMED-mail posting of the
Toronto Star announcement to indicate that, despite the fact the article
says rhinos are susceptible to FMD, FMD has not been diagnosed or reported
for any rhino species (the family Rhinocerotidae)?
Meanwhile, many rare or endangered Artiodactyla in India and around the
rest of the world are chronically at risk from exposure to poorly
controlled domestic animal diseases such as FMD, as livestock continually
infringe on parks, reserves, and previously "wild" lands.
FMD is endemic in Assam. According to a recent note from a faculty member
from the College of Veterinary Science, AAU, Guwahati, over the years wild
buffalo and elephants have been known to have been infected with FMD in the
same area where the rhino populations live and no cases in rhinos have ever
been seen.

[Dr Karesh is correct. I should have noted the rhino has not actually been
diagnosed with the disease. I appreciate his correction in stating rhinos
have not been diagnosed, but elephants have, and of course there are many
rare and endangered species whose plight is not helped by this disease.
Thank you, Dr Karesh. - Mod.TG
