A man has died from hepatitis A complications following a hepatitis A outbreak at Famous Anthony's in September [2021], according to his attorney. We're told that the man's wife died from the outbreak as well.

This comes after the Virginia Department of Health announced in September 2021 that an employee who worked at 3 Famous Anthony's locations in Roanoke was diagnosed with hepatitis A. The employee had worked at 4913 Grandin Road, 6499 Williamson Road and 2221 Crystal Spring Ave. The attorney said he is also representing 27 clients who were involved in the outbreak. He said some of his clients are still facing liver complications.

On 15 Oct 2021, the health department announced the 1st death that was associated with the outbreak. A 2nd death was announced on 29 Oct 2021 and a 3rd death was reported later that day. Their identities were not disclosed.

[Unlike the more recent Pennsylvania HAV outbreak linked to a restaurant, this earlier and larger HAV cluster seems clearly to be associated with an infected food handler. It is also likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case in Virginia was unimmunized, and the substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019. Outbreaks such as these may not change the statistics for cost-effectiveness nationwide but might push public health authorities to a plan to immunize food handlers against HAV. Although now part of childhood immunization programs in the USA -- and none of the cases were apparently in children -- many adults in the developed world are susceptible. - Mod.LL
