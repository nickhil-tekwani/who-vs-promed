A poultry flock in Huron County has been infected with a new strain of bird flu, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Tuesday [26 Apr 2022].

There are now 19 outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu in Ontario. The federal agency estimates 250 000 birds in the province have been impacted since the 1st outbreak was declared 27 Mar 2022.

The federal agency didn't specify on its website where the affected farm is in Huron County, or the type of poultry.

The other outbreaks closest to London are near Durham in the Municipality of West Grey (confirmed 9 Apr 2022), in Chatham-Kent (confirmed 6 Apr 2022) and near Thamesford in western Oxford County (confirmed 28 Mar 2022). Control zones have been set up around each property, so officials can control the movement of people and birds on and off those farms.

Outside of Ontario, there are outbreaks in every province except Prince Edward Island.

In 2015, federal and provincial officials spent months containing and eventually eradicating another strain of bird flu. That outbreak was contained to 3 farms in Oxford County. About 80 000 birds, mostly turkeys, were wiped out.

Bird flu continues to spread in Saskatchewan. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported Sunday [24 Apr 2022] in a poultry flock in the rural municipality (RM) of Carmichael, 2 days after it was detected Friday [22 Apr 2022] in a poultry flock in the RM of Morse and in a small flock in the RM of Loreburn.

Those follow cases in a poultry flock in the RM of Loreburn that was reported 16 Apr 2022 and in a small flock in the RM of Moose Creek that was detected14 Apr 2022.

The CFIA said all of the infected premises have been placed under quarantine. "CFIA has begun an investigation and will be establishing movement control measures on other farms within that area," the agency said in a media release.

The virus was first detected in Saskatchewan in a snow goose near Elrose on 8 Apr 2022. On 14 Apr 2022, Saskatchewan's chief veterinary officer instituted an animal health control area order to limit the co-mingling of poultry due to the risk of the flu. The order prohibits birds from being taken to and appearing in shows, auctions, agricultural fairs and any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations. That order is in effect until 14 May 2022.

The provincial government said there isn't any risk to food safety and the risk of transmission is low. However, people working with chickens suspected of being infected should use protective clothing.

The province said biosecurity is the best tool for poultry producers and small flock owners to protect their birds from avian flu. Biosecurity protocols include keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health. Small flock owners are encouraged to confine their birds indoors, if possible, during wild bird migration.

"AI is spreading in wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada," the agency's release said. "The CFIA continues to remind anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds to practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from infectious animal diseases."

[3] British Columbia (Kelowna): backyard flock

A small backyard poultry flock in Kelowna, BC, has tested positive for avian flu, the 2nd known outbreak of the disease among flocks in British Columbia. The highly infectious H5N1 strain of the illness was confirmed earlier this month [April 2022] on an Enderby farm in the North Okanagan.

A statement from the Ministry of Agriculture says it is working closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and BC poultry producers to ensure protection measures are in place. The infected Kelowna flock has been quarantined, and the statement says producers within a 12-kilometre (~7.5 mi) radius have been notified.

The ministry also says a bald eagle recently found in Delta is positive for avian influenza, the 2nd case among wild birds in BC since February [2022], when the H5N1 strain was confirmed in the remains of a bald eagle in Vancouver.

Owners of small or backyard flocks are urged to watch for signs of illness in their birds, eliminate the chance for contact with wild birds and step up cleaning and disinfection of all clothing and equipment used when caring for their animals.

Outbreaks of avian influenza have been confirmed in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta, but no human cases have been detected. The CFIA said the illness is not considered a significant concern for healthy people who are not in regular contact with infected birds.

A farm in Whitemouth, Man., was also quarantined on 23 Apr 2022, as the agency said that province had recorded its 1st confirmed cases of H5N1 in a commercial poultry flock. Manitoba Natural Resources and Northern Development announced last week avian flu had been detected in several snow geese collected in southwestern Manitoba and from the remains of a bald eagle found in the Dauphin area.

This has been an unprecedented year globally for avian flu, the CFIA has said. It cautioned migratory birds are likely responsible for the outbreaks, which spread through contact with an infected bird, its feces or nasal secretions, and the CFIA said it expected there would be more cases as wild birds continue to fly north for the summer.

BC's deputy chief veterinarian has ordered all commercial poultry operators with more than 100 birds to move their flocks indoors until the spring migration ends in May [2022].

To date [25 Apr 2022], more than 31 million birds in the US commercial poultry industry have been lost to the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak of 2022. It is a number practically unimaginable to most of us. And we need to keep in mind that these are just cases in commercial poultry and that figure does not include the backyard poultry flocks and wild birds that have also been affected by the virus.

A unique thing about this outbreak is practically every type of poultry is raised in the United States has been infected. And at the conclusion of the past week, we broke those HPAI infections down by the type of flock.

As of 22 Apr 2022, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) had reported there were confirmed cases in 147 commercial poultry flocks, resulting in either the natural death or the depopulation of a total of 31 022 600 birds.

While the overwhelming majority of the HPAI cases in the United States this year [2022] have been in turkey flocks, it is the commercial egg industry [that has] lost the most birds because of the larger flock sizes in layer operations. But the broiler, duck and upland gamebird industries have also not been immune to this outbreak.

The figures below came from information released by state agencies, APHIS and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Egg industry losses
-------------------
The current tally on US commercial egg laying operations to be impacted by HPAI in 2022 is 14, with 23 231 000 hens lost. Two of those flocks -- both of which were in Iowa -- involved more than 5 million layers, while another case in Wisconsin had nearly 3 million hens affected, collectively making up more than half of the US layers lost to the outbreak.

In addition to the layer flocks to be affected, 3 pullet operations have also been hit by HPAI, which collectively amounts to 809 000 birds. One table egg breeding operation was also infected, and that flock included 15 000 birds.

Turkey industry losses
----------------------
In 2022, 102 commercial turkey operations have been affected by HPAI, amounting to 4 411 000 turkeys. The largest affected flock involved 240 000 birds in Meeker County, Minnesota.

There have also been 6 turkey breeder hen flocks affected, for a total of 170 000 hens affected. A turkey breeder replacement hen flock of 68 600 birds was also impacted by HPAI.

There was also one case of HPAI in a turkey breeder flock and one case in a poult flock, involving 6900 and 8100 turkeys, respectively.

Broiler industry losses
-----------------------
Ten US broiler operations have been lost to HPAI in 2022. The 2 largest operations affected were both in Butler County, Nebraska. Collectively, those 2 cases involved 987 000 birds. Those 2 cases, combined with the 3rd largest US case, which involved 294 800 chickens in Stoddard County, Missouri, account for more than half of the 2 214 900 broilers lost to HPAI in 2022.

A broiler breeder flock of 60 000 birds has also been lost to HPAI this year [2022].

Duck industry losses
--------------------
Two commercial duck flocks have been affected by HPAI, accounting for 13 000 birds. In addition, a duck breeder flock of 4700 birds was also infected. All 3 cases were in Indiana.

Upland gamebird losses
----------------------
Three commercial upland gamebird operations have had positive confirmations of HPAI in 2022. One was in Texas, one was in New York and one was in South Dakota. The total of those 3 cases is 9000 birds.

[5] Iowa (Koosuth County): backyard flock
Date: Mon 25 Apr 2022 14:57 CDT

https://www.thegazette.com/agriculture/bird-flu-hits-backyard-flock-in-kossuth-county/


An outbreak of highly contagious bird flu has been discovered in a backyard flock in north-central Iowa's Kossuth County, state agriculture officials announced Monday [25 Apr 2022]. The confirmation brings to 18 the number of Iowa outbreaks, all since the start of March.

Agriculture officials did not say how many birds were being euthanized in the latest outbreak to help curtail the spread of the disease. So far, more than 13.3 million poultry birds in the state -- and over 33.6 million nationwide -- have been euthanized this year [2022].

Almost all the outbreaks in the state have been in commercial chicken and turkey operations. The non-commercial Kossuth County outbreak is the 3rd backyard flock affected so far this year in Iowa.

Two additional avian flu diagnoses bring Minnesota to 60 infection sites. A confirmed diagnosis was received Saturday [23 Apr 2022] in a Rice County producer of 60 unspecified birds. And Stearns County now has its 8th site with a confirmed diagnosis on Monday [25 Apr 2022] at a commercial meat turkey operation of 14 590 birds.

The Board of Animal Health's tally of confirmed diagnoses of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza now stands at 2 717 892 over 60 sites.

The Board of Animal Health's web page devoted to avian flu response in the state -- which can be found at http://www.bah.state.mn.us/hpai -- is updated by noon each weekday with the information that is known about poultry infection sites. Data from previous days also may be updated by quality control staff if more accurate information is gathered later.

According to the web page, commercial meat turkey operations remain the vast majority of the sites. There are now 5 sites in the backyard producer category; 3 sites of commercial turkey breeder hens, all located in Kandiyohi County; and 2 chicken flocks in Morrison County, one broiler and one egg layer operation.

Bird flu has been confirmed in another Michigan county. According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a non-commercial backyard poultry flock from Wexford County.

The flock contained approximately 60 birds of various species. The birds will be killed to prevent disease spread. The MDARD says the latest positive test emphasizes the ongoing high risk for the disease in Michigan and underscores the need for bird owners to maintain their vigilance in protecting their flocks.

The Wexford County flock is the latest in Michigan to have a confirmed positive test. The disease was confirmed in a flock of 35 poultry housed in Saginaw County this week. State officials reported cases of bird flu in Kalamazoo County in February, in Macomb County in March, and in Livingston, Menominee and Washtenaw counties in April [2022]. Multiple counties in northern Indiana have also had confirmed cases.

Avian influenza has been found at a small flock in Johnson County. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health said the flock included 41 ducks, chickens and peafowl.

Sites in Dubois, Elkhart and Greene counties have also tested positive. Those were commercial duck and turkey farms, according to the Board of Animal Health.

The Indiana Department of Natural Resources has reported bird flu in redhead duck, bald eagle and red-tailed hawk populations in Dubois, Starke, Miami and Johnson counties.

Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified avian influenza among wild birds in 33 states and among poultry in 29 states. There are no human cases reported and federal health officials have said the bird flu poses little risk to the public.

Anyone who sees signs of highly pathogenic avian influenza can call the Healthy Birds Hotline. A state or federal veterinarian will talk to the caller to assess the case and determine the next steps. Testing will be provided at no charge.

[Avian influenza continues to march across North America with a wake of dead birds and devastated individuals.

Biosecurity cannot be overemphasized, whether you are a commercial production facility or a school student preparing to show a bird. But sadly, the shows are cancelled in effort to protect the birds. Biosecurity is everyone's priority when it comes to the birds. Guard your birds, inside, and limit the number of individuals coming onto your premises. - Mod.TG
