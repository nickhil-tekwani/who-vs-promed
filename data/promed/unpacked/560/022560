We have just learned about the 1st reported case of a horse with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the Upper Peninsula. The Michigan Dept of Agriculture & Rural Development released the following statement on Friday [2 Oct 2020]:

"Today [Fri 2 Oct 2020], the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is confirming the discovery of EEE in a horse from Baraga County. Not only is this the 1st case of EEE being found in Michigan's Upper Peninsula for 2020, but it is also the 1st report of EEE ever being found in Baraga County. This case indicates the mosquitoes carrying EEE continue to be active, and all Michigan residents still need to take precautions to protect their animals as well as themselves."

EEE is a dangerous, zoonotic mosquitoborne disease typically seen in the state from late summer to early fall. Last year [2019], Michigan experienced 50 cases of EEE in animals and a record of 10 human cases. So far this year [2020], 2 human cases of EEE and 36 animal cases have been confirmed across 15 Michigan counties. The human cases of EEE have been confirmed in residents of Barry and Montcalm counties, and the Montcalm County resident has died.

"Our sympathies to the family and friends of this Michigan resident," said Dr Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). "EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquitoborne diseases in the United States, which is why we made the decision to conduct aerial treatment last month [September 2020]. We continue to urge Michiganders to take precautions against mosquitoes."

The latest reports of the disease involve horses found in Livingston and Baraga counties. To see the presence of EEE so far northward in the Upper Peninsula is not uncommon. Last year [2019], 2 cases of the disease were reported in animals from Houghton and Ontonagon counties. Also, while the Baraga County case is the 1st case of the disease in the Upper Peninsula this year [2020], Wisconsin has had a number of EEE cases within their northern counties, including Forest County, which borders the Upper Peninsula.

"Given the trends of EEE and other mosquitoborne diseases over the last 2 years, owners of horses and other animals across the entire state need to make vaccines and mosquito mitigation practices routine," said state veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "The mortality rate of EEE in horses can be as high as 90 per cent, so it's unlikely you'll get a 2nd chance to vaccinate an animal after it becomes infected. And, even though mosquito season is coming to a close as the weather gets colder, it is important for owners to work with their veterinarian to ensure proper timing of vaccination."

While the state of Michigan has been experiencing some cooler temperatures this week, the mosquitoes carrying EEE will remain alive and active until there has been at least one hard freeze where the temperatures fall below 28 F [-2.2 C] for several hours. Therefore, it is still necessary to eliminate standing water on one's property, bring animals into a barn from dusk to dawn to avoid peak mosquito activity, vaccinate horses against the disease, and contact a veterinarian if an animal displays any sign of illness.

"Living in the Upper Peninsula, it's easy to feel insulated from some of the issues happening south of the Mackinac Bridge," said Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development director Gary McDowell, a resident of Chippewa County in the Upper Peninsula. "EEE is carried primarily between mosquitoes and bird reservoir hosts, so there are no natural geographic barriers protecting animals or people. Every Michigan resident needs to be cognizant of this and take all necessary precautions."

In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases.

In early September 2020, the increasing number of EEE cases being discovered in equines prompted MDHHS to initiate aerial treatments to mitigate the spread of the disease and help protect human health. This resulted in 462 000 acres treated. MDHHS will continue to monitor the situation, and treatment zones could be added if new cases are found and aerial treatment would be effective to reducing risk of exposure.

Applying insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and following other precautions can help Michigan residents avoid mosquito bites and stay healthy. For more information about EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases, visit https://www.Michigan.gov/emergingdiseases.

On 25 Sep 2020 MDARD officials confirmed 2 unvaccinated horses with EEE, bringing the state's total confirmed cases to 32 for the year.

The affected horses include a 20 year old Arabian mare in Oakland County and an 11 year old pony mare in Tuscola County. The pony mare is Tuscola County's 1st case in 2020.

Both equines began showing clinical signs on 12 Sep 2020. The Oakland County mare's signs consisted of recumbency (down and unable to rise), and she was humanely euthanized. The Tuscola County mare's signs included ataxia (loss of muscle control) and tremors. She is reported to be recovering.

The Lincoln County Health Department reports a horse in Lincoln County has tested positive for EEE. The report comes after 2 human cases of disease this year [2020] in Eau Claire County and Chippewa Counties. There have also been reports of several other EEE cases in horses in northern and western regions of Wisconsin.

EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito, which picks up the disease by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Presence of a EEE-positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can spread the virus to people and other animals. [The paragraph above states 2 human cases this year; wouldn't those cases indicate the disease was circulating in mosquitoes? - Mod.TG]

Even though temperatures have cooled off, as long as mosquitoes are active, the risk of EEE and other illnesses spread by mosquitoes can continue through much of the fall. Since EEE virus is known to be circulating in Lincoln County, the health department urges people to be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick, but it can cause serious illness in some cases. Those who do become ill may develop fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe, resulting in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death. There is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE illness available for people.

Signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Officials at the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (WDATCP) have confirmed 4 horses with EEE: 2 in Taylor County and one each in Sheboygan and Lincoln counties. All 4 horses were unvaccinated.

The Taylor County horses were confirmed positive on 17 Sep 2020. The 1st, a 9 year old pony mare, experienced onset of clinical signs on 10 Sep 2020. Signs included ataxia (loss of muscle control), depression, disorientation, shallow respiration, minimal reflexes, recumbency (down and unable to rise), and near-coma condition. The 2nd, a 10 year old paint mare, experienced ataxia and depression progressing to recumbency beginning 11 Sep 2020. The pony mare died, and the paint mare was euthanized. The cases brought Taylor County's tally of confirmed equine cases to 3.

On 17 Sep 2020, 2 additional horses, one in Sheboygan County and one in Lincoln County, began showing signs.

The Sheboygan County horse, a 7 year old quarter horse gelding, exhibited fever and began circling, lost muscle control, experienced difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and leaned against objects, progressing to recumbency. He was confirmed positive on 25 Sep 2020 and was euthanized. He was Sheboygan County's 1st confirmed equine case for 2020.

The Lincoln County horse, a 9 year old quarter horse gelding, began showing signs consisting of fever, acute-onset depression, anorexia, ataxia, and recumbency. He was also confirmed positive on 25 Sep 2020 and euthanized. This was Lincoln County's 1st confirmed case this year [2020].

The cases bring Wisconsin's confirmed equine cases this year [2020] to 20.

On 25 Sep 2020, officials at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) confirmed a Putnam County horse with EEE. On 17 Sep 2020, the 2 year old quarter horse mare with an unknown vaccination history presented with clinical signs consisting of fever, depression, head pressing, muscle twitching, and inability to stand. She was humanely euthanized. This is Florida's 18th confirmed case of EEE in an equine in Florida for 2020.

Tips for preventing mosquitoborne diseases include:

**Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
**Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
**Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
**Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
**Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses.
**Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
**If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
**Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
**Stock water tanks with fish for consuming mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[According to this update, one horse was vaccinated against EEE in March 2020 and began showing clinical signs of EEE in September 2020. Hopefully, this horse received treatment and survived. It is critical to know that immunity to EEE wanes quickly, and in prolonged mosquito seasons, it is recommended to revaccinate against EEE approximately every 3-4 months.

Any unvaccinated horse is extremely susceptible to this disease. Supportive treatment is about all we have, but reading through this report, it seems most of the time, there are poor outcomes for unvaccinated horses. Vaccinating your animals against these diseases is part of responsible animal ownership! - Mod.TG
