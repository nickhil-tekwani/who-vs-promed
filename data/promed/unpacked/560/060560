Gabon Cordons Off Suspected Ebola Fever Zone after Several Deaths
----------------------------------------
Gabon has cordoned off a remote forest village to stop an outbreak of the
deadly Ebola virus thought to have killed at least 10 people, health
authorities said on Mon 10 Dec 2001. The World Health Organisation
confirmed during the weekend that at least one of those killed by
haemorrhagic fever in this central African country had died of Ebola virus
infection. [This information has been relayed in several press reports from
Geneva and Libreville, but as yet no statement has appeared on the WHO CSR
web-site. - Mod.CP.
"The zone is completely cordoned," Gabon's assistant health director, Obame
Edou, told Reuters. "A team has left for the area today and the government
will not delay in releasing news on the epidemic." Edou could not say
whether the death toll in the northeastern village of Mekambo had risen
above 10, including one nurse. An Ebola epidemic in a nearby area of Gabon
killed at least 66 people in 1996.
The latest deaths coincide with an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever that has
killed at least 28 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where
Ebola was discovered in 1976. Uganda has issued an Ebola alert in areas
bordering the DRC, even though the affected village of Misangandu [in the
DRC is roughly 1000 km southwest of Uganda, where Ebola killed 170 people
last year.

[The Ebola fever alert issued in Uganda relates to the concurrent outbreak
of an unknown hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
in the health zone of Dekese, centred on the village of Mbisangandu. The
health authorities in the DRC at present do not attribute this outbreak to
Ebola virus. There is undoubtedly a good deal of alarm in the whole region,
much media attention, and very little hard fact. - Mod.CP
