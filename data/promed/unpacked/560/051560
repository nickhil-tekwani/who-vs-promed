The Gorakhpur encephalitis (AES) [acute encephalitis syndrome] mystery has been [resolved]. It is scrub typhus, a mite-borne bacterial disease, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_.

An ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] sponsored investigation during August-September 2014 identified the etiology. Out of 249 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases investigated, 152 (61 percent) of the cases were attributable to scrub typhus either by IgM ELISA, IFA or PCR. A pathognomonic eschar was evident in 20 per cent of the AES cases we investigated.

Scrub typhus is generally an acute febrile illness involving multiple organs. Encephalitis is a late manifestation with high mortality. Scrub typhus is a treatable bacterial disease with excellent clinical response from doxycycline and azithromycin treatment. If left untreated for over a week, scrub typhus may lead to encephalitis, myocarditis, or multi-organ failure. Early administration of doxycycline during the 1st week of the febrile phase can prevent clinical complications in scrub typhus. In severe cases of scrub typhus, early and appropriate administration of intravenous azithromycin or doxycycline may save lives.

Seasonality of scrub typhus in Gorakhpur coincides with monsoon (July-September). Scrub vegetation during this season enhances transmission.

Early case identification and appropriate doxycycline therapy at community levels during monsoon will reduce the incidence of encephalitis.

[This report adds another dimension to the etiologies of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in northeastern India. A 22 Sep 2015 report indicated that there were 10 834 AES cases in 2014. That report describes AES as, "a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals and toxins" (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/india-had-over-10000-acute-encephalitis-syndrome-cases-in-2014_1800724.html). Previous ProMED-mail posts have implicated Reye syndrome, consumption of lychees, and heat stroke, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus infections, as responsible for AES. Now, scrub typhus is added to the list. Although "gold standard" diagnostic tests for scrub typhus were employed in the above study, there is no mention that these other etiologies were ruled out. One should note that 61 percent of the samples tested were scrub typhus positive, leaving 39 percent of the AES cases without a diagnosis.

The contributor of this report is thanked, and one hopes that this study will lead to testing for scrub typhus as other AES cases occur.

Scrub typhus occurs sporadically in India. There was a significant outbreak of scrub typhus in Rajasthan in 2014.

Mod.ML commented in ProMED post archive no. 20150821.3582448: "Outbreaks of scrub typhus have previously been reported from South India (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12098-012-0721-0). Because scrub typhus can present in a non-specific manner, its diagnosis can be difficult and sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests may not be widely available.

"Scrub typhus is caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by the bite of a chigger mite present in shrubberies. Symptoms develop 6 to 21 days after the chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common. A characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis may be seen at the site of a chigger bite and a maculopapular rash may also be present. A picture of the eschar can be found at http://medind.nic.in/icb/t10/i8/icbt10i8p918.pdf.

"Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop if treatment is delayed. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Treatment with azithromycin has been found to be equally effective (http://aac.asm.org/content/51/9/3259.full, http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957884/)."

Mod.ML indicated: "The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus has been the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay to detect _O. tsutsugamushi_-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (see ProMED-mail archive 20150821.3582448)." These are the tests used in the above study.

[Scrub typhus is known to involve the central nervous system as part of systemic infection, causing meningo-encephalitis with neck stiffness, tremor, delirium, seizures, and coma in some patients (1,2). Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, usually with an increase in mononuclear cells, has been described (1). Scrub typhus as one of several causes of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India has been described before. Among 20 consecutive patients with AES, scrub typhus was diagnosed in 6 (30%) based on scrub typhus immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immuno-sorbant assay (ELISA) (3).
