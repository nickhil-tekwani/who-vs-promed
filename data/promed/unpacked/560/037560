Rift Valley Fever, spreading westward into Kajiado and Kiambu districts
bordering the capital city of Kenya, has prompted the WHO and Kenya Health
Ministry to sound an alert to a possible outbreak in Nairobi.
RVF has already been reported in the Borana and Maasai pastoral
communities. The Nairobi provincial medical officer, Dr. Mary Vangai, said
no cases have yet been reported in the capital, but those who may come into
contact with infected animals and persons have been cautioned to wear
masks, gloves and other protective clothing. This includes slaughterhouse
workers as well as medical staff personnel. Surveillance of meat, milk and
animal products is being increased.

infection being brought in by bus (passengers). - Mod.MHJ
