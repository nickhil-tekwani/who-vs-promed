Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - United Arab Emirates - 28 May 2018
---------------------
On 16 May 2018, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported one (1) laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection to WHO.

Details of the case
The case is a 78 year old, male national, residing in Gayathi, UAE. On 13 May 2018, the patient presented to a hospital in Abu Dhabi with fever, cough and shortness of breath, which began on 4 May 2018. A lower respiratory/nasopharyngeal sample was collected on 14 May 2018 and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Sheikh Khalifa Medical Centre laboratory. He is currently in stable condition in hospital. The patient has hypertension and interstitial lung disease as underlying conditions. Investigation into the source of infection is ongoing. The patient reported recent travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and he owns a camel farm in UAE, which he visits on daily basis.

Globally, 2207 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 787 MERS associated deaths have occurred since September 2012. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of since 2012 through follow-up with affected member states. For more information, see link below.

Public health response
Contacts of the confirmed patient have been identified and are being monitored for the appearance of symptoms for 14 days from the last exposure to the confirmed patient. The Communicable Disease Department in UAE is in coordination with the animal authorities to initiate camel testing at the patient's farm in UAE.

[My thanks to Vicki Hansen-Landis and our Raportuer Marianne Hopp for submitting this report. I had checked the WHO DON in my early searches but this announcement had not been posted there at that time.

This represents the 1st case of MERS-CoV infection (and disease) reported by the UAE (United Arab Emirates) during 2018. In 2017 there were a total of 8 cases reported. According to the information available on this case, possible high risk exposures this individual had for disease include camel ownership with frequent contact, recent travel history to Saudi Arabia where the MERS-CoV continues to be reported, and a history of pre-existing co-morbidities which may have resulted in healthcare facility contact. Presumably studies of the camels in this individual's farm are underway. We await further information on results of additional laboratory and epidemiologic investigations.
