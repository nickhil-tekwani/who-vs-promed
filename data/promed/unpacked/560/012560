Experts to investigate Ozarks soldier's death
--------------------------------------------
The U.S. government is investigating whether the death of a Missouri
National Guardsman is related to 11 other incidents of severe
pneumonia among soldiers stationed in the Middle East. The Army
Surgeon General's Office confirmed Fri, 25 Jul 2003 that 2 teams of
epidemiology experts will investigate the 12 cases, 2 of which were
fatal. A National Guard specialist, aged 20 years, of Montreal,
Missouri, was one of the 2 troops who died.
Deploying such teams is rare, said Col. Robert DeFraites, the
surgeon general's senior preventative-medicine physician. "This
only happens 1 or 2 times every year."
A 2-person team has already been sent to the Landstuhl Regional
Medical Center in Germany, where the Missouri native was treated
before his death on 12 Jul 2003. An additional 6-person team is
gearing up to fly to undisclosed areas of Iraq, where other soldiers
began suffering from the illness [since the etiology of the respiratory
illness is not defined, it has yet to be shown that the etiology is
singular -Mod.LL]. The teams will study everything from the
soldiers' medical records and tissue samples to soil, water, and air
samples, DeFraites said.
"Nothing's going to be ruled out," DeFraites said. "When you go into
one of these things, you keep an open mind. There's enough
concern about these 2 fatal cases in such a short period of time" to
warrant the investigation. The colonel said they've not yet been
able to identify a specific bacterium or virus that could have caused
such severe cases of pneumonia, but added that 17 soldiers have
died from acute respiratory distress syndrome in the past 5
years.
"It's not entirely unheard of for this to happen," DeFraites said. It is
uncommon for pneumonia to cause a breakdown in organs other
than the lungs, he said. The parents of the Missouri native said they
were told their son's kidneys, liver, and muscles began to deteriorate
after he contracted the illness.
Without releasing specific numbers, DeFraites said there has been
a noticeable increase in pneumonia cases among soldiers since the
war in Iraq began. Under normal circumstances, the colonel said,
they expect to see 750 cases worldwide each year among troops.
Considering the number of troops in Iraq, DeFraites said the
incidence of pneumonia is exceeding military expectations: 10-20
cases among deployed soldiers each month. Most of the patients
have served in Kuwait and Iraq.
Since 1 Mar 2003, the 12 soldiers serving overseas in the Central
Command's Area of Responsibility have fallen ill with pneumonia and
had to be placed on respirators, the doctor said. 2 suffered from a
serious form of the illness called Pneumococcus pneumonia, but
lived. Many of those soldiers have recovered and are back to work,
but questions still linger as to what actually killed the 2 men.
The Missouri native was a heavy-equipment operator with the
National Guard's 203rd Engineer Battalion who fell ill on 30 Jun 2003
after returning to his camp in Baghdad. He had just completed a
mission that started 4 days earlier. Fellow soldiers found him
unresponsive in his tent. "Before he went to sleep, he told his friend
he was tired and had a sore throat," his mother said she was
told.
DeFraites said preliminary tests show the illness is not passed from
person to person and is not related to severe acute respiratory
syndrome, or SARS. Aside from bacteria and viruses, he said,
pneumonia can also be brought on by fungus, parasites, and
noninfectious causes such as exposure to metal dust. "We don't
think depleted uranium has anything to do with it," the colonel said,
referring to the element some contend led to soldier illness during
the first Gulf War. "There's nothing to suggest depleted uranium
would cause pneumonia in the soldiers we've seen."
DeFraites said the 12 soldiers' vaccination records will be studied,
as will their personal habits. "No vaccines cause pneumonia as a
side effect," he said. "You look for clues. Where were they? What
are their ages? There's probably more to be gained by looking at
their environment, blood, lab findings, and personal habits."
Infectious agents such as anthrax and smallpox will also be
investigated, the doctor said.
Regarding deployment of the epidemiology teams (a relatively rare
occurrence), DeFraites said units were sent in the summer of 2002
to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to investigate a series of murders
and to Fort Leonard Wood when the post experienced a
meningococcal outbreak in early 2002.
The Iraq team will augment medical military personnel already in that
country. It includes an epidemiologist, who will study the patterns of
disease and health in the targeted population; an infectious-disease
specialist, who will diagnose and prescribe treatment for infections;
a microbiologist; and laboratory technicians. The team will stay in
Iraq for about a month, DeFraites said.

We are wondering whether melioidosis (rodent glanders) or simple
glanders has been considered in the differential diagnosis list for
these patients. This would fit the sporadic nature of the cases in
question and could also explain the multiple organ involvement.
Finally, mortality can be high in untreated cases of glanders.

[Much more information regarding the illness(es) is needed to
before any conclusions are possible. It appears that bacteria that
grow on standard media are not at work here, since standard
cultures of respiratory secretions, blood, and possibly operative or
postmortem specimens were not helpful. The development of overt
cases over time and geographic areas will be very useful
in determining whether the cases are related to a point source.
Additionally, the histopathology (if available) can be very helpful to
assist in suggesting a cause, whether natural or human-spread
infection or toxin. The fact that the pneumonia was severe enough to
require respiratory assistance by a ventilator is worrisome. 2 cases
(of the 12 or additional) were reported to have pneumococcal
pneumonia.
Regarding _Burkholderia mallei_ (glanders) and _B. pseudomallei_
(melioidosis), both formerly in the Pseudomonas genus), as brought
up by Drs. Carter and Ronald; if good specimens were available, I
would expect these Gram-negative bacilli to be cultured, since they
are not fastidious in their growth requirements. Melioidiosis is a well-
known human disease generally acquired from aerosolization of soil
or water (1,2). It is primarily endemic and enzootic to Southeast
Asia and was not uncommon among US troops during the Vietnam
conflict. Cases indigenous to Australia, South and Central America,
and the Middle East (particularly relevant here) have been reported.
Primarily a lung infection, in its acute form, melioidosis presents 2-5
days after exposure with a rapidly progressive pneumonia, often of
the upper lobes and/or nodular lesions that coalesce. More chronic
disease may occur with slow progression and may resemble
cavitary tuberculosis. Recrudescence may occur several decades
after exposure (3).
Infection by _B. mallei_ in animals can cause a subcutaneous
infection referred to as farcy and if disseminated is referred to as
glanders. A century ago, glanders was a serious infection in horses
and could be associated with zoonotic, often fatal infections in
humans (4). The organism was used as a biological warfare agent
in World War I directed towards horses. Acute infection in humans
causes cutaneous abscesses and bacteremia with disseminated
visceral abscesses if acquired through the cutaneous route, or a
necrotizing pneumonia if inhaled. A case of laboratory-associated
_B. mallei_ infection reported 2 years ago manifested with
lymphadenitis and hepatic and splenic abscesses (4).
