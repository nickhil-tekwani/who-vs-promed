The Imperial County Public Health Department (ICPHD) confirmed on Wednesday [21 Aug 2019] that 2 El Centro residents have been infected with St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus.

ICPHD says these are the 1st human cases of SLE reported in California this year [2019]. The 2 individuals who were infected, both middle-aged, were admitted to a hospital in late July [2019] with severe headache, fever, and nausea and were diagnosed with viral meningitis. All individuals are said to be home recuperating in El Centro.

"Although we are nearing the end of the summer, we need to continue to stay vigilant and prevent mosquito bites," stated Stephen Munday, MD, health officer for Imperial County. "These human cases of mosquitoborne illnesses were caused by the bites of infected mosquitoes. The most important step we can take to prevent mosquitoborne viruses is to use mosquito repellent and eliminate mosquito-breeding sources where we live."

Enhanced surveillance for human cases of mosquitoborne diseases in the community are said to have been implemented by the ICPHD. They say even though the individuals were hospitalized in July [2019], the California Department of Public Health laboratory confirmed it to be SLE just within this last week, through the Department's active surveillance effort.

There were 3 mosquito pools that were said to be collected in the areas of Imperial, Holtville, and Westmoreland, where these pools tested positive for SLE.

There are no vaccines to prevent or medications to treat SLE. Some symptoms from SLE include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. If you think you or anyone in your household has symptoms, contact your healthcare provider.

[Cases of SLE virus-caused encephalitis occur sporadically in southern California and adjoining south western states, so the 2 cases this year (2019) in southern California are not surprising. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. The virus also is found in the south eastern USA with occasional incursions into the midwestern states. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that less than 1% of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infections are clinically apparent, and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/technical/symptoms.html).

Wild birds are the SLE virus reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report.
