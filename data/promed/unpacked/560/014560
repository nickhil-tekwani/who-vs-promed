The presence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) has been confirmed on a 5th
salmon farm within the existing ISA control zone in the south west of
Shetland. The farm is close to the farms confirmed as being infected
earlier in the year [2009].

In line with the Scottish Government's objective of eradication of
outbreaks of ISA, the farm will be depopulated as soon as practicable. This
will be done by the farm owners under the supervision of Marine Scotland's
Fish Health Inspectors to prevent the spread of the virus.

The controls to contain ISA within the zones established in south west
Shetland on 2 Jan 2009 will remain to provide protection for this and other
areas of Shetland. As ISA does not affect humans there is no risk to human
health, but it can cause serious damage to stocks of farmed Atlantic salmon
in seawater.

ISA is a notifiable disease under the Aquatic Animal Health (Scotland)
Regulations 2009 and it is Scottish Government's policy to attempt
eradication where outbreaks are confirmed. Symptoms of ISA in fish include
high mortality rates, darkening of the liver, severe anaemia, and visceral
haemorrhage.

Statutory movement restrictions have been placed on all sites in the
control zone centred on the infected farms and in a wider surveillance
zone. Other control measures include restrictions on movement of dead fish
from sites and to killing stations, for all sites in the control and
surveillance zone; and restrictions on movement of personnel and equipment
to, from, and at sites where there has been a confirmed or suspected case
of ISA.

There is no evidence to suggest that ISA virus has spread out of south west
Shetland.

[The following background is derived from the introduction to chapter
2.1.9. "Infectious Salmon Anaemia" in OIE's (World Organisation for Animal
Health) Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals, available online at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_summry.htm>.

"Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a disease of farmed Atlantic salmon
(_Salmo salar_) caused by the orthomyxovirus infectious salmon anaemia
virus (ISAV). ISA primarily affects fish held in seawater or fish exposed
to seawater. However, indications of disease outbreaks in fish held in
fresh water have also been reported. The disease may appear as a systemic
and lethal condition characterised by severe anaemia and haemorrhages in
several organs. The most prominent signs observed are pale gills,
exophthalmus, distended abdomen, and petechiae in the eye chamber; skin
haemorrhages in the abdomen and scale oedema may occur. The major findings
on post-mortem examination are circulatory disturbances in several organs
caused by endothelial injury in peripheral blood vessels. These clinical
manifestations of ISA are found in 4 organs: the liver, kidney, gut, or
gill. The liver manifestation is characterised by dark livers caused by
haemorrhagic liver necrosis. The kidney manifestation is characterised by
moderately swollen kidneys with interstitial haemorrhaging and tubular
necrosis. The gut manifestation is characterised by dark red guts caused by
haemorrhaging within the intestinal wall but not into the gut lumen. In
addition to being pale, the gill manifestation includes, in some cases,
accumulation of blood, especially in the central venous sinus of the gill
filaments. Lesions in the liver and gut are easily visible while lesions in
the gills and kidney are less obvious. In some ISA outbreaks, one of the
organ manifestations can dominate, while in other outbreaks all
manifestations can be found. In individual fish all manifestations may be
found to some extent. Outbreaks dominated by either the liver or kidney
manifestation appear to be most common. Haematocrit less than 10 in end
stages may be observed. Diseased Atlantic salmon presenting with anaemia
and circulatory disturbances should be examined for ISAV infection, if
there are no other, obvious causes to explain their condition.

"Mortality during an outbreak of ISA may vary significantly. Daily
mortality in affected net pens may initially range from 0.5 to 1 per cent,
but may increase with time. Cumulative mortality ranges from moderate to
high and may exceed 90 per cent in severe cases. The disease usually starts
in one net pen and it may take many months before the disease develops in
neighbouring net pens. Although natural outbreaks of ISA have been recorded
in farmed Atlantic salmon only, subclinically infected feral Atlantic
salmon, brown trout, and sea trout (_S. trutta_) have been identified. ISAV
has also been detected in 2 marine species, pollock (_Pollachius virens_)
and cod (_Gadus morhua_)." - Mod.AS
