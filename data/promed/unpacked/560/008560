A deadly outbreak of a highly contagious virus that's often fatal in horses has struck an equestrian farm in western Quebec.

The neurological form of EHV-1, sometimes called equine herpesvirus [or equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form)], has already caused the deaths of 2 horses and infected nearly half of the other 39 animals housed in stables at the Luskville farm.

Staff at Venturing Hills, already under added strain due to the coronavirus pandemic, now have new anti-contagion precautions to manage. They've been working around the clock to care for the horses, which are either owned by the training facility or boarded there by their private owners.

The illness seemed to come out of nowhere.

On 3 Feb [2021], Eddy, an otherwise healthy, young horse, began to stumble and lose strength. The neurological form of the equine virus had taken hold, and within hours, the animal had to be euthanized. Another horse died 11 days later.

"There was just no warning whatsoever," said Eddy's owner, Sophie Barbeau-O'Connor, who has since returned to Venturing Hills to help manage the outbreak.

Venturing Hills co-owner Rae Becke believes a horse purchased from stables in Toronto in January [2021] may have brought the virus to the farm.

With the mortality rate of the neurological form of EHV-1 somewhere between 30% and 50%, it's been a race to separate animals with clinical signs of the disease from the healthy ones so anti-viral treatment can begin.

Becke and her small army of staff and volunteers are working in shifts to monitor the horses and administer the drugs to the surviving animals.

At the same time, they must observe strict new protocols. It's not just nuzzling that's now forbidden: due to a horse's powerful sneeze, the animals require a physical distance of 11 m [36.1 ft] between them. Vapour barriers have been installed inside the barn, while stalls are deep-cleaned and disinfected regularly.

There's even a sort of equine ICU. "This is an isolation ward for our 2 most vulnerable," said Becke, pointing to a new addition to the stables

Veterinarian Carole Michon must also take extreme precautions to halt the further spread of the illness, including bagging her personal protective equipment and leaving it behind when she departs for the day.

"The day I'm there, I don't go anywhere else," she said. "It's a bit like COVID."

Michon noted that while older horses are generally thought to be more vulnerable, the death of 5-year-old Eddy shows how unpredictable the disease can be. Even horses that have been vaccinated for EHV-1 can contract the neurological form of the illness. The anti-viral drugs alone can cost more than CAD 6000 per animal.

Michon said the virus poses no risk to humans, but people can carry it on their hands and clothes.

Becke said for her and her team, February [2021] has been the longest month.

"It's terrifying for our horses, and terrifying for our staff who are fighting a virus we just don't know if we can beat or not," she said.

["Although most cases cause mild-to-moderate respiratory illness (rhinopneumonitis), EHV-1 infection occasionally leads to a life-threatening neurologic disease known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The mechanisms through which EHV-1, and even more rarely EHV-4, produce neurologic disease are not yet understood.

"A quick scan of the Equine Disease Communication Center database shows that EHM cases occurred this spring [2020] in California, Iowa, Indiana, and Maryland, even amid lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders. Regardless of where and how it occurs, a single EHV-1 case that is not promptly contained can easily turn into a widespread outbreak that puts all nearby horses at risk, and if EHM develops, the fatality rate can be high.

"EHV-1 and EHV-4 are respiratory viruses that, when inhaled, penetrate the epithelial cells lining the horse's airways, setting off an inflammatory reaction called rhinopneumonitis, which is not unlike the common cold in people. Signs range from mild to severe and can include cough, fever, nasal discharge, loss of appetite, and general malaise. Most sick horses recover uneventfully within a week or 2 with rest and supportive care.

"There are multiple strains of EHV-1 and -4, and some are more dangerous. These strains of EHV-1 and -4 can pass beyond the respiratory membranes, infect white blood cells called lymphocytes, and circulate throughout the horse's body. If the circulating viruses gain a foothold in the epithelial cells lining the uterus of a pregnant mare, the resulting inflammation can reduce the blood supply to the placenta, which in turn can starve the fetus and may cause an abortion. If the infection occurs later in the pregnancy, the fetus may survive but be born weakened. The greatest worry with broodmare bands is that one mare shedding the virus may trigger an 'abortion storm' as the infection sweeps quickly through the entire herd.

"EHM occurs when the EHV-1 attacks the cells lining the central nervous system, damaging blood vessels serving the brain and spinal cord. 'The neurologic impairment often doesn't occur until a little bit later in the course of the infection,' says Amy Johnson, DVM, DACVIM, of the University of Pennsylvania. Signs may include decreasing coordination, urine dribbling, weakness in the hindquarters, and loss of muscle tone in the tail. The weakness in the hindquarters may progress into a horse leaning against wall for balance, sitting like a dog, or full recumbency with an inability to rise.

"If the horse can be kept alive with supportive care, the inflammation will subside, and the damage will heal, at least to some degree. Many horses recover fully and return to normal work, while others may survive with some permanent effects.

"More severe cases -- especially if the horse is recumbent -- may be fatal. The statistics vary somewhat among different outbreaks, but on the whole, up to 30% of horses who contract EHV-1 during an EHM outbreak will develop EHM, and anywhere from 5%-50% of those EHM cases may require euthanasia. In some outbreaks, the number of horses with EHM who were put down approached 80%.

"The vaccine against rhinopneumonitis is listed as 'risk-based' by the American Association of Equine Practitioners, which means vaccination is recommended for horses who are most likely either to be exposed to fresh outbreaks of the illness or to suffer the worst consequences from the exposure. Typically, this means broodmares, as well as horses who may be exposed to broodmares at breeding farms, and horses who travel frequently to competitions and other venues where they will encounter many other horses.

"'We know that vaccinated horses, if they do become infected, will likely have milder respiratory signs, and shed less virus, and may be less likely to transmit the virus to other horses or contaminate the environment,' says Nicola Pusterla, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, of the University of California, Davis.

"Vaccinating against EHV-1 and -4 is advisable but doesn't eliminate the risk of the disease. That means that the best way to protect your horse against EHM is to limit his exposure to horses who might be shedding this highly contagious pathogen. The virus can also be passed from horse to horse via human hands and on clothing and shared tools and equipment.

"Even when all of your horses are healthy, it's a good idea to practice basic hygiene every day to avoid spreading any potential pathogens. Here are some basic rules:

"- Prevent close contact with strange horses. Always maintain some distance between your horse and others at trails, shows, clinics, and other venues. A distance of 8-10 feet is best to avoid exposing our horse to airborne droplets.
- Avoid shared water and equipment. EHV-1 survives for hours or days on hard surfaces and, under the right conditions, up to a few weeks in water. Do not share water buckets or use communal troughs when away from home, and avoid borrowing tack or grooming tools. At home, make sure each horse in your care has his own feed and water buckets, tack, and tools.
- Wash or sanitize your hands after working with each horse. Keep a supply of hand soap and/or hand sanitizers at your barn, and use them after handling each horse. Ask visitors to your barn not to go from nose to nose, petting each friendly face.
- Quarantine equine newcomers. Horses can incubate EHV-1 as well as other illnesses for a week or more without showing signs of infection, so it's a good idea to isolate new additions to your farm for 3 weeks before allowing any contact with others in your herd.

"A necessary complement to biosecurity measures is vigilance in looking for the earliest signs of developing illness in a herd and taking appropriate steps to control a potential outbreak. That means keeping a close watch on horses who travel and others who might be exposed to EHV-1.

"One of the hallmarks of EHV-1 infection is a biphasic (2-phased) fever: The horse might have a low-grade fever as soon as 24 hours or up to 6 days after initial exposure to the virus. The temperature may then return to normal, but the horse will spike a new, higher fever 6 or 7 days later. At that time, he may begin showing other signs of respiratory illness, including coughing, loss of appetite, a depressed demeanor, and nasal discharge.

"During the time between the 2 phases of fever, however, the horse may show no signs of illness, and yet he may be actively shedding the virus, risking the health of every other horse he encounters. That's why it's a good idea to monitor the temperature of any horse at risk of exposure to EHV-1 at least daily, or preferably twice daily. Candidates include horses who have recently returned from shows or competitions, as well as those who might have been exposed to sick horses during an outbreak.

"Call your veterinarian as soon as you identify an at-risk horse with a fever. [The vet] may suggest simply isolating the horse and letting the illness run its course. If, however, there is a risk other horses may have been exposed to a neurologic threat, your veterinarian may opt to run some diagnostic tests to distinguish EHV-1 infections from other illnesses, such as equine influenza. The definitive test for EHV-1 involves identifying the presence of the virus in a blood sample, nasal swab, or both using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate the viral DNA.

"Move the sick horse to a stall at the end of the aisle, away from the main doors, and leave at least one empty stall between him and his nearest neighbor. Set up fans to direct airflow over the isolation stall outward, through an open door or window. If other people visit your barn, post signs asking them not to approach or touch the sick horse.

"Turn out the sick horse in a separate space. Ideally, you'd place the sick horse in a separate area that is downwind from the main pasture and does not share a fence. Another option is to use temporary fencing to cordon off an area of the main pasture, but you'll need to make 2 barriers separated by about 10 feet to prevent contact between horses."
