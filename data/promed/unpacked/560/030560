On Friday [25 Jul 2008], 9 residents of the village of Ivanovskoye
were admitted to a hospital with a preliminary diagnosis of botulism.
There are 2 children among them. A 22-year-old person died. Omul
[fish] was bought privately and only the victims ate it.

[The Irkutsk region is located in the southern part of Eastern
Siberia and is a part of the Siberian Federal district of the Russian
Federation. Lake Baikal borders the Irkutsk region and the Buryat
Republic. Fish dishes from omul (fried, salted, or smoked) are
traditional Baikal delicacies. - Mod.NP]

The location of Irkutsk can be found on a map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk_Oblast>.

Omul is a salmonid from Lake Baikal in Russia, also known as
_Coregonus autumnalis migratorius_; a picture of the fish can be seen at
<http://www.bww.irk.ru/baikalfauna/baikalfauna01.jpg>.

The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here. Individual
cases of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a
cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E
botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products. - Mod.LL]
