Reno County's whooping cough outbreak continues, local health officials said, with the number of suspected pertussis cases now topping 70.

The persistent nature of the outbreak has health officials concerned that it won't be contained before school starts back up, creating fear of a potential "micro-outbreak," said Health Department Director Nick Baldetti. The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].

"I'm not confident to say we won't get any more," Baldetti said. "It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4."

Whooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the "whooping" sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.

As of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.

The Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, "but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts]," Baldetti said. "(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form."

While the pertussis vaccine offers "90 percent protection" from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.

"It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms," Baldetti said. "Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry." They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.

"There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools," Baldetti said. "When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group." Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults "and everywhere in between," he said. "We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster," he said. "It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window."

[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.

The news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).

The following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:

In the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Pertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML
