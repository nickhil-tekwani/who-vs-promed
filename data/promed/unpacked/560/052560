Salmon farmer Grieg Seafood has confirmed an outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) at a Norwegian site will mean it can harvest 3000 metric tons less salmon in 2017.

The Norwegian Veterinary Institute confirmed the outbreak at Grieg's site Kleppenes in Hammerfest [Finnmark county]. The site is currently home 1.3 million fish, with an average weight of 0.985 kilograms [about 2.2 lb], said Grieg.

As per Norwegian Food Safety Authority instructions, the harvest/destruction of all fish at this site must be carried out by [31 Jan 2017].

Grieg Seafood Finnmark has implemented a plan for the harvesting/destruction of all fish at this site "as soon as possible and feasible".

"Subsequently the site will be laid fallow and made ready for new smolt [young salmon] input spring/summer 2017."

Preliminary estimates indicate that this will yield a negative one-off effect on Q4 2016 accounts amounting to approximately NOK 25 million (USD 2.9 million).

Further estimates indicate that harvest volume for 2017 will be reduced by 3000 tons, it said.

"For 2018 reduced harvest volume early in the year will be offset by increased volume towards the end of the year, due to new smolt input at the abovementioned site."

Analysts, including those at Rabobank [Dutch multinational banking and financial services company], have already noted that Norwegian salmon supply growth is set to be limited in 2017.
