At least 19 people have tested positive for Q fever this year in Rostov Oblast, a Russian region that borders Ukraine, according to state-affiliated media RIA Novosti [https://ria.ru/20220707/ku-1801052385.html; in Russia]. While the farm-animal-borne infection can often be harmless to humans, it can cause serious problems for a significant portion of people.

"This year [2021], 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of coxiellosis [Q fever] have been registered in the Salsky and Remontnensky districts of the Rostov region... The last time this disease was recorded in the region was in 2001-2002," Svetlana Nenadskaya, head of the epidemiological surveillance department of the regional Rospotrebnadzor, told RIA Novosti.

Q fever is a bacterial infection caught from infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats. It's often picked up by humans by contact with infected animal blood, poop, urine, and fur. As such, it's most often seen in people who work with animals, like farmers and vets. People with weakened immune systems are also at a heightened risk.

People can fall sick with Q fever by consuming unpasteurized milk and other dairy products. It's also a bacterium that is considered a potential agent for a bioterrorism attack.

The infection is caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. Many people with the infection will not show any signs of illness, but some will resent with flu-like symptoms a couple of weeks after exposure. It's estimated that about half of the people with Q fever will experience flu-like symptoms, and 40 percent of them will require hospital care. Some infected people die, while others will suffer complications such as infection of heart valves (called endocarditis) or long-term chronic fatigue syndrome disorders.

Q fever is a problem for agriculture workers all around the world, but Australia is the only country where a Q fever vaccine is available to those working in the livestock industry. In the US, 178 acute Q fever cases were reported in 2019, as well as 34 chronic Q fever cases, according to the CDC.

[Q fever is a zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. The most common animal reservoirs for this organism are cattle, sheep, and goats. Infected animals excrete the bacterium in milk, urine, feces, and birth by-products, especially the placenta. Intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ that can be dispersed for a considerable distance to involve people living downwind from infected livestock.

Widespread transmission of Q fever was documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5-km (3 mi) high-risk zone (https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to spore-like particles the organism forms in mammalian cells as part of a biphasic developmental cycle (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949614/). These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and U.S. travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (ProMED post 20170416.4974554). Rarely, Q fever has been spread from person to person through blood transfusion, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sex, infected breast milk, clustered familial cases, and nosocomial infection during delivery or autopsies (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/58/11/e146/2895430 and https://www.cdc.gov/qfever/transmission/index.html).

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis, or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, or an arterial aneurysm (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

During pregnancy, Q fever may result in obstetric complications, such as placental infection, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal death, premature delivery, and maternal chronic Q fever (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/5/548/273863).

Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.

The tetracyclines (such as doxycycline) are considered the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865).

A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in "at-risk" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever).

If the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions.

We have not been told of the types of exposures that placed these 19 patients in Rostov Oblast at risk for acquiring Q fever, the source of this outbreak, or descriptions of the patients' clinical conditions. How diagnoses of Q fever were confirmed and how the patients were treated also are not stated. More information concerning this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Salsky, a district located in the south-central region of Rostov Oblast, and Remontnensky, a district located in the southeastern region of the oblast, are two of 43 districts in Rostov Oblast, Russia. Rostov Oblast borders Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts) to the west and can be located on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rostov+Oblast,+Russia.
