An emergency operations center has been established in the Kara-Kulja District of Kyrgyzstan to eliminate and localize anthrax, Press Secretary of the Ministry of Health Jyldyz Yerkinova told RIA Novosti on [Wed 15 Aug 2018]. Sanitary and preventive measures are being carried out, said Yerkinova.

Earlier, the Ministry of Health announced the hospitalization of 12 people in Kara-Kulja with suspected anthrax. All hospitalized people had had contact with meat of the infected animal.

"Anti-epidemic and anti-epizootic measures are being carried out in conjunction with the veterinary service of the district in order to localize and eliminate anthrax," said Yerkinova.

[Osh is in the base of the lower fork of the westernmost provinces of Kyrgyzstan; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg. Kara-Kudja is in eastern Osh near the Jalal-Abad border, where livestock is most common in the country; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KG/08/KaraKuldzha.html.

The area is a long narrow valley so I think we can presume that annual anthrax vaccination of the livestock is not an every day event. And this would explain why the report focuses on the human cases. - Mod.MHJ
