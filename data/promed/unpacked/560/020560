In a follow-up on the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreak in Iraq, the Iraqi Ministry of Health announced on Thursday [28 Jul 2022], a high number of infections and deaths from hemorrhagic fever.

In a brief statement, the ministry stated that the number of hemorrhagic fever cases rose to 273, while 49 deaths were recorded.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[As per the latest available report dated 7 Aug 2022, to date, 1085 suspected Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever cases were reported, of which 287 were confirmed by laboratory tests, with 83 related suspected deaths and 52 deaths among confirmed cases (representing 18.1% case fatality rate). All governorates reported confirmed cases, except for Sulaymaniyah.

A total of 7 confirmed cases of CCHF were reported in week 31, representing a decrease of 36% compared to the previous week. This is the lowest number of weekly confirmed cases since week 16. Deaths in weeks 30 and 31 remain the same (2 deaths per week). Thi-Qar is on the top of the list of the governorates affected by the CCHF outbreak, with 122 confirmed cases, representing 42.5% of the total cases. Missan, Babil, Wassit and Muthanna governorates also reported a significant number of cases.

Housewives, butchers and livestock breeders and traders represent 84% of those reported to be infected with CCHF across Iraq. No cases were reported among health workers. (https://iraq.un.org/index.php/en/194395-who-situation-report-iraq-week-31).

Coordination between health and agriculture sectors is being scaled up in the frame of One Health to ensure adequate prevention and control within the animal health sector as well as improving case management amongst humans.

To control the CCHF outbreak, it's paramount to strengthen the collaboration between the health and agriculture ministries and to operationalize the One Health initiative. This includes launching a comprehensive anti-tick campaign, enhancing case management, stopping the movement of animals from the affected governorates to other governorates, and increasing the awareness activities on slaughtering animals at home. - Mod.UBA]

Over the past 7 months, 42 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been confirmed in Georgia, and 2 patients have died. Amiran Gamkrelidze, head of the National Center for Disease Control, told Interpressnews that the number of cases of Crimean-Congo fever in the country has increased compared to previous years.

According to Amiran Gamkrelidze, Crimean-Congo fever is one of the most serious diseases. It is characterized by high fever, dry mouth, dizziness, vomiting, and redness of the mucous membranes. Jaundice may also be present, especially a rash with hemorrhage.

"In the past 7 months, 42 cases of Crimean-Congo have been confirmed. Unfortunately, we have 2 deaths. The mortality rate is 4.7%. The disease appeared in Georgia in 2009. We've had 1-10-15 cases each year and this year [2022] has the most confirmed cases with 42 cases. From 2009 to this day, 164 cases of Crimean-Congo and 21 deaths have been recorded in the country. In general, the mortality rate during these years was 12.9%.

"As you know, Crimean-Congo is one of the most serious diseases. It belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers. In different countries, the mortality rate ranges from 10 to 40%. Crimean-Congo is widespread in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey. We have it endemic. The main distribution regions are Samtskhe-Javakheti, Shida Kartli, in particular the Khashuri municipality. The Crimean-Congo fever is transmitted by ticks from various animals, especially domestic ones. ... The diagnosis is mainly established by PCR technology during the 1st 6-7 days. We're doing this today [2 Aug 2022] at the Lugar Research Center and then doing a serological test. Basically, hospital treatment is required. Our central infectious diseases clinic has good experience in treating Crimean-Congo. There is no specific vaccine or antiviral drug against this disease yet," said Amiran Gamkrelidze.

As for preventive measures, as Amiran Gamkrelidze explains, active educational work is being carried out jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture in the endemic zones of the Crimean-Congo. According to him, the population is actively informed, while animals are treated with anti-tick drugs.

Three more cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been confirmed in the Samtskhe-Javakheti region in southern Georgia.

Two patients are residents of the village of Tskruti, Akhaltsikhe municipality -- a 66-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman.

Also, the 1st case of CCHF infection this year [2022] was recorded in the neighboring Borjomi municipality. The disease was confirmed in a 45-year-old resident of the village of Sakire.

Since the beginning of 2022, 36 cases of CCHF have already been recorded in Samtskhe-Javakheti. One of the infected people died.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a particularly dangerous natural focal disease characterized by fever, severe intoxication, and hemorrhages on the skin and internal organs. It was first discovered in 1944 in the Crimea.

The disease is caused by a tick-borne virus. Vectors include wild and domestic animals (cattle, sheep and goats).

The virus is transmitted to humans either by tick bites or by contact with the blood or tissues of infected animals. Most cases of infection occur in people employed in industrial animal husbandry -- these are agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

*Akhaltsikhe literally "new castle"; it was formerly known as Lomsia and is a small city in Georgia's southwestern region (mkhare) of Samtskhe-Javakheti. It is situated on both banks of a small river named Potskhovi, which divides the city between the old city in the north and new in the south.
