MALARIA, BURUNDI
----------------------
A malaria epidemic has affected an estimated 276 000 people in the northern
highland districts of Burundi. As of the end of November 2000, 115 deaths
had been officially reported. Experts fear that the 4-month rainy season,
which starts in January, could result in a massive increase in cases. In
previous years malaria cases have doubled during this time. Data from
clinics in Kayanza province collected in mid-November show 21 000 cases of
malaria among a total population of 200 400 -- an increase of more than
500% compared to the same period in 1999.
Laboratory tests have shown that 80% of suspected cases from selected
health centers in Kayanza province were positive for _Plasmodium
falciparum_. Mobile clinics are treating patients in 10 provinces, and
homes are being sprayed with insecticide. A vast information campaign is
under way to encourage people to use insecticide-treated mosquito nets
where possible, and to ensure that anti-malarial drugs are taken correctly.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the cheapest available drug
-- chloroquine -- cannot continue to be used because of unacceptable levels
of resistance in the area.
WHO advocates the use of a single treatment of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to
treat the chloroquine-resistant malaria in this epidemic, in order to
ensure that as many cases as possible are treated with maximum compliance.
More than 1 million people die of malaria in Africa every year -- many of
them in epidemics such as this. The epidemic is thought to have been the
consequence of the October rains, and its circumstances are similar to the
most recent major malaria epidemic that occurred in the western highlands
of Kenya in the first part of 1999, affecting more than 1 million people.
Young children and pregnant women with lower levels of immunity are usually
the most likely to succumb to the disease in areas where levels of
transmission are high, however in epidemic-prone areas, all age groups are
vulnerable.

[Compared to our first posting on the malaria situation in Burundi, there
is now more information available on the slide positive rates and the
number of cases compared to 1999. Data from a single clinic indicate an
increase in _P. falciparum_ malaria cases of 500%. There is widespread
resistance to chloroquine in the area and the WHO recommends
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (fansidar) as the drug of choice for first line
treatment. The epidemic is primarily thought to be caused by unusually
heavy rains, but a reduced level of malaria control due to the political
situation probably plays a part too. One wonders if some of the cases may
be due to trypanosomiasis. ProMED-mail has previously reported on the
emergence of trypanosomiasis in the D R Congo (Trypanosomiasis, African -
Congo Dem.Rep. (Kinshasa) 19990318.0416) and it is likely that the epidemic
could spread to neighboring countries. In a situation with an large
increase in malaria cases many febrile patients will be treated for malaria
and if they do not respond this will be perceived as evidence of drug
failure. It should be kept in mind that febrile cases not responding to
treatment could be trypanosomiasis even if low levels of _P. falciparum_
are found in the blood films. - Mod.EP]
