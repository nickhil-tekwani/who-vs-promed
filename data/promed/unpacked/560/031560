Molecular Variability and Distribution of Cassava Mosaic Begomoviruses in
Nigeria

Several begomovirus species and strains causing Cassava mosaic disease
(CMD) have been reported from cassava in Africa. In Nigeria, African
cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) was the predominant virus in this important
crop, and East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), first reported from
eastern Nigeria in 1999, was also found occasionally.
A survey was conducted in 2002 to resolve the diversity of the virus types
present in cassava in Nigeria and to further understand the increasing
complexity of the viruses contributing to CMD. A total of 234 leaf samples
from cassava with conspicuous CMD symptoms were collected in farmers'
fields across different agroecological zones of Nigeria and subjected to
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with type-specific primers. In addition
and, to provide a full characterization of the viruses present, DNA-A
genome components of several viruses and informative genome fragments were
sequenced.
In Nigeria, ACMV proved to be the dominant virus, with 80 percent of all
samples being positive for ACMV. The East African cassava mosaic Cameroon
virus (EACMCV) prevalent in Cameroon and Ivory Coast was detected in single
infections (2 percent) and in mixed infections (18 percent) with ACMV.
There was no indication for other virus strains of EACMV present in the
country. The EACMCV samples collected showed a high nucleotide sequence
identity >98 percent and resembled the described sequence of a Cameroon
isolate (EACMCV-CM) more than an Ivory Coast isolate, EACMCV-CM[CI].
Evidence is provided that the EACMCV has reached epidemiological
significance in Nigeria.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), caused by cassava begomoviruses, is the
major constraint to cassava production in Africa. The fact that EACMCV has
reached epidemic status in Nigeria threatens the food security of that
country and is a setback to plant pathologists who have been contending
with control of CMD. The virus is present in many parts of Africa (Congo
Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Uganda and possibly in Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique).
Disease management strategies include cultural control (planting of
virus-free stocks and use of stem branches of moderately resistant and
resistant genotypes as sources of cuttings), development of resistant lines
through crosses between cassava and wild species (_Manihot glaziovii_) to
restore root quality and resistance to CMD, as well as lines derived from
Nigeria and local Nigerian genotypes. Moreover, breeding for the specific
needs of farmers in different regions of Nigeria should be considered.
