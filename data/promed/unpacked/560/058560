The Mongolian Ministry of Health confirmed 2 people -- a 38-year-old man and his pregnant wife, 37 -- died from plague after consuming raw meat and internal organs of a marmot. Their deaths left 4 children as orphans aged from 2 to 13. Dramatic pictures have shown at least one aircraft being met by anti-contamination emergency workers in a bid to prevent spread of the disease.

The local town of Ulgii (or Olgii) on the border with Russia was shut for quarantine by Mongolian health authorities and army. Several dozen tourists from all over the world had to alter their holiday plans and are now waiting to hear when they might be allowed to leave the town.

"Did you think that the plague was something from the Dark Ages? Us too!! We were just about to leave Ulgii to go deeper into Mongolia, but all exits of the town were shut and we were not allowed to leave. Half of the city is closed due to some plague-contaminated marmots!" wrote one traveler from Kemerovo [Siberia, Russia] who is marooned on the border with her husband. With a big group of fellow travelers from the US, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, and Germany, the Russians were besieging the authorities, desperate to leave the town.

The tragic family that died from plague got infected after eating raw kidneys of a marmot. An old Mongolian tradition says that a raw meat and internal organs of freshly killed marmot strengthens health, local media reported.

The Mongolian Ministry of Health stressed they did not think that the situation with the plague was critical or anywhere near epidemic. Yet there was no deadline announced for the quarantine which in the worst case scenario can last as long as 21 days.

Sanitary and epidemiological services in Russia's Altai and Tuva republics, which neighbour the Bayan-Uglii province of Mongolia, are on high alert since news broke of the plague outbreak.

In Uglii a total of 158 people who came directly or indirectly into contact with the couple are 'under supervision'.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. As it is only pneumonic plague that spreads person-to-person and close contact is required, if the tourists were not exposed to the couple, quarantine seems not needed.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse."

Maps of Mongolia: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/mongolia.pdf and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6456511,34282. The province of Bayan-Olgiy is in the extreme western part of the country. - Mod.LL

While foodborne transmission of _Yersinia pestis_ has been described (e.g, Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011 May; 139(5): 728-35. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that these bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LM]
