Since 2013, the Central African Republic has been experiencing at least one monkeypox outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. Since the beginning of 2018, outbreaks have been reported in 3 health districts, namely Bambari in the centre, Bangassou in the eastern part of the country, and more recently Mbaiki in the southwest.

In Bambari district, the outbreak was declared on 17 Mar 2018 in the Ippy sub-district after the index case developed symptoms on 2 Mar 2018. From week 9 (week ending 4 Mar 2018) to week 11 (week ending 18 Mar 2018), a total of 9 suspected cases with no deaths were reported from Ippy sub-district. Of the 7 samples tested, 6 were laboratory confirmed for monkeypox by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at Institut Pasteur de Bangui.

On 5 Apr 2018, the Ministry of Health was informed of a suspected case in Bangassou District, close to Bambari District where the index case was reported. The index case is a merchant who developed symptoms on 29 Mar 2018 in Dembia village, sub-district Rafai, who was hospitalized in Bangassou district hospital. From 5 Apr 2018 to week 20 (week ending 20 May 2018), 15 suspected cases including one death (case fatality ratio 6.7 percent) were reported in Bangassou; 3 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR from the 11 samples tested. The death was of a 33-year-old woman who died in a health facility 3 days after she developed a rash. Since 16 May 2018, no cases have been reported from Bambari and Bangassou districts.

In week 26 (week ending 1 Jul 2018), a 27-year-old female developed symptoms in Bangandou sub-district, Mbaiki district, and test results released on 30 Jun 2018 were positive for orthopoxvirus by RT-PCR. No epidemiological link has been established with cases from Bambari and Bangassou. Since 30 Jun 2018, a total of 5 suspected cases with no deaths have been reported from Bangandou. Among the 5 cases, 2 tested positive for monkeypox (RT-PCR).

Cumulatively, 29 cases of monkeypox with one death (case fatality ratio 3.4 percent) have been reported since 2 Mar 2018 in the Central African Republic, and 11 cases have been laboratory confirmed out of 23 samples tested. Among the confirmed cases, 63 percent (n=7) are female, and 45 percent (5) are aged between 20 and 30 years; 2 confirmed cases are age 5 and below.

Public Health Actions
- Active surveillance has been strengthened in the country, especially in Mbaiki health district, including case investigation of suspected cases and contact tracing.
- Capacity for case management and infection prevention and control measures have been enhanced at health facility level.
- Awareness campaigns have been conducted in the villages where the cases originated.
- Free healthcare has been provided to monkeypox patients in health facilities across the country.

Despite the poor security situation across the country delaying case investigation in Bambari and Bangassou, all cases have been investigated in these areas, with 75 percent tested for monkeypox and contacts being followed-up. This shows the extent of the efforts made by the national health authorities and partners to control the outbreak. However, the recurrence of monkeypox outbreaks in the country since 2013 and the emergence of a new cluster of cases in Bangandou, Mbaiki district in June 2018, where cases have been notified almost every year since 2013, underscore the need to continue raising awareness of the disease among the local population and strengthen preparedness measures at the national level. Inclusion of the animal health division in the response activities is also key in the containment of the outbreak, given the close contact of the affected populations with wildlife.

[Sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases continue to occur in the Central African Republic. The case fatality rate continues to be very low. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia and more recently in the Central African Republic (CAR). One wonders whether there is an MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in the CAR and the other affected countries. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
