Veterinary Department Receives Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccines
-------------------------------------------------
The Department of Veterinary Services has received 500 000 doses of
vaccines for foot and mouth disease, out of the 750 000 worth USD 1 million
ordered from Botswana to help contain the infection, which broke out in
Harare south recently. Veterinary Services principal director Dr Stuart
Hargreaves yesterday said the remaining 250 000 doses were expected to
arrive in the country later this week.
The vaccines, he said, were of enormous benefit to the department although
they would not be enough to cover the whole country, and there was
definitely the need to have a lot more.
He said the recent outbreak of the disease in Harare south had been
contained, while 71 000 cattle had so far been vaccinated in Mashonaland
provinces. Dr Hargreaves attributed the continued outbreak of the disease
to the illegal movement of cattle.
"There is a lot of illegal movement of cattle that is going on, with some
cattle being moved at night, while others are being moved through bushes,"
he said. "We appeal to cattle owners that they should abide by the rules
in which the cattle are only moved from one place to another following
approval by our department."
The veterinary service chief said the long-term solution to the outbreak of
foot and mouth disease was to carry out a national vaccination
campaign. There was a need, he said, for all the cattle in the country to
be vaccinated against the disease at least 3 times. Dr Hargreaves said the
primary and secondary vaccinations should be at least one week apart
followed by the booster vaccination after 6 months. High-risk areas needed
constant vaccination of cattle, he said.
There has been an outbreak of the foot and mouth infection in the country
over the last few months. The latest outbreak was at 2 farms in the export
zone south of Harare. It was suspected that the outbreak was linked to
previous outbreaks in Masvingo through illegal cattle movement. The
department last month suspended the movement of livestock in Chivi and Gutu
districts in Masvingo following an outbreak.
The Government has established a national taskforce comprising the
Department of Veterinary Services, farmers' unions, the Cold Storage
Company, Colcom, Dairibord Zimbabwe Limited, auctioneers, police and local
government officials to look into the problem.
Outbreaks of the foot and mouth disease have hit hard beef exports to the
European Union and South Africa. Exports to the EU were suspended in
August 2001 following the outbreak of the disease. Zimbabwe exported 9100
tonnes and 5000 tonnes of de-boned beef to the EU and South Africa
respectively before the ban.
This raked in about ZWD 2 billion [USD 2.5 million] to the country
annually, while exports within Africa and the Far East generated $2.5
billion [USD 3.125 million] in 2000.
