More Rift Valley Fever Cases Detected in Namibia
------------------------------------------------
New Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases have been diagnosed at 6 farms,
including one in the Erongo Region, in addition to farms in the
Hardap and Karas regions. The Directorate of Veterinary Services'
surveillance activities have led to the diagnosis on 6 other farms,
bringing the total number of farms to 14.

One of the newly identified farms is in the Erongo Region, 2 are in
the Karas Region, and 3 in the Hardap Region. Hardap has the highest
number of animals affected by the outbreak, where 11 farms are
affected. The outbreak in Erongo is the 1st of its kind.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry said measures to
contain the outbreaks are being implemented with the co-operation of
affected farmers. The total number of reported clinical cases so far
identified is 67 and 46 deaths from a total population of 9700 small
stock on the affected farms.

Clinical signs of infection include abortion, stillbirths, weakness,
bloody diarrhoea and difficulty in breathing. All cases (except on 2
farms where goats were affected) involve sheep.

"These findings indicate that the disease is not widespread and can
be described as sporadic at this stage. This situation can be
explained by the prevailing winter conditions that do not favour the
survival of the vectors (mosquitoes and biting flies)," a statement
by the Directorate of Veterinary Services read. The directorate,
however, warns farmers that the disease is likely to cause a
widespread epidemic during the next rainy season when vector activity
is expected to increase if animals are not vaccinated.

Farmers are therefore urged to vaccinate their livestock -- cattle,
sheep and goats -- during this time. Control measures that were
previously announced remain in place.

The importation of live ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, goats and
game into South Africa under a RSA veterinary import permit and
health certificate processed by a the Directorate of Veterinary
Services of Namibia will be allowed, provided the animals did not
pass through an RVF-infected zone during transportation.

Movement of livestock within the country is now permitted subject to
a movement permit issued by the Directorate of Veterinary Services,
except from farms that are under restriction for Rift Valley fever or
other reasons.

Farms under movement restriction due to RVF will be allowed to move
livestock 21 days after vaccination, while no live game animal will
be allowed to move from the restricted farms. The directorate
predicts that there is an increased risk of the epidemic during the
coming rainy season. All livestock in the Hardap and Karas regions
must be vaccinated before the onset of the rains.

Transporters intending to move animals through Botswana are expected
to vaccinate their livestock with an attenuated live vaccine at least
21 days prior to movement. Prior arrangements with the local State
veterinary office must be made to avoid problems.

In the meantime, farmers who have vaccinated or would like to
vaccinate their livestock, must inform their State veterinarian 3
working days prior to vaccination, provide proof of purchase of
vaccine and empty vaccine containers.
