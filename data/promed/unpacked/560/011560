More hepatitis C cases
----------------------
New Hampshire's Department of Public Health confirmed on Monday [2 Jul 2012] an additional 6 cases of hepatitis C connected to the outbreak at Exeter Hospital. There are now 27 total cases, one of which is the hospital employee believed to be the source of the outbreak.

The investigation is ongoing, but state officials believe that an employee used drugs in the cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) for recreational use and then returned the syringes to that lab, which were later used on other patients. Any patient of the CCL or its recovery room between 1 Oct 2010 and 25 May 2012, should have already received a letter from Exeter Hospital asking them to get tested. They can have their blood drawn at either Exeter Hospital or at additional testing sites set up in Hampton and Portsmouth.

Several legal cases, including a class action lawsuit, are either pending or looming against the hospital. A criminal investigation that involves the US Attorney's Office is also under way.

[The number of affected patients has increased to 27 as the screening programme progresses and is likely to rise even higher. It has now been confirmed that the infection was transmitted by a hepatitis C virus infected hospital employee using [pre-filled?] syringes to self-inject with medication intended for patients prior to their clinical use -- a surprising breach of disease control procedures. Neither the nature of the medication involved nor the identity and role of the hospital employee has been revealed so far.

It is likely that more cases of hepatitis C virus infection will be identified. Diagnosis of acute infection is often missed because the infected person has no symptoms. Common methods of antibody detection cannot differentiate between acute and chronic infection. The presence of antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) indicates that a person is or has been infected. HCV recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV RNA testing are used to confirm the diagnosis of HCV infection.

Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people exhibit no symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). When a chronically infected person develops symptoms, it may indicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of those with chronic infection develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
