Liberia: Lassa fever outbreak reveals health infrastructure gaps
---------------
An outbreak of Lassa fever in northern Liberia has already claimed at
least 7 lives and rural health workers say they lack drugs to treat
further illness, health authorities said Thursday [28 Sep 2006].
"Right now, we have clinical reports of about 10 confirmed cases of
Lassa fever in Nimba County out of which 7 died," Dr. Moses Pewu,
Liberia's chief acting medical officer, told IRIN.
Nimba is a densely populated county that lies between Guinea and Cote
d'Ivoire, where more than 10 000 returning refugees and internally
displaced people (IDP) have been resettled, according to the United
Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).
Lassa is a viral haemorrhagic fever known to be endemic in Liberia,
Guinea, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria. It probably exists in
other West African countries as well, according to the UN World
Health Organisation (WHO).
Humans become infected with Lassa from contact with infected rodents.
The virus can also be transmitted from one human to another through
direct contact with body fluids. Rural dwellers, especially those
living in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions, are
at greatest risk of contracting the illness.
Symptoms include headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and cough. Severe cases may progress to
bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract.
WHO says some studies indicate that 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa
fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. The overall
case-fatality rate is 1 percent to 15 percent among hospitalised
patients, WHO says. The illness is especially severe late in
pregnancy, with fetal loss and sometimes maternal death occurring in
more than 80 percent of cases.
Pewu said rural health workers in Nimba County do not have the
capacity to deal with the disease. "The drugs for treatment for Lassa
fever are in short supply," he said.
The humanitarian coordination section of the UN Mission in Liberia
(UNMIL) in its situation report early this week noted the poor state
of health infrastructure to deal with the illness.
"Some of the problems in tackling the disease include weak or
non-existent surveillance, monitoring and supervision, poor diagnosis
of the disease at some health facilities, and lack of adequate drugs
and treatment facilities," the report said.
The report, which quoted a joint team of the Ministry of Health and
WHO that visited villages in Nimba County, said "there is a high
presence of Lassa fever" in those areas.
Liberia's recent National Human Development Report said the country's
health facilities were in ruins. It said the country's 14-year civil
war destroyed 95 percent of health facilities, and that the number of
trained government doctors in the country had dropped from 400 to
less then 20 at the war's end in 2003.

[Borrowing from my colleague Mod. CP's comments in Lassa fever -
Nigeria (edo) 20050303.0654 "The disease is endemic in west Africa.
Lassa virus belongs to the old-world group of arenaviruses. Like all
arenaviruses, these viruses cause persistent infections of rodents
(_Mastomys_ sp. in the case of Lassa virus), usually without obvious
signs of disease.
Humans and other animals are infected through contact with rodent
excreta, particularly urine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to West
Africa and have been reported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and
to a lesser extent from Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic
areas of rural West Africa, subclinical infection is common, but
occasional outbreaks with high mortality rates have been recorded. - Mod.CP".
As mentioned in the above newswire, information from the CDC fact
sheet on Lassa fever: "The number of Lassa virus infections per year
in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with approximately
5000 deaths. Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because
surveillance for cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In
some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10 -16
percent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which
indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this
region." (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm>)
According to Gideon Online <http://www.gideononline.net>, In Liberia,
Lassa fever accounts for 10 to 20 percent of hospitalizations for
fever, and is common throughout the country - with the highest
incidence seen in Lofa, Nimba and Grand Cape Mount.

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated.
