Avian influenza: UK (England), mute swan, Weymouth city, Dorset, new outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 4 Feb 2008 Defra reported a 2nd outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1
avian influenza [HPAI] on the Dorset coast, UK.

The new outbreak refers to a mute swan euthanised in a nature reserve
(Radipole Lake) in Weymouth city and later tested positive for H5N1,
according to OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) follow-up
report No. 3 (OIE Ref: 6760, report date: 6 Feb 2008, UK [available
at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6760>].

This is the 10th infected swan found so far on the Dorset coast, but
some 10 km (6 mi) from the former site at Abbotsbury Swannery.
Defra's website does not reveal the precise locality or date, though
the fact that this swan was found in a town in an area of nature
protection and leisure signifies an important new development.

This was not unexpected, though it is noteworthy that there is no
direct connection between the 2 lakes.

Close to the new outbreak site there is a popular feeding place for
feral mute swans (no wild swans involved) and at least one lakeside
restaurant
(<http://www.weymouth-pictures.co.uk/dor/wey/rla/pic_lakebirds.htm>).

Defra does not address the question of how it will react to this
spread, nor did it forward any information when asked. The new case
apparently passed unnoticed by the public so far (including
ProMED-mail).

[We are grateful to Dr Peterman for this reminder. ProMED-mail's last
posting on the Dorset cases in swans addressed the 9th case; it was
published on 2 Feb 2008 (see 20080202.0420). Until the said date, all
infected swans were found in the location of the 1st outbreak. -

Bird flu spreads in southern part of Indonesia
----------------------------------------------
Bird flu is on the rise in East Lampung, Indonesia, prompting local
authorities to order backyard farmers to keep their chickens inside
their coops, local media reported on 13 Feb 2008.

The avian influenza virus had spread through 8 sub districts in East
Lampung District, Antara news agency quoted the head of the
Participatory Disease Surveillance (PDS) team, Dewanto, as saying.

The virus was detected earlier this month [February 2008] in 6 sub
districts, but [now] it has struck poultry in 12 villages in 8
sub districts, Dewanto said, adding it is possible that the poultry
will spread the virus to other sub districts.

Lampung is a province of Indonesia, located on the southern tip of
Sumatra Island. East Lampung District, Central Lampung District, and
Bandarlampung city of the province have seen several bird flu
outbreaks over the past few years.

Vets refuse to cull
-------------------
In a significant development that will affect the government's
proposal of culling of birds within 5-km (3-mi) radius of Orissa-West
Bengal border to prevent bird flu in the state, the Orissa Veterinary
Association (OVA) decided not to participate in the killing.

A decision to this effect was taken in the emergency meeting convened
today [13 Feb 2008] to review the present situation. The meeting was
chaired by vice-president of OVA Dr Nayan Singh Majhi.

The killing of healthy poultry is quite unethical for a veterinarian
and it contravenes the principle of veterinary medical ethics, the
association unanimously felt. "All sorts of precautionary measures
have been taken since last month and the investigations so far
have found not a single bird flu case, there is no need of mass
culling of birds", said the general secretary Dr Muktikanta Bhuyan.
"Even the samples from Kalahandi district did not contain bird flu
virus," he added. The association decided to move to the state
government in this connection.

[The information above can serve as an update on the current policy
of the Indian authorities to prevent/control H5N1 in Orissa. Killing
animals along the (vulnerable) border, creating a "cordon sanitaire,"
is an explainable but controversial disease-prevention measure. It
would have been expected from the Orissa Veterinary Association to
propose alternative measure(s); such as, vaccination?! - Mod.AS

Bird flu strikes another Bangladesh district
--------------------------------------------
Bird flu has spread to another district in Bangladesh despite efforts
by authorities to control it, officials said on Wednesday [13 Feb
2008], bringing the number of affected districts to 41 out of 64.

Health workers culled nearly 1100 fowl after tests confirmed some
chickens had died from the avian influenza virus in western Meherpur
[Khulna], livestock officials said.

The H5N1 virus, first detected in Bangladesh in March last year
[2007], was quickly brought under control through aggressive
measures, including culling. But it reappeared a few months ago
apparently because of lax follow-up monitoring, experts say.

So far no human infections have been reported in Bangladesh, a
densely populated nation with millions of backyard poultry and
thousands of chicken farms.

The government has raised compensation for poultry farmers to
encourage them to report and kill sick birds as part of efforts to
stamp out the outbreak. Nearly 600 000 birds have been culled across
the country against the virus since March 2007, but it continues to
spread and now covers nearly two-thirds of the country of more than
140 million people.

Officials blame lack of awareness among poultry breeders and
non-compliance with warnings by the health ministry as the main
reasons for the spread of the virus.
