Tick-borne encephalitis was first reported in Hungary in 1977. [1,2] The disease is most common in forested, hilly areas of the western and northern regions. Highest incidence is reported from western Hungary, west of the Danube; the region surrounding the Balaton extending to the Austrian and Croatian borders; the areas to the west and north of Budapest, along the border to the Slovak Republic. High rates are encountered in the areas surrounding Zala, Somogy, Vas (western Hungary) and Nograd (northern Hungary). Sporadic cases occur on the river Theil, the areas east of Miskolc. Disease rates correlate with proximity to a forested habitat within a 2500-meter radius of a town or village.

The incidence of TBE in Hungary has decreased somewhat since the 1990s and continues to be similar to those of bordering countries (see graph. [3] http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/TBE-Hungary.png

In the second graph, I have compared the incidence of TBE with those of other arthropod-borne diseases in Hungary.

Seroprevalence surveys:
26.5 per cent of cattle, 7.0 per cent of sheep, and 0.0 per cent of horses in northeastern Hungary (2008 publication).

Notable outbreaks:
2007 - An outbreak (25 cases) was associated with consumption of
raw goat milk.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for this interesting overview of the TBE overview in Hungary. The recent report of TBE virus infections in Hungary from consumption of raw cow's milk (ProMED-mail archive no. 20120323.1079163) is part of an ongoing story that has been going on in Hungary for 35 years.
