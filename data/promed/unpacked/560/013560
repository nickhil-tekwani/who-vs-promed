Anthrax cases among humans have so far spread to nearly 1/6th of the
districts of Bangladesh since the south Asian country recorded the
1st virus-infected patient on 18 Aug 2010, official data showed
Tuesday [14 Sep 2010]. The latest figures, released by Bangladesh's
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) on
its website on Tuesday, showed the disease spread to 10 out of 64
districts of the country.

The IEDCR confirmed 13 new cases in the last 24-hours until Tuesday
[14 Sep 2010] morning, bringing the total number of the infected
people to 508.

Following the quick spread of anthrax to more new districts, the
Bangladeshi government last week announced a red-alert across the
country and formed committees in all the 64 districts to coordinate
all efforts of anthrax prevention and treatment. Mahmudur Rahman,
chief of the IEDCR under the country's Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, had earlier said almost all the patients, who are suffering
from cutaneous anthrax, have either consumed meats or come in contact
with anthrax infected ill animals.

Anthrax is closing in on Dhaka, having infected 9 people in
Narayanganj, the nearest district some 20 km south of the capital,
according to the district's top medical office. With the latest
cases, at least 504 people have so far been infected with the disease
[See prior post showing 508 affected as of 14 Sep 2010. - Mod.MHJ].

Dr Zinat Afroj of the Narayanganj Civil Surgeon's Office said on
Monday [13 Sep 2010], at least 9 people have been confirmed to have
contracted the acute disease at Araihazar Upazila in the district.
They are a 38-year-old man and his 8-year-old son, a 42-year-old man
and his son aged 20 and daughter aged 7, and others aged 28, 8, 7,
and 35 of Raghunathpur village under Mahmudpur Union of the Upazila.
They have been admitted to the Upazila health complex.

Civil surgeon Mohammad Matiar Rahman, who visited the village, said
those infected have already been vaccinated. "We're even keeping a
tab on the families who consumed meat of an ailing cow." He said
there is nothing to be panicked about, since the disease does not
spread by human contact. Matiar said sufficient vaccines are in
stock. Afroj said she and Upazila livestock officer Dr Sakhawat
Hossain also visited the village and treated the patients.

A resident inhabitant of the village said he had bought a cow from
Kalyandi Bazar 2 days before Ramadan had started. He then found that
the cow was sick and took it to the local livestock hospital. He said
he slaughtered it, as its condition deteriorated even after
vaccination. Later, he distributed the meat among 40 families of the
village, and many of them fell sick.

[This latter report is included because of the history of the cow
that was slaughtered. Livestock vaccination takes 8 days before any
benefits are seen. Thus, vaccinating a sick animal is doing nothing
for the animal. Cattle are moderately resistant to the infection, but
not to getting infected, and so treating them with suitable
antibiotics, e.g., oxytetracycline, can result in saving them. It
seems that the Raghunathpur village veterinary clinic was unaware of
this. More likely, the clinic was manned by a veterinary assistant,
and the situation was compounded by the poverty of the local
livestock owners. From the accounts we have seen, i.e. "those
infected have already been vaccinated," vide supra, it would appear
that human patients are also being treated with vaccines, whether
with or without antibiotics is unclear, though high success rates are
claimed. - Mod.MHJ]

Cattle and livestock sales in Bangladesh have plummeted following a
major outbreak of human anthrax. Nearly 500 people have caught the
disease, which is not lethal if treated promptly.

At the Gabtali cattle market, one of Dhaka's largest, livestock
trader Najrul Mohajon said sales are just 1/10th of what they should
be at this celebratory time -- Eid -- though the capital has yet to
report any cases.

Around 75 percent of Bangladesh's 160 million inhabitants rely on
livestock to some degree for their livelihood, the government says.

"This is not the 1st time that anthrax has been detected in cattle in
Bangladesh, but unfortunately this year [2010], we have found it in
humans," Livestock Department Deputy Director Mosaddek Hossain,
within the Ministry of Fisheries & Livestock, told IRIN.

Current supplies of the livestock anthrax vaccine are sufficient, the
government said, which has also launched a massive public awareness
campaign to warn people against consuming infected beef and prevent
cattle traders from inadvertently spreading the disease when
disposing of infected animals.

Mat Yamage, chief technical adviser at the Food and Agriculture
Organization, told IRIN 270 000 animals have already received the
vaccine, and work is underway to administer a further 500 000
vaccinations in affected areas.

"Due to the specific conditions existing in Bangladesh, it is neither
easy nor practical to dispose of affected animals using incinerators,
which is the safest way to contain the disease. So we are teaching
cattle owners to bury the dead animals very deeply underground and to
isolate any animals suspected of having anthrax. We are watching
things very carefully because we have found that some farmers are
disposing of animals in rivers and lakes, which is very risky," he
said.

Meanwhile, for those whose livelihoods depend on livestock, the
fallout remains unclear.
