When an avid fox hunter in Surry County died about a year ago, his
pack of 15 foxhounds was distributed among his friends. Then, one by
one, the dogs developed a mysterious illness manifested by mange and
severe weight loss. Blood tests confirmed it was leishmaniasis.
The disease is caused by a parasite carried by the tropical sand fly,
which is about one-tenth the size of a mosquito. Sand flies avoid
direct
sunlight and live in moist areas rich in organic debris. They emerge
to
feed at dusk and through the night, eating protein-rich blood and
drinking sugar-rich plant juices. The particular type of sand fly
spreading the disease isn't known to be in this country.
Eventually, all 15 of the hounds came down with the disease and were
euthanized. About a month ago, offspring from the original pack began
to show symptoms.
The disease is common in Europe and the Middle East, especially in
Saudi Arabia. Natural hosts include a variety of rodents, small
mammals, dogs, and humans.
It's important to remember that with proper antibiotics the disease
can
be successfully treated in humans, said Dr. F. Garrett Edwards, who
took over the treatment of the newest cases. "So far, the foxhounds
are
the only ones we've seen with positive titers," Edwards said. "In the
dogs, you can make the animal feel good and look healthy, but they are
still a carrier."
If it is passed to humans, it's especially dangerous to children and
adults with weak immune systems, he said. If untreated, the disease
can
cause maiming and death.
Although the sand fly carrying the parasite may not be in this
country,
our native sand flies could have picked it up, said Dr. Peter Schantz,
veterinarian and epidemiologist with the division of parasitic
diseases
at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
"It's essentially in foxhounds now, and we think it's being
transmitted
from dog to dog,'' said Schantz. "The greatest concern we have is it's
a
disease that infects people, too."
The CDC has tested blood samples from more than 4000 registered
foxhounds in this country and Canada, Dr. Bruce Akey, Virginia state
veterinarian's office said. Of that number, between 2 and 3 percent of
the animals tested positive, most of them in Virginia. Of about 80
tests
done on humans nationwide, none have been positive.

[What's new in this report is that the offspring are coming down with
the disease after all the parents died. I'm going to stick my neck out
on this one. To me it's obvious that the infection is not sand fly
transmitted, because only foxhounds are coming down with it -- if it's
carried by sand flies, why aren´t other breeds living nearby, which
they
certainly also feed on, coming down with it? Why should foxhounds be
uniquely
susceptible?
My hypothesis is that some foxhounds were sent to the Middle East,
perhaps to a dog show, & became infected there by sand fly bite before
returning to the USA. Foxhounds have a unique ecology in that they
live in packs & are often exchanged between hunts, which give perfect
opportunities for the spread of disease. Following the observation in
a previous post in this thread that visceral leishmaniasis can be
transmitted in humans sexually and congenitally as well as by sand fly
bite, the same thing could be occurring with the foxhounds. Meaning
that there is no threat to human health. - Mod.JW
