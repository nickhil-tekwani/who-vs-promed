Re-emergence of Zika virus in travellers to Thailand - 'forgotten but not gone'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International Society of Travel Medicine, wishes to highlight 5 cases of recent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in returning travellers from Thailand.

We report 5 cases of ZIKV infection in travelers returning from Thailand (3 females, median age 30 years [range 28-70]). All travelers were tourists who had travelled to Thailand for a median of 15 days (range 7-29) between 16 Mar 2022 and 2 Jun 2022. Symptoms commenced a median of 8 days (range 6-21 days) after arrival in Thailand. The following areas were visited: Phuket, Phi Phi Island, Koh Samui, Khao Lak, Bangkok, Chang Mai. All presented to a post-travel clinic (UK, Israel, Germany) within a median of 7 days of symptom onset (range 2-22). Most (4/5) travelers reported fever, and all reported a maculopapular rash. The diagnosis of ZIKV was made based on detection of ZIKV RNA in serum (n = 2), urine (n = 1); and in one case documented seroconversion. A further probable case was diagnosed in the partner of a confirmed case based on positive ZIKV IgM on day 4 of illness, and a compatible clinical and travel history. Dengue PCR and serology was negative in this patient, and they declined to return for convalescent ZIKV serology. Notably 4/5 travelers were of child-bearing age, although none were pregnant or trying to conceive.

With relaxing of COVID restrictions, travel to Thailand has markedly increased, returning towards pre-COVID numbers. ZIKV is known to be endemic throughout Thailand. However, according to the national surveillance programme, ZIKV infections have declined over recent years in Thailand; with only 12 cases reported to the Thai Ministry of Health between 1 Jan 2022 and 31 May 2022. These ZIKV infections in returning travellers indicate ongoing transmission of ZIKV in popular tourist areas in this country. Given that only 20% to 50% of ZIKV infections are thought to be symptomatic, it is likely that there have been many more infections, both in travellers and in the Thai population. ZIKV infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis in returning travellers with fever or rash and the potential risk of infection and prevention measures discussed during pre-travel consultations. Prevention measures include bite prevention during day-light hours, when the mosquito vector is active, and a discussion regarding barrier contraception for women of child-bearing age, and their partners.

[ProMED thanks Victoria Johnston and colleagues for forwarding this report. It has a serious message: although there may not be obvious outbreaks of Zika virus infection in tourist destinations where it has occurred in the past, this virus should not be ignored. This includes not only Thailand, but all tropical areas around the world. Travelers should be aware that although the risk of Zika virus infection is small, it is not zero. Pregnant women and their partners should be particularly aware because of the risk of mosquito or sexual transmission of the virus with subsequent miscarriage or teratogenic effects on the fetus. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measure is avoidance of bites by vector mosquitoes and of sexual activity if one of the partners is febrile. - Mod.TY
