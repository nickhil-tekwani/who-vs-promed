During the current year [2008], starting with epidemiological week
[EW] 06 [3-9 Feb 2008] the Alto Amazonas network began to report
cases of dengue imported into the area coming from Iquitos (5 cases)
and Tarapoto (4 cases), and between EW 10 and 17 [2 Mar - 26 Apr
2008], an increase in cases began to be observed in Yurimaguas city,
coinciding with the rainy season, which is usual and persistent in
this area. In EW 18 [27 Apr - 2 May 2008], there has been a reduction
in the number of dengue cases, with a total of 98 cases of classical
dengue and one probable dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) case in
Yurimaguas. The NMRCD [USA Navy laboratory in Lima] confirmed
isolation of dengue 4 [virus] from a patient living in Yurimaguas.

Health officials are warning the public to make sure their homes and
gardens are free of stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes from
breeding, after the mosquito-borne dengue fever virus claimed 3 lives
in [the southern provinces of] Champassak and Saravan this year [2008].

The National Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology issued the
warning in a bid to reduce the incidence of dengue fever in the wet season.

So far this year [2008], there have been 581 cases of dengue fever,
including 3 deaths: 2 in Champassak and one in Saravan province.

Dr Phengta said the number of people falling ill with dengue fever
was increasing gradually every week. He attributed this to increasing
rainfall and higher incidence of the virus in neighboring countries.

More than 3000 children have dengue fever in Ho Chi Minh City, twice
the number last year [2007], the city's Health Department reported
Tuesday [20 May 2008].

Dr. Bich Lien, head of the Children Hospital 1's Dengue Fever
Department, said last week she was admitting 20-30 patients daily,
but that had gone up to 40-60 now.

Children Hospital 2 is treating around 60 children at the moment.

Mekong Delta provinces too have been hit hard by the disease, with
more than 10 000 cases having been reported so far this year [2008].

The Viet Nam Drug Administration last week instructed local health
agencies and drug firms to stock up on drugs to respond to the
current escalation of dengue fever.

[More than 3000 cases of dengue fever in children have been reported
since the beginning of the year (2008), with reports of 40 to 60
patients being seen per day in the Children's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh
City. Almost 900 cases of dengue fever had been reported in Ca Mau,
Bac Lieu and Can Tho provinces in the Cuu Long (Mekong Delta) area in
the prior PRO/MBDS posting on dengue in Viet Nam.

More information from reliable sources on the current dengue
situation in the other regions of Viet Nam would be highly appreciated.

The Centre for Health Protection today [20 May 2008] confirmed the
year's 12th imported dengue fever case involving a 39-year-old man
who traveled to the Maldives 5-13 Apr 2008. He was admitted to St
Teresa's Hospital on 28 Apr 2008 and has been discharged.

He came down with a fever, sore throat, joint pain and a rash on 22
Apr 2008. His 4 travel companions also had similar symptoms. Of them,
a 30-year-old man was confirmed to have dengue fever on 30 Apr 2008.

[New reports of continuing dengue transmission on the Maldives is of
concern. This is an additional imported case of dengue acquired in
the Maldives 3 weeks after the last reported case imported into Hong
Kong (see ProMED archive no. 20080505.1542). The Maldives had a
serious chikungunya epidemic in 2006 (see ProMED archive no.
20061224.3598), and it seems likely that there is a significant
population of _Aedes_ dengue virus vectors still there that could
support a serious dengue outbreak.
