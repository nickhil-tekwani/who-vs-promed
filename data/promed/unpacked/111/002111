The Netherlands Health Ministry said Thurs 18 Mar 1999 that there have been
50 cases & 13 deaths so far from legionellosis associated with the
Westfriese Flora show in Bovenkarpsel, about 40 miles north of Amsterdam, in
February 1999, & as many as 200 visitors have reported pneumonia-like
symptoms compatible with the disease.
This is an increase from the 33 cases & 9 deaths reported earlier this week.
