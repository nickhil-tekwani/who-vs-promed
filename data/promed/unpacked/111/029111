The West Nile virus has been detected again in British Columbia. 2 horses recently tested positive in the Cache Creek and Ashcroft area. Dr John Twidale, a veterinarian specializing in the treatment of horses, says these are the 1st confirmed cases this year [2014]. "We've been looking for it for the last 5 years since it appeared in the Prairie provinces and we've expected it to arrive either from the Prairies or from Washington State [USA], so it's just a matter of time and this seems to be our time."

The virus is more dangerous for animals than humans because it causes muscle tremors and in severe cases, the inability to stand.
A vaccine has been available for the last 5 years.

[It is significant that the veterinarian says they have been looking for it, and there have been no cases. It makes me immediately wonder if it has been there, but not reported because the horse was never treated, and a veterinarian never called out? We will never have the answer to that question. But hopefully they have been doing sentinel surveillance for the last few years.

Owners should be vaccinating their animals regardless of the circulation of the virus.

It is also interesting that they expected this virus to arrive from Washington state in the USA [presumably by cross-border bird movements. - Mod.JW].
