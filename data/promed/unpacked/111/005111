In the recent posting on pertussis in USA the moderator commented that
"immunization of adults with the acellular pertussis vaccine, reasonably
well tolerated in this group (unlike the old killed whole cell product),
may be the answer". The following 2 trials also show that aP is safe and
immunogenic in adults.
Christie CD, Garrison KM, Kiely L, et al: A trial of acellular pertussis
vaccine in hospital workers during the Cincinnati pertussis epidemic of
1993. Clin Infect Dis 2001;33:997-1003
Halperin SA, Smith B, Russell M, Hasselback P, et al: An adult formulation
of a 5-component acellular pertussis vaccine combined with diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids is safe and immunogenic in adolescents and adults. Vaccine
2000;18:1312-9
However according to Weingart et al (Weingart CL, Keitel WA, Edwards KM,
Weiss AA: Characterization of bactericidal immune responses following
vaccination with acellular pertussis vaccines in adults. Infect Immun
2000;68:7175-9) booster immunization of adults with acellular pertussis
vaccines was not found to increase bactericidal activity over
preimmunization levels. Identifying ways to promote bactericidal immune
responses might improve the efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccines.
The following 2 recent editorials also address relevant issues:
Crowcroft NS, Britto J: Whooping cough a continuing problem. BMJ
2002;324:1537-1538 -
"Policy makers need more information about the natural history of pertussis
in adolescents and adults to determine the potential benefits from booster
vaccination in these groups irrespective of any possible benefit to infants
through reducing transmission.
Robbins JB, Schneersonn R, Trollfors B: Pertussis in developed countries.
Lancet 2002;360:657. -
"Pertussis in children is at all-time lows and immunisation rates at
all-time highs with aP vaccines. More susceptible adults, due to lower
vaccination rates in the 1980s, and increased awareness and better
diagnostic methods account for the increase in pertussis. DTaP should
replace DT in adults to eliminate pertussis from the entire
population."
