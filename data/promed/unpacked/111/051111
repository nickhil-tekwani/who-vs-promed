-----------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to thank the ProMED-mail readers who brought to my attention the misleading statements mistakenly included in my comments ([4] Bolivia: atypical case), taken from the organization The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC); specifically, "Published medical research indicates that vaccine failure due to waning immunity can occur, despite multiple doses of measles vaccine. Measles vaccine-acquired immunity is reported to wane in at least 5% of cases within 10 to 15 years after vaccination. Moreover, exposure to natural measles may be necessary for the maintenance of protective antibodies in vaccinated persons. The Vaccine Research Group at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic reports that up to 10% of persons who receive 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine fail to develop protective humoral immunity, and those antibody levels wane over time, which can result in infection." (National Vaccine Information Center https://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Measles/measles-vaccine-effectiveness.aspx).

The ProMED-mail post referenced above mistakenly posted this incorrect information from NVIC. This organization was founded under the name Dissatisfied Parents Together (DPT) in 1982. It has been widely criticized as a leading source of fear-mongering and misinformation about vaccines. While NVIC describes itself as the "oldest and largest consumer led organization advocating for the institution of vaccine safety and informed consent protections," it promotes false and misleading information including the discredited claim that vaccines cause autism, and its campaigns portray vaccination as risky, encouraging people to consider "alternatives" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vaccine_Information_Center).

The comments were made in response to the atypical case of measles reported in Bolivia in a 29-year-old who had been vaccinated as a child. While this may happen even after the full 2-dose immunization regimen, it is a rare occurrence.

The recommended site to read scientifically accurate information backed by data in the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) on recommendations about the efficacy of the MMR vaccine is CDC, "How well does the MMR vaccine work?" which states:
"MMR vaccine is very effective at protecting people against measles, mumps, and rubella, and preventing the complications caused by these diseases. People who received 2 doses of MMR vaccine as children according to the US vaccination schedule are usually considered protected for life and don't need a booster dose. An additional dose may be needed if you are at risk because of a mumps outbreak. One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella. 2 doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps."... [Thus,] about 3 out of 100 people who get 2 doses of MMR vaccine will get measles if exposed to the virus. However, they are more likely to have a milder illness and are also less likely to spread the disease to other people (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html).

According to Amy Wishner, MSN, RN, APHN-BC, Program Director, PA Immunization Coalition (PAIC), the study cited in the comment above from the Vaccine Research Group at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic is considered an outlier. Immunity to measles disease following 2 age-appropriate doses of MMR vaccine is almost always lifelong and does NOT require ongoing contact with wild measles disease to be effective.

What is most important to recognize is the success story of the measles vaccine following its implementation in 1963. According to the CDC, in the decade before 1963, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year. Also each year, among reported cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from measles (https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). How can anyone question the value of vaccine immunization, not only to measles, but also polio, diphtheria, Ebola, and now SARS-CoV-2? - Mod.LK
