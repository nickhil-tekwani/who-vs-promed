National Scrapie Eradication Program fiscal year 2017 report: highlights
-------------------------------------------------------------
Samples for scrapie surveillance were collected from targeted sheep and goats at 206 sites in 41 states. Over 42 000 sheep and goats were tested for scrapie in the fiscal year 2017 (1 Oct 2016 to 30 Sep 2017).

No sheep have tested positive for classical scrapie since April 2016 (see: ProMED-mail. Scrapie, sheep - USA: (TX) 20160427.4185993).

Other than one goat in a herd quarantined since 2005 and depopulated in 2017, no goats have tested positive for scrapie since February 2015.

No classical scrapie infected or source flocks were designated in the fiscal year 2017.

[This is great news, and USDA/APHIS and the relevant state agencies are to be congratulated.

For those unfamiliar with scrapie, an ovine and caprine TSE disease, the following commentary by my colleague TG may be of value:

"Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats. It is among a number of diseases classified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Infected flocks that contain a high percentage of susceptible animals can experience significant production losses. Over a period of several years the number of infected animals increases, and the age at onset of clinical signs decreases making these flocks economically unviable. Female animals sold from infected flocks spread scrapie to other flocks. The presence of scrapie in the United States also prevents the export of breeding stock, semen, and embryos to many other countries.

"The agent responsible for scrapie and other TSEs is smaller than the smallest known virus and has not been completely characterized. There are 3 main theories on the nature of the scrapie agent: (1) the agent is a prion, which is an abnormal form of a normal cellular protein, (2) the agent is a virus with unusual characteristics, and (3) the agent is a virino, a very small piece of DNA that acts like a virus. The scrapie agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization processes. It does not evoke any detectable immune response or inflammatory reaction in sheep and goats.

"The scrapie agent is thought to be spread most commonly from the ewe to her offspring and to other lambs through contact with the placenta and placental fluids. Signs or effects of the disease usually appear 2 to 5 years after the animal is infected but may not appear until much later. Sheep may live 1 to 6 months or longer after the onset of clinical signs, but death is inevitable. The genetics of the sheep affects their susceptibility to scrapie.

"In the laboratory, the scrapie agent has been transmitted to hamsters, mice, rats, voles, gerbils, mink, cattle, and some species of monkeys by inoculation. There is no scientific evidence to indicate that scrapie poses a risk to human health. There is no epidemiologic evidence that scrapie of sheep and goats is transmitted to humans, such as through contact on the farm, at slaughter plants, or butcher shops.

"Signs of scrapie vary widely among individual animals and develop very slowly. Due to damage to nerve cells, affected animals usually show behavioral changes, tremor (especially of head and neck), rubbing, and locomotor incoordination that progresses to recumbence and death.

"Early signs include subtle changes in behavior or temperament. These changes may be followed by scratching and rubbing against fixed objects, apparently to relieve itching. Other signs are loss of coordination, weakness, weight loss despite retention of appetite, biting of feet and limbs, lip smacking, and gait abnormalities, including high-stepping of the forelegs, hopping like a rabbit, and swaying of the back end.

"An infected animal may appear normal if left undisturbed at rest. However, when stimulated by a sudden noise, excessive movement, or the stress of handling, the animal may tremble or fall down in a convulsive-like state. Several other problems can cause clinical signs similar to scrapie in sheep, including the diseases ovine progressive pneumonia, listeriosis, and rabies; the presence of external parasites (lice and mites); pregnancy toxemia; and toxins.

"On the farm, veterinarians diagnose scrapie based on the appearance of its signs combined with knowledge of the animal's history. Scrapie can be diagnosed in the live animal by biopsy of the lymphoid tissues on the inside of the third eyelid. This test is used by the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

"USDA has initiated an accelerated scrapie eradication program. The program is based on the following key concepts:
- identification of preclinical infected sheep through live animal testing and active slaughter surveillance,
- effective tracing of infected animals to their flock/herd of origin made possible as a result of the identification requirements, and
- providing effective genetic based flock cleanup strategies that will allow producers to stay in business, preserve breeding stock, and remain economically viable.

APHIS provides the following to exposed and infected flocks/herds that participate in cleanup or monitoring plans:
- indemnity for high-risk, suspect, and scrapie positive sheep and goats, which owners agree to destroy,
- scrapie live-animal testing,
- genetic testing, and
- testing of exposed animals that have been sold out of infected and source flocks/herds."
