[1] Undiagnosed rust, wheat - France (Normandy), request for information
Date: Sat 2 May 2009
From: Susan Baekeland <grolleyog@wanadoo.fr>


We have an outbreak of some sort of common rust in winter wheat. I do
not know which, nor does anyone else farming here.

On examination of the crop I saw that the tips of the leaves were
brown/beige, and there were yellow/orange spots on the rib of the
leaves. The farmer confirmed the rust. He did not know what the type
was but said he had sprayed this crop 14 days ago and it would have
to be re-done.

I showed samples to another farmer and he said yes that it was the
rust (type not specified), it is this wet and warm weather we have
been having, which is ideal for the growth of this fungus.

Looking at more wheat fields in the area, about 85 percent were
infected with this rust. In some fields it is just starting, in
others it is quite well established. It is the most common one. No
stripes.

It is a problem because at the moment farmers are spraying herbicide
on fields to prepare to plant maize, and now they have to treat the
wheat with a fungicide as well.

[2] Fungal diseases, winter cereals - Germany (Saxony)

In winter barley, depending on the variety, all leaf diseases
including mildew, net blotch, leaf rust, and rhynchosporium are
present mostly in lower leaves and in varying severities. Due to fast
plant growth, a single fungicide treatment should be enough for most
crops.

For winter rye, fungicide treatments should be geared towards leaf
rust because it has the most serious effect on yields.

In susceptible varieties of winter wheat, septoria is present. Early
plantings are at a particularly high risk of infection.

[Cereal crops are affected by different rust fungi: leaf rust (or
brown rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ in wheat, by
_P. recondita_ f.sp. _recondita_ in rye, and by _P. hordei_ (synonym
_P. recondita_ f.sp. _tritici_) in barley. Stripe rust (or yellow
rust) of cereal crops is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_
var. _striiformis_. Stem rust (or black rust) of wheat is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f.sp. _tritici_. Serious yield losses
may be caused by these rusts on cereal crops.

Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). Cereal
diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi
_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and
_Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. Scald caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is
one of the most destructive diseases of barley. Powdery mildew of
barley is caused by _Blumeria graminis_ f.sp. _hordei_, and the less
important downy mildew is caused by _Sclerophthora_ species.

Management strategies for these pathogens generally include cultural
practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, use of clean seed, and
resistant cultivars. For more information see links below.

Most of the diseases mentioned above have also been reported to be
active in the UK at present (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed
below). The rust reported from Normandy may be leaf rust, but we
would be most grateful for additional information about this problem.
