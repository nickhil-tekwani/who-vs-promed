[This is now the 7th newly reported laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection this year (2016) -- 2 of whom were reported to be asymptomatic. All 7 of these individuals had a history of contact with camels (1 indirect and 6 direct).

Of note, in recent days there have been difficulties in reconciling case totals contained on the MOH pages. I've chosen to present the total as the total of the stated number of currently active cases, reported recoveries and reported fatalities.

In late October 2015, the Ministry of Health Command Control Center (CCC) began publishing a weekly monitor report on MERS-CoV which can be linked to via http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/Pages/Weekly-Monitor.aspx. The most recent issue (Vol.2 Issue, 26 Jan 2016) mentions the risk associated with contact with camels, especially juvenile camels less than 2 years of age.

"The rise in the number of emerging primary cases of MERS has been associated with the breeding season for camels. The 2 seasons when breeding peaks are: the main one during and immediately after the rainy season, lasting from July to September; and another occurring in December and January. The newly born camels have more viruses than the adults; the very young animals pose the greatest threat to humans. People will contract the virus when they come into contact with them or inhale their nasal secretions; e.g., behaviors like kissing camels, drinking raw milk, touching the nostrils and then touching your eyes. About 90 percent of animals became infected by the age of 2 and virus shedding is more common in calves than in adults.

"There is a need to intensify community-based health-educational programs during this camel-breeding season targeting camel herders and workers at the slaughter houses among others. The movements of camels in the Kingdom need to be carefully monitored. Public health laws should bar slaughtering of camels outside designated places. Doctors, especially those working in emergency departments, need to be alerted. Moreover, there is a need to develop and further improve an early warning systems for MERS. Ministries of Agriculture and Health need to maintain active and integrated human and animal epidemiological and genomic surveillance with sensitive indicators to inform and guide effective preparedness and response warrant further research. There is an urgent need to establish an integrated and strategic evidence-based local and nationwide surveillance and response capacity."
