Diagnostic testing conducted, reported on 29 Sep 2020 by the Equine Diagnostic Services in Lexington, Kentucky, confirmed a diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) affecting a 2nd Kentucky horse. The confirmation of disease is based on WNV-specific IgM antibodies being detected and compatible clinical signs with WNV.

A 9-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse in Madison County, Kentucky, had onset of clinical signs on 21 Sep 2020 including lethargy, inappetence, proprioceptive disorder, muscle fasciculations and moderate ataxia. The unvaccinated horse was alive...and described on 29 Sep 2020 by the attending veterinarian to be in a stable condition with some improvement.

The Kentucky Department of Agriculture's Equine West Nile virus page was updated to reflect this 2nd WNV case of 2020.

Information for this report came from Rusty Ford, Equine Operations Consultant, Office of the State Veterinarian, Kentucky Department of Agriculture.

An unvaccinated gelding in Washington County was the 1st reported WNV case in Kentucky for 2020.

A horse residing in Jefferson County has been diagnosed with West Nile virus (WNV), marking Colorado's 1st confirmed equine WNV case in 2020.

Vaccines in horses have proven to be a very effective prevention tool for WNV, and horses having been vaccinated in past years do need an annual booster. If a horse has not been vaccinated in previous years, it will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 4-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, as a preventative measure, horse owners should also work diligently to reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas where horses are located. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

Any time a horse displays clinical signs consistent with neurologic disease, a complete veterinary examination is warranted. All infectious or contagious equine neurologic diseases are reportable to the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office. A comprehensive chart of reportable animal diseases in Colorado can be found on the CDA website (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/report-a-disease).

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has reported 20 human cases to date in 2020. They have published data on human WNV cases, as well as positive mosquito pools, available on the CDPHE WNV website at https://www.colorado.gov/cdphe/west-nile-virus-data.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus first detected in the USA in the New York City area in 1999. Since 1999, the virus has spread throughout the USA and Canada, infecting birds, humans, horses, and other animals. The virus is maintained in the wild bird population and is spread between birds by mosquitos. Birds are considered the natural reservoir for WNV since high levels of virus circulate in their bloodstream. Mosquitos acquire WNV in blood meals from infected birds and pass it on to other birds, animals, and people. Mosquitos that feed on an infected horse or human have not demonstrated the ability to ingest enough of the virus to transmit it to other animals or humans; therefore, horses and humans are considered "dead end hosts".

Clinical signs: WNV may cause a wide range of clinical illness ranging from mild "flu-like" signs to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that may be fatal to both humans and horses. While horses are susceptible to WNV infection, many infected horses do not develop clinical illness and recover uneventfully.

Consult a veterinarian if your horse exhibits any of the following clinical signs:
- Fever
- Incoordination, especially in rear limbs, causing stumbling and falling
- Generalized weakness, muscle twitching, seizures or coma
- Drooping lips and lip smacking, head drooping, grinding teeth
- Hypersensitivity to touch or sound
- Recumbency (inability to rise)

Diagnosis: Any horse displaying abnormal behavior or neurologic signs should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out neurologic diseases, such as WNV, equine herpes virus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalopathy, eastern/western encephalomyelitis and rabies.

Blood samples should be collected by a veterinarian and sent for diagnostic testing. The WNV IgM capture ELISA test is a specific test that detects acute WNV infection in animals, is usually positive within 6 days post-infection and can remain positive for up to 2 months post-infection. A positive WNV IgM capture ELISA test is indicative of recent infection. Unexposed animals vaccinated for WNV will test negative on the WNV IgM capture ELISA test.

Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no specific treatment for WNV. Supportive care includes administration of anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous fluids. Recumbent WNV-positive horses are at a higher risk of dying or requiring euthanasia. For horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV, the case fatality rate is approximately 33%; however, many infected horses will fully recover following infection.

Prevention: Vaccination and mosquito control minimize the risk of WNV infection in horses. Although the number of WNV-infected horses has declined over the last 5 years, WNV remains an important disease in unvaccinated horses. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends incorporation of a WNV vaccine as an annual core vaccine in equine vaccination protocols. Currently, there are 4 US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-licensed WNV vaccines available for horses in the USA. Horse owners should consult with their veterinary practitioner to ensure current WNV vaccination status of their horses.

Mosquito control: Minimizing horse exposure to mosquitoes during the peak mosquito feeding periods at dawn and dusk decreases the risk of horse exposure to WNV. Application of mosquito repellant can also effectively reduce the number of mosquito bites on horses. Mosquito control efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites are also important. Methods to eliminate mosquito breeding sites include:
- Draining unnecessary standing water found in wheelbarrows, tires, etc.
- Cleaning water containers at least weekly (such as bird baths, plant saucers)
- Scheduling pasture irrigation to minimize standing water
- Keeping swimming pools optimally chlorinated and draining water from pool covers
- Stocking of water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunk" available at hardware stores.
