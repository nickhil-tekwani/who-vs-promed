[In 2014, Swaziland reported 2 outbreaks of African horse sickness (AHS) in the region of Hhohho (where the current outbreak is located). According to the final report, the event was resolved on 13 Aug 2014. Serotype 4 was identified. The event summary and map are available at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15462.

The following information is quoted from the OIE's technical disease card on AHS available at, http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/AFRICAN_HORSE_SICKNESS.pdf:

"AHS is caused by a virus of the family _Reoviridae_ of the genus _Orbivirus_. There are 9 antigenically distinct serotypes of AHS virus (AHSV) identified by virus neutralization, but some cross-reaction has been observed between 1 and 2, 3 and 7, 5 and 8, and 6 and 9. No cross-reactions with other known orbiviruses have been observed.

Infectious disease is transmitted by _Culicoides spp._ that occur regularly in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. At least 2 field vectors are involved: _Culicoides imicola_ and_ C. bolitinos_. The disease has both a seasonal (late summer/autumn) and an epizootic cyclical incidence, with disease associated with drought followed by heavy rain.

AHS is endemic in the central tropical regions of Africa, from where it spreads regularly to Southern Africa and occasionally to Northern Africa. All serotypes of AHS occur in eastern and southern Africa. Only AHS serotype 9, 4 and 2 have been found in North and West Africa, from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean.

A few outbreaks have occurred outside Africa in the Near and Middle East (1959-63), Spain (1966, 1987-90), Portugal (1989), Yemen (1997) and the Cape Verde Islands (1999). But recent northward expansion of the main African vector (Afro-Asiatic species _C. imicola_) and bluetongue virus into the Mediterranean Basin of Europe now threatens that region and beyond to AHS."
