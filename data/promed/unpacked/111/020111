DRACUNCULIASIS, GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE SUMMARY, 1997
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: May 1, 1998
From: Dr. James Chin, CDPC-mail

Progress for the worldwide eradication effort gave a mixed picture in
1997 despite an overall reduction in cases reported from 152 814 in 1996
to 77 863 in 1997. Details for 1997 are listed by country and month.
India and Kenya reported no indigenous cases; Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Senegal, and Yemen each reported fewer than 30 cases,
suggesting that dracunculiasis is on the verge of elimination in these
countries. Excluding Sudan, a total of 34 267 cases of dracunculiasis
were reported from endemic countries; this differs little from the 34
236 cases reported in 1996, while the number of endemic villages
declined from 4 518 in 1996 to 3 778 in 1997, a reduction of 16%, and
the rate of cases contained increased from 64% to 71%.
WER Editorial Note: The Indian subcontinent is now apparently free of
transmission. With the expected end of transmission in Yemen, only
Africa will remain endemic for dracunculiasis. In 1997, the significant
increase in the number of new endemic villages calls for the extension
and strengthening of community surveillance to cover resident as well as
nomadic populations living in areas of potential transmission, including
hamlets and nomadic encampments. The last cases of dracunculiasis will
be the most difficult to identify. Reward systems can be useful to
accelerate the eradication process. However, as recommended by the 3rd
ICCDE, they should only be introduced upon request by the countries at
the final stage of eradication. All partners should continue to support
endemic countries to ensure that the final goal of eradication will soon
be attained.
