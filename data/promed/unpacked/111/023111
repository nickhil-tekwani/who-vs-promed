A vaccination campaign for yellow fever is planned to begin in Ifelodun local government area of Kwara by 30 Sep 2017 to prevent further spread of infection. Ifelodun is the site where a girl in the community of Oke Owa is reported to have contracted yellow fever on 12 Sep [2017]. Surrounding local government areas will also be covered in the vaccination campaign, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said Monday [25 Sep 2017].

The case of yellow fever was diagnosed at Lagos University Teaching Hospital and confirmed at the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. Since then, the Kwara state epidemiology team has been working with federal and international partners to continue investigation and assess risks. A multi-agency Incident Management System has also been constituted at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to ensure a rapid and coordinated response.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice (yellowness of the eyes), muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Some infected people may not experience any of these symptoms, while in some, the symptoms might be mild. In severe cases, jaundice and bleeding may occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach.

"Vaccination against the disease remains the most important measure in preventing yellow fever, and the yellow fever vaccine is part of the childhood immunisation schedule in Nigeria," said NCDC national coordinator Chikwe Ihekweazu.

"Other methods of prevention include using insect repellents, sleeping under long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, living in net-screened accommodations, ensuring proper sanitation and getting rid of stagnant water or breeding places for mosquitoes.

Although there is no specific medicine to treat the disease, intensive supportive care can be provided, and most patients would recover with appropriate care when they present early enough, said Ihekweazu.

Healthcare workers are strongly advised to practice standard precautions while handling patients and/or body fluids at all times. They are also urged to be alert, be familiar with the case definition, and maintain a high index of suspicion.

Nigerians are advised to remain calm and support public health authorities, avoid self-medication, and report to the nearest health facility if feeling unwell or noticing any of the above symptoms in anyone around.

[It seems odd that only one laboratory confirmed yellow fever (YF) case is mentioned. Previous reports mention 2 patients diagnosed with YF in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara state. It is good to see that a vaccination response will be initiated very soon. With _Aedes aegypti_-transmitted yellow fever (YF) virus and urban transmission in a susceptible human population, an outbreak can expand very rapidly and get out of hand. Vaccination will prevent that spread.
