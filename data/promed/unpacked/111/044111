Hanoi reports bird flu outbreak
-------------------------------
Some 3700 birds were culled at a poultry farm in Soc Son District
after a bird flu outbreak infected nearly 2-3rds of the farm's
livestock, the Hanoi Animal Health Department reported Thursday [6
Mar 2008]. The northern province of Tuyen Quang also reported an
outbreak in Son Duong District.

Northern Viet Nam is seeing a massive outspread of bird flu epidemic
as 8 out of the 12 provinces and city hit by the epidemic nationwide
are in the north, including Hai Duong, Quang Ninh, Ninh Binh, Phu
Tho, Nam Dinh, Ha Nam, Tuyen Quang and Hanoi.

Central provinces include Quang Nam and Quang Binh. The southern
provinces of Tra Vinh and Vinh Long are also hit. The southern animal
health departments are strengthening control over slaughtering and
trading of poultry. They also require farmers to have their poultry vaccinated.

Viet Nam is one of the most bird flu affected countries in the world,
with 105 H5N1 human casualties since 2003.

According to a review on the situation in Viet Nam, included in FAO
RMPRES, FAOAIDE news update 50, 11 Feb 2008 (distributed 1 Mar 2008),
available at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//239862/AIDEnews_feb08_no50.pdf>),
HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry were reported repeatedly by Viet Nam
throughout 2007, mainly in unvaccinated duck production systems.

The country's 1st avian influenza vaccination campaign for 2007 was
completed in September 2007 for 63 provinces, where a total of 164.47
million poultry were vaccinated (87.42 million chickens, 73.15
million mallard-type ducks and 3.90 million muscovy ducks). More than
42 million doses of vaccine were administered by private livestock firms.

Analysis of post-vaccination surveillance data in 41 provinces and
cities indicated a protection rate of 65.4 percent (47 037 tested
samples) and 72.05 percent based on tested flocks (1753 tested
flocks). Analysis of post-vaccination surveillance data on 15
breeding farms managed by the central government showed that the
overall protection rate was 81 percent (3474 tested samples). Based
on serological testing (hemagglutination inhibition test (HI)),
analysis of serum samples for virus activity in unvaccinated domestic
waterfowl (ducks and muscovy ducks) showed that the overall positive
rate was 4.58 percent (14 427 tested samples) and 13.95 percent based
on tested flocks (681 tested flocks).

Based on real-time reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) of swab samples taken from markets and slaughtering points
in 25 provinces and cities, the overall rate for virus occurrence was
1.75 percent. Outbreaks in 2008 affected unvaccinated ducks.

From the above newswire, it is not clear which species was affected
in the described outbreak and what kind of management system was
involved. The "massive outspread of bird flu epidemic" in numerous
provinces, in spite of the vaccination campaign, is worrisome and its
background -- including vaccine efficacy -- deserves clarification. -Mod.AS]

Dead bird found in HK tests positive for H5N1
---------------------------------------------
An oriental magpie robin found dead earlier in Hong Kong has tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus, the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region said in a press release Friday [7 Mar 2008].

"An oriental magpie robin was confirmed to be H5N1 positive after a
series of laboratory tests," said the Department.

The dead bird was collected on 29 Feb 2008 near a management center
in Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve in the northern district of New
Territories, a government spokesman said, adding that the oriental
magpie robin is a common resident in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has
reported 9 cases of bird infections of the H5N1 virus since November
2007. The H5N1 strain typically gets more active during the cold and
dry winters.

Authorities in Hong Kong have been on alert against the virus, with
contingency plans and education programs aimed at informing the
public about bird flu. More than 300 people from government
departments, the Hong Kong International Airport and airline held an
exercise in Hong Kong Friday [7 Mar 2008], simulating a suspected
case of H5N1 avian influenza on a plane at the Hong Kong International Airport.

The government spokesman also reminded the public to observe good
hygiene Friday. "They should avoid personal contact with wild birds
or live poultry and clean their hands thoroughly after coming into
contact with them," he said.

[Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with
HPAI H5N1, namely a 3-year-old boy in August 1997. The measures
applied by the local authorities to control the disease in avians and
to prevent human infection were and remain exemplary. The
