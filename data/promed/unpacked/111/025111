I am replying to the ProMED posting of 15 Sep 1999 [cited above. This
posting implied some difficulty in obtaining information on the travel
destinations of two New Zealanders who had developed cholera after
returning from holiday in the Pacific. I am not sure where this apparent
information block has come from. New Zealand is
committed to free exchange of surveillance information on emerging public
health hazards. Imported cholera cases are fully reported in New Zealand
along with their travel history. This information is disseminated here in
a variety of forms, including the New Zealand Public Health Report (NZPHR),
which is sent monthly to most medical practitioners and public health
workers in NZ. This journal is also distributed internationally and posted
on the NZ Ministry of Health's web page
<http://www.moh.govt.nz/nzphr.html>.
The first of these two imported cases of cholera was reported in the March
issue of the NZPHR. This case was in a 28 year old man who developed
cholera in December 1998 after returning from a holiday in Fiji. The
second case was a 26 year old man who developed cholera in July, again
after returning from a holiday in Fiji. This case will be reported in the
September NZPHR.

Both cases were due to _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 biotype El Tor, subgroup Ogawa.

[Since the report appeared in the WHO WER in September, we erroneously
assumed it referred to current cases. Now all is clear. They are the same
ones imported from Fiji in January & July which we had already reported
(see refs. above). It appears that both ProMED & WHO have reported them
twice. We note that the International Health Regulations require reporting
of all cholera cases to WHO within 24 hours; reporting them in a monthly
bulletin 2 months after the fact does not fulfill that requirement - Mod.JW
[Thanks to Dr. Baker for calling the information to our attention. In
fairness to those who did not find it on their own, I note that the New
Zealand Public Health Report as posted on the website does not include
specific reference to cholera in the Table of Contents. One has to read
the entire issue to find the single paragraph in the Surveillance Reports
section. I am unfamiliar with the other forms of information dissemination
used by the New Zealand public health officials in this case, but again I
guess we missed the reports. It is important that subscribers help us to
find such information. - Mod.ES
[It is also noteworthy that the 17 Sep 1999 posting cited above refers to
two cases of typhoid among cruise ship passengers. It is apparent that, if
the latter diagnosis is correct, it must represent a separate outbreak. -
