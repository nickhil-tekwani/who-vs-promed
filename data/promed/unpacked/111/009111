The Florida Department of Health on Thu 10 Oct 2013 confirmed that a Santa Rosa County resident infected with a shellfish-borne bacterial infection has died. According to family members, The 53-year-old Gulf Breeze resident died earlier this week from the bacterium _Vibrio vulnificus_. The death brings the total number of deaths this year [2013] in Florida from _Vibrio vulnificus_ to 10 out of 31 cases.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ is normally found in warm, salty seawater and is most often ingested by people through raw shellfish, particularly oysters, according to health officials. The Santa Rosa case, which was reported on Tue 8 Oct 2013, came less than 24 hours after Escambia County health officials confirmed their 1st case of 2013.

Based on historical data dating back to 2008, the 31 reported cases of infection and 10 deaths throughout the state appear to be within an average range, with the highest number of cases, 35 infections with 13 deaths, reported in 2011.

[The following is exacted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and is associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH [acidity], salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
