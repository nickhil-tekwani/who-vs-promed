West Nile Virus Confirmed Positive in Horse in Louisiana
--------------------------------------------------------
A horse residing in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, has been confirmed as
positive for West Nile virus (WNV) infection. This is the first equine case
of clinical WNV infection ever detected in Louisiana.
The horse was a 7-year-old Quarterhorse mare that went down on 21 Aug 2001,
was unable to move, and had to be euthanatized on 23 Aug 2001. There is no
known history of recent travel of the horse outside of Louisiana.
WNV infection was confirmed at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL). Both WNV IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and plaque-reduction neutralization test were positive on a serum
sample.
On 23 Jul of this year a WNV-positive blue jay was detected in Jefferson
Parish, just outside of New Orleans. No human cases of WNV infection have
yet been detected in Louisiana.
More information on WNV including links to State and local WNV web pages is
available on the APHIS website at:
