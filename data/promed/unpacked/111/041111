Angola: Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever outbreak - WHO Update 20; Fri 27 May 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 26 May 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 399
cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 335 were fatal. The
vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province, where 388 cases and
324 deaths have been reported.

Yesterday, 4 new cases, of which 3 were fatal, were reported in Bungo
municipality, in Uige Province. These are the 1st cases in this city
detected since early April [2005]. An urgent investigation has been launched
to determine whether the Bungo cases can be linked to Uige municipality,
where transmission is known to be ongoing. Another focus of transmission
would be a disturbing development for outbreak control.

In Uige municipality, procedures for contact tracing are now operating with
greater efficiency. This week, staff from the mobile surveillance teams were
able to visit and look for signs of illness in more than half of the 100
persons known to have had close contact with a Marburg patient. New cases
are, however, continuing to occur with no known link to a previous case,
suggesting that the surveillance system has not yet reached the efficiency
needed to interrupt chains of transmission.

Local and international staff have continued to identify cultural practices
that create opportunities for exposure to the virus and thus allow the
outbreak to continue. Most recently, around 200 traditional healers have
been given masks and gloves and trained in ways to reduce risks to
themselves and their clients. To date, at least 2 traditional healers have
died of Marburg haemorrhagic fever.

Intensive educational campaigns, supported by local religious leaders and
Red Cross volunteers, about the hazards of home treatment using injections,
have resulted in the collection and safe disposal of large numbers of
syringes. There is however no assurance that this practice, which is a
highly efficient way to spread the virus, has been fully eliminated in
Uige's population.

Correction
----------
In the preceding ProMED-mail post archived as "Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever -
Angola (44) 20050526.1458" it was stated by a correspondent that: "That
[there was] a case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in a young boy in a big cave
near Entebbe, Kenya. Numerous tests were carried out, but nothing was
found, yet this boy said that he had touched the walls of this cave, but
that he had not been bitten or had contact with a bat."

In fact it was an adult Frenchman who was the victim, not a young boy. There
is no proof so far of linkage of this incident to bats. Furthermore Entebbe
is situated in Uganda, not Kenya.

[The cave is in fact in Kenya, and nowhere near Entebbe, Uganda. Kitum Cave
is on the side of an extinct volcano, Mount Elgon (14 178 feet, 4321 meters
high, coordinates 1 degree 8 minutes North, 34 degrees 33 minutes East).
ProMED-mail regrets not correcting these errors in the correspondent's
comment and welcomes this assistance in keeping the record straight. -
