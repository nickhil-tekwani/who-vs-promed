A 37 year old woman died of rabies in Beijing last week, reports the
Municipal Bureau of Health. The victim, from Central China's Henan
Province, was bitten by her puppy, which had not been immunized, on 10 Jan
2006. She died on 14 Feb 2006 in Southwest Beijing's Fangshan District.
From 13 to 19 Feb 2006, hospitals in Beijing saw a rapid increase in
numbers of patients who had been injured by their pets. In addition, 204
citizens have called the city's health hotline for information about rabies
during the past week, accounting for 42 per cent of all calls to the service.
Rabies is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease that can affect
most warm-blooded animals, especially wolves, cats, and dogs. It attacks
the central nervous system and is transmitted by the bite of infected animals.
The latent period of rabies can be as short as 10 days or as long as 10
years, according to Su Bogu, deputy director of the Emergency Treatment
Department of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing. Once
[symptoms] fully develop, the mortality rate is 100 per cent, Sun said.
Beijing has seen a gradual increase in rabies cases in recent years due to
the increase of pet cats and dogs raised by citizens, he said. He urged
health authorities to improve public awareness of the disease.

[A previous report from China recorded a gradual decline in the number of
cases of canine rabies and human infection commencing in 1990, followed by
a resurgence in 1998 -- see Rabies, canine, human - China (Beijing)
20050814.23800. The epidemic areas were mainly in the south eastern and
south western parts of the country, such as Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi,
Guangdong, Anhui, and Fujian, where dogs were raised for meat and there was
no requirement for such dogs to be vaccinated. In contrast, Beijing was
considered to be rabies-free as a consequence of a policy of compulsory
vaccination of pet dogs, which was rigidly enforced in urban areas -- see
Rabies, human - China (nationwide) (02) 20031125.2920. It seems that
Beijing may have lost its rabies-free status, possibly due to population
movements. Visitors to China should be made aware of this situation. - Mod.CP]
