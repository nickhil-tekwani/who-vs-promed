Chemical Poisoning Targeted in South China
----------------------------------------
BEIJING - An investigation team was sent Thursday [23 Nov 2000 to probe
into a benzene poisoning case in Nanhai City in south China's Guangdong
Province.
Since last September more than 200 workers from a shoe factory in Pingzhou
Town in Nanhai have been diagnosed with blood problems, and 60 of them have
been sent to the hospital for treatment. The cases were later diagnosed as
benzene poisoning, which may lead to possibly fatal brain and blood problems.
The provincial health authorities sent the team and asked for local police
involvement in investigating the case, the biggest instance of chemical
poisoning in the province in recent years, an official source said.
The shoe factory has been accused of using impure benzene and not having
established safety measures and guidelines for workers.
There are over 400 factories in Pingzhou which employ many workers from
outside the province. The factories, most of which are funded by Hong Kong
or Taiwan firms or joint ventures, use the same benzene materials in
production.
"Despite difficulties, the case will get a thorough investigation and just
handling," a provincial health bureau official said.

[The article does not tell us if the benzene was inhaled, absorbed through
the skin, or a combination. Furthermore, we know nothing of the
concentrations to which these workers were exposed. However, non-HodgkinÂ´s
lymphoma is associated with chronic high-dose benzene exposure with a
latency period of approximately 5-6 years. Although the latency period for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for chronic, low dose exposure is not established,
it appears to be approximately 15-20 years. Benzene has been known as a
carcinogen for a number of years. - Mod.TG
