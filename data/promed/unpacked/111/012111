A national health warning will be issued after the confirmation that 2
Alice Springs residents have contracted the potentially fatal Murray Valley
Encephalitis virus. The Communicable Disease Network will issue a warning
of the presence of this dangerous mosquito-borne virus.
A 59-year-old man and a 49-year-old woman were transferred to Adelaide
hospitals last week after being admitted with symptoms of headache, fever
and decreased consciousness. The woman remains in critical condition in the
Flinders Medical Centre, while the man is in a stable condition in the
Royal Adelaide hospital.
Dr Alex Brown from the Communicable Disease Centre says the elderly and the
young are most at risk of contracting the virus. He stated that the risk
extends beyond the Territory and evidence of the virus has been detected in
Queensland and north-western New South Wales.
