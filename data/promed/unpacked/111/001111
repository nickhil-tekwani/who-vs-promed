Something very strange is happening in a favorite crocodile haunt,
the Olifants Gorge, in South Africa's Kruger National Park.
Crocodiles are dying en masse, and a local television documentary has
showed, recently, the many carcasses floating in the river or lying
dead in the sun on the river bank.

In the month of June 2008 alone, 30 carcasses were counted in the
Olifants River area alone. This figure has subsequently risen to 50.

Most carcasses appear to have distinctive discoloration in the tail's
fat tissues. The tissue is a mustard yellow color and unusually
hardened. Scientists seem to be finding a higher mortality among the
older crocs. What appears to happen is that the crocodiles, in
attempting to fatten themselves up over winter, have had their fatty
tissues poisoned, and the chemical reaction which hardens these
tissues gradually paralyses them in what is likely an excruciating death.

Kruger National Park's Head of Department for Scientific Services,
Danie Pienaar, suggests the crocodiles are afflicted with
pansteatitis. But this disease is associated with ingesting rotten
fish, and the fish in the Olifants River are apparently healthy.

There is growing consensus that the croc die-off is a result of a
confluence of low level toxins, which has lead to endocrinal
abnormalities (that is, hormonal changes) in croc tissues.

The spokeswoman for the Kruger National Park and the Water Research
Commission, Linda Page, has cited traces of 15 pesticides in local
river water and indicated that while the levels of these were below
WHO drinking water guidelines, she said they were [also] "... in the
range where possible accumulation in the food chain is possible."

Long term exposure to these and other toxins may well be conspiring
towards the crippling condition suffered by Olifants River
crocodiles. But other pollutants have also been discovered in the
water, phthalates for one. Phthalates, related to plastics, have been
found in both sediments and water samples. The phthalates may account
for the hardening of fatty tissues.

Despite reasonably transparent river water (no algae), polyaromatic
hydrocarbons have also been found at higher than normal levels in
sediments. These are related to local grass fires and coal
combustion, the latter having increased dramatically in recent times.

The construction of the Massingir Dam may also have promoted long
term exposure and accumulation to these various compounds, especially
since it is in the nature of dams to promote not only a buildup of
water but the sediments carried in the water.

Warren Foster, writing for the Mail & Guardian opines: "The expansion
of mining in the area, compounded by the withdrawal of water by a dam
in Mozambique, is seen is a possible cause."

What is interesting and distressing about this case is that we see
here a combination of chemicals which has formed a mixture in river
water lethal to crocodiles. Separately, each compound has been
introduced into the river system at apparently low and safe "healthy" levels.

While in this case crocodiles are the obvious victims, no one knows
what impact (long term or short) the sick water of the Olifants River
might have on human beings exposed to it. Meanwhile, at least 18
platinum mines continue to operate in the Kruger Park's water catchment areas.

[The article does not specify chemicals, pesticides, or heavy metals,
or their amounts, yet the article boldly states, "Long term exposure
to these and other toxins may well be conspiring towards the
crippling condition suffered by Olifants River crocodiles." So
apparently, the specifics of the chemicals, pesticides and/or heavy
metals are known. It would be much more beneficial to publish what
has been found and the levels of those alleged toxins, then those
doing research or having experience in the area would be able to
suggest a possible solution.

It would also seem appropriate to get to the deceased crocodiles as
quickly as possible and get a proper necropsy and tissues, stomach
contents, etc. sent to several different diagnostic labs to better
the chances of locating the cause of the crocodiles' demise.

There is a similar condition in cattle known as "Hard Yellow Liver."
After several decades, it remains a mystery, but cattle do not die
from it in the way these crocodiles are dying. The condition is
thought to be related to a seasonal plant that may occur during rainy
years but only becomes toxic under certain environmental stressors
such as drought later in the year, or even the following year. The
condition has geometric boundaries, suggesting it may be plant related.

If the environmental conditions around the area have not been fully
explored, including plant life and possible fungi, then perhaps this
should be done as well.

This is really most disturbing, and we would be very grateful for an
authoritative report that provides more insight into these continuing
deaths. - Mod.TG]
