Between November 2013 and August 2014, 9 cases of verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O117:H7 VT1 [Verotoxin type 1, also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) - Mod.LL] were confirmed in adult men. Further investigation using semi-structured interviews revealed that 8 cases were United Kingdom (UK)-born men who have sex with men (MSM) who had sexually acquired infection in the UK. Most were HIV-positive with high numbers of sexual partners. This behavioral profile resembles that associated with the recent rapid increase in other sexually acquired infections in MSM.

Few diagnoses of EHEC serotype O117:H7 VTI are reported each year in England. Between 1 Jan 2009 and 20 Nov 2013, Public Health England's (PHE) Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit (GBRU) confirmed just 13 cases of EHEC O117:H7 VT1 (Figure) [for Figure, see source URL - Mod.LL] compared with 4050 cases of EHEC O157 in the same period. Travel history was available for 10 of the 13 cases and all reported recent travel to countries with a high prevalence of EHEC O117:H7 (1,2).

In June 2014, GBRU detected an increase in EHEC O117:H7 VT1 diagnoses with 9 cases confirmed since 21 Nov 2013. All were adult men, of whom 3 were referred from genitourinary clinics and only 1 reported recent travel. An incident control team was established on 4 Jul 2014 to investigate this increase, the clinical presentation of cases and possible links with the ongoing _Shigella flexneri_ 3a outbreak in men who have sex with men (MSM) (3-5).

Incident investigation
----------------------
On 19 Jun 2014, 204 laboratories in England were alerted to the increase in EHEC O117:H7 VT1 and asked to refer all presumptive _S. sonnei_ isolates to the GBRU. Cases of reported EHEC infection were investigated in line with PHE standard operating procedures (6). In addition to the routine enhanced surveillance questionnaire for EHEC, all men older than 18 years diagnosed with EHEC O117:H7 VT1 after 1 Nov 2013 were invited to take part in confidential semi-structured face-to-face interviews with a sexual health advisor after patient consent had been obtained by the local Public Health Office. The interviews lasted 1.5 hours and explored the men's lifestyle and sexual behavior, focusing on the 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms, i.e. the period within which infection had been acquired. Demographic data and information on sexual behavior were collected, together with details of where they met sexual partners, recreational drug use, engagement with health services, previous history of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For HIV-positive men, the most recent CD4 T-cell count, viral load and current treatment regime were also discussed.

Results
-------
Between 21 Nov 2013 and 21 Aug 2014, 9 cases of EHEC O117:H7 VT1 were identified, none of which had evident common food, water or animal exposures. One of them was a heterosexual man who had recently traveled to South America. The remaining 8 were MSM, 7 of whom consented to be interviewed. The median age of the 7 men was 46 years (range: 33-50 years), most of whom (6/7) were of white ethnicity. 6 men were in a relationship and 3 of whom cohabited with their male partner. All had open relationships and were reported from London and Brighton, cities that have large, vibrant gay communities.

In the 2 weeks before onset of illness, the 7 men reported a median of 5 partners (range: 2-15) and in the previous year, a median of 40 partners (range: 5-480). There was no evidence that any of the sexual contacts were cases. For the 2 weeks before onset, all 7 men reported unprotected oral-anal contact with casual partners, they also reported receptive fisting (2/7), insertive fisting (3/7) and scat play (1/7). 4 men had met sexual partners through social media using geo-spatial networking applications that allow users to locate and meet men with similar sexual interests within close proximity. 2 men had attended sex parties during that time. 3 of the 7 men reported chemsex, i.e. having sex under the influence of one or more of the following drugs: mephedrone, crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth), gamma-hydroxybutrate (GHB) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). These drugs, which are taken immediately before and/or during sex, facilitate sexually disinhibiting behavior and increased sex drive. Although the drugs can be injected, none of the men reported this practice [7].

3 men were HIV-positive and on therapy. A history of a range of STIs including lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) (n=3), gonorrhea (n=4), syphilis (n=1) and chlamydia (n=6) was reported within the past 5 years. All 7 men had heard of _E. coli_ but only 3 had seen the recent shigellosis information campaigns by PHE and Terrence Higgins Trust (http://www.tht.org.uk). Although 1 man experienced acute infection with bloody diarrhea, others described more chronic illness with symptoms of mild stomach cramps and fatigue which generally lingered for several weeks, 1 man seeking medical advice after a month. The men sought medical advice from their general practitioner or genitourinary medicine clinic. One man was subsequently admitted to hospital.

Discussion
----------
Initial findings from this ongoing investigation detail the 1st cluster of EHEC O117:H7 VT1 to be described in MSM. There was no evidence that this was part of a generalized epidemic or that the observations were the result of sampling bias. EHEC O117:H7 may be misidentified as _S. sonnei_ by local diagnostic laboratories as there are similarities in colony appearance and biochemical profile. Such misidentifications are detected when strains are referred for confirmation and typing at the GBRU. Since December 2012, a small number of laboratories, including services in Brighton and central London have adopted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to detect verocytotoxin (also called Shiga toxin) genes in stool samples, resulting in an increased number of diagnoses of non-O157 EHEC, including serogroup O117 (3).

This strain does not possess the pathogenicity factor intimin and the stx2a shiga-toxin subtype which are known to be associated with more severe disease and progression to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (3). Previous clusters have mainly been travel-associated and limited to around 3 cases (1). Although the small sample size restricts interpretation, we have shown that recent diagnoses of EHEC O117:H7 VT1 in England have been sexually acquired by highly sexually active MSM born in the United Kingdom, some of whom were HIV-positive and took chemsex drugs. This behavioral profile resembles that of LGV, infectious syphilis and shigellosis epidemics in England (4,8,9). Such overlapping epidemics, sustained by closely related sexual networks facilitated by geo-spatial social networking applications, allow hyperefficient transmission, an environment in which infection control has been difficult to achieve. Infections have become endemic despite increased case finding and proactive campaigns (http://www.tht.org.uk/shigella) to raise awareness about shigellosis and provide hygiene advice through advertisement in the gay press, magazines, leaflets in clinics and general practitioners' surgeries as well as pop-up banners on internet sites.

Conclusion
----------
This new cluster further highlights the importance of enhancing and strengthening measures to decrease fecal-oral transmission of infection and increase awareness amongst MSM. This is of particular importance and a cause for concern should a more pathogenic EHEC be introduced into this high-risk group. The public health response to EHEC O117:H7 VT1 has been combined with ongoing initiatives aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of MSM and promoting access to health services (10).

"20 patients were infected with a new group of verocytotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (VTEC) strains of serotype O117:K1:H7 during a 5-y period. The main symptoms were persistent watery diarrhea with abdominal cramps; 2 persons of the 20 were healthy carriers. The duration of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients was median 11 weeks with 80 percent being ill for more than 30 d. In 19 cases the infection was acquired during travel (Asia, Africa and Cuba), and 1 case was laboratory acquired. All strains were positive for the vtx1 gene and negative for the vtx2, the eae, the saa and the ehxA genes. 13 strains (65 percent) were resistant to 4 or more antimicrobial agents. By PFGE using the restriction enzyme XbaI, the strains were clonally related, but not identical. O117:K1:H7 is a clonal group of VTEC that should be considered in patients returning from Africa and Asia with long-lasting watery diarrhea."

The absence of the intimin gene (eae) does not necessarily mean that complications related to Shiga toxin cannot occur. Readers should recall the quite large outbreak, centered in northern Germany, of the chimeric _E. coli_ O104:H4 which was Shiga toxin positive without eae and contained genetic information from enteroaggregative _E. coli_ as well. This outbreak was associated with a large number of deaths associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and associated renal failure as well as central nervous system complications (1,2). This organism (O117:H7) does not seem to do this but causes more chronic watery diarrhea. Although the posting implies that it can be confused with _Shigella sonnei_, the disease complex associated with shigellosis is a dysentery with bloody, mucous containing diarrhea and fever. EHEC almost never causes fever or frank dysentery.
