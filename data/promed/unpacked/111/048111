The health zones of Onema Ototo and Vangakete [in Sankuru] are
affected by pertussis. In total, 74 cases have already been
registered. Among the victims, many are children of 1 to 3 years. The
lack of vaccination or the use of expired vaccines are the cause of
the disease, according to the provincial Minister of Health.

The resurgence of these cases are causing concern at the highest
level of the health authorities in the province of Kasai Oriental
because whooping cough [pertussis] is a disease eradicated from the DRC.

[Since it seems clear that the eradication of pertussis even from the
industrialized world is quite difficult, it is not likely that _B.
pertussis_ had been eradicated from DRC. - Mod.LL]
