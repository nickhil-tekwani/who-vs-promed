Epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection on [23 Jan 2020]
-----------------------------
As of 24:00 on [22 Jan 2020], our committee had received a total of 571 confirmed cases of pneumonia of new coronavirus infection in 25 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) in China, including 95 severe cases and 17 deaths (all from Hubei Province). A total of 393 suspected cases were reported in 13 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities).

At 00:00 on [22 Jan 2020] 24 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) reported 131 new confirmed cases and 8 new deaths, of which 5 were males and 3 were females, with the exception of 1 individual who was 53 years old, the remaining fatalities were elderly individual over age 65 years. Elderly individuals (and there were 5 cases over 80 years old) have chronic diseases such as cancer, liver damage, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. 13 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) reported 257 new suspected cases. A total of 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) reported epidemics nationwide, and 4 provinces including Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Fujian were added.

Confirmed cases reported overseas: 1 case in Hong Kong, China, 1 case in Macau, 1 case in Taiwan, China; 1 case in the United States, 1 case in Japan, 3 cases in Thailand, and 1 case in South Korea.

At present, 5897 close contacts have been traced, 969 people have been released from medical observation, and 4928 people are still under medical observation.

Information on the 17 deaths
----------------------------
1. A 61-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis and myxoma. Fever started on [20 Dec 2019], with cough and weakness. [He] was hospitalized in the Department of Respiratory Medicine of Wuhan Puren Hospital on [27 Dec 2019], transferred to the ICU on [28 Dec 2019], had mechanical intubation on [30 Dec 2019], and transferred to the ICU of Jinyintan Hospital on [31 Dec 2019]; in shock and a coma when transferred. On [1 Jan 2020] he received ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] support, anti-infection, anti-shock, and corrective acid symptomatic supportive treatment. At 20:47 on [9 Jan 2020], the heart rate of the patient suddenly became zero, and the ECMO blood flow rate decreased rapidly to 0.2 liters/minute. Resuscitation was performed immediately. By 23:13, the heart rate was still 0, and clinical death was announced.

2. A 69-year-old male, was admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital for 2 days due to fever and cough for 4 days, and exacerbated by dyspnea. On [3 Jan 2020], tracheal intubation was connected to a ventilator to assist breathing. Abnormal myocardial enzyme profile persisted. Transferred to Jinyintan Hospital on [4 Jan 2020]. Admission diagnosis was acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, severe pneumonia, unconsciousness, pleural effusion, and aortic atherosclerosis. A CT scan of the patient's chest revealed large ground-glass opacities in both lungs. ECG: ST-segment changes. After admission, he was treated with intensive care, ventilator-assisted breathing, prone ventilation, and symptomatic and supportive treatments such as CRRT, anti-infection, and liver protection. His condition did not improve. Septic shock, microcirculation failure, coagulation dysfunction developed. At 00:15 on [15 Jan 2020], the patient's heart rate dropped to 0, and norepinephrine, epinephrine, pituitary, and dopamine were continuously pumped into the anti-shock therapy. The patient failed to recover spontaneous breathing and heartbeat until 0:45. The electrocardiogram at the bedside showed total cardiac arrest, and clinical death was declared.

3. An 89-year-old male, with a history of hypertension, cerebral infarction, and cerebral softening. Due to urinary incontinence, he was referred to the Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital on [5 Jan 2020], and was transferred to the emergency department on [8 Jan 2020] due to drowsiness and unconsciousness. The examination revealed lung infection (viral pneumonia) and acute respiratory failure. On [8 Jan 2020], a physical examination revealed that the patient had [a systolic blood pressure of ] 77mmHg and hypoxia. Lung CT showed double lung patch shadow, bilateral pleural effusion, and pleural adhesion. Routine blood tests showed a progressive increase in white blood cell count and a low lymphocyte count. On [9 Jan 2020], he was transferred to the outpatient clinic for emergency treatment and was given symptomatic supportive treatment. On [13 Jan 2020], the ventilator was assisted with positive pressure ventilation. Drowsiness occurred on [14 Jan 2020]. With ventilator-assisted ventilation, blood oxygen saturation fluctuated between 50% and 85%. He was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Ward on [15 Jan 2020]. Before transfer at 10:30 on [18 Jan 2020], Bp140 / 78mmHg, SPO2 85% under non-invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation. During the transfer, the patient suffered a respiratory arrest, continued resuscitation for 2 hours, but the treatment was unsuccessful. Clinical death was announced at 13:37 on [18 Jan 2020].

4. An 89-year-old male, with prior history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and coronary stent implantation. The patient developed symptoms on [13 Jan 2020]. There was no obvious onset of asthma 4 hours before the consultation, and he felt dyspnea and no fever. On [18 Jan 2020], he went to the emergency department of Wuhan Union Medical College for treatment due to severe breathing difficulties. The patient was old and had a positive specimen with _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, a new coronavirus positive test, and CT of the lung showed typical changes of viral pneumonia. At 23:39 on [19 Jan 2020], his condition deteriorated, and he died.

5. A 66-year-old male, prior history of COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], hypertension, type 2 diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, ascending aortic artificial aorta replacement in 2007, abdominal aortic stent placement in 2017, cholecystectomy, multiple organ damage. The patient was admitted to Wuhan Iron and Steel General Hospital on [16 Jan 2020] for 6 days due to intermittent cough, headache, fatigue and fever. Chest CT on [16 Jan 2020] showed bilateral pneumonia, fibrosis of the left upper lung, and nodules of the left upper lung. Dyspnea occurred on [17 Jan 2020] and blood gas analysis revealed type 1 respiratory failure. Oxygen, anti-infection, anti-virus, and sputum treatment were given. At 10:10 on [20 Jan 2020], the patient suddenly developed reduced finger pulse oxygen to 40%. He was given non-invasive ventilator-assisted ventilation. The patient was again diagnosed with severe respiratory failure and asked again whether he wanted to undergo tracheal intubation. At 10:35 on [20 Jan 2020], his condition deteriorated and resuscitation efforts failed.

6. A 75-year-old male, was admitted to Wuhan Fifth Hospital at 17:19 on [11 Jan 2020] due to fever with cough, sputum for 5 days, and vomiting for 2 days. Previous history of hypertension and hip arthroplasty. The admission temperature was 38.2 C, accompanied by fatigue, anorexia, cough, nasal congestion, dizziness, and headache. There were no obvious chills, or sore muscles and joints. A CT of the chest revealed an interstitial lung infection. After being admitted to the hospital, he was in critical condition and was given oxygen, anti-infection, anti-virus, phlegm, fever, and fluid rehydration as appropriate. The patient's condition worsened progressively, and he was transferred to the ICU on [15 Jan 2020] for mechanical ventilation. At 11:30 on [20 Jan 2020], the family members expressed their understanding of the condition and then requested to stop the ventilator and pull out the tracheal tube for observation. The tracheal intubation ventilator assisted breathing and CPR rescue were no longer indicated. He was pronounced dead at 11:25 on [20 Jan 2020].

7. A 48-year-old female, with prior history of diabetes and cerebral infarction. On [10 Dec 2019], there was no fever (38 C/100.4 F); sore body and fatigue, and cough and sputum gradually appeared. Anti-infective treatment in primary hospitals did not improve her condition over 2 weeks. On [27 Dec 2019], chest tightness and shortness of breath occurred. At Tongji Hospital she was given non-invasive ventilation and conventional anti-infective treatment. Her condition still worsened. On [31 Dec 2019], she was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital and given symptomatic treatments such as high-flow oxygen inhalation of nasal catheter. Hypoxia had not improved significantly, and her condition was still worsening. On [14 Jan 2020], chest CT showed diffuse mechanized changes in both lungs, some with traction bronchiectasis, especially in the lower lungs. At 11:50 on [20 Jan 2020], tracheal intubation was performed, and analgesia and sedation were given. The terminal oxygen saturation and blood pressure continued to decline, and then the heart rate decreased. Eventually, resuscitation efforts failed.

8. An 82-year-old male, was admitted to Wuhan Fifth Hospital at 15:41 on [14 Jan 2020] due to chills and soreness in the whole body for 5 days.

ref: The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team, Qun Li. An outbreak of NCIP (2019-nCoV) infection in China -- Wuhan, Hubei Province, 2019-2020. China CDC Weekly. 2020;2(5): 79-80
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the most recent updates, follow China CDC Weekly's Tracking the Epidemic at http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htm

Emerging and re-emerging pathogens are great challenges to the public health (1). A cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown etiology (VPUE), now known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province and was reported to health authorities on December 29, 2019 (2). A national, provincial, and municipal joint investigation team has been assembled to conduct field investigations and implement disease control and prevention measures. This report shows interim results of the investigation and makes recommendations for response measures.

Identification of the epidemic
------------------------------
On [29 Dec 2019], a hospital in Wuhan admitted 4 individuals with pneumonia and recognized that all 4 had worked in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live poultry, aquatic products, and several kinds of wild animals to the public. The hospital reported this occurrence to the local center for disease control (CDC), which lead Wuhan CDC staff to initiate a field investigation with a retrospective search for pneumonia patients potentially linked to the market. The investigators found additional patients linked to the market, and on [30 Dec 2019], health authorities from Hubei Province reported this cluster to China CDC. The following day [31 Dec 2019], China CDC sent experts to Wuhan to support the investigation and control effort. Samples from these patients were obtained for laboratory analyses.

To identify potential cases, a temporary surveillance case definition for the VPUE was established at that time that was consistent with previous "pneumonia of unknown etiology" definitions: an illness of unknown etiology with 1) fever with or without a recorded temperature; 2) radiographic evidence of pneumonia; 3) low or normal leukocyte count or low lymphocyte count during the early stage of disease; and 4) no improvement or worsening symptoms after 3 to 5 days of antimicrobial treatment per standard clinical guidelines (3).

A probable case of VPUE [viral pneumonia of unknown etiology] was defined as a surveillance VPUE case or an illness of unknown etiology fulfilling the 1st 3 surveillance VPUE case criteria with a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan or any other VPUE case.

The initial laboratory screening results from patients were negative for 26 common respiratory pathogens, including influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and other common respiratory viruses. On [3 Jan 2020], the sequence of novel beta-genus coronaviruses (2019-nCoV) was determined from specimens collected from patients in Wuhan by scientists of the National Institute of Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC), and 3 distinct strains have been established (2). On [7 Jan 2020], this novel coronavirus was confirmed to be the pathogenic cause of this VPUE cluster, and the disease has been designated NCIP.

Epidemiological findings
------------------------
Patients' clinical manifestations were consistent with viral pneumonia. Most patients had severe and nonproductive cough following illness onset, some had dyspnea, and almost all had normal or decreased leukocyte counts and radiographic evidence of pneumonia.

Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has western and eastern sections, and 15 environmental specimens collected in the western section were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through RT-PCR testing and genetic sequencing analysis. Despite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.

As of [19 Jan 2020], 198 cases of NCIP have been reported in Wuhan with 110 (55.6%) cases reported in males. The median age was 57 years old with a range of 26 to 89 years. As of this day, 25 patients have recovered and have been discharged from medical care, and 3 patients have died. A total of 170 patients are receiving isolated medical treatment at designated Wuhan medical facilities. Among these patients, 126 are classified to have mild illnesses, 35 have severe illnesses, and 9 are in critical condition. A total of 817 close contacts of cases have been placed under quarantine for medical observation, of which 727 have been cleared and 90 remain in quarantine. No cases of NCIP have been found among the close contacts.

A total of 16 health care workers (HCWs) are believed to have been infected while caring for patients from the outbreak; 15 have confirmed NCIP, and 1 HCW is still under being verified.

Two clusters containing 2 cases and 3 cases, respectively, were identified among the confirmed cases. Human-to-human transmission appears to have occurred in the 2-person cluster.

The epidemiological investigation of 198 confirmed cases revealed that 22% of patients had direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market before illness onset; 32% of patients had contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms; and 51% of cases had neither visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market nor had contact with similar patients before their illness onset.

Preliminary conclusions
-----------------------
This outbreak was detected in Wuhan in late December 2019 and was caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Although investigation into the source or sources of NCIP is ongoing, exported cases have been reported by Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, and other provinces in China, indicating that the epidemic is ongoing in Wuhan and that further spread is almost certain.

During the investigation, the following was concluded: 1) recently-reported, confirmed cases have had no history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market; 2) human-to-human transmission has occurred; and 3) HCWs have been shown to have been infected by the novel coronavirus. Based on this information, transmission within communities is believed to be taking place in Wuhan.

Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented, including use of personal protective equipment (surgical masks), school closures, postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings, and exit screenings.

Hong Kong confirms its 1st case
-------------------------------
Hong Kong confirmed its 1st case of a new flu-like coronavirus on [Wed 22 Jan 2020] following an outbreak in the central mainland China city of Wuhan, local broadcasters RTHK, Cable TV, and TVB said, citing unnamed sources.

The outbreak, which began in Wuhan [Hubei], has spread to more Chinese cities including the capital Beijing, Shanghai, and Macau and cases have been reported outside the country's borders, in South Korea, Thailand, and Japan.

The patient arrived in Hong Kong via high-speed railway from the mainland, and has been quarantined at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, the reports said.

The Hospital Authority on [Tue 21 Jan 2020] enhanced laboratory surveillance for pneumonia cases, to include patients with travel history to all of mainland China, rather than just Wuhan.

Hong Kong had deployed temperature screening machinery at the airport and the high-speed rail station. Air passengers are required to fill in health declaration forms. Some 500 isolation wards at public hospitals were available, with more ordinary wards to be converted if necessary.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of the crown-like spikes on their surfaces that cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade. According to WHO figures, 1755 people in Hong Kong contracted the SARS virus at the time and 299 died. The SARS virus remains engrained in Hongkongers' memory. Many of the city's residents wear surgical masks often, shopping malls provide sanitizers at receptions, staff at office buildings and condominiums clean door handles and elevator buttons several times a day.

Macau confirms 1st case of Wuhan virus
--------------------------------------
Macau confirmed on [Wed 22 Jan 2020] its 1st case of pneumonia linked to an outbreak of a newly identified coronavirus and tightened temperature screening measures in casinos and around the city.

The patient is a 52-year-old businesswoman from Wuhan who reported to hospital on [Tue 21 Jan 2020], said Macau Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Ao Leong Lu, who vicechairs a committee set up to respond to the virus. The woman took a high-speed train to the Chinese city of Zhuhai on [19 Jan 2020], then a shuttle bus to Macau. She had dinner with 2 friends, then went to the hotel and spent a long time in casinos. She was in a stable condition in an isolation ward. Her 2 friends were also being monitored and were in isolation.

Speaking at a news conference in Macau, Ao and other officials said authorities were coordinating with 6 gaming enterprises to introduce temperature screening machines at all entrances into casinos.

A total of 405 guest entrances and 47 staff entrances have already been provided with portable screening devices and all casino staff had to wear surgical masks. All performers and staff at the events hosted across Macau will be screened. Entry points into Macau will also have temperature checks and visitors will be asked to fill in a health declaration form. Bus stops, taxi stands and wet markets will be cleaned more frequently. The tourist-magnet casino industry in Macau, which returned to Chinese rule in 1999, accounts for more than 80% of the revenue in the city of 600 000 people. Macau is a popular Lunar New Year destination for mainland Chinese.

The virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year [2019], has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan and the United States confirmed its 1st case on [Tue 21 Jan 2020].

The virus has caused alarm in China and abroad because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. The coronavirus is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there "is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease", National Health Commission vice minister Li Bin said at a news conference on Wednesday [22 Jan 2020].

15 medical personnel are among those infected in China. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and can be passed from person to person.

Though the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market.

Since the beginning of the year [2020] this new virus, known as 2019-nCoV, which is reportedly a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans has been causing alarm in Wuhan, China, where it originated in a local market which sold illegal wildlife.

Chiang Mai airport together with the public health office, and the disease control department of Chiang Mai has set up thermo-scanning machines to check and screen passengers from Wuhan to CNX [Chiang Mai, Thailand]. The public health office of Chiang Mai reported that only 5 cases were found to be possible patients but later 2 were found to be not affected and currently, 3 are under close monitoring. The office added that people should not be panicking and not to believe in rumours.

However, as of [21 Jan 2020], reporters found that one boy from Wuhan with high fever of 38.2 C [100.8 F] was screened to be treated at Nakonping Hospital where there is a restricted area for treatment. Around 3 pm on the same day, Dr Jatuchai Maneerat, public health doctor and Dr Sumet Ongwandee, director of Chiang Mai disease control department held a press announcement to confirm the patient boy to be affected by the new virus. Blood samples were sent to Chulalongkorn Hospital for further testing (which will take two days).

Public health office and disease control department of Chiang Mai still asks people not to panic as WHO still has not declared the spread of the Wuhan virus as an emergency, and medical staff in charge are still monitoring the situation closely.

[6] Vaccine development

https://q13fox.com/2020/01/20/vaccine-for-new-chinese-coronavirus-in-the-works/


The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus that has infected hundreds and killed 4 [now 17] in Asia. "The NIH is in the process of taking the 1st steps towards the development of a vaccine," said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci said it would take a few months until the 1st phase of the clinical trials get underway and more than a year until a vaccine might be available.

The latest
----------
The virus, which was first reported at the end of December [2019], has infected more than 200 people, according to a Chinese government-appointed expert. The bulk of the cases have been in China, but there have been 4 cases in Thailand, South Korea, and Japan. The virus originated in animals and can be spread from person to person. While most of the patients visited an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, a city about 700 miles [about 1127 km] south of Beijing, some did not.

This new virus is a coronavirus, which is the same family as the virus that causes SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was first reported in Asia in 2003 and killed more than 700 people. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which has killed more than 800 people since 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.

Working on a vaccine
--------------------
A team of scientists in Texas, New York, and China are also at work on a vaccine, according to Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats," Hotez said. He added that it's less challenging to develop a vaccine for coronaviruses than for other viruses such as HIV or influenza. "Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target," Hotez said.

If a vaccine is developed, he said, health care workers might be among the 1st to receive it because they're exposed to infected patients.

It is "remarkable" that scientists are able to start developing a vaccine for a virus that was identified less than a month ago, he said. He credited Chinese researchers, who quickly sequenced and published the virus's genome. "With SARS, it took almost a year to be able to identify and map the full genetic code," he said. "Now we're doing this in just a few weeks."

'An evolving situation'
-----------------------
Fauci emphasized there are still many questions about this new virus. "This is an evolving situation, and it's tough to predict ultimately where it will go," he said. "But we have to take it very seriously." A few things are clear. One, the virus jumped from animals to humans, just like SARS did nearly 2 decades ago. He added it's unclear whether just one type of animal is transmitting the virus to humans, or more than one type.

He also said while it's clear this new virus can be spread from person to person, it's unclear how easily that spread can happen. "Is it a continual spread? Is it sustained? We're not quite sure yet," he said.

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed there are many questions. "This is one of those inflection moments in outbreak history where we have enough information to be very concerned, but not enough information to say this is going to be an international crisis," he said.

Of new pneumonia epidemic prevention and control headquarters

In order to fully do a good job in the prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic of the new type of coronavirus infection, effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people, the relevant matters are notified as follows:

From 10:00 on [23 Jan 2020], the city's urban bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger transportation will be suspended; for no special reason citizens should not leave Wuhan, and the airport and train station from the Han corridor will be temporarily closed.

[In a similar announcement, a media report was released saying the Mayor of Wuhan says Stay away (China Daily http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/22/WS5e27890ca3101282172729d5.html. Given the rapid spread of this virus (2019-nCoV) outside of Wuhan City into 25 provinces (including autonomous areas and municipalities) and the identified person-to-person transmission, one wonders if this measure will have a significant impact on reducing the transmission of this virus. Time will tell. I hope I am wrong and this has a positive impact. - Mod.MPP]
