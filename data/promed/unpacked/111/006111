Endogenous Retrovirus Expression Linked to Schizophrenia
--------------------------------------------------------
A virus which hijacks part of the human genetic code may have some link to
the mental illness schizophrenia. The retrovirus may have invaded human DNA
millions of years ago and been carried down through generations, say
scientists. The experts believe that some activity from the endogenous
retrovirus may have some unknown effect on the brain, perhaps contributing
to a number of cases of schizophrenia.
A study by a team headed by Dr. Robert Yolken at the Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine in Baltimore tested both diagnosed schizophrenics and healthy
volunteers for traces of the retrovirus. They found an "unexpectedly" high
level of the retroviral traces in cerebrospinal fluid taken from the
schizophrenics, compared to very little in the other study subjects. Their
findings will be published in the journal Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the USA. But the authors warned that their findings
did not represent the complete answer to the genesis of schizophrenia.
Endogenous retroviruses perpetuate themselves by mixing their code with the
cells that are part of the "germ line." It can then be passed down to
offspring, be present in every cell in the body, then proceed onwards down
through the generations. Through mutations, most of these sequestered
retroviruses become inactivated over this huge period, although a few
retain -- or regain -- some form of activity, and can produce the RNA which
has been detected by these experiments.
The Johns Hopkins scientists found the distinct RNA signature of a
particular endogenous retrovirus, called HERV-W, in the DNA of 29 percent
of schizophrenia patients with the acute form the disease, and 7 percent of
those with the chronic form. Dr Yolken said that: "While a low level of
retrovirus expression occurs in most human tissues, we found an
unexpectedly high level of expression in the cerebrospinal fluids of
individuals who'd had a recent onset of schizophrenia. While our report
doesn't explain why the retrovirus becomes active in the first place, it
presents clues as to what may happen when it does become active. Our
ultimate hope is that we can interfere with the retrovirus by preventing it
from becoming active. If we can do that, it may give doctors another method
of treating schizophrenia."
A spokesman for the National Schizophrenia Fellowship said that the finding
should not be interpreted as a "definitive" analysis of the cause of
schizophrenia. "Schizophrenia remains poorly understood, but is almost
certainly an umbrella term covering a range of conditions with a number of
common symptoms."

[This may seem a rather tenuous association, but it perhaps suggests that
genetic, environmental or physiological processes facilitating the
expression of the endogenous retroviruses present in us all could mimic the
occurrence of epidemic disease.
