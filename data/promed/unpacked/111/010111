The European Commission has been informed of an outbreak of bluetongue in
France, close to the border with Belgium. The virus was confirmed in cattle
in the Ardennes region, within the 150 km restriction zone already set up
in response to outbreaks in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. The
French authorities have established a 20 km protection zone around the
outbreak, in which a movement ban will apply to all ruminants, other than
those who have received veterinary approval for transport for direct
slaughter or to another holding within the restriction zone. The Commission
will meet with the chief veterinary officers of the Netherlands, Belgium,
France, Germany, and Luxembourg tomorrow, to ensure a fully coordinated
response by the member states to the bluetongue situation. The issue will
be addressed again by member states veterinary experts in the Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health next week.

The deadly livestock virus that has taken the Netherlands, Belgium, and
Germany [and now France as well; see above. - Mod.AS] by surprise this
month did not come from southern Europe, as researchers had suspected. A
genetic analysis, announced yesterday [28 Aug 2006], has shown that the
bluetongue virus almost certainly originated in Africa, deepening the
mystery of how it reached northern Europe.

First seen in the Netherlands on 14 Aug 2006, the virus, which infects
ruminants and is transmitted by Culicoides biting midges, has spread to
more than 70 farms in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany [and now also
to a not-yet-specified number of locations in France. - Mod.AS]. Bluetongue
sickens primarily sheep and goats and is not harmful to humans.

There are 24 known serotypes of the virus, and over the past 8 years, a
handful of them had made dramatic incursions from Turkey and the Middle
East into southern European countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, and the
Balkan nations. Hence, scientists had assumed that the disease's arrival in
northern Europe marked another leap north from one of these areas.

The leap is much bigger than they thought. Frantic days of genetic testing,
completed very early Saturday morning at the Institute for Animal Health
(IAH) in Pirbright, United Kingdom, has revealed the virus to be of
serotype 8, previously known to occur only in sub-Saharan Africa, South
America, and the Indian subcontinent, says Peter Mertens, who heads IAH's
arthropodborne virus research group. Its genetic fingerprint is closest to
that of a virus isolated in Nigeria in 1982, which means it almost
certainly came from Africa, Mertens says.

But how? There's almost no traffic of ruminants between Africa and Europe,
says epidemiologist Aline de Koeijer of the Central Institute for Animal
Disease Control (CIDC) in Lelystad, the Netherlands. Perhaps an imported
zoo animal was infected, she suggests; veterinary authorities in the
affected countries are trying to track down possible culprits. An infected
midge may also have hitched a ride on an airplane, as happens occasionally
with malaria-infected mosquitoes. Yet it would then have to find its way to
a farm.

The current outbreak is unusual in that some cows have gotten sick --
normally, they are infected without clinical symptoms -- but it's unclear
whether this is typical of serotype 8, which has been studied very little,
says CIDC virologist Eugene van Rooij [see commentary].

Once introduced, the virus may have benefited from the warm weather, which
speeds up its life cycle, says medical and veterinary entomologist Willem
Takken of Wageningen University in the Netherlands; July was the hottest
month on record in the affected areas. Scientists are certain that the
outbreak will subside as temperatures drop; they can only hope that the
northern European winter will kill off all infected midges and prevent a
2007 sequel.

PARIS (Dow Jones): The French Agriculture and Fishery ministry said on
Thursday that a case of bluetongue disease, or catarrhal fever has been
detected in a milk cow in the north east of France.

In a press statement, the ministry said safety and sanitary measures have
been put immediately into place in the Ardennes region. It said the disease
affects only ruminants, not humans and not meat or milk consumption.

The disease has affected sheep, cattle, and goats in the Mediterranean
region and recently appeared in Northern Europe, in Belgium and the
Netherlands.

The French government reinforced monitoring of the disease on 23 Aug
because of the evolution of the disease in Belgium, near France's northern
border.

The disease, which is non-contagious, is transmitted by midges.

The ministry called on French farmers to closely monitor their stock and
notify veterinarians of any suspicious symptoms. The government also said
measures would be re-evaluated depending on the evolution of the situation.

[Dr Eugene van Rooij is one of the 3 authors of an analysis performed in
2003 to evaluate the risk of bluetongue and West Nile fever entering the
Netherlands. Their recommendations included the intensification of
entomological surveillance and research, particularly related to the
competence of endemic culicoides species for virus transmission, and the
early preparation of a crisis scenario.

Of interest, and probably not surprisingly, the authors suggested that one
possible source of bluetongue introduction was southern Europe. The
possibility of bluetongue introduction from Africa was not discussed, as
far as this moderator was able to assess. For the full text (in Dutch) of
the said risk analysis, by ARW Elbers, PA van Rijn and EMA van Rooij, see
CIDC Rapport 2003-2, 3 Nov 2003 at
<http://www.cidc-lelystad.wur.nl/NR/rdonlyres/902C6232-5DBB-4CCA-86DA-93802EB0DA16/11385/RiskAssessmentBT.pdf>.

Another paper which deserves subscribers' attention is: BR Hoara, TE
Carpentera, RS Singer, IA Gardnera. Probability of introduction of exotic
strains of bluetongue virus into the US and into California through
importation of infected cattle. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 2004; 66: 79-91.

We are grateful to Christian Griot for bringing the above paper to our
attention. Dr Griot also raised an interesting question: the possible
introduction of infected culicoides in conjunction with the transport of
horses from BT-infected countries, either within the regular international
trade or for special events, such as equestrian games.

A reasonable next step would be to take a careful, thorough look at the
past traffic of animals originating from sub-Saharan Africa into or on
their transit through the countries involved and monitoring the activities
of wildlife dealers in the region.

The French Ministry of Agriculture has issued 2 press releases, referring
to the 1st and 2nd bluetongue cases diagnosed in cows near the Belgian
frontier. The 1st case occurred in Brognon (Lat 49:55:46N, Lon4:17:08E, map
at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=49.9293&lon=4.2856&scale=200000&icon=x>)
in a cow with slight clinical signs (lameness). See
<http://www.agriculture.gouv.fr/spip/leministere.leministrelecabinet.communiquesdepresse_a6317.html>.

The 2nd case was diagnosed in a clinically unaffected cow at Beaurieux
(Lat: 50:10:33N ; Lon: 4:07:38E Map
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.1759&lon=4.1272&scale=200000&icon=x>).
It was discovered in the framework of the surveillance for bluetongue
within the 150 km restricted zone. See
