Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc. is recalling several products after health
officials in Wisconsin suspected a link between flour tortillas and
an outbreak of illness at 3 schools.

The Chicago-based company told the state of Wisconsin it will
voluntarily recall the products as a precaution while the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) continues to investigate. But the company
is still not sure its products caused the reported symptoms, said
Marcy Toledo, Del Rey's general manager.

"We're testing the product and looking to see where this is coming
from," Toledo told The Journal Times in Racine. "We haven't received
any complaints yet about illnesses." She did not return a message
left by The Associated Press on 13 Nov 2007.

More than 80 students at 3 schools in Racine reported flu-like
symptoms earlier in November 2007 that included vomiting, according
to health officials. The Racine Unified School District closed 2
middle schools and an elementary school for a day for disinfection.

Health officials in Wisconsin said Fri 9 Nov 2007 they suspected soft
flour tortillas may be responsible for the outbreak. An exact cause
of the outbreak has still not been found. State health officials said
Del Rey made the flour tortillas served at the 3 Racine schools where
illnesses were reported.

Del Rey recalled some tortillas in 2006 when consumers complained of
stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and headaches, according to
the FDA.

The products in question were distributed nationwide through food
distributors and grocery stores. Del Rey has not specified states
involved in the recall beyond Illinois and Wisconsin. Consumers
should immediately return any product that is subject to the recall
to the store where they purchased it for a full refund or replacement.

The recall includes flour tortillas of all sizes: White Flour
Tortillas; Tortillas de Harina (6 inch); Burritos 2, 3, and 4; and
Fajita 8 inch size. The recalled tortillas all have the name "Del
Rey" on the label and are stamped with one of these Date Codes:
OCT/17/07; OCT/20/07; OCT/24/07; NOV/04/07; NOV/10/07; or NOV/11/07.

Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc., Chicago, Illinois is announcing the recall
of its flour tortilla products.

Included in the recall are flour tortillas of all sizes [White Flour
Tortillas; Tortillas de Harina (6 inch); Burritos 2, 3, and 4 inch;

one of these Date Codes: OCT/17/07; OCT/20/07; OCT/24/07; NOV/04/07;
NOV/10/07; or NOV/11/07.

Illinois state officials have told us that they believe there is a
connection between the tortillas and recent illnesses in Racine, WI
schools, in which students experienced vomiting, nausea and abdominal
cramps. If you experience symptoms of this type, you should consult a
health professional.

State officials have told us that they do not believe the problem
involves microbial contamination. Del Rey is not certain that its
products caused the reported symptoms, but is recalling the product
nevertheless as a precaution while its investigation continues. This
recall does not affect any other Del Rey products. The products were
distributed nationwide through food distributors and grocery stores.

Flour tortillas manufactured by Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc. have been
recalled after dozens of students in Wisconsin became ill after
eating the products. While health officials still do not know what
contaminant is responsible for the food poisoning outbreak, they have
determined that all of the sickened students ate Del Rey flour
tortillas before becoming ill. Del Rey Tortilleria decided to issue
the flour tortilla recall as a precaution.

While Del Rey insisted yesterday [13 Nov 2007] that the flour
tortilla recall was only a precaution, this is not the 1st time the
Chicago-based company has issued a recall after mysterious outbreak
of food poisoning. In January 2006, Del Rey recalled 4 varieties of
flour tortillas after they were suspected of making people sick. At
that time, the company's tortillas were linked to an illness outbreak
in December 2005 that sickened 53 students and 3 staff members at 5
middle schools in Illinois. People stricken in that outbreak also
complained of stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and
headaches. The source of that food poisoning outbreak has never been
determined. However, lab results following a 2003 outbreak in
Massachusetts found elevated levels of 2 chemical additives used in
the production of Del Rey tortillas: potassium bromate and calcium
propionate. The levels were elevated compared to common industry
practices, according to the CDC. A recent smaller outbreak associated
with flour tortillas occurred in September [year unclear - Mod.LL] in
Iowa.

Most of the illnesses associated with the recalled Del Rey tortillas
have occurred within a day of a person eating the product. The
symptoms last about 24 hours and appear to have no long-term health
consequences.

[ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this outbreak,
how strong the association is with the presumptive tortilla
reservoir, and what is found regarding the etiology. An illness
lasting not much more than 24 hours associated primarily with
vomiting suggests a toxin, either biologic in origin such as
staphylococcal enterotoxin or a contaminating chemical. No
information is clearly given regarding other states in which the
product was distributed.

The original report of the outbreak can be found at:
<http://www.wisn.com/news/14474828/detail.html>.
Racine is in southeastern Wisconsin bordering Lake Michigan, and its
location can be found at:
