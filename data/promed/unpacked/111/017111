The UK Government has been summoned to the High Court to answer charges
that it violated European Union law by refusing to let a Swedish cat travel
with its owner to Britain. The case could lead to compensation claims for
more than bps 200 million. If the Government loses, Britain's tough
anti-rabies rules, which require all imported pets, regardless of origin or
health status, to spend six months in quarantine, would become null and
void. The Ministry of Agriculture could face claims for the money that pet
owners estimate they have spent on quarantine fees since Britain joined the
EU in 1973.
The landmark hearing, fixed for March 15 and 16, seems certain to force the
Government to relax quarantine much sooner than envisaged under plans for a
partial phase-out over three to four years. The plaintiff is the Quarantine
Abolition Fighting Fund [QUAFF, a pet owners' pressure group that was
granted leave by the High Court last February to apply for judicial review.
The hearing will turn on the Ministry of Agriculture's refusal in June 1997
to permit Matt Geiden, a Swedish member of Quaff, to travel to Britain with
his 16-year-old cat, known as His Imperial Highness Tigee, without having
to undergo quarantine.
Sweden, which dropped quarantine regulations in 1994, has been free of
rabies since the late 19th century, far longer than Britain. Tigee had been
vaccinated against rabies and blood-tested to prove its immunity to the
disease. Lawyers for Quaff will argue that the quarantine requirement is a
violation of the freedom of movement for persons and goods guaranteed by
the Treaty of Rome.
Although member states may limit freedom of movement to protect public
health, Britain would have to show that quarantine was the only effective
safeguard against rabies, says Quaff. That line of defence was undermined
in September by a government-commissioned report from the Advisory Group on
Quarantine, chaired by Ian Kennedy, Professor of Health Law, Ethics and
Policy at University College London. The group recommended that quarantine
should be ended for pets travelling to and from other members of the EU,
plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein and rabies-free countries such as
Australia and New Zealand. The group proposed a system based on
vaccination, blood tests and microchip identification. Even that would go
beyond what is required in many other EU states.
One important gain would be the removal of the incentive to smuggle pets
into Britain to avoid quarantine. About 100 such cases are detected every
year and the real number is thought to be ten times higher.
The Ministry of Agriculture is expected to plead that it is in the process
of changing the law and there would be administrative chaos if the system
were abandoned overnight.
