100 000 birds culled in Sweden after salmonella outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
Authorities in southern Sweden have culled more than 100 000 hens and
chickens to stem what was believed to be the country's biggest
salmonella outbreak in poultry in 10 years, officials said Tuesday [6
Feb 2007].
The situation was under control, and authorities said the risk of
humans being infected by the food-borne illness was minimal. "It's
too far back in the production line to really pose a risk to
consumers," said Lennart Sjoland county veterinarian in the southern
Skane region. "The scope of this outbreak is the worst in at least
the past 10 years," he said.
The birds were slaughtered after salmonella was found in birds at 7
farms in southern Sweden. The source of the outbreak was unclear, but
Sjoland said the bacteria could have spread from infected mice, rats,
or through the feed.
Pia Gustafsson, a veterinarian at the Swedish Poultry Meat
Association, said that salmonella outbreaks among poultry in Sweden
were "so rare that almost no one remembers the last time it happened."

[Spread between 7 farms by rats and mice? Pull the other one! If it
were due to hitchhiking rodents it would have taken quite some time
to have been completed and at any point in that cycle discovery would
surely be likely. Logically it is a common contaminated feed but how
feed delivered to 6 or 7 different farms got contaminated would be
interesting in itself. If anyone can tell us what serotype(s) is/are
involved it would be helpful. - Mod. MHJ]
