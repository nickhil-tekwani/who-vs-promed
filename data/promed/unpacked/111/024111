"Australia is well prepared to deal with a case of avian influenza should it occur in poultry here. There have been 7 minor incidents of highly pathogenic avian influenza (all involving types of avian influenza that have not caused disease in humans) in Australia, the last being in 2013. Each was eradicated before the disease was able to significantly spread. Workers involved with diseased poultry did not become infected with avian influenza in any of these outbreaks. Australia has a surveillance program to detect incursions of avian influenza.

"Animal health authorities have had contingency plans in place for many years to minimize the impact of an outbreak of avian influenza in Australia. These procedures are outlined in the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN; https://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/our-publications/ausvetplan-manuals-and-documents/). AUSVETPLAN describes the response measures that will be used should an outbreak occur, including the culling of infected birds, disposal method used for carcasses and sanitary measures that will be adopted at infection sites to contain the disease."
