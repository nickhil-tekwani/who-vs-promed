A highly contagious disease has been found in an North-east bee colony. 2 bee yards, or apiaries, near St Cyrus [Aberdeenshire, Scotland] have been found to contain the American foulbrood (AFB) infection, which has a characteristic foul smell.

There is no treatment for the infection and bee hives containing infected larvae must be destroyed to stop the disease spreading.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: "The disease was confirmed on [Mon June 13 2016] following laboratory diagnosis by Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture.

"The AFB infected hives have been destroyed as there is no permitted treatment for the disease in the UK.

"There are no risks to public health from AFB and no implications for the quality and safety of honey."

A ban is now in force on the movement of bees and related equipment into or out of the affected area.

Classic signs of the disease are sunken cappings on cells, which when uncapped reveal dead larvae in various stages of decomposition.

Beekeepers have been urged to register on BeeBase [http://www.nationalbeeunit.com], the national bee database, which will give them access to up-to-date information on the control of AFB and bee related issues.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
