More cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the Bell County area. As of Monday, 19 Mar 2012, there are 14 confirmed cases in both Belton and Temple, with 8 probable cases that have yet to be confirmed. The health department is expecting more cases to surface. While the cases are, for the most part, not connected, it is still vital to recognize symptoms early.

"We have had 2 cases in the same grade level that have been confirmed," says Community Health Services Supervisor Judy Butler.

Last November 2011, WCHL reported that a kindergartner in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro school system had developed the disease. That student was also at Carrboro elementary.

Butler says school system parents should take a few basic precautions. "Have your child fully vaccinated and to be alert for symptoms in your child and if they do have symptoms, consult your physician." says Butler. "Keep the child away from infants, pregnant women, and people are immunocompromised in particular. If whooping cough is strongly suspected, they need to stay away from everyone."

On average, Orange County sees about 3 cases of whooping cough per year. But Butler says those numbers have been going up in recent years.

"2008-2009 was a big year; there were 29 cases. Then in 2010, 2; 2011 we had 3 and we've had more in 2012," says Butler. "Alamance [County] is also having a significant outbreak."

Although the pertussis vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, Butler says those who have been immunized tend to have milder cases if they do develop the disease. All North Carolina children are required by law to receive a vaccination.

Great Valley School District alerted parents Monday morning, 19 Mar 2012, that a student at General Wayne Elementary School was diagnosed with pertussis, also known as whooping cough.

The new case is the 7th confirmed case of pertussis in the Great Valley School District. There have been 4 in Great Valley High School, 1 in Great Valley Middle School, 1 in Kathryn D. Markley Elementary School and the latest in General Wayne.

According to Betsy Walls, director of Personal Health Services in the Chester County Department of Health, "What we're seeing nationally is that [for] people who have the vaccine and have received age-appropriate dosing, there's a point where protection seems to be waning and people become susceptible to pertussis."

A policy change was recently enacted to mandate that all students entering seventh grade have the vaccine, according to Walls.

2 more cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been confirmed in Kittitas County. Health officials say one child is home schooled while the other is a student at Damman School.

The Health Department says anyone who is not up-to-date on their whooping cough vaccines should not visit Damman School for 21 days, as a precaution.

This is the 3rd pertussis case in Kittitas County in 2012 and 8 people have been hospitalized in Washington state already in 2012.

20 people have been diagnosed with pertussis in Jefferson County so far in 2012, and 1 person has been hospitalized in the last week. In all of 2011, there was only 1 person in Jefferson County to be stricken with what is more commonly known as whooping cough. The person hospitalized spent one night under observation.

"We really want to make sure infants are protected," Jefferson County Public Health supervisor Julia Danskin said on Tuesday, 13 Mar 2012. "We've seen grandparents come through wanting to be immunized. So I think we have increased awareness a lot."

80 percent of the people who contracted pertussis this year have not been fully immunized, Danskin said. But there is no specific school or community that is being hit more than another, she said.

Ages of those diagnosed with pertussis range from a 6-month-old child to a 14-year-old and 3 adults, whose ages were not available.

With a recent increase in whooping cough cases, the Tompkins County Health Department is focusing efforts to educate the public to contain the disease. "There are more cases than we saw in all of 2011," Tompkins County Public Health Director Frank Kruppa said Tuesday, 13 Mar 2012.

As of 13 Mar 2011, there were 15 pertussis cases recorded in 2012, 2 more than in all of 2011. The disease normally occurs more frequently in the winter, although cases can happen any time of year.

This manuscript (Witt MA, Katz PH, Witt DJ: Unexpectedly limited durability of immunity following acellular pertussis vaccination in pre-adolescents in a North American outbreak. Clin Infect Dis. (2012) doi: 10.1093/cid/cis287) is one of the 1st detailed analyses of a recent North American pertussis outbreak found widespread disease among fully vaccinated older children. Starting approximately 3 years after prior vaccine dose, attack rates markedly increased, suggesting inadequate protection or durability from the acellular vaccine.

"Abstract
---------
Background: Despite widespread childhood vaccination against _Bordetella pertussis_, disease remains prevalent. It has been suggested that acellular vaccine may be less effective than previously believed. During a large outbreak, we examined the incidence of pertussis and effectiveness of vaccination in a well-vaccinated, well-defined community.

"Methods: Our center provides care to 135 000 patients, 40 percent of the population of Marin County, CA. 171 patients with a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for _B. pertussis_ from 1 Mar 2010 to 31 Oct 2010 were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographics and vaccination status.

"Results: We identified 171 cases of clinical pertussis; 132 in pediatric patients. There was a notable increase in cases in patients aged 8-12. The rate of testing peaked in infants, but remained relatively constant until age 12. The rate of positive tests was low for ages zero to 6, and increased in preadolescents, peaking at age 12. Vaccination rates of PCR positive preadolescents were approximately equal to that of controls. Vaccine effectiveness was 41 percent, 24 percent, 79 percent, for ages 2-7, 8-12, 13-18, respectively.

"Conclusions: Our data suggests that the current schedule of acellular pertussis vaccine doses is insufficient to prevent outbreaks of pertussis. We noted a markedly increased rate of disease from age 8 through 12, proportionate to the interval since the last scheduled vaccine. Stable rates of testing ruled out selection bias. The possibility of earlier or more numerous booster doses of acellular pertussis vaccine either as part of routine immunization or for outbreak control should be entertained."

This paper along with further observations regarding shifting of the antigenicity of the recent clones of _B. pertussis_ (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones Archive Number: 20120321.1076103) further underscore the need for potential revisions in the vaccine and vaccine schedule for pertussis prevention. - Mod.LL]
