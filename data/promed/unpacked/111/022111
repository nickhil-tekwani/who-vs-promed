New health zone affected by Ebola virus disease [EVD] in South Kivu
- A new health zone has been affected by EVD in South Kivu Province;
- This is a 24 year old woman and her 7 month old son. On the mother's side, symptoms of EVD began to appear on 4 Aug 2019 in Beni, but she died on 14 Aug 2019 in Mwenga after consulting 2 health facilities, namely the Kangolo and Kilingutu Health Center;
- The sample taken from the deceased tested positive on 15 Aug 2019 and her son was confirmed positive case MVE [maladie Ã  virus; ill with the Ebola virus] 15 Aug 2019. He has been put in isolation for treatment;
- According to initial investigations, the woman from Bukavu was living with a host family at the Mabolio Health Area in the Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. She was listed as a high-risk contact around a member of this family, confirmed MVE on 25 Jul 2019;
- On the 12th day of her follow-up, on 6 Aug 2019, there was an alert about her move to Bukavu by the teams of the response and she was found accompanied by her 2 children (5 years and 7 months) at the Point of entry (PoE) from Kasindi, bordering Uganda;
- During her return to Beni, she escaped the response teams and continued her way from Kasindi to Beni, Butembo, Goma, Bukavu to Mwenga.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/ebola-spreads-drc-provinces-cases-approach-2900
[byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the weekend, 2 remote regions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded cases of Ebola, suggesting previously unknown transmission chains in both North and South Kivu provinces.

According to Reuters, DRC officials today confirmed a new case of Ebola in the remote, militia-controlled territory of Walikale, which is 95 mi [about 153 km] north west of Goma. Goma recorded 4 cases of Ebola in the last 6 weeks, and it is unclear if the case in Walikale had any contact with other Ebola patients.

Reuters also reported the DRC confirmed a 3rd case in South Kivu region, which reported its 1st case late last week. South Kivu is more than 430 mi [about 692 km] from the outbreak's epicenter. The 1st cases in South Kivu were a mother and child who were likely exposed in Beni.

For almost a year, the DRC's Ebola outbreak--the 2nd largest in history--was contained to North Kivu and Ituri provinces along the country's eastern border. But this summer [2019] has seen the 1st cases in Goma and South Kivu in the DRC, as well as in Uganda, signaling that the virus may not be as contained as was previously thought.

WHO: 27 new cases in 3 days
---------------------------
A total of 27 new Ebola cases were confirmed over the last 3 days, raising the outbreak total 2888, according to the World Health Organization's online dashboard. A total of 387 suspected cases are under investigation, and there have been 21 newly recorded deaths, which raises the fatality total to 1934. Beni and Mandima have reported the most cases in the past 21 days.

[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In another discouraging, but not unexpected, development in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) battle against Ebola, health officials today [Fri 16 Aug 2019] reported the first 2 cases in South Kivu province.

In other developments, the DRC reported 9 more cases, and a United Nations (UN) agency announced USD 10 million more to support the outbreak response.

Mother, child infected in South Kivu
------------------------------------
WHO said on its Twitter feed today [Fri 16 Aug 2019] that the South Kivu cases were confirmed in a mother who died and her child who is being treated. South Kivu province --the 3rd to be affected in the outbreak-- neighbors North Kivu, where the main outbreak epicenters are located.

The mother is a 24 year old woman who had been identified as a high-risk contact of an Ebola patient in Beni, and had traveled to Mwenga in South Kivu province by bus, road, and boat with 2 of her children, Reuters reported today, citing a DRC government statement. She died the evening of [Tue 13 Aug 2019]. The 2 towns are about 473 mi [approx.761 km] apart and South Kivu province shares a border with Rwanda and Burundi.

The woman had been vaccinated, according to health officials, and the response team has identified 120 of her contacts and has immunized 20 of them. WHO said in its tweet that as soon as the Ebola alert was raised, response teams were on the ground ready to provide treatment, start tracing contacts, and begin vaccination.

The woman's likely exposure in Beni underscores concerns that the WHO has aired about persistent outbreak hot spots seeding illnesses to other parts of the DRC and to other countries. The cases in South Kivu follow recent spread of the virus to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.

New cases, more support for response
------------------------------------
In other developments, the DRC confirmed 9 more Ebola cases, lifting the overall outbreak total to 2861, according to the WHO online Ebola dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 353 suspected cases. A total of 8 more people have died from their infections, putting the fatality count at 1913.

Meanwhile, the United Nations said today [Fri 16 Aug 2019] that USD 10 million from its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will go to help people affected by the DRC's Ebola outbreak. According to a UN statement, the money will help strengthen early disease detection, boost prevention and control measures, provide psychosocial and nutritional support, and assist with community engagement.

Mark Lowcock, UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian relief and emergency coordinator, said the CERF money will help detect new cases faster and support those who have lost loved ones. "But we urgently need donors to provide sustained funding for the response at this critical juncture," he added.

The UN said the USD 10 million is in addition to USD 4.8 million it allocated to the Equateur province outbreak and earlier in the current outbreak and is separate from a USD 10 million CERF contribution to help key DRC neighbors--Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda--prepare for possible Ebola cases.

After the confirmed case of Ebola in South Kivu province, 100 km [about 62 mi] from the city of Bukavu, the Provincial Health Inspectorate announces that 2 helicopters from Goma landed in Chowe with a team of caregivers and medicines to strengthen the teams already in place.

This [Sat 17 Aug 2019], an emergency meeting will be held in Bukavu with the national level. On the other hand, the doctor Claude Bahizire, in charge of communication of the provincial inspection of the Health of South Kivu, calls the population to the respects of the hygienic norms. "We ask all families to observe the universal rules of hygiene, especially washing hands with soap or chlorinated water every time, which is very serious," insisted Claude Bahizirhe.

Note that in their game bags, there are vaccines and additional staff for good care.

- Fri 16 Aug 2019. South Kivu: virus spread
[Trust, abridged, edited]
http://news.trust.org/item/20190816163237-h0l1w/
[byline: Nellie Peyton]

Ebola's spread to a new part of Democratic Republic of Congo is a disturbing sign that health workers are failing to keep track of high-risk people on the move, aid agencies said on [Fri 16 Aug 2019]. A woman and her child were confirmed to be the first 2 Ebola cases in Congo's South Kivu province this week, after travelling more than 700 km [about 430 miles] south from where they likely caught the disease, according to officials. The outbreak had previously been contained to North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with a few cases in neighbouring Uganda.

The 24 year old woman had been identified as a high-risk contact of an Ebola patient in the city of Beni last month [July 2019], but travelled with her children by bus, boat and road for hundreds of miles before she died on [Tue 13 Aug 2019] night.

"This highlights a disturbing trend of cases originating from current hotspots which then leave the area and, despite the control measures in place along the corridor, are not detected," said Whitney Elmer, country director for charity Mercy Corps. "It is very concerning, especially given the efforts over the last few months to scale up the response," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

WHO deployed a rapid-response team and plans to vaccinate everyone in the village where the woman died, said Margaret Harris of WHO. The response has been hampered by militia violence causing people to flee and by mistrust of health workers, which has driven patients to hide symptoms and avoid detection.

South Kivu presents similar challenges to North Kivu in terms of insecurity and conflict, said Jamie LeSueur, Ebola response operations manager for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). "This is a stark reminder that we are still far from containing and ending Ebola in DR Congo," LeSueur said.

- Mon19 Aug 2019. Economic impact
[Mercy Corps, abridged, edited]
https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/Ebola_Economic_Impact_FINAL_Aug19.pdf

Mercy Corps has been a key partner in the DRC's Ebola response since [14 Aug 2018], responding with water, sanitation and hygiene, infection prevention control, and community engagement and mobilization, reaching almost 1 395 000 people. Mercy Corps' experience of community mobilization and engagement is based on our response during the 2014--2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Mercy Corps led a consortium of local and international partners in the largest community mobilization program in Liberia that reached more than 2.4 million people - half of the country's population, which ultimately helped to halt the spread of the disease in that country. Mercy Corps' research during the West Africa Ebola Crisis from 2014--2016 proved that any response to the Ebola outbreak must seek to save lives as well as livelihoods. Border closures and any measures that would see international trade suspended should be avoided at all costs.

This paper presents a brief summary of our learnings and experience from the West African epidemic on the economic impact of EVD outbreaks, and lays the foundation for future research into the DRC experience.

The Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) installed [on Sat 17 Aug 2019] at least 3 checkpoints and prevention against Ebola virus disease in the Virunga National Park.

Without providing figures, the ICCN's director of communication for Virunga National Park, Wenga Mulayi lamented a slight decline in the number of tourists visiting the park, since the announcement of the 1st Ebola case in the city of Goma and the declaration of the epidemic as a global health emergency. This, for him, constitutes a shortfall for the ICCN, but also for the country.

The 1st checkpoint at Rwindi Bridge on the Goma-Butembo axis in Rutshuru territory is already operational. The other 2 are being installed at the Semuliki bridge and Kambo ferry in the Beni territory, towards the border with Uganda, said Joel Wenga Mulayi, ICCN's director of communication for the Virunga National Park. According to him, by this project against the Ebola virus disease, the ICCN aims to contribute to the safety of travelers who cross the park, by monitoring their health.

Devices at these checkpoints include temperature testing, handwashing, but also passenger registration for a data bank, when needed.

[4] Geographic spread
- Mon 19 Aug 2019. Walikale
[Trust, abridged, edited]
http://news.trust.org/item/20190819092313-hbynl

The widening geographic spread of the virus, and its presence in yet another zone under the sway of armed groups, raises the risk of it spreading out of control. Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have confirmed a new case of Ebola in the remote, militia-controlled territory of Walikale, hundreds of km away from where previous cases near the border with Uganda and Rwanda occurred, the Health Ministry said overnight.

Pinga, the village where the case was reported, lies about 150 km [approx. 95 mi] northwest of Goma, one of the towns affected by the Ebola epidemic, and much further away from the epicentre of the epidemic in Butembo and Beni. The ministry data also showed a 3rd case confirmed in South Kivu region, which on [Fri 16 Aug 2019] reported its 1st cases, more than 700 km (430 mi) south of where the 1st case was detected. The widening geographic spread of the virus, and its presence in yet another zone under the sway of armed groups, raises the risk of it spreading out of control, even while the technical tools to rein it in are better than ever. Walikale is controlled almost entirely by a Mai Mai ethnic militia, surrounded by forest and difficult to access because of poor roads.

[5] Opinion. Eradication of Ebola
- Fri 16 Aug 2019
[New York Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/opinion/ebola-tuberculosis-cure.html? action= click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage
[byline: The Editorial Board]

New treatments for Ebola and drug-resistant tuberculosis offer hope, but they won't be successful on their own.

The global health community got a few pieces of hopeful news this week. On [Mon 12 Aug 2019] WHO announced that 2 newly developed intravenous drug therapies appear capable of curing Ebola. The medications could help end a continuing epidemic in DRC, where nearly 2800 people have been infected over the past year and more than 1800 have died. Combined with the recently developed Ebola vaccine, they could even help eradicate a disease that has killed more than 12 000 people over the past 4 decades.

Then, on [Wed 14 Aug 2019], the Food and Drug Administration effectively endorsed a 3-drug treatment that appears to cure so-called extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis -- the deadliest version of the world's deadliest infectious disease. Tuberculosis infects about 10 million people globally every year, and roughly 30 000 to 50 000 people are believed to be infected with the extensively drug-resistant strain, which is usually fatal.

Together, these developments could mark a pivotal moment in the century-long quest for global health security. But that quest will only succeed with the help of sustained, cross-border collaboration. For instance, countries need health systems capable of detecting disease outbreaks and delivering and monitoring these new treatments -- all of which require substantial funding. International policies must be in place to promote the use of the treatments, and affected communities need to trust the organizations charged with providing their care.

The latest effort to stamp out Ebola in Congo has faced some of these problems -- there's been a deep mistrust of global health workers, and WHO has received only half of the money that donors have promised to devote to the crisis. The fight against tuberculosis faces similar challenges, including a lack of global investment that has prevented medication and innovative diagnostics from reaching the people who need them most. Roughly a quarter of people believed to be infected with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis are properly treated for the disease, a problem that will need to be resolved quickly for the new drugs to have an impact.

Each of these challenges has been exacerbated by an increase in xenophobia around the globe. As the journalist Maryn McKenna wrote in The New Republic earlier this year [2019], "the assumption that every nation owes an investment in health to every other nation no longer holds." Nowhere is this shift more pronounced than in the United States, which until recently was a leader in global health. During the last Ebola outbreak, which spread across West Africa from 2014 -- 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deployed the largest number of personnel in that agency's history. By the time the crisis had resolved, the Obama administration had begun a global initiative to better protect the world from infectious disease threats. More than 60 countries ultimately participated.

In recent years, that leadership has all but evaporated. In the past 2 years, the Trump administration has dissolved the federal government's biosecurity directorate, scaled back its infectious disease prevention efforts, restricted development aid for countries like Congo, made several attempts to rescind foreign aid, including for global health, and pulled CDC workers from Congo's outbreak zones without a clear plan to send them back.

The administration has also announced policies meant to scare legal immigrants off public assistance programs, including for health care, to which they are legally entitled. Such policies imperil everyone: the more people who don't have access to vaccines or antibiotics, the greater the risk that an infectious disease will spread. That applies to diseases like Ebola that might arrive on American shores from other countries, but it also applies to diseases that are already here, like flu and measles. The only reliable way for a country to protect itself from these threats is for it to help other countries do the same.

The new medications for Ebola and tuberculosis are the product of years of investment and careful work. That investment could continue to pay off, but only if the United States and its partners around the world increase their global health efforts, instead of shrinking away from them.

[The implementation of the new treatments for Ebola and prevention of infection with vaccination have and will have in the future tremendous impact in controlling spread of Ebola once it is in the population. However, these tools will not eradicate Ebola virus. Since Ebola virus is zoonotic, there always will be sylvatic amplification cycles where the virus perpetuates. Thus people will become infected when they encroach on this cycle, in this case mostly by hunting and eating bushmeat. The vaccine can prevent humans from becoming infected in such circumstances. Rapid and inexpensive diagnostics would quickly determine etiology of illness when people present at a clinic, and effective treatment early in infection will help control disease. This is the framework of public health, rapid detection, response, control. But it requires the community to have well functioning clinics with trained health care workers, and trust from the community. In resource-poor countries, building and maintain a strong public health infrastructure is a challenge. Support from the worldwide community is necessary. - Mod.LK]
