A 21-year-old farmer died in Parauapebas, in Para [state], from
yellow fever according to the results of [laboratory] tests issued by
the Instituto Evandro Chagas, this Thursday 19 [Jun 2008].

According to the state secretariat of Health, the young man lived in
a rural area of the city and died on [9 Jun 2008]. The Secretariat
added that this is the 1st death due to this disease in the state in
2008. The farmer was admitted to the Belem city emergency clinic, but
it was not possible [at that time] to determine if he had dengue
hemorrhagic fever or yellow fever.
