WINNIPEG (CP) - Manitoba's first anthrax outbreak this year has left 9
cattle dead. Federal and provincial officials were hoping that because
the farm is relatively isolated in the community of Sprague, and
almost 20km away from the next nearest cattle operation, no other
farms will be affected by the outbreak.
Federal officials have been busy isolating and treating the animals
since first arriving at the farm of Holger Schoenbach on Sunday. "All
I know is they have vaccinated every animal," Alfred Schoenbach,
Holger's father, said Thursday. Dr. Blaine Thompson, a veterinary
program specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, said the
farmer's almost 400 cattle will be quarantined for 30 days. Thompson
said because the herd was only vaccinated on Sunday, more cattle could
die before the outbreak is stopped.
Provincial veterinarian Dr. Allan Preston said the dead cattle are
being burned in a shallow trench on the farmer's land.
Emerson MLA Jack Penner said many farmers had already vaccinated their
herds this year after last year's anthrax outbreak about 50 kilometres
away in Vita, Manitoba, the worst in almost 20 years. "Until last year
that area of the province had never seen the disease," said Thompson.
"This farmer will be able to use the land for his cattle, but to
minimize his risk he'll have to vaccinate his herd every year."
Anthrax can be in the soil for years, only causing an outbreak during
wet, hot weather like what the area, located about 140 kilometers
southeast of Winnipeg, has been experiencing. It was a common disease
among buffalo herds when they still freely roamed the prairie decades
ago, but the disease, contracted by eating grass, does not spread from
animal to animal.

[Why this outbreak has recurred, and in a patently isolated herd, must
await clarification. Last year, when talking to various involved
people, I came to understand that the ranchers in southern & SW
Manitoba had not been reporting cattle deaths routinely, and therefore
the disease might have been ticking over out of veterinary sight. This
rancher's neighbours may have prevented their herds coming down this
summer by their pre-emptive vaccination, something the Sprague rancher
clearly had not done.
As anthrax deaths normally cease by the 8th day after vaccination,
quarantine beyond 2 weeks is usually counterproductive. Also, we now
advise that herds be treated first with long-acting antibiotics and
then vaccinated about 9-12 days later, by which time the antibiotic
levels will have essentially disappeared and any residual antibiotic
will not kill the live vaccine. The initial antibiotics should stop
any incubating infections.
Burning infected carcasses is very important and the fewer that have
to be handled and burned, the better. Max Sterne used to say that, in
his experience in Natal, 3 years of herd vaccination was usually
adequate to prevent recurrences. - Mod.MHJ
