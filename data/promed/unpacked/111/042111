Mass food poisoning in Bahrain
------------------------------
Over 700 Bahrainis have been treated for the last 3 days at hospitals and
health centers for food poisoning, reportedly caused by contaminated
sandwiches served during a wedding celebration, in what is considered the
biggest mass poisoning case in the island's history.
The wedding took place in the Safala village, near the eastern island of
Sitra. Quoting government health officials, the Bahrain Tribune Monday said
the number of people affected had reached 750 by Sunday night. Most of the
people were discharged after treatment, but 9 were still in the Salmaniya
Medical Complex; 8 of them -- 7 children and one woman -- were in a stable
condition and one case was serious because the patient also had sickle cell
disease, the sources said.
The ministry of health was investigating the matter, the newspaper said,
adding that 3 teams have been formed to investigate the incident which is
thought to have been caused by sandwiches of egg, cheese, and mayonnaise
served at the wedding.
"The bakery which supplied the sandwiches has been ordered closed by the
Public Health Directorate at the ministry until the investigation is over,"
the sources said. Blood samples have been taken from all the bakery
employees who were involved in preparing the sandwiches. Samples of some of
the raw material used in the sandwiches have also been taken. The sources
said that the Communicable Diseases Section also took samples of the
leftover of sandwiches served at the wedding and sent them for
bacteriological analysis.

[As with the gastroenteritis outbreak in the Philippines (Gastroenteritis,
school - Philippines (Manila) 20020702.4655) the food apparently linked to
this outbreak is food that is often associated with outbreaks of
salmonellosis or staphylococcal toxin. The article above offers no hints to
the incubation period, so further narrowing the probable etiology is
difficult. More information on both the epidemiological and laboratory
investigations associated with this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
