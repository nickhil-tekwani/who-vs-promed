A 6-year-old child in Uyench soum (administrative subdivision) of Khovd [Hovd] Province in Mongolia was reported to be infected with bubonic plague in Western Mongolia, according to the country's National Center for Zoonotic Diseases (NCZD).

The child is now under isolation at a local hospital, said Nyamdorj Tsogbadrakh, director of the NCZD on Fri 17 Jul 2020. The child showed symptoms of high-grade fever and skin rashes after playing with a dead marmot, the official added.

A total of 7 suspected cases of bubonic plague have been reported across the country so far in 2020. 3 of which had been confirmed by laboratory test results. 2 cases of bubonic plague have been confirmed in Tsetseg soum in Khovd Province earlier in July 2020. A 15-year-old boy in Govi-Altai province died from bubonic plague last week. Up to 17 out of all 21 provinces in Mongolia are now at risk for the bubonic plague, according to the NCZD.

Health Minister Togtmol Munkhsaikhan has ordered all relevant officials to ensure that health organizations are ready, including training health workers in high-risk provinces and raising public awareness about the infectious disease.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse". - Mod.LL
