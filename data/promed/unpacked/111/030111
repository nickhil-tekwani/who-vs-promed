Peru reports foot-and-mouth outbreak, says controlled
--------------------------------------------
Peru has reported its 1st outbreak since 2000 of the highly contagious
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), saying 8 infected cattle and 80 animals in
contact with them have been slaughtered and more were being killed.
"It's been a fairly light outbreak, and now it is under control," Jose
Ochoa of the National Service of Agrarian Health (SENASA) said in an
interview with Reuters. Ochoa said the 3 establishments in Lurin, south of
Lima, where the disease was detected, had been sealed off.
FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals, and although Peru does not export beef,
it is keen to recover its FMD-free status because the virus can be
transported, for example, with fruit and vegetables. That could
potentially affect Peru's bid for a free-trade treaty with the United
States, which is free of the disease.
Ochoa said "more animals that were close (to those infected) are being
slaughtered now." He said it was unclear how many would be killed, but it
would be "many more." Some 800 other cattle had been in contact with those
infected, he said. "We believe that given the way we are handling it, this
accident will be overcome and won't affect Peru's status of having become
FMD-free," Ochoa said.
He noted that Britain had recovered its disease-free status after a
devastating outbreak confirmed in 2001 when 4 million animals were slaughtered.
Asked if the outbreak could harm Peru's bid to secure a free-trade treaty
with the United States, Ochoa said: "If we return to our status of being
FMD-free, no ... But it definitely could affect it if it were out of control."
Peru is a big exporter of limes, mangoes, asparagus and other agricultural
produce. It also exports live alpacas.
The 11 Jun 2004 outbreak -- Peru's first in 3 years and 7 months -- was in
an area where cattle are brought from other parts of the country to be
fattened. The area is one of 5 departments considered at risk of the
disease where livestock are vaccinated. Peru's other 19 departments are
FMD-free without vaccination.
The country is seeking the World Organization for Animal Health's (OIE)
stamp of approval of southern Peru as an area completely free of the
disease without vaccination and will be reviewed on that in October, Ochoa
said.
In the wake of the outbreak, SENASA was controlling cattle movement to
prevent the spread of the disease to central and southern areas and stepped
up other checks.
Brazil on Thursday reported an outbreak of the FMD disease, but Ochoa said
there was no link. "Our research shows it is most likely that the virus
came in from the north (of Peru)," he said, referring to Piura, near the
border with Ecuador. That is another at-risk area where cattle are
vaccinated under a USD 5 million-a-year national eradication program
sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and in place since
1998.
In northern Peru there is contraband where Ecuadorian animals are passed
off as Peruvian, he said.
Ochoa said Peru's neighbors Ecuador, Bolivia and Brazil all have
foot-and-mouth disease in some areas. Chile and Colombia, however, are free
of the disease. Ecuador and Colombia, like Peru, are negotiating a U.S.
free-trade deal.

[Alpacas are susceptible to FMD. FMD virus can be carried on a number of
different fomites. Fruit could certainly be classified as a fomite, as most
fruit is shipped without washing. There is no mention in this article of
whether the fruit is in the same region as the outbreak. - Mod.TG]
