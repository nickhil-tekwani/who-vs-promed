CDC sends team to probe Asian avian influenza.
The Centers for Disease Control is sending a team of epidemiologists to
Hong Kong Friday to investigate a strain of flu that usually afflicts birds
but has infected humans for the first time. A CDC spokeswoman said the
agency did not believe there was a link between the two flu victims, both
children and both from Hong Kong. The likely source of the virus was
chickens. "The only thing we know is they (the two flu cases) are not
similar in terms of coming from the same source," Barbara Reynolds told
news reporters Wednesday. She said Hong Kong had experienced a flu
epidemic among ducks and chickens.
The World Health Organization confirmed the second case of influenza A,
strain H5N1 in a human Tuesday. That case involved a 2-year-old boy
hospitalized in November who has since recovered. The first victim, a
3-year-old boy, died in May of complications associated with Reye's
syndrome. Reynolds said the CDC has no records on whether the same strain
of avian influenza affects birds in other areas of the world.
