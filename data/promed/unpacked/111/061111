Last week CSIRO researchers at the Division of Food Science and Technology
issued a couple of press releases to help put the Victorian salmonella
discussion in perspective.
An extract follows - the full text is available at
http://www.csiro.au/communication/mediarel/mr1997/mr97all.htm
Senior CSIRO scientists today rejected public claims by meat industry unions
about the safety of meat produced in domestic abattoirs, saying they
misrepresented the findings of a major scientific study.
Dr Michal Eyles, the chief of the CSIRO Division of Food Science and
Technology, said that the CSIRO study demonstrated that meat produced from
both domestic and export abattoirs in Australia was of a high standard. The
study did not reveal differences in the incidence of Salmonella or in
overall levels of product safety between domestic and export works.
Dr Eyles said it had also been incorrectly claimed changes in the meat
inspection systems in Victoria contributed to the recent smallgoods-related
Salmonella outbreaks.
"These changes have included a shift in emphasis from traditional meat
inspection to a preventative food safety system called Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Points (HACCP). Individual companies have also been given
an increased level of responsibility for the safety of their products.
"Traditional meat inspection, in which carcases are examined visually by
inspectors, cannot control the major contemporary hazards to food safety
adequately. The threats to food safety and international market access for
Australian foods today are almost exclusively due to agents that cannot be
seen by the naked eye, particularly microbial contaminants such as
Salmonella," he said.
"In contrast, the HACCP food safety system is the most effective method for
controlling contamination of foods with hazardous microorganisms. It
involves the scientific identification of critical areas of risk in
production processes and the development of procedures that ensure that
processes are controlled to prevent problems.
"The HACCP food safety system is supported very strongly by the scientific
community, the food industry and major government agencies world-wide. It
has been implemented in many countries.
"Although individual companies have been given an increased level of
responsibility for assuring food safety under the new arrangements, a very
desirable development, government authorities continue to have an important
role in regulation of meat safety," Dr Eyles said.
"For example, HACCP-based food safety systems in the meat industry are
audited regularly by independent authorities and company-employed meat
inspectors operate under government-approved comprehensive quality assurance
systems."
Dr Eyles also announced that CSIRO was expanding its research in search of
quick, economical and sensitive tests to check both for the presence and the
virulence of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli.

[This thread is hereby halted as there appears to be little of
epidemiological value in the other messages coming in; there is clearly a
right political barny going on in Victoria as they sort out who did or did
not what to whom and who will pay.
Thanks, Niall.
