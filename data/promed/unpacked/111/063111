Tests: Commercial meat was not _E. coli_ source
-------------
All 4 meat samples taken from the wholesale food store in West Nyack tested
negative for _E. coli_ [O157] bacteria, according to lab results completed
this week by state officials. "We have found nothing wrong with the meat
they sold," said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the state Department
of Agriculture and Markets. "It is not the source of the _E. coli_."
But health officials still don't know the cause of the month-long outbreak,
which struck another victim this week, bringing the total to 26, said Dr.
Joan Facelle, Rockland's commissioner of health. The latest victim is a
youngster from Monsey, NY, where all but 2 of the victims live, she said.
Tests have shown that the Orangeburg [sometimes called Orangetown - Mod.LL]
girls and the Monsey children are infected with different strains of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 [This suggests that the clusters although geographically
close, are separate events. The towns are about 10 miles apart in Rockland
County, NY. - Mod.LL].
Investigators thought they had a strong lead toward finding the source of
the bacteria responsible for infecting the Orangeburg girls. Ground beef
still in the freezer of the first Orangeburg girl's home was contaminated
with _E. coli_ O157:H7, a particularly toxic strain, state officials
confirmed last week. The meat was purchased 12 May 2002 at a wholesale food
store in West Nyack. State investigators tested 4 packages of meat chosen
at random at the store 7 Jun 2002, Chittenden said. It is not clear whether
the meat came from the same lot as the package found to be contaminated,
she said.
All 4 of the tests were negative, leading investigators to believe that the
meat was contaminated after it left the store. The families dispute the
findings, maintaining that the _E. coli_-tainted meat was contaminated when
it was purchased.
"We have very high standards for testing and maintaining our meat," said a
spokesman for the store that sold the ground beef. Experts on _E. coli_
said it is not uncommon for the bacteria to be in parts of some meat but
not in others.

[The infectious dose for human _E. coli_ O157:H7 is quite low, on the same
order of magnitude as _Shigella_ spp., less than 1000 organisms and perhaps
as low as 10 bacilli. This, together with sampling error in an individual
specimen and screening only some packages, makes determining where the meat
was contaminated as yet unclear. It is not stated whether the ground beef
was repackaged into smaller lots after purchase from the store. _E. coli_
O157:H7, being usually sorbitol-negative, can be detected easily in food
samples, and several enhancement media exist. Rapid tests include toxin
detection by ELISA, dot blotting, or cytotoxicity and polymerase chain
reaction. - Mod.LL]
