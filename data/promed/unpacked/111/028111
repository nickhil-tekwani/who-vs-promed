A little more background -- and a bit of recent history -- on the
role inanimate objects can play in Salmonella transmission. My
former colleague, Ken Spitalny, MD, worked up an outbreak of mixed
salmonelloses (serotypes Chester, Tennessee, and Habana) involving
more than 40 persons at a Vermont hospital in 1981, in which a meat
slicer was also inculpated. Secondary transmission by hospital staff
was the likely cause of at least 2 nosocomial cases as well.
The abstract of the report can be found here:

[ProMED thanks Dr. Brondum for his comments. The abstract from
Spitalny KC, Okowitz EN, Vogt RL: Salmonellosis outbreak at a Vermont
hospital. South Med J. 1984;77: 168-72 is below:

"An outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred at a hospital in
northern Vermont during Sep 1981. Of the 292 hospital employees
surveyed, 43 had diarrheal illness; 12 of them had positive cultures
for Salmonella, serotypes chester, tennessee, or habana. In addition,
three individuals who were culture-positive but did not have diarrhea
were counted among the cases. Illness was related to eating roast
beef or cold cuts (P less than .01) in the month of September. One
food specimen, an unopened package of precooked roast beef supplied
by a New York processor, was found to be contaminated by Salmonella,
serotypes chester, tennessee, and livingston. Cold cuts were believed
to be secondarily contaminated by a meat slicer. 3 of 80 patients
whose charts were reviewed had nosocomial diarrhea; 2 of them had
positive cultures for Salmonella, serotype chester. Secondary
transmission of Salmonella from hospital staff was the likely source
for at least 2 of the patients." - Mod.LL]
