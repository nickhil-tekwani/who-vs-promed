Scotland: Alarming Rise in Mumps Among Teenagers in Glasgow
-----------------------------------------------------------
The city of Glasgow is at the centre of an alarming rise in mumps
among teenagers. Confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland have
soared to 49 since 1 Dec 2003 -- almost double the tally of 26 cases
for the rest of 2003. And 71 percent of these cases were in Glasgow.
A report by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental
Health (SCIEH) said 35 of the 49 cases were within the Greater
Glasgow NHS board area, with others in areas adjacent to Greater
Glasgow. The potentially-fatal disease can cause meningitis,
inflammation of the brain, and infertility in boys.
Dr Claire Bramley of the SCIEH said: "Like the rest of the UK, we are
seeing cases of mumps in older teenagers and young adults [90 percent
of the cases were in the 16-24 year age group - Mod.CP]. The virus
has come into circulation and is infecting those who have not been
vaccinated. You could describe it as an outbreak -- certainly in
Glasgow. We encourage as many people as possible to take their
children for vaccination."
Experts said there had been outbreaks elsewhere in the UK, and there
was no specific reason why it had spread to Scotland. Dr Syed Ahmed,
consultant in public health at Greater Glasgow Health Board, said the
latest cases were a worrying development. He said: "This is very much
higher than normal, as we usually have only one or 2 confirmed cases
in a year."

[This outbreak is a further unfortunate consequence of the decline in
uptake of the triple measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in the UK provoked
by fears of [an unproven - Mod.JW] link with autism. In the Greater Glasgow
area, the uptake of triple vaccine has declined to 85 percent in 2003 from 87
percent in the previous year. - Mod.CP]
