A meeting of Africa's leading cassava breeders zeroed in on actions
needed to stop the rapid spread of cassava brown streak disease
(CBSD). The resurgent crop disease has already caused a low-grade
famine in northern Mozambique and led farmers in Zanzibar to largely
abandon cultivation of the critical food crop. Breeders from Uganda,
Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique all noted the rising threat of
the disease to small-scale farmers in their areas.
Cassava breeders at the meeting in Zanzibar 3-5 Oct 2007 said that
the disease has recently spiked for reasons that are unclear. Yet
breeders have already developed a number of disease-resistant
varieties, and others are in the pipeline. Breeders noted that the
problem lies in getting these varieties to farmers and that many
African governments have stringent variety release rules that
seriously delay getting the new varieties into farmers' fields.
"Joint action by cassava breeders, farmers and government agencies
can contain this disease," said cassava breeder Dr. Edward Kanju of
the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture in Tanzania.
"Isolated action or inaction will worsen hunger. Unless cassava
scientists and policy makers understand that there is this menace,
farmers and their families will suffer as a result."
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has recently
awarded 3 grants totaling USD 553 692 to cassava breeders at national
agricultural research organizations in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania.
AGRA has also made a grant for USD 157 500 to support rapid
distribution of 4 cassava varieties that are resistant to CBSD on the
islands of Zanzibar and Pemba.
If CBSD continues to spread unabated, the damage would be
considerable, breeders said, and would compound the losses already
being caused by a 2nd disease, the _African cassava mosaic virus_.
CBSD causes the normally edible cassava roots to become corky and
inedible and may also streak and destroy leaf tissue. Once introduced
into a field, the virus can spread rapidly, and yield losses of up to
100 percent have been registered. However, Tanzania's cassava
breeders have developed tolerant materials that could be critical to
arresting the epidemic. The key will be getting this genetic material
to other breeding programmes in the region for use in local breeding
programmes.
Across Africa, cassava is a staple food for some 250 million Africans
and is the 2nd most important crop in terms of calories consumed. It
has served as a reserve against famine and is tolerant to water
stress and poor soils, making it important to African farmers facing
longer and more frequent droughts. Its leaves are a source of
protein, vitamins and minerals. Nonetheless, cassava remains
susceptible to a number of crop diseases and pests, and most
varieties grown by small-scale farmers are low yielding, limiting the
crop's potential to alleviate hunger and malnutrition.

Following the cassava brown streak disease [CBSD] outbreak in Mukono
district [Uganda], the agriculture ministry has given 200 bags of a
disease tolerant variety to farmers. Doreen Kataama, the district
agriculture officer, said the variety would be given to selected
large-scale farmers in the area. "Other farmers will get the cassava
cuttings from their colleagues," she said.
In April 2007, CBSD attacked plantations in Kasawo and
Seeta-Namuganga sub-counties, the major cassava-growing areas in the
district. "Over 6000 acres of cassava were affected. Farmers also
lost 87.6 percent of their yield," Kataama says.
The disease is characterised by the rotting of the tuber and general
stunted growth. "A plant may look healthy when the tubers are
rotten," Kataama explains. Eventually, however, the plant succumbs to
the virus and collapses. The disease cannot be cured, and the tuber,
if cooked,
has a sour taste.

[Previously, a species in the genus _Carlavirus_ tentatively named
Cassava brown streak-associated virus was thought to be involved in
brown streak disease. However, in recent extensive studies, no
carlavirus was detected in affected cassava plants. Instead, _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_) is
now considered the causal agent. The disease was 1st reported in 1935
from coastal Tanzania. It remained largely confined to the region
until recently, when a new and substantially more virulent strain
emerged and began spreading. It is now a threat to the whole of
sub-Saharan Africa and has invaded Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique, from where it
is feared it will move across all of southern Africa.
Symptoms in cassava are leaf chlorosis, often in a characteristic
pattern of feathering along the veins and, in severe infection, stem
necrosis. Unlike cassava mosaic disease, symptoms may be found also
on the roots, as a yellow/brown, corky necrosis in the starch-bearing
tissue, making the most severely affected roots unfit for
consumption. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have
rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 percent have been reported,
and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 percent have been
observed in susceptible cultivars. In Tanzania, for example, cassava
production has fallen by between 50 and 80 percent in the past few
years, and the economic damage to the incomes of poor Tanzanian
farmers is conservatively estimated at more than USD 50 million a
year.
CBSV is thought to be transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia
tabaci_ and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings.
Disease management includes removal of infected plants, phytosanitary
measures within farms, quarantine restrictions on movement of cassava
material, vector control and planting of resistant varieties.
African cassava mosaic virus
----------------------------
_African cassava mosaic virus_ (ACMV; genus _Begomovirus_) is also
spreading in East Africa and is considered a serious threat to food
security. It is transmitted by _B. tabaci_ and also spread with
infected cassava cuttings. A number of different strains have been
identified in different areas. Co-infections as well as genetic
recombination between strains have been reported.
