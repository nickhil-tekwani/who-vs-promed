Foot and mouth disease (FMD) cases suspected in the beef cattle herd of Kibbutz Kfar Szold, Upper Galilee, have been confirmed. The disease involves a group of pregnant heifers that were vaccinated a month ago. Quarantine measures have been applied in the region.

FMD has also been suspected in Banias, in the beef cattle herd owned by Kubbutz Shenir. [The distance between Banias and Kfar Szold is less than 5 km (3.1 miles).]

Sickness in wild boar has been reported from several locations in the region [a photo of separating/sloughing hoof of an affected wild boar is attached to the report].

[On 22 Nov 2018, Israel notified the OIE of 2 FMD outbreaks in free-ranging beef cattle, one on the Hermon mountain (northern Golan Heights, bordering Syria) and the other in Banias (Upper East Galilee); see, with map, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=28716. These outbreaks were, reportedly, caused by FMD virus serotype O, while the virus lineage was (and still is) "pending." The suspected outbreak in another herd in Banias is not surprising. The vaccination history in all affected herds is of interest. Disease in vaccinated animals is obviously a cause for concern.

On 24 Nov 2018, ProMED-mail reported an additional outbreak in the Golan Heights (20181124.6162891). The current outbreak in the adjacent Kfar Szold (map at https://tinyurl.com/y7s94agh), similarly close to the Lebanese border, is most probably caused by the same strain, of which the genotyping is pending.

It is hoped that the epidemiological investigation will include wild boar; genotyping is warranted.
