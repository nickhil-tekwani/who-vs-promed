In the context of epidemiological investigations around the focus of bovine brucellosis which occurred earlier this year [2012] in Haute-Savoie, an investigation is under way into the wild fauna in the mountains, focusing on chamois and roe deer [_Rupicapra rupicapra_ and _Capreolus capreolus_, respectively. - CopyEd.MSP].

The survey was launched in late August 2012 and led to the identification of a case of brucellosis in chamois. This result confirms the relevance of having implemented a surveillance effort.

It is now essential to know the extent of the phenomenon in wildlife. This finding also justifies engaging investigations to assess the respective transmission between wild and domestic animals. The strengthening of the surveillance program in wild ruminants and laboratory tests to be undertaken should help support this finding.

For the cattle, sheep and goat sector, intensive monitoring of this disease is already planned on their return from summer pastures. It will clarify the risk of contamination of farms in mountain areas.

Screening cattle herds producing raw milk cheese is undertaken annually.

Monitoring of clinical signs in domestic ruminants is strengthened by increased awareness of farmers and veterinarians taking measures in cases of abortion.

The support of the national platform for epidemiological surveillance in animal health has been sought. An assessment of the situation will be made with the experts involved in this monitoring in the coming days to identify any additional measures in susceptible populations, wild or domestic.

[The positive case mentioned might be an animal that reacted to a serological test to detect antibodies against _Brucella abortus_. Initiatives to enhance wildlife efforts are very important for the early detection of threats to human health and safety, threats to wildlife conservation, and threats to livestock.
