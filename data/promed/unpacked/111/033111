[A] mysterious blight [is] mowing down date plantations. [It] has caused killing of date trees in Khairpur district, triggering a wave of panic among date producers. Information from farmers and researchers revealed that nobody is capable enough, despite collecting soil samples from plant roots, to identify the exact problems which are making trunk and trees dying one after another.

Agriculture scientists agreed that soil nutrient deficiency is increasing. [A] growing trend of multi-cropping is [also] considered harmful to soil fertility. In the district, numerous date gardens are as old as 60 to 80 years. Some trees are even 100-year old, but are still bearing fruits. After witnessing the losses, farmers are reluctant to plant new date trees. Some cut the affected trees instantly to save others.

"The "virus" first hit Khairpur 4 to 5 years ago and now it is endemic," [a farmer] said. Farmers said if the emerging threat continues to harm tall trees the date production may decline and worsen [their] vulnerability.

[Date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is cultivated in many hot, dry regions as a staple food source. A large number of fungi and some other pathogens, as well as several diseases of unknown aetiology have been reported for this crop and productivity has declined globally.

An unknown disease attacking date palms in Sindh has been reported since about 2008 (see ProMED-mail posts 20100503.1435, 20090806.2776, 20080730.2323]. Symptoms of this 'sudden date decline' (SDD) were reported to be similar to Bayoud disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_; ProMED-mail post 20080909.2817) and may include bleaching and drying of fronds, followed by death of the tree. Although the report above mentions a "virus", it is likely that this is used as a general term to indicate disease and that the problem described is SDD.

In 2014, several fungal species were isolated from different plant parts of SDD affected trees in various locations in Khairpur (ProMED-mail post 20140723.2629399). However, association of these fungi with diseased palms does not prove their causal role (Koch's rules must be fulfilled, i.e. re-isolation of the pathogen after culture and transmission; see ProMED-mail post 20171228.5526316). It is currently thought that SDD is due to several pathogens and possibly other factors as well. Environmental and nutritional stress (as mentioned above) may predispose palms for infection.

Until a cause can be identified and effective management strategies can be designed, fungicide sprays have been found to improve palm condition (see links below) and to enable fruit production for longer periods. Tissue culture programmes for crop improvement that could be used to produce disease-free replanting material have been established in Pakistan (ProMED-mail post 20090806.2776) and other countries.

A sudden decline of date palms caused by bacteria in the genus _Erwinia_ has been reported from Saudi Arabia (see link below). It is not clear whether research has been done in Pakistan to look for this or other bacterial pathogens in association with SDD.
