[In ProMED-mail's posting "Foot & mouth disease, bovine - North Korea
(P'yongyang-Si) 20070307.0803", which includes a summary of North
Korea's emergency notification to the OIE, we requested data on the
origin of the imported, FMD-O infected animals. However, browsing in
the full report at OIE's web-site reveals that the origin of the
imported animals was indeed disclosed by the reporting country, as
presented below. - Mod. AS].
Information received on 07 Mar 2007 from Mr Ri Kyong Gun, Director of
the Veterinary and, Ministry of Agriculture, Anti-Epizootic
Department, PYONGYANG, Korea (Dem. People's Rep.):
----- Affected population: calves imported from Tieling city,
Liaoning province, China (People's Republic of). Some showed clinical
signs after their introduction in the farm.

[Tieling is a city situated north-east of Shenyang, the capital of
China's province Liaoning which borders with North Korea (see map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?country=136_9018_5&language=1>).
In February 2006, FMD was suspected in Liaoning's Liangjia village
(map at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/19/Liangjia.html>). No
confirmation became available (see ProMED-mail archive
20060207.0405). Liaoning has not been included among the provinces
reported as FMD-infected since the beginning of 2006. China has sent
14 FMD reports to the OIE during 2006 and an additional 5 reports
since the beginning of 2007, all of them related to the FMDV serotype
Asia 1. - Mod.AS].
