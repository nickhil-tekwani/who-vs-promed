There is no connection with the epidemic in West Africa, and there are no currently reported cases of EVD in East Africa. The last scares out of Kenya and Tanzania were because of the 2012 outbreak in Uganda (see ProMED archive Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Kenya, Tanzania: NOT 20120807.1232121). - Mod.JW
