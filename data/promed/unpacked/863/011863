Japan: Characterization of an H5N1 Influenza virus in imported Duck Meat
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is the abstract of a paper authored by M. Mase and 7 others at
the Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Animal Health, 3-1-
5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0856, Japan, entitled "Isolation of a
genotypically unique H5N1 influenza virus from duck meat imported into Japan
from China", published ahead of print in Virology 17 Jun 2005.
"An influenza A (H5N1) virus was isolated from duck meat processed for human
consumption, imported to Japan from Shandong Province, China in 2003. This
virus was antigenically different from other H5 viruses, including the Hong
Kong H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in 1997 and 2003. Sequence analysis
revealed that 6 genes (PB1, PA, HA, NA, M, and NS) of this virus showed greater
than 97 percent nucleotide identity with their counterparts from recent H5N1
viruses, but that the remaining 2 genes (PB2 and NP) were derived from other
unknown viruses. This duck meat isolate was highly pathogenic to chickens upon
intravenous or intranasal inoculation, replicated well in the lungs of mice and
spread to the brain, but was not as pathogenic in mice as H5N1 human isolates
(with a dose lethal to 50 percent of mice (MLD(50)) = 5 x 10(6) 50 percent egg
infectious doses [EID(50)]). However, viruses isolated from the brain of mice
previously infected with the virus were substantially more pathogenic (MLD(50)
= approximately 10(2) EID(50)) and possessed some amino acid substitutions
relative to the original virus. These results show that poultry products
contaminated with influenza viruses of high pathogenic potential to mammals are
a threat to public health even in countries where the virus is not enzootic and
represent a possible source of influenza outbreaks in poultry.

[Significant features of this report are: (1) The apparent survival of an avian
influenza virus in processed duck meat destined for export; (2) the antigenic
distinctiveness of this virus from other H5N1 viruses known to be in
circulation between 1997 and 2003, notwithstanding the greater than 97 percent
nucleotide identity of the HA and NA genome subunits; (3) the characterization
of this virus as a reassortant with 2 genome subunits from one or more unknown
influenza virus.
Biological characterization of the virus in mice suggested that it was less
pathogenic than human isolates of H5N1 viruses but that it had potential to be
come more virulent, although extrapolation from mouse to man seems a dubious
procedure at this stage of knowledge. Perhaps the most intriguing feature of
this report is the unresolved identity of the influenza virus (or viruses)
contributing the PB2 and NP genome subunits, which one must assume was/were
circulating in some host somewhere in China at that time or before. - Mod.CP]
