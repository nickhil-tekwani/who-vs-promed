African swine fever likely to be widespread in Georgia:
EC/FAO/OIE call for rigorous control campaign
---------------------------------------------
There is strong evidence that the devastating pig disease African swine
fever (ASF) is widely spread across Georgia, FAO [Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations] warned today. A joint mission of the
European Commission, the Office Internation des Epizooties (World
Organisation for Animal Health; OIE) and FAO called for immediate and
rigorous control measures requiring substantial international assistance.
The mission reported that by mid-June 52 of 65 districts were suspected to
be affected by ASF, more than 30 000 pigs died and a total of 22 000 pigs
have been culled.
ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs. It causes fever and
results in high pig mortality but does not affect humans. It is a
transboundary animal disease with the potential for wide international
spread. There is no vaccine against the disease; controlling animal
movement and stamping out is the only remedy to avoid spillover of the
disease to healthy animals, wildlife or even local ticks.
"The Republic of Georgia faces an exceptionally difficult situation," the
mission concluded. "Keeping pigs in open grazing, the wide distribution of
infected pigs before the 1st confirmation of the disease, and the limited
human and financial resources are difficult circumstances constraining an
effective control campaign."
A significant wild boar population will also complicate short and long term
control of ASF. Aggressive control measures limiting the contact between
domestic and wild pigs are essential in order to avoid that the virus
becomes adapted to wild pigs.
"With rapid and appropriate control measures, it may be possible that
confined pig farms and even some districts can be kept free of infection.
However, without such interventions, there is a real risk that Georgia may
lose most of its pig population to African swine fever in the coming
months," the mission stated.
Georgia has about half a million pigs, kept mainly in back yards and in
small farms. ASF may have entered Georgia from the port of Poti on the
Black Sea and then spread eastwards. It can be assumed that pigs had access
to contaminated waste from ships.
The mission stated that a national control campaign should ï¿½- under current
circumstances -- avoid the depopulation of the entire national pig
population. Every effort should be made to protect virus-free areas from
infection and progressively eliminate the virus in affected areas.
The mission made the following recommendations:
- all pigs within infected herds and in contact herds must be culled;
- carcasses must be burnt or buried deeply on site;
- the ban on pig movements and marketing should be continued and enforced;
- pigs should be totally confined and should have no contacts with wild boars;
- strict entry and exit controls between all infected and free areas should
be continued and enforced;
- vehicles and people entering and leaving farms should apply strict
disinfection procedures;
- pig owners should be compensated for their losses in order to increase
compliance with control measures;
- swill feeding should be strictly controlled;
- analysis of clinical suspicion of disease should be followed up by
national or international reference laboratory confirmation; and,
- the reporting of ASF, and methods for prevention, needs to be improved
through communication campaigns targeting farmers and the training of
veterinarians.
The mission described the ASF crisis in Georgia as a national emergency;
control, eradication and recovery measures will require considerable
financial resources.
To date, neighbouring countries have not reported outbreaks of ASF.
However, due to the probably ongoing movement of pigs and pig products
between Georgia and neighbouring countries, spread of the virus can not be
excluded. Infected wild boar might also contribute to the spread. Countries
that share a border with Georgia should be on high alert.
Pigs can acquire ASF by eating infected meat or tissues, by direct contact
with an infected pig, and by contact with contaminated material and
equipment, such as buckets, needles, clothing and vehicles. In Africa, the
virus is also known to be transmitted by ticks.
ASF virus may remain viable for long periods in infected pig tissues, meat
and processed pig products, which should not enter the food chain.

[The above statement includes a statement about the possible introduction
of ASF into Georgia by contaminated waste from ships in the port of Poti on
the Black Sea, then spreading eastward. See map at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/georgia_pol99.pdf>. Obviously,
similar scenarios could prevail in ports anywhere globally if waste from
ships, arriving from infected regions, is indiscriminately allowed
unloading while veterinary controls are deficient or non-existent.
African swine fever is endemic in most of sub-Saharan Africa including the
island of Madagascar; the highest incidence of disease is seen from the
equator to the northern Transvaal. The global threat of ASF became apparent
when it appeared in Portugal in 1957. This 1st incursion was eradicated in
1958 by stamping out (6103 pigs died of the disease and 10 354 more were
slaughtered). During later years, the disease was detected in other
European countries: Spain, France (along the Spanish border), Italy, Malta,
Sardinia, Belgium and the Netherlands. Except for Sardinia, all managed to
eradicate the disease by stamping out. Europe, except Sardinia and Georgia,
is free of ASF today.
ASF first appeared in the western hemisphere in Cuba in 1971. The disease
was eradicated but only after more than 400 000 pigs died or were
slaughtered. In the late 1970s, ASF entered Brazil, the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, and, again, Cuba. The disease was eradicated from the western
hemisphere by depopulation. - Mod.AS]
