A type of cheese linked to 2 cases of listeriosis has been recalled in New Zealand. Officials said there have been 2 reports of illness that could be associated with the product, but a concrete link has not been confirmed. Gopals Sweets and Snacks recalled all batches and dates of its Gopala brand paneer up to and including best before 5 May 2022.

Vincent Arbuckle, New Zealand Food Safety deputy director general, said listeriosis's long incubation period [up to 70 days - Mod.ML] made it difficult to establish a definitive link between the sick people and the product. "However, because of the detection of _Listeria_ in specific batches, we support the recall and advise anyone who has bought paneer recently to take the precaution of checking the product date mark to see if it is affected," he said.

The 2 illnesses, one that is pregnancy associated, were reported in December 2021 and January 2022. Testing found that samples from patients were closely related, which means it is likely their infections came from the same source. Isolates from the cases were of a rare sequence type in New Zealand. Both sick people consumed high-risk foods, including a common brand of paneer cheese.

Gopala brand paneer is available in various weights between 300 grams and 1 kilogram [0.66-2.2 lbs] in plastic packages. It was sold in supermarkets such as Foodstuffs and Countdown and ethnic grocery stores throughout New Zealand.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) advised consumers that affected product needs to be cooked thoroughly and should not be consumed raw. Officials added that if people were in any doubt, they should throw the item out or return it to the place of purchase.

New Zealand Food Safety and Gopals Sweet and Snacks are trying to establish how the contamination happened and what actions are required to prevent it from recurring.

Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalled product and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure.

Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks, because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients, who have weakened immune systems, are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

[_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism is a Gram-positive bacillus that can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw (unpasteurized) milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises used to process contaminated meat or fish, and vegetables, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, humans, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Paneer is a type of fresh cheese, similar to Mexican queso fresco and Italian ricotta salata, that requires no aging or culturing; it can be made from cow or buffalo milk, either pasteurized or unpasteurized. When lemon juice or vinegar is added, the resulting acidity causes the milk to separate into curds and whey. Ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurization, however, is said to prevent the separation of curds from whey (https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-paneer-cheese-in-30-minutes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-57008). The whey is removed, and the curds pressed. We are not told if the paneer involved with the outbreak was made from unpasteurized milk.

_L. monocytogenes_ has been reported to contaminate about 2-8% of raw milk (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526472/). Raw milk can be contaminated from the environment (e.g., contamination of milking equipment with bovine feces) or by direct excretion of _Listeria_ into the milk from an infected cow. Pasteurization of milk effectively destroys _Listeria monocytogenes_. However, post-pasteurization contamination can occur within the processing plant. Once contaminated, _Listeria_ is capable of growing at refrigeration temperatures; therefore, even very low numbers of _Listeria_ in processed dairy products can multiply to dangerous levels, despite proper refrigeration.

The news article above reports that genotyping the _Listeria_ isolates from the 2 patients showed a closely related sequence type, rarely found in New Zealand, suggesting a common source, and the patients' food histories confirmed both ate a common brand of paneer cheese. _Listeria_ was detected in "specific batches" of that paneer, but we are not told if genotyping of the cheese isolates matched that from the patients. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
