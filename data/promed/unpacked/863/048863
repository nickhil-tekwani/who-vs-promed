Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus, a negative-strand
RNA virus with a bipartite genome belonging to the family _Arenaviridae_,
that is endemic in parts of West Africa, meaning that sporadic cases occur.
We understand that an outbreak is currently in progress in Nigeria, with
some fatal cases. If anyone can provide us with further information, we
will be grateful.
