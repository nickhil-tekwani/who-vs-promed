Three people have been infected with anthrax in Santhia upazila of
the district, a local health officer confirmed yesterday [14 May
2011]. [Three] Chinanari villagers who went to Santhia Hospital on
Friday were diagnosed to be carrying germs of anthrax, Monsurur
Rahman, upazila health and family planning officer, told The Daily
Star. They were taking treatment at the hospital.

Sources in the upazila health and livestock department said 2 goats
got infected with anthrax a few days ago. One of them died, while the
other was culled. [The 3 villagers] caught the disease as they
processed the meat, said Monsurur Rahman. Officials of the livestock
department visited the area yesterday [14 May 2011] and took steps to
launch a vaccination campaign there.

Talking to The Daily Star, Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Institute
of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said they received
information in the evening about 2 persons being anthrax-infected.
"Though anthrax in cattle was detected almost a month back, we
received the report of human infection just today (yesterday [14 May
2011])," he said.

Every year during the rainy season, anthrax spreads among the cattle
in the country.

The director said that if the livestock department can continue
anthrax vaccination for 5 consecutive years, which does not cost much,
anthrax in cattle will be contained, and eventually spread of the
disease to humans will be contained.

When contacted, however, a high official of the livestock department
said they have had no report of anthrax in cattle this year [2011].

[Although the previous bovine outbreak was reported as "tarka" or
anthrax, subsequent investigations failed to confirm it. The results
of follow-up investigations have yet to be reported as to the true
cause or causes of the multiple deaths.

In December 2010, Antonio Fasanella and I visited Bangladesh as
guests of the community-based Dairy Veterinary Foundation, Bangladesh
Agricultural University, and as a result of a series of farm visits
and meetings with Sirajganj farmers, we came to the conclusion that
those bovine infections were not as a result of grazing -- anyway, the
2010 epidemic was during the monsoon, and the fields were flooded --
but from contaminated feed. This was supported by a wide genetic
diversity of the recovered organisms, typical of a contaminated bone
meal source. A joint paper with our Bangladesh hosts will soon be
submitted to a suitable journal.

Goats mainly browse, not graze, which limits their opportunities for
a contaminated soil source, even if we disregard the clay nature of
the soil in this district, which makes me suspect that these Pabna
goats may have been given contaminated feed. Investigations by our
colleagues in Bangladesh will confirm or deny this hypothesis.
