Joint USDA and DOI Release: Montana Wild Bird Samples Undergo
Additional Avian Influenza Testing
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Interior (DOI) today
announced a detection of the H5 and N1 avian influenza subtypes in
samples from wild Northern pintail ducks in Montana.
Initial tests confirm that these samples do not contain the highly
pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe
and Africa. These samples were collected from apparently healthy
ducks and initial test results indicate the presence of low
pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health.
The duck samples were collected on 15 Sep 2006 in Cascade County,
Montana, by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks as part of a
cooperative, expanded wild bird monitoring program. Sixty-six samples
were collected directly from the birds using cloacal swabs. Samples
were initially screened at the Colorado State University Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory. Of the 66 samples tested at the Colorado State
University state lab, 16 samples were sent to USDA's National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for confirmatory testing.
One of the 16 samples screened by NVSL tested positive for both H5
and N1. However, this does not mean these birds are infected with an
H5N1 strain. It is possible that there could be 2 separate avian
influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1.
Confirmatory testing underway at NVSL will clarify whether one or
more strains of the virus are present, the specific subtype, as well
as confirm the pathogenicity. These results are expected within 2 to
3 weeks and will be made public when completed.
The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working
collaboratively with States to sample wild birds throughout the
United States as well as in Canada and Mexico for the presence of
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). As a result of this
expanded testing program, USDA and DOI expect to identify additional
cases of common strains of avian influenza in birds, which is not
cause for concern.
Low pathogenic avian influenza commonly occurs in wild birds and can
be found in a number of duck populations including the Northern
pintail. It typically causes only minor or no noticeable symptoms.
These strains of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as
North American H5N1, which is very different from the more severe
highly pathogenic H5N1 circulating overseas.
Duck populations, including Northern pintail ducks, are commonly
hunted. There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from
contact with low pathogenic forms of avian influenza virus.
Nevertheless, hunters are always encouraged to use common sense
sanitation practices, such as hand washing and thorough cooking, when
handling or preparing wildlife of any kind. Interior has issued
guidelines for safe handling and preparation of wild game.
