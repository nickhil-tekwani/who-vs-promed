Japan chicken imports infected with VRE
Japan has found potentially lethal bacteria in chicken meat imported from
France and Thailand, and has called for the governments of both countries
to investigate the matter, Japanese government officials said yesterday.
The meat carried vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus_ (VRE), an intestinal
bacteria resistant to antibiotics, which could kill aged or ill people
whose immune systems are weak, Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry
reported.
A ministry official said: "We don't plan to ban imports, as the bacteria
causes no problem to people in good health, and is killed if heated. We
have already sent out warnings urging people to cook imported chicken
thoroughly." Experts said avoparcin, which is mixed in chicken feed, was
one possible source of the bacteria. France and other European countries
have prohibited the additive's use since April last year, but Thailand is
believed to be still using it, the ministry reported.
Japan imported 96,000 tonnes of chicken meat from Thailand and 2,300 tonnes
from France last year, it said. It found the VRE in some of the chicken
meat during its annual probe for virus infection over the year to last
March. The inspection started two years ago, to look closely into infection
of hospital equipment and food by antibiotic-resistant viruses. The health
ministry official said: "The VRE has been found in imported food before,
but that found this time is more resistant."
In Singapore, one-tenth of the country's frozen poultry comes from
Thailand; a negligible amount is from France. A Primary Production
Department (PPD) reply to The Straits Times' queries said that Singapore
imported 6,000 tonnes from Thailand and 244 tonnes from France last year.
Singapore also imports frozen poultry from Brazil, the US, China, Denmark,
Britain and the Netherlands. The PPD statement said this imported meat is
safe for consumption as every consignment is inspected at ports-of-entry.
Unfit consignments are destroyed and doubtful ones are sent to the
laboratories for investigation.

Thai broiler chicken exporters are, according to this story, investigating
the discovery of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococus_ (VRE) in their exports,
following a complaint by authorities in Japan, Thailand's biggest market
for frozen and processed chicken, who said they had found the bacteria in
chicken imports from Thailand.
Prasert Anuchirachiva, assistant vice president of C.P. Trading Group, was
quoted as saying, "The Thai Chicken Exporters' Association is investigating
if the claim is true and, if it is, what is the cause of it."
The story says that meat carrying VRE can kill aged or ill people whose
immune systems are weak. However, heating the tainted meat will kill the
bacteria, according to medical sources.
The story adds that the bacteria is believed by some experts to be linked
to the use of avoparcin, an antibiotic used in chicken feed to prevent a
range of diseases. The antibiotic, if used extensively, fosters bacteria
resistant to antibiotics like VRE.
Japan has banned the use of avoparcin in chicken feed since 1997 after
Europe announced similar measures a year earlier.
Prasert was further quoted as saying, "But we can say with confidence that
the Thai chicken industry stopped using avoparcin in feed for four-five
years now. Moreover, current high prices of the antibiotic make it even
less attractive to use. And that frightens us because it means the VRE
claimed to be found in Thai chicken was not caused by the use of this drug.
The industry will try to identify it as soon as possible. It might be
carried by workers in the assembly line."
