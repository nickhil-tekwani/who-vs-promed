An outbreak of a mysterious hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the Venezuelan state of Aragua and the country's capital Caracas has left 10 people dead in the last 3 weeks. Reports indicate that 9 people have so far succumbed to the disease in the northern state and a 10th person has died in the capital.

It is unclear whether the cause of the syndrome is viral or bacterial -- a distinction with implications for treatment -- although autopsies have indicated that those who died were suffering from other complications, such as chikungunya [virus infection].

Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is endemic in the 2 states of Portuguesa and Barinas, but transmission from person-to-person is uncommon.

While samples have been sent to the Venezuelan National Institute of Health, the results have not yet been released publically and there is no suggestion from health officials that VHF is behind this particular outbreak.

One doctor, who wishes to remain anonymous, attended a meeting last week [week of 22 Sep 2014] at the headquarters of the Medical Association of Aragua state to discuss what action should be taken. "This is an emergency," he said, "we do not know what we are facing and we need to know the causes in order to provide appropriate treatment, to prevent the collapse of the patient's organs, and also to set up epidemiological surveillance."

Similar to Ebola, this syndrome causes patients to experience high fever, skin rashes, and bleeding. It has been described as an aggressive disease that leads to a fatal deterioration of health within 72 hours.

Doctors have urged government authorities to declare a state of emergency in Aragua state.

Anticipated laboratory results may hold the key to discovering the pathogen to blame for this latest public health emergency, but they will not be responsible for the quality and strength of the response. Instead, this will be dictated by the speed at which the outbreak is acknowledged by politicians and health officials, and the informed multi-agency response that follows.

If the 10 people who have lost their lives to this mysterious illness are isolated cases, there may be accusations of an overreaction. If they are not, then a swift and unified action plan may save many lives -- a lesson being learnt all too keenly in 3 West African countries across the ocean.

[Clearly, the laboratory results are essential to make a diagnosis of the causes of death of the 10 patients. With the very limited information given in the report above concerning the symptoms and the places where the infections were acquired, it is not possible to speculate about the etiology of the illnesses, or to rule out Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever due to Guanarito virus infections. ProMED-mail will be very interested in receiving information about the results of the laboratory tests.
