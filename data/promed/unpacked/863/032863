New Jersey
--------------
State and federal health officials were awaiting further test results
from the Trenton regional post office after early tests found anthrax
contamination in 13 separate work areas. Postal Inspector Tony
Esposito would not give details of where the samples were taken,
saying only that they were along the path letters travel through the
mechanized equipment.
None of the samples taken from the building's public areas were
contaminated, officials have said.
The facility processed at least 3 anthrax-laced letters addressed to
NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and the
New York Post.
Two Trenton-area postal workers have confirmed cases of skin anthrax.
Anthrax skin infections are less dangerous than the inhaled form of
the disease. The Hamilton post office has been closed since Thursday,
when it was announced that a New Jersey mail carrier had skin anthrax.
On Sunday, preliminary results on 19 samples taken from the West
Trenton post office in Ewing (where one postal worker with anthrax
works) came back negative for anthrax. The facility is a small office
that feeds mail into the regional facility. The West Trenton office
has been closed to the public since Friday.

New York
-------------
-- CBS Office: Small traces of anthrax were found Monday in CBS
anchorman Dan Rather's office, buttressing what had been an
assumption: that the assistant who opens his mail encountered the
spores at the network. CBS News spokeswoman Sandra Genelius said
Rather and his staff, including the assistant who has contracted skin
anthrax, are still working in the office because the amount of
bacteria found wasn't considered dangerous.
-- Governor´s Manhattan office: Earlier Monday, Gov. George Pataki's
Manhattan office reopened. It had been evacuated Wednesday after a
sample of suspected anthrax was found and initially tested positive.
Another 140 samples were collected later in the week, and all of those
tested negative, said John Signor, a spokesman for the state
Department of Health. A culture of the sample that tested positive was
still being observed for a final result, Signor said. Authorities have
suggested that the anthrax, if that's what it is confirmed to be,
might have been brought in by officers who worked on anthrax cases
elsewhere in the city [Earlier reports said the positive sample came
from an office used by State Troopers who had visited other
contaminated sites. - Mod.JW
-- News outlets: Several other news outlets have been tested. The
Associated Press announced Monday that samples taken from its
Rockefeller Center mailroom were conclusively found to be negative for
anthrax. The AP said it had been told that no further testing was
necessary.

Washington DC
-------------------
2200 Postal Workers Get Anthrax Test
Officials discovered anthrax over the weekend in a building where mail
for House offices is processed. These officials said there had been no
test results yet indicating anthrax in any of the other House office
buildings, leaving authorities to wonder whether an as-yet
undiscovered piece of mail
was the source of spores found on a mail room machine.
Postmaster General John Potter said the U.S. Postal Service was
increasing security at its facilities and beginning to introduce
technology to sanitize mail.
More than 2100 workers at Washington's main mail-processing center and
150 at an air mail-handling center near Baltimore-Washington
International Airport were asked to report for nasal swab testing,
which will help determine where in the buildings exposure may have
occurred. Employees will each be given a 10-day supply of antibiotics
to ward off infection in case they were exposed.
Officials also planned extensive environmental testing at both
facilities. They will use the results, along with nasal swab testing,
to determine which workers need a full course of preventive
antibiotics.

Washington DC
-------------------
Traces of Anthrax Are Found at Mail Center for White House
Traces of anthrax have been found at a center that screens mail
addressed to the White House, federal officials announced this
afternoon.
The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said that tests had
confirmed the presence of anthrax at the mail-screening facility, on a
military installation miles from the White House itself, and that the
facility "has been closed for further testing and decontamination."
The Secret Service said a letter-opening machine at the site had
tested positive today for traces of anthrax spores.
No one at the site has reported symptoms consistent with anthrax, and
tests at the White House complex itself have uncovered no signs of
contamination, the Secret Service said. Since the terrorist attacks of
11 Sep 2001, the
agency said, screening of White House mail has been enhanced.
The Secret Service said the origin of the spores is unknown. It noted,
however, that mail addressed to the White House  like all mail that
comes into the District of Columbia  passes through a huge processing
center on Brentwood Road in Northeast Washington, where anthrax has
already been detected and has affected several people. Thus, it
seemed possible that contaminated mail destined for the White House
might not have been tainted intentionally.
Dr. Ivan Walks, the District of Columbia health director, sounded a
similar message as he appeared at a news briefing with Washington
Mayor Anthony Williams to confirm the cause of death of the Washington
postal employees. Dr. Walks said health professionals were determined
to "follow the science pro-actively and working in real time" in
trying to get ahead of possible anthrax outbreaks  "to respond to
this different day," as Dr. Walks put it.
It is still not entirely clear why so much concern attached early on
to the Trenton post office and to the Capitol Hill office area where
the letter to Mr. Daschle was opened, while so little was apparently
given to the Brentwood center. Some postal workers have complained
that health officials were too ready to believe that anthrax in the
mail did not pose a wide danger if the contaminated letters were
sealed. The use of a simple letter to transmit bacteria misled health
officials into thinking a series of anthrax attacks were
unsophisticated and thus not especially dangerous, a bioterrorism
expert told the Reuters news service.
"What this is telling us is that this stuff is either extra easy to
get up in the air or it is in extremely small particles," said C.J.
Peters, head of a new bioterrorism center at the University of Texas
and a former C.D.C. expert on special pathogens. Speculating on how
anthrax could escape from a sealed letter, he said, "I think when it
went through one of those squishing machines where they flatten it
out, if there was even a little hole in it, it may have gotten out."
