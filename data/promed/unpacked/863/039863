POTATO LATE BLIGHT: INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT (SUMMARY)
===================================================
[See: Potato late blight: Global threat - 960617
Potato late blight: Global initiative - 970117151713]
Date: June 1996

The Global Initiative on Late Blight, launched by the
International Potato Center (CIP), has at its core the
development of durable resistant potato varieties. Along with
planting resistant varieties, integrated pathogen management
demands that additional control measures be employed
simultaneously and methodically:
1. Phytosanitary measures that reduce or eliminate the source(s)
of inoculum
2. Good agronomic and cultural practices
3. Judicious use of chemical fungicides
However, none of these measures used alone or in toto will
eradicate late blight in potatoes without a significant shift
towards replacing susceptible cultivars with durably resistant
forms. The CIP, therefore, calls on governments in all countries
to support breeders in their efforts, and suggests that these
efforts must include a broadening of the genetic base.
