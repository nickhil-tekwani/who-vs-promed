Was this case of cholera caused by toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 or O139?
In the past there has been considerable confusion because some people have
non-O1 Vibrio cholerae infections, which should not be called cholera.
Another possible source of confusion is that non-toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1
strains exist.
If it has not been done already, the isolate should be sent to CDC for
definitive identification.
Were the snails eaten raw? Where did they come from?

This is supposedly is a non cholera case; I believe. The epidemiology and
the clinical course seems more likely to be related to non-cholera vibrio.
Is the patient immunocompetent?

Regarding the "cholera" case in Minnesota that was just posted, the
patient's isolate was a non-O1, non-O139 serogroup /_Vibrio cholera_/;
Benenson's "Control of Communicable Diseases Manual" states that reporting
such cases as cholera "is inaccurate and leads to confusion". We attempted
to reach the patient regarding the case but were unsuccessful.
