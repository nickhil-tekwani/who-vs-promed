[A recent outbreak of enterotoxigenic _E. coli_, or ETEC sickened about
5,000 guests at graduation parties around suburban Chicago.
A rash of intestinal-disease outbreaks has been in the news recently. The
most serious involved ten children who were infected with a more deadly
strain, E. coli 0157:H7, at an Atlanta water park in the wake of a sick
child's bathroom accident in a pool. Some of the children are reported in
critical condition with [hemolytic uremic syndrome.
The CDC sent investigators to assist the Cook County Public Health
Department with its investigation. The sleuths are testing patients,
sampling food items and examining the delicatessen at the epicenter of the
outbreak.
CDC's Larry Slutsker was cited as saying no commercial test kit for ETEC is
marketed, and pinpointing the strain requires a type of genetic analysis
called PCR, or polymerase chain-reaction.
Meanwhile, local and federal health agencies are working around the clock
to identify the precise source of the outbreak. CDC investigator Penny
Adcock flew to Chicago on June 17. Her first task: post-party interviews.
Dr. Adcock was quoted as saying, "We've picked 10 different parties and
we're in the process of calling every single guest, about 700 people,
asking about symptoms, what food they had to eat and how they were treated
for their illness."
Now CDC and Cook County officials are checking the delicatessen: swabbing
pots, sinks and pipes, probing food and water, testing employees. Mitchell
Iwan, owner of the deli, was quoted as saying, "I'm deeply saddened,"
adding that he is cooperating with the CDC investigation, but declines
further comment pending its results. So far, the most common link between
patients is potato salad. "Potato salad is a suspect, but only one," says
Dr. Adcock. When the source of contamination is identified, federal
agencies will likely cooperate "to do a complete trace-back from farm to
fork," she adds.
The story adds that nobody has implicated deli workers in this case.
However, notes Minnesota State Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm was cited
as saying that past outbreaks have seen food handlers deny illness, and
then test positive for infection, adding, "Today mass-produced food
products require only one simple mistake to cause a very large number of
cases. We're seeing more and more of that all the time. ... With increased
emphasis on food-borne safety," outbreaks like Cook County's are "a
previously unrecognized part of the iceberg."
