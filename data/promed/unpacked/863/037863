I wish to correct an error regarding the recent posting on
acinetobacter. While we did have over 50 cases/colonized patients on the
USNS Comfort and came within 1 day of running out of carbapenem
antimicrobials on 2 occasions, we never did completely run out of
imipenem/cilastatin, as indicated in the posting.
Through antibiotic husbandry with input from the infectious disease
specialist and pharmacists, and an exemplary job by the supply people, we
were able to maintain stocks of drugs throughout the deployment.

[ProMED thanks LCDR Petersen for his correction of the posting. The faulty
information was contained in the lecture that was accessed, and indeed the
pdf presentation wrongly stated that the hospital ship had run out of the
carbapenem. As stated above by Dr. Petersen, it is clear that the naval
infectious disease physicians, pharmacists, and supply personnel did an
excellent job in maintaining antimicrobial supplies, as well as caring for
the patients.

It should be pointed out that Dr. Petersen reported that initial
observation regarding the _Acinetobacter baumanii_ wound infections to us
in Apr 2003. - Mod. LL]
