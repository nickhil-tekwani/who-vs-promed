A deadly rabbit disease has been detected in Minnesota. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says 4 of a Hennepin County family's pet rabbits died, and tests confirmed the presence of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 [RHDV2] in one of the carcasses. A news release says the remains were submitted to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in late July [2022] because the positive rabbit was lethargic, quiet, and limp before it died.

The Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory spotted signs of the disease in the remains and sent samples to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, which confirmed RHDV2 was present. The Board of Animal Health says the deadly illness is highly contagious among both domestic and wild rabbits, but there is no risk to humans.

"There is a vaccine available for RHDV2, and we encourage rabbit owners to talk to their veterinarian about getting pets vaccinated," said senior veterinarian Dr Veronica Bartsch. "Whether your rabbits are vaccinated or not, you should always call your veterinarian right away if you notice any signs of illness."

The news release says there were 8 unvaccinated rabbits in the home, and the 4 surviving rabbits are now receiving the vaccine. They remain quarantined and are being observed for any signs of RHDV2. The source of the virus is unknown, and officials note the family's rabbits do not travel out of the home to shows or exhibitions.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease caused by a calicivirus that affects rabbits, including wild and domesticated European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), from which our own domesticated rabbits are descended. Until 2020, RHDV had not been known to affect North American native rabbits or hares, such as cottontails, snowshoe hares, and jackrabbits. In the 2020-2021 outbreak in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, RHDV caused death in wildlife species of rabbits as well.

RHDV was first seen in China in 1984, but it was thought to have originated in Europe. Cases have been confirmed in 40 countries, including in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico, United States, Canada), Australia, and New Zealand.

A new strain, RHDV2, emerged in 2010 in France; it quickly spread throughout Europe and in the Mediterranean and has replaced the original strain in many countries. In 2015, RHDV2 was detected in Australia and spread coast to coast -- about 3 million square miles, compared with the United States' 3.8 million square miles -- in 18 months in the rabbit population, where it became the dominant strain, replacing RHDV1.

Signs may include:
- loss of appetite
- lethargy
- high fever
- seizures
- jaundice
- bleeding from nose, mouth, or rectum
- difficulty breathing
- sudden death

RHDV is often a very swift and sudden killer, giving little warning. Rabbits may die without showing any symptoms at all. Any sudden rabbit death is suspicious and should be reported to your veterinarian as a possible case of RHDV.

Incubation period
- RHDV1: 1-3 days. Rabbits may die within 12-36 hours to a few weeks after the onset of symptoms.
- RHDV2: 3-5 days. Previous experimental RHDV2 infection found incubation of 3-9 days until onset of symptoms, then death within 3-5 days.

Death rate (mortality)
- RHDV1: 40-100%
- RHDV2: 5-80%+. In the 2020 south west US and Mexico RHDV2 outbreak, officials reported a death rate of about 90%.

Survivors
Rabbits who survive RHDV are carriers and shed the virus for a minimum of 42 days, possibly longer.

Asymptomatic carriers
Some rabbits may have few or no signs of RHDV2 (subclinical/asymptomatic) but may shed virus for up to 2 months.

Transmission routes
Rabbits are infected by oral, nasal/respiratory, or ocular exposure to the virus, or by blood-feeding insects.

Cause of death: RHDV causes necrotizing hepatitis and may cause necrosis of the spleen. There may be internal or externally visible bleeding. Death occurs from liver failure or hemorrhage due to an impairment in the blood's ability to clot.

Durability of virus
Rabbit calicivirus is a very hardy virus, remaining viable in the environment outside a host.
- Survives 105 days at 68 deg F (20 deg C) on fabric; it remains stable for 3.5 months at room temperature
- Survives 225 days at 39 deg F (3.9 deg C) (just above freezing temperatures)
- Survives freeze/thaw cycles
- Survives heat of 122 deg F (50 deg C) for one hour

Seasonal outbreaks
Where the virus has a reservoir in wild rabbits or feral/stray domestic rabbits, seasonal outbreaks are expected year to year. In Australia, outbreaks start in fall and winter, peak in spring, and are mostly absent in summer. Seasonal fly abundance, as flies are a significant vector, may be linked with RHDV activity.

Treatment
- There is no known cure for RHDV.
- Treatment is supportive care in isolation.
- There are currently no known effective anti-viral drugs or other treatments available.
