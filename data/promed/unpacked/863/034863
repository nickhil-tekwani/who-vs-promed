People in the camps for the displaced in North Darfur complain of the spread of malaria.

"There is no home free of malaria in Zamzam camp," a community leader reported to Radio Dabanga. "The same is true for the camps of Abu Shouk, Tawila, Kassab, Fata Borno, and Kabkabiya."

The sheikh said that the disease, spread by mosquitoes, "appears to be more widespread than during the last rainy seasons". He added that most displaced people cannot afford to buy medicines anymore. "With these soaring food prices, we have hardly money enough to buy food."

A delegation from the federal Ministry of Health, headed by the director of the Ministry's Epidemiology Department, arrived in the North Darfur capital of El Fasher last week to investigate the prevalence of malaria cases and visit health facilities in the state.

Several people in East Darfur have reported the spread of the infectious disease as well.

[The information is sparse with no numbers, but ProMED has reported earlier (2015, see below) on malaria in the camps for internally displaced persons in Sudan. There was at that time a general lack of medicine and some drugs were apparently substandard. The coverage with impregnated bed nets is unknown. - Mod.EP
