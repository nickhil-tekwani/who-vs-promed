Egypt, confirmed additional infection with H9 LPAI in a human;
- on 29 Apr 2015, a 7-year-old male with high fever and cough tested positive for H9 on 7 May 2015;
- the sample tested positive for RNP gene, flu A, avian H9 and flu B and was negative for all other respiratory viruses;
- the investigation revealed a history of exposure to live bird market poultry. The case was cured and discharged.

[MoH and FAO field officer, 12 May 2015]

Note: This is the 3rd case of H9N2 LPAI reported in humans in Egypt since January 2015. The other 2 cases were detected in 2015 in Aswan and Cairo Governorate. The latest case is the 1st recorded human case of co-infection with H9 and flu B in Egypt.

- The most recent outbreaks of H9N2 LPAI in poultry occurred in January-May 2014 in Cairo Governorate [see PDF].

[Between 1998 and 1999, 10 human H9N2 virus infections occurred in China, and since the early 2000s, H9N2 subtype viruses have become widespread across Asia. H9N2 influenza strains have been associated occasionally with illness in children aged 9 months to 5 years in Hong Kong, with the latest occurring in December 2009. H9N2 infections in children appear to result in uncomplicated influenza-like illness, and are not associated with a known source. Patients recover, and additional cases do not occur (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/avian-flu-humans.htm).

A 2013 publication by Blair and colleagues reported antibody to H9N2 in 3 percent of a study cohort in Cambodia. Exposure to poultry was not significantly associated with seropositivity. The investigators concluded, "Although the role of cross-reactive antibodies from human seasonal influenza viruses cannot be completely excluded, our study data suggest that a number of participants may have been previously infected with the avian-like A/Hong Kong/1073/1999(H9N2) virus, likely due to as yet unidentified environmental exposures. This highlights the need for further work to elucidate the prevalence of H9N2 influenza virus infections in humans" (Blair PJ, Putnam SD, Krueger WS. Evidence for avian H9N2 influenza virus infections among rural villagers in Cambodia. J Infect Public Health. 2013 Apr;6(2):69-79. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034113000026).

A later report in 2014 in rural Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, found 9 of 21 participants who were found to have antibody to avian influenza, had H9N2 antibody over 2 years. The study cohort consisted of 800 adults (Gray GC Krueger WS, Chum C. Little evidence of subclinical avian influenza virus infections among rural villagers in Cambodia. PLoS One. 2014 May 12;9(5):e97097. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819948).

In contrast with the lack of contact transmission reported following identification of individuals infected with H9N2, D Perez and colleagues at the University of Maryland demonstrated in 2008 that some currently circulating avian H9N2 viruses can transmit to naive ferrets placed in direct contact with infected ferrets. However, aerosol transmission was not observed, a key factor in potentially pandemic strains. These scientists showed that a single amino acid residue (Leu226) at the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein plays a major role in the ability of these viruses to transmit. They also found that an avian-human H9N2 reassortant virus increases virulence, pathology and replication in ferrets. These results suggest that the establishment and prevalence of H9N2 viruses in poultry could pose a significant threat for humans ("Pandemic Potential Of H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 14 August 2008. (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080812213818.htm).

Because of its potential to evolve and possibly become more transmissible to humans, H9N2 is yet another avian flu strain which poses a public health threat.

The patient in this report also was infected with influenza B. This virus has a limited host range and mutates at a rate 2 to 3 times lower than type A (Nobusawa E, Sato K. Comparison of the Mutation Rates of Human Influenza A and B Viruses. J Virol 2006; 80(7): 3675-8. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440390/). Dual infections of influenza A and B viruses are rarely reported. The factors that may be responsible for such events are not clear yet, but the host immune system and the virus properties have been suggested as causes.
