Sheep breeders in upper Oristano province [central-west Sardinia] were notified some time ago, of the presence of Maedi-visna virus [MVV] in sheep flocks in the region, urging them to apply appropriate measures to address the pathogen which may affect the performance of numerous herds with deleterious consequences. However, the shepherds claimed they were left to face the consequences of this insidious, contagious disease which causes latent infection, without further support or action from the authorities, for which they appealed.

When veterinarians were sent by authorities to vaccinate a flock of sheep against bluetongue yesterday [24 Apr 2015], 6 farmers gathered in the pen to protest. The owner of the flock voiced serious doubts on whether to inject a virus into animals whose immune system was apparently weakened by another disease. "The sheep are not eligible to be vaccinated," he objected. Of the 400 head he owns, almost 90 percent are apparently positive to MVV.

The farmer has dictated his conditions, demanding the signing of a formal act by which the vaccinator should be responsible for any damage caused by the vaccination and undertake to remedy said damage. The vet withdrew yesterday [24 Apr 2015].

The issue has been referred to authorities and is currently being discussed. Several farmers have instructed a lawyer to remove complaints and prosecution. They claim the right to be protected through a regional plan for the eradication of Maedi-visna.

[Maedi-visna [MV], known to be circulating in Sardinia (as in many sheep-breeding countries) for years, is a persistent lentivirus infection of sheep, also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). MV is an Icelandic name that describes 2 of the clinical syndromes recognised in MV virus (MVV)-infected sheep. "Maedi" means "laboured breathing" and describes the disease associated with a progressive interstitial pneumonitis, and "visna" means "shrinkage" or "wasting," the signs associated with a paralysing meningoencephalitis. The disease, which is not zoonotic, is included in OIE's list in the section "Caprinae diseases" (diseases of sheep and goats).

The objection of the Sardinian farmers to vaccinate their suspected MVV-infected sheep against bluetongue deserves explanation. Are they expecting deficient bluetongue immunity due to the immunological deficiency of their MVV-infected sheep? Do they expect dissemination of the MVV by the vaccinators (contaminated needles?. Do they fear post-vaccination reaction (in case a live attenuated vaccine is applied)? - Mod.AS
