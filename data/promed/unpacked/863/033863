[Events in animals: OIE Members have been keeping the OIE updated on any investigations or outcomes of investigations in animals.

It has been shown that carnivores in the Felidae and Mustelidae families are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. The cougar/mountain lion/puma (_Puma concolor_) is a felid native to the Americas. Other Felidae previously confirmed infected by this virus were domestic cats, lions, and tigers. Further, experiments showed that infected cats can transmit the virus to other cats. It has not been proven as yet that felids can be a source of infection for humans. Animal-to-human transmission of COVID-19, however, has been documented from minks (Mustelidae). - Mod.PMB
