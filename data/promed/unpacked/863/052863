[2] Guinea (Fria): new cases
Date: Fri 5 Jun 2015
Source: Guinee News [in French, trans. Mod.JW, edited]
http://guineenews.org/ebola-fait-des-ravages-a-fria-11-cas-confirmes-106-contacts-officiel


Fria Prefecture, located 160 km from the Guinean capital, is on the alert since the 11th confirmed case in the rural commune Banguigni, reported in your online newspaper on Fri 5 Jun 2015. Supported by international partners involved in the fight against the hemorrhagic virus, the coordination of the struggle against Ebola, headed by Dr Barry, health director of the Prefecture of Fria, is working hard every day to eradicate this virus. Fria was already facing an economic crisis in 2012 following the closure of the alumina plant, nurturer of the city.

Dr Amadou Barry has told us: "Fria recorded its 11th confirmed case of Ebola on 26 May 2015, in a sick person from Banguigni in the locality of Horokilentcho who contracted the disease on one of several trips to Tchontchen in Telimele, and who returned ill and passed away a few weeks later; sampling was done afterwards, and the result was positive. Since then, we have identified 106 cases contacts that are being followed in the village of Horoguilinto in the sub-prefecture of Banguigni."

On the question of the difficulties associated with resistance, Dr Barry added: "Access to the village has not been easy; it took the intervention of the prefectural authority and citizens so that we could access the site to identify contacts, and occasionally the vehicle has been damaged by stoning. We still encounter some small resistance; there are also 7 people who have fled, and luckily the authorities and citizens are on the right track, because the research is around the village of the urban commune of Fria, according to our information."

[Because of the persistence of the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea, President Conde on Sat 6 Jun 2015 extended until the end of June 2015 a health emergency (declared in March 2015). See, from 7 Jun 2015: Guinea extends Ebola emergency measures http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/guinea-extends-ebola-emergency-measures-769386. - Mod.JW]

[This is just one example of why it is so difficult for West Africa to see its way to the end of this Ebola outbreak.

3 Jun 2015 USA (New Jersey): Lawmakers: end Ebola quarantine at Fort Monmouth
http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150603/ProBioGen-initiates-clinical-trials-of-Ebola-vaccine-using-AGE1CRpIX-cell-line.aspx
[New Jersey lawmakers urged Fort Monmouth's decision makers to stop allowing state health officials to use fort grounds as a quarantine location for travelers at risk of Ebola infection. No travelers have been quarantined at the fort, according to a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.]

6 Jun 2015 USA (Ohio): Ohio has monitored about 375 travelers under Ebola protocols
http://www.nbc4i.com/story/29254858/ohio-has-monitored-about-375-travelers-under-ebola-protocols
[According to Ohio health officials, several hundred travelers coming from West African countries that had Ebola outbreaks have been monitored for 21 days (the last day of possible exposure to the Ebola virus) under protocols implemented in the fall of 2015. Nobody was found to be infected.]

3 Jun 2015 USA (Virginia): 100 people being monitored for Ebola in Virginia
http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/100-people-being-monitored-for-ebola-in-virginia/33389810
[These travelers are monitored under Virginia's post-arrival monitoring program, and arrived within the previous 21 days from travel that originated in Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone. Last week, 45 people entered Virginia's monitoring program.]

2 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Health ministry official admits early wrong Ebola methods
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506030682.html?viewall=1
[The Minister of Health and Sanitation, Lansana Conteh, admitted that the public was given, early in the Ebola outbreak, wrong methods to stop the spread of the Ebola virus. He said, because at the beginning of the outbreak the ministry lacked experts who knew about the disease, the ministry got it wrong on many issues, including the method of recruiting burial team members, burial methods, training of staff, and involvement of community leaders and the media.]

4 Jun 2015 WHO: warns rainy season hampering Ebola response in West Africa
http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v8/wn/newsworld.php?id=1140994
[The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported an increase in the intensity and geographic area of Ebola transmission in Guinea and Sierra Leone, warning that the onset of the rainy season "from now onwards" will make field operations more difficult and noted that community engagement remains a challenge in both countries. Peter Graaff, the acting special representative and head of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), told the UN News Service that the rainy season "creates problems because it will bring other diseases like malaria that often show similar symptoms to Ebola." It ... makes things more complicated, because, for the time being, people showing those symptoms have to be dealt with as if they are potentially Ebola patients and, therefore, have to be tested." It is anticipated the number of people to be tested for Ebola will dramatically increase.]

[Patients with malaria and other fevers will be interned with Ebola patients while waiting for their lab results, exposing them to infection and making the situation worse. - Mod.JW]

4 Jun 2015: Ebola response reveals the need for new models for collaboration between the private and public sectors
http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2574662.

Non-governmental organizations
------------------------------
3 Jun 2015 G7: The world is no better prepared today than a year ago to respond to Ebola
http://reliefweb.int/report/world/g7-world-no-better-prepared-today-year-ago-respond-ebola
[According to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the global health system remains unprepared for mass disease epidemics, and MSF urged G7 countries to commit to developing an efficient emergency response system against epidemics and international health crises. There is also a pressing need for funding of the development of Ebola drugs and diagnostics.]

Intergovernmental
-----------------
5 Jun 2015: Global health leaders ask G7 for post-Ebola rapid response unit
http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/06/05/health-g7-global-idINL5N0YQ2C020150605?rpc=401
[The next global disease epidemic is regarded as inevitable, and a new unit is needed to prepare for unknown threats, with the ability to call on a reserve of 10 000 scientists to address outbreaks. The unit should come under the auspices of the World Health Organization, but be free of bureaucracy, allowing independent action within days of the beginning of a potentially fatal outbreak. The reserve scientists would include experts in infectious diseases, virologists and epidemiologists, with a mandate to travel quickly to the source of an outbreak. The estimated cost for the rapid response operation could be USD 100-200 million a year. Hundreds of millions are being spent addressing the current Ebola epidemic. Estimated regional economic losses from the current Ebola epidemic are about USD 500 million.]

[WHO asked the Swiss government in January 2003 to reactivate Task Force Scorpio, a unit set up by Dr Robert Steffen, a Swiss physician and myself (then a WHO staff member, since retired) within the Swiss Disaster Relief Unit to deal with outbreaks caused by WMD (weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological and radiation weapons) in 1991 during the 1st Gulf War. It was to be renamed the Swiss/European WMD Task Force. No information has been published about its reactivation. - Mod.JW]

Drugs, vaccines, research
-------------------------
3 Jun 2015 (Science Translational Medicine): A screen of approved drugs and molecular probes identifies therapeutics with anti-Ebola virus activity
http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/290/290ra89
[Taken from abstract of LM Johansen, L Evans DeWald, CJ Shoemaker. 2015. A screen of approved drugs and molecular probes identifies therapeutics with anti-Ebola virus activity. Science magazine 7 (290): 290ra89 (http://www.ScienceTranslationalMedicine.org): Researchers tested roughly 2600 approved drugs and molecular probes in an in vitro infection assay using the type species, Zaire ebolavirus. Selective antiviral activity was found for 80 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. Results using an in vivo murine Ebola virus infection model confirmed the protective ability of several drugs, such as bepridil and sertraline. Viral entry assays indicated that most of these antiviral drugs block a late stage of viral entry. By nature of their approved status, these drugs have the potential to be rapidly advanced to clinical settings and used as therapeutic countermeasures for Ebola virus infections. - Mod.LK]

3 Jun 2015: Scientists release Ebola sequencing data to global research community online
http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-release-ebola-sequencing-data-to-global-research-community-online#sthash.DEptP12p.dpuf

4 Jun 2015: WERF to begin studies addressing Ebola, antibiotic resistance challenges
http://www.wwdmag.com/research/werf-begin-studies-addressing-ebola-antibiotic-resistance-challenges
[Water Environment Research Foundation (WERF) will begin new studies addressing Ebola and antibiotic resistance challenges as a response to concern about risks to water resource recovery facility (WRRF) operators and workers who may potentially be exposed to these and other newly emerging and or/re-emerging pathogens of concern. The project, "Protecting wastewater treatment plant operators from emerging pathogens: a preparedness protocol and online decision support tool (WERF3C15)," will be conducted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.]

4 Jun 2015 International: Survey reveals hospital preparedness for management of suspected Ebola cases is not adequate
http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2015/06/survey-reveals-hospital-preparedness-for-management-of-suspected-ebola-cases-is-not-adequate.aspx
[The authors say that the results from this 1st international survey provide a framework for future efforts to improve hospital preparedness worldwide.]

5 Jun 2015: Results from Phase I trials of Ebola vaccine in Kenya called promising
http://www.voanews.com/media/video/results-from-phase-one-trials-of-ebola-vaccine-in-kenya-called-promising/2808673.html
[Initial results from Phase I trials of an experimental Ebola vaccine, rVSV ZEBOV, show the vaccine is safe and generates an immune response against the Ebola virus.]

5 Jun 2015 Congo Republic: Risk factors associated with Ebola and Marburg viruses seroprevalence in blood donors
http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003833
["We identified that contacts with bats and birds constituted 2 independent environmental determinants of exposure. This study confirms that contact with Ebola virus is not infrequent in Congo and can occur in the absence of haemorrhagic fever."]

Funding

3 Jun 2015 Nigeria: Ebola volunteers locked up over unpaid hotel bills
http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/daily/index.php/news-menu/news/56314-ebola-volunteers-locked-up-over-unpaid-hotel-bills
[10 days after Nigeria's volunteers on Ebola frontlines in Liberia and Sierra Leone returned to the country, their stay at hotels in Abuja has been cut short after allegations their accommodation bills were not paid. The contingents' hotel stay did not amount to a 21-day period required to observe symptoms, or the 42-day period required for observation in the event that the last confirmed case of Ebola is reported before a country is declared free.]

[This is terrible in so many ways; for example, committed money not being used as was intended, breaking quarantine protocol intended to prevent inadvertent spread of disease, and more. - Mod.LK]

[Members of Stage Aid Drama Society, after the success of their latest production, The Departure Lounge, presented a check to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) for assistance in the Ebola crisis.]

7 Jun 2015 Guinea: Ebola spreads suspicion and rumors in Guinea
http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ebola-spreads-suspicion-and-rumors-in-guinea-769401
[According to the authorities, the "reluctance" of locals is igniting new transmission chains and so hampering efforts to stamp out the virus.]

7 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone: Journalists can't account for Ebola media funds given to SLAJ
http://www.switsalone.com/22054_sierra-leone-journalists-cant-account-for-ebola-media-funds-given-to-slaj/|Sierra Leone News & Entertainment
[Over 200 journalists at the annual general meeting of the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) have asked their executive to account for LE 300 million [USD 69 045] the organization's leaders received as funding support for sensitization programs on Ebola virus disease. According to a statement from a private auditing firm, the funds were received from international organizations and governments. However, no internally audited report was provided by the executive, as per procedure.]

7 Jun 2015 UK, USA: David Cameron and Barack Obama launch international hit squad to battle pandemics such as Ebola
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3114155/david-cameron-launches-international-hit-squad-battle-pandemics-ebola.html#ixzz3cpkorqfo
[The United Kingdom is set to lead a new team which will respond to pandemic outbreaks in which a group of doctors and nurses will be ready to fly to affected countries.
