The Disease Control Department has cautioned people to protect themselves against dengue fever, which is likely to strengthen during the rainy season.

Since the beginning of this year [2012], dengue fever is reported to have killed 9 people and sickened 7000. The Disease Control Department said the rainy season, which exists between May and June each year, is usually a dangerous period for dengue fever.

Although it is said that children are most susceptible to dengue fever, doctors warn that adults should not take the matter lightly. They disclosed that half of the victims this year [2012] were aged above 15. The statistics imply that dengue fever-induced deaths among grown-ups may have resulted from ignorance.

The number of dengue fever patients tends to climb in the Andaman provinces, Ratchaburi, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, Rayong, Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Lopburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen and Bangkok.

The Disease Control Department has now instructed local public health officials to place their areas under close surveillance.

- Reunion Island. 17 May 2012. Since January 2012, 20 autochthonous cases of dengue virus (DENV) infection have been identified in Reunion. The 1st cases were detected on the western coast, but the 2 co-circulating viruses (DENV 1 and 3) seemed to have spread later to different cities of the island. Of the 20 cases, 7 were probable and 13 laboratory-confirmed. Nine of them occurred in April 2012, and this suggests an increase in viral circulation, while the geographical distribution of the cases suggests the spread of the virus. http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20173
