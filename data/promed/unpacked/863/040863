To date 1 139 300 ha of Kazakhstan lands have been treated against rust and
Septoria diseases of cereal crops, according to the director of protection
and phytosanitary control of the Agriculture Ministry of Kazakhstan,
Saktash Khasenov.
According to Khasenov, rust and Septoria diseases were expected to cover
about 1 551 000 ha. However, weather conditions turned out to be favorable
for development of diseases, and the total area of affected land was about
2 550 000 ha. Most of the infected areas were in the northern grain seeding
regions. In the Kostanay region, a state of emergency was declared.
Taking into account the available [funds?] allocated for the "Plant
protection" program, 795 000 ha were cultivated. 344 030 ha underwent
chemical treatment at the expense of the agricultural producers.

[In Central Asia, yellow rust (_Puccinia triticina_), tan spot
(_Pyrenophora triticirepentis_), common bunt (_Tilletia tritici_, syn. _T.
caries_), and _T. laevis_ (syn. _T. foetida_) are major foliar diseases of
spring wheat, although Septoria leaf blotch (_Septoria tritici_ and _S.
nodorum_), leaf rust (_Puccinia recondita_ f. sp. _tritici_), and cereal
cyst nematode (_Heterodera latipons_) also occur in some areas. Yellow rust
and leaf rust are also very important in the Caucasian countries.
As researchers develop new varieties resistant to these diseases, progress
is tested through a step-by-step evaluation at different locations in the
region. In the first step, resistance to yellow rust, leaf rust, stem rust,
Septoria leaf blotch, cereal cyst nematode, and common bunt is evaluated at
Tel Hadya, ICARDA's headquarters, where wheat nurseries are artificially
inoculated with these diseases. In the 2nd phase, varieties identified as
resistant are further screened for resistance to different diseases in
heavily infected areas in different countries in Central and West Asia and
North Africa (CWANA) in collaboration with local scientists at 3 to 5 sites
per country.
It is difficult to assess disease loss given the information available. The
fact that about 350 000 ha. were treated with fungicides indicates that
farmers needed to try to control the diseases affecting their crops.
