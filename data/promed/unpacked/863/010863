In 5 villages in Sirajganj district [Rajshahi division] and Tangail district [Dhaka division], 43 people have been infected with anthrax, a bacterial disease that spreads from cattle.

On [the receipt of this] information, medical teams of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited the villages Tuesday [26 Aug 2014] and found them infected with the disease following tests. The infected villagers have already been given drugs and there is nothing to worry [about], IEDCR Director Professor Mahmudur Rahman said yesterday [27 Aug 2014], adding that the medical teams had collected samples from the patients for further tests. Among the 43 patients, 20 belong to Char Nandigati village under Ullapara upazila in Sirajganj.

A sick cow was slaughtered in the village few days ago, reports our Pabna correspondent. The other affected villagers are from Koijuri village under Shahzadpur upazila in the same district and Tangail's Ambaria village under Madhupur upazila and Sandalpur village under Dhanbari upazila.

A recent paper (Mondal SP & Yamage M (2014) A retrospective study on the epidemiology of anthrax, foot and mouth disease, haemorrhagic septicaemia, peste de petits ruminants and rabies in Bangladesh, 2010-2012. PLOS ONE 9(8): e104435. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104435), reported 5937 cases of livestock anthrax in that 3-year period. It might be better described as an epidemic. - Mod.MHJ
