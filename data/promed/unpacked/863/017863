In the vesicular fluid of cows with pox-like disease, related to human
cases as described earlier, parapoxvirus particles have been detected on
September 3, 1999, by electron microscopy at the Laboratory of
Ultrastructure of the Department of Virology, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio
de Janeiro. The animals live in 2 different counties in the state of Rio de
Janeiro, where human and animal cases have been observed. The epizootics
and associated human cases, include at the moment, large areas of the state.
Since vaccination against smallpox is no longer available, human infections
with bovine strains like in this episode, may also appear in other parts of
the world.
It was for the group quite a feeling to be involved again in poxviruses
diagnosis, since we closed our Smallpox Laboratory in the early 1970's
where we carried out for years the diagnosis of smallpox for the country,
including the last cases to occur in the Americas, and also diagnosed in
Rio de Janeiro state.
