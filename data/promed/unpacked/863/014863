Last Tuesday it was quoted in the Samoan Observer, by a pathologist, that
three cases of suspected eosinophilic meningitis [had been detected].
Eosinophilic meningitis is transmitted by the nematode (lungworm of rats)
_Angiostrongylus_ (_Parastrongylus_) _cantonensis_ a which has several
intermediate hosts including snails.
A local non-government official is trying to promote consumption of the
Giant African Snail by humans in an attempt to turn this pest into a
valuable factor.
Can anybody give specific information about:
1) the hosts of _Angiostrongylus_ (specific snails or any mollusk?)
2) the risks of infection of humans by lungworms as a result of snail
collection and the consumption of cooked snails.
3) any other diseases transmitted by collecting or eating cooked Giant
African Snails.

[Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>, Tel Aviv Medical Center, responded:
The GIDEON software program identifies snail or slug species as reservoirs
for at least 20 human-infecting trematodes; and vehicle (e.g., ingestion)
for only three: eosinophilic meningitis, Abdominal angiostrongyliasis
(found in Latin America) and Echinostomiasis (found in Latin America and
Asia). The following background data on angiostrongyliasis were extracted
from GIDEON:
_Angiostrongylus_ (_Parastrongylus_) _cantonensis_ was first identified in
rats in Canton, China in 1933; in humans in Taiwan in 1944. Epidemics
occurred in Ponape (East Carolina Islands) during 1944 to 1948, and the
parasite was widely disseminated by the African land snail (_Achatina
fulica_).
Infection of rats is now found throughout the Indopacific basin,
Madagascar, Cuba, Egypt, Puerto Rico, New Orleans and Cuba. Following World
War II, the parasite was introduced and spread from southeast Asia into the
Pacific, through Micronesia, Australia, Micronesia and Polynesia. Cases
were first identified in the Philippines, Saipan, New Caledonia, Rarotonga
and Tahiti during the 1950's. During the 1960's, the disease was reported
from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Java, Sarawak, Guam and Hawaii.
_Angiostrongylus_ (_Parastrongylus_) _cantonensis_ is found in rats, prawns
and frogs and transmitted to man through ingestion of snails, slugs, prawns
or lettuce. Following an incubation period of approximately 2 weeks
(range 5 to 35 days) the patient may develop an eosinophilic meningitis
(generally self-limited) in which fever is absent or low grade in most
cases. Cranial nerve involvement (II, VI and VII) may ensue. Therapy may
include mebendazole 100 mg BID X 5d, and corticosteroids for severe disease.
Additional country-specific notes:
Australia: Sporadic cases have been reported in Queensland. Seropositivity
is common among aboriginals [proper term: "kooris"].
Cook Islands: Thirty cases were reported from Rarotonga during 1965 to 1967.
French Polynesia: Approximately 1,000 cases were reported for Tahiti, and
67 for Raiatea during 1957 to 1964.
Guam: Five cases were reported in 1965.
New Caledonia: 243 cases were reported during 1951 to 1964.
Papua New Guinea: Seropositivity rates of 17% are found in East New
Britain; and 12% of rats in Port Moresby are infested.
Trust Territory Pacific Isl.: Cases are reported from Truk, Ponape, Saipan
and the Marshall Islands.
Vanuatu: A single case has been reported from Espiritu Santo.

During the Japanese occupation of the Northern Islands prior to World War
II, the Japanese raised the giant African snail for human consumption. The
snails were raised in special pens with screen floors where the snail
droppings are not allowed to be either consume by the snails or just to
co-mingle. The significance of this practice is unknown to [me]. However,
after the war, the consumption of the giant African snails totally ceased
for the islanders and for those Japanese who decided to stay back in the
islands.
