The number of Ohioans sickened in a mumps outbreak that began at Ohio State University [OSU] climbed to 153 yesterday [7 Apr 2014] and includes a 9 month old [baby].

Meanwhile, OSU leaders and experts from public health and the Wexner Medical Center are preparing to examine the health crisis. Interim university president Joseph A Alutto appointed a mumps advisory executive team last week to review university policies, OSU spokeswoman Liz Cook said. The group will "take a very careful and closer look at the outbreak and really try to determine next steps to really protect the university campus and the greater community," she said.

Cook said she did not know whether the team was to specifically consider requiring students to be vaccinated before attending Ohio State. Some other schools mandate vaccination against mumps, but Ohio State does not. The advisory team has yet to meet, and Cook said she did not know when members would conclude their discussions or issue a report or recommendations.

Outbreak cases have now been found in the following counties: Franklin (135), Delaware (12), Athens (1), Belmont (1), Fairfield (1), Hamilton (1), Licking (1), and Pickaway (1).

One of 2 people who became temporarily deaf as a result of the mumps has recovered, said Columbus Public Health spokesman Jose Rodriguez. There are now 6 cases of orchitis (swollen testicles) associated with the outbreak, he said. The condition can lead to sterility, though that is rare.

Rodriguez said news that a baby was sickened was particularly troubling. Babies under a year old are too young to have received a vaccine and are especially vulnerable, as are older children and adults who have not had both rounds of the vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella.

[ProMED-mail recently posted reports of the mumps outbreak that started on the Ohio State University (OSU) campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio and then spread into the surrounding counties (Delaware, Franklin, Fairfield, Licking, and Union) in central Ohio, but also involved Hamilton County in the south western portion of the state, in which the city of Cincinnati is located. As of the last previous post (4 Apr 2014) the total number of cases was 129. Now there are 153 cases, with 3 additional counties involved (Athens in south eastern, Belmont in eastern, and Pickaway in central Ohio), although most cases continue to be in Franklin County in which the city of Columbus and OSU are located.

The mumps vaccine is administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf). The MMR vaccine in the United States is given in 2 doses: the 1st dose is given at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose before entering school, at 4-6 years of age (http://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/mumps/index.html). The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrolment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). However, the news report above says that OSU does not mandate immunization against mumps before matriculation. Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine viruses are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full).

CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm). During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group.

Columbus is the capital of and the largest city in the US state of Ohio. For a map of Ohio that shows the location of this state's counties, see http://geology.com/county-map/ohio.shtml.

Ohio State University (OSU) is a large public research university in Columbus, Ohio, with about 28 000 undergraduates and more than 35 on-campus residence halls, with additional separate housing for graduate and professional students, plus multiple extra-curricular organizations where social mixing can occur to facilitate spread of the disease (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University). - Mod.ML
