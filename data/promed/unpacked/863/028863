In Cairns, 2 cases of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya have been confirmed.

Queensland Health is today [26 Apr 2013] issuing a warning for people to take precautions against the virus, which is similar to dengue fever [in terms of symptoms and mode of transmission, but the viruses are in different families. - Mod.TY].

Tests this week revealed that 2 people who recently returned from Papua New Guinea had contracted chikungunya [virus infection], which includes symptoms such as fever, prolonged joint and muscle pain, headaches, rash and fatigue.

Tropical Public Health Services staff have been spraying for mosquitoes in the neighbourhoods where the 2 patients live.

The Cairns Post revealed last week that entomologists from Queensland Health and James Cook University were monitoring chikungunya following an outbreak in PNG, where more than 3000 people have been infected.

The disease is carried by 2 mosquito species, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_. Both also can transmit dengue fever [virus], which has infected more than 110 people in Cairns, Innisfail, and Port Douglas since November last year [2012].

[ProMED-mail thanks Robin Hide for sending in this report.

The concern about introduction of chikungunya virus into Queensland with the risk of ongoing local transmission is realistic. As noted above, this area has been experiencing local transmission of dengue viruses this year (2013), so conditions exist to also transmit chikungunya virus should individuals coming from areas of chikungunya virus transmission arrive in Cairns while viremic. It is good to learn that the situation is being monitored.

[The 2 mosquito species mentioned can also transmit yellow fever virus, if an infected passenger from an endemic area in Africa or South America should arrive in Queensland. Australia should have a contingency plan in place for that possibility (even if rather remote). - Mod.JW]
