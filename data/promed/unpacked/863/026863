Four More Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection in Georgia
-------------------------------------------------------------
Georgia Public Radio this morning is reporting that 4 more human cases of
West Nile virus infection have been found in the state. The cases occurred
during September and October, but laboratory confirmation did come about
until the present because of testing delays. Those delays were due to the
anthrax threat and the large number of laboratory tests undertaken to detect
anthrax.

These 4 cases bring the total number of human WNV cases in Georgia to 5. Of
theses 4 men infected, one man from Pierce County (Southeast Georgia)
remains hospitalized for encephalitis. The 3 other individuals have
recovered. They are from Richmond (Augusta), Wayne, and Macon Counties.

Four Georgia Men Test Positive for West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------
Four Georgia men were infected with West Nile virus this fall, the Georgia
Division of Public Health stated on Tue 4 Dec 2001, but their diagnoses were
delayed for weeks while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
struggled to track anthrax.

A 68-year-old man from Pierce County in southeast Georgia remains
hospitalized with encephalitis, while 3 others, a 61-year-old from Macon
County, a 73-year-old from Richmond County, and a 70-year-old from Wayne
County, have recovered and been sent home, said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker of
the public health division. The men became sick between September and
November. But test results were not returned until this week because labs at
the CDC, which confirms all West Nile virus findings, were overwhelmed by
work on anthrax.

"The delay fortunately made no difference to their care" because all viral
encephalitides are cared for the same way, by treating symptoms and keeping
patients comfortable, she said. Long-delayed positive diagnoses of West Nile
virus infection were recently announced for several other states, and more
infections among Georgians may be confirmed in coming days, Lance-Parker
added.

Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), who has sponsored legislation to increase funding
for the CDC, said on Tuesday that the delay in diagnosis underlines the
disease agency's need to expand its efforts to track infectious diseases.
"Without more lab space and more dependable infrastructure, we are asking
the CDC to do the impossible, which is to work at surge capacity without
facilities that accommodate the increased demands that come with events like
the anthrax scare we have just experienced," he said.

The new diagnoses bring to 5 the number of Georgians known to have
contracted West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne infection that arrived in the
United States in 1999. Blanch Hill, a 71-year-old Atlanta resident, died on
11 Aug 2001, the first West Nile fatality in the nation this year.

Before the 4 new Georgia cases, West Nile had sickened 48 people nationwide
this year, killing 5, including Hill. Though the mosquito season has ceased
in most of Georgia, residents in the southern part of the state still may be
in danger, said Dr. Kathleen Toomey, Georgia's director of public health.
That area has had the largest number of West Nile virus findings, and it has
such a mild climate that mosquitoes may persist year-round.
