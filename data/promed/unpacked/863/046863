In Nigeria, taro leaf blight (TLB) has historically reduced tuber yields by up to 50% and leaf yield by up to 95%. A collaboration has been established between the Nigerian National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) and Cornell University to combat TLB epidemics across West Africa.

The research is to use QTL analysis [see comment below] to determine genetic variation for TLB in locally relevant taro varieties, with the aim to identify superior genotypes that both have high TLB resistance and provide good yields. Furthermore, it will attempt to identify beneficial sequences that may contribute to TLB resistance or tolerance in the host and could be used to develop improved taro varieties.

[Taro (_Colocasia esculenta_) leaf blight (TLB) caused by the oomycete (fungus-like organism) _Phytophthora colocasiae_ was first reported in Java in the early 1900s. Since then, it has been found in various parts of Asia and the Pacific; in 2010, it was reported for the 1st time from Africa (see ProMED post 20100715.2365). Both leaves and tubers of the crop are affected. TLB results in yield losses of 30-50 percent or even total crop losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the harvest.

Symptoms include purple-brown water-soaked lesions on leaves oozing a clear yellow liquid; lesions enlarge and eventually destroy entire leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis and plant vigour. Disease development and spread are favoured by free water collecting on older leaves, high temperatures and high humidity. The pathogen can be spread by wind, splashing rain and mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Spores survive in plant material for several weeks and, therefore, infected planting material (seed tubers) is a common means of pathogen spread over long distances and between seasons.

Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in addition to differences in the genetic background of local taro varieties. Some of these strains appear to be able to infect some other aroid crops (for example _Alocasia_ species) as well, but further information is needed on whether non-aroid crops like yam (_Dioscorea_ species) and cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) could be affected by these pathogens.

Disease management using an integrated approach has been successful in the Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides as sprays or treatments for seed tubers, phytosanitation and use of cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility. Programmes specific to different areas for the assessment of taro blight resistance levels of local cultivars have been set up by some countries.

In Nigeria, a resistance breeding programme was established in 2011 by the National Root Crops Research Institute (see ProMED post 20110422.1253). The project described above presumably falls within that ongoing work.

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis uses statistics to link phenotypic and molecular genetic data. It may be used to explain the roles and impacts of particular genetic loci within specific complex biological systems, such as host-pathogen interactions in the project above (see link below for further information on QTL analysis).
