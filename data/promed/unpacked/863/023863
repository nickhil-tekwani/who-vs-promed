The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries has received reports from different sources across the country complaining of strange pests and diseases affecting coffee trees. Farmers have reported that their coffee trees were drying up. The initial reports were from Eastern Region districts.

The ministry immediately constituted teams to conduct an emergency assessment of the complaints. They observed that there was high severity of coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust (CLR) in some Arabica coffee growing areas. If farmers do not manage the diseases, they can lose up to 50% of crop yield.

[Leaf rust
---------
Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance. No coffee cultivars resistant to all races are currently available. Furthermore, fungal spores that are wind borne or can easily be carried on travellers' clothes, as is the case for CLR, pose a very high biosecurity risk.

Berry disease
-------------
Coffee berry disease (CBD; also called green berry anthracnose) is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. _Colletotrichum_ species have been reported from _Coffea_ species wherever they are grown, causing spotting and blackening of fruit. A virulent strain of _C. coffeanum_, a species reported from Brazil at the end of the 19th century, was considered the cause of CBD, but the CBD pathogen has since been classified as a separate species.

CBD occurs only in Africa. Losses on arabica from CBD may be up to 80%. The pathogen affects flowers, immature coffee berries, and sometimes the beans. Infected berries display dark sunken spots coalescing into lesions. Berry development may be arrested, resulting in mummified berries on branches. Infected berries are considered the major source of inoculum. Spores are spread mainly by wind-blown rain or drops from treetops. Disease management includes cultural practices, quarantine, and periodic fungicide treatments. Some resistant host cultivars exist, and more are being developed.

Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), both diseases affect only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste.
