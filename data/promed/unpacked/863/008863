An emergency has been declared in Vilnius [Lithuania] after _Legionella_ bacteria were found in the water systems of several apartment buildings in the Lithuanian capital.

The Emergency Commission at the Vilnius local authority stated on [Fri 10 Mar 2017] that the situation met the criteria for an emergency, Arvydas Darulis, acting director of the city's administration, told BNS [Baltic News Service].

"We have 2 deaths and a 3rd incident is still under investigation. This affects over 500 people because there are 3 buildings and it takes more than 24 hours to eliminate (the emergency situation). Based on these criteria, an emergency situation has been declared," he said.

According to the official, the commission has activated an emergency operations centre to handle the emergency.

The National Public Health Service said that samples from 2 apartment blocks in the Zirmunai neighborhood, at Tuskulenu 5, and Ladygos 3, had tested positive for the bacteria that cause legionnaires' disease and samples from an apartment block in the Lazdynai neighborhood were still being tested.

To date, 2 residents of these buildings have died of legionnaires' disease and a 3rd is being treated.

Genotyping clinical and environmental _Legionella_ isolates will help establish transmission pathways: a common source would be presumed for cases that have matching of _Legionella_ genotypes; and a source for these cases with matching genotypes would be confirmed if the clinical genotype matches an environmental genotype.

Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania and its largest city, with a population of 542 664 residents as of 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius). Zirmunai, where 2 apartment blocks tested positive for _Legionella_, is Vilnius's most populous administrative division, located north of central Vilnius (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Žirmūnai). Lazdynai, where buildings are still being tested, is another neighborhood located southwest of central Vilnius (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lazdynai,+Vilnius,+Lithuania). - Mod.ML
