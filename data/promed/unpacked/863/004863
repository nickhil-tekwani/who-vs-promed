On Thu 18 Sep 2008, the hospital of Nantes in
west France informed the District Health Office
of a case of salmonellosis in an exclusively
bottle-fed infant. On Monday morning, 22 Sep
2008, 2 additional cases of salmonellosis in
infants were reported by the hospital of Niort in
southwest France. The serotype of the 3 cases was unknown at that time.

At the same time, the database of the French
national reference centre (NRC) for Salmonella
showed a recent increase in the proportion of
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Give isolates from
infants. The overall number of _S._ Give isolates
received by the NRC in 2008 was 19, similar
compared to the same period in previous years.
However, 6 of the recent isolates had been
obtained from infants, whereas this proportion was zero in previous years.

Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
An investigation was started to identify any
common exposures between the 3 reported cases of
infant salmonellosis, and to identify the
serotype(s) involved. In addition, we
investigated the cases of _S._ Give in infants
identified by the NRC. The parents of the 3
reported infant salmonella cases were interviewed
by the district health office on their
consumption of foods and drink and other
exposures. The infants, aged 9 weeks, and 4 and 5
months respectively, had developed symptoms of
febrile diarrhea between 13 and 18 Sep 2008 and
had been hospitalized between 17 and 19 Sep 2008.
The infants had not been in contact with other
diarrhea cases, and had no common exposures
except for their infant formula milk. All 3 drank
the same brand (brand X) formula milk. The batch
number of the product consumed during the days
before the onset of symptoms was known for 2
cases. The serotype of 1 of the 3 isolates was
known on 25 Sep 2008 and confirmed as Give.

As of 25 Sep 2008, 5 of the 6 infant cases of
_S._ Give in the NRC database have been
investigated. The infants are between 1.5 and 4.5
months of age and live scattered throughout
France. They developed symptoms between 17 and 28
Sep 2008: all had diarrhea, which was bloody for
4 infants, 4 had fever, and 2 were hospitalized.
The parents of all 5 infants reported feeding
their infants the same brand X of infant powdered
formula milk in the week before onset of
symptoms. The batch number is known for 1 case
and it is the same batch as in the 2 cases
mentioned above. No other common exposures were identified.

The preliminary results of the investigation
strongly suggest the brand X formula milk as the
vehicle of transmission. On 22 Sep 2008, the
authorities and the producer decided to recall
the incriminated batch. On 23 Sep 2008, the
producer initiated the recall of this batch. On
24 Sep 2008, the recall was extended to all
batches since consumers had difficulties
identifying the batch number. Consumers have been
advised not to drink the product and to return it to the place of sale.

Investigations are ongoing, particularly
microbiological examination of the product and
investigations of additional infant salmonellosis
cases. Since the recall, 5 additional cases of
infant salmonellosis have been reported. All 5
infants had consumed the incriminated product
before illness. The isolates of these cases are currently being serotyped.

A European alert was issued by France through the
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) on
23 Sep 2008. A warning was posted on the European
Early Warning and Response System on 25 Sep 2008,
and information was sent via the European Food
and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses Network at
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

[_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Give is frequently
found in cattle and pigs but is not frequently
found in humans (ref.5). In a study on salmonella
serovars in dairy cattle in the southwestern USA,
_S. Give_ was present in 4.8 percent of 393
salmonella isolates (there were 1560 fecal
samples, so the overall prevalence of _S. Give_
in the cattle sampled was 1.2 percent -- see ref
1 below. _S. Give_ has also been identified in
chicken (ref 2) and pigs (ref 3). There was a
country-wide outbreak of _S. enterica serovar
Give in Germany that was associated with the
ingestion of raw minced pork (ref 4).
