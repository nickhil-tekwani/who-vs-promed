What is alarming is that this monsoon, Puneities are under attack
from 3 diereses -- swine flu, malaria and chikungunya. According to
Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department figures, 10
chikungunya cases have been recorded since January [2010] till date.

R R Pardeshi, Medical Officer of Health (MoH), said as of now, we are
concentrating on slum areas. "There is no record of death in the city
due to chikungunya," he said.

[India is endemic for chikungunya virus, and sporadic outbreaks have
occurred frequently. This report does not provide specific dates for
the occurrence of these cases, so one does not know if this is a
small focal outbreak or just cases scattered over time, although the
report does associate them with the monsoon season.

The absence of deaths among the 10 chikungunya virus infections is
not at all surprising, as the case fatality rate for this infection
is nearly zero, mortality only having been documented retrospectively
in the massive La Reunion Island outbreak in 2005-2006 (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20061014.2953).
