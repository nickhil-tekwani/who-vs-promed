As a minor correction to [the] comments [reported in MMWR (Morb
Mortal Wkly Rep) 6 Mar 2009 / 58(08); 194-8, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5808a3.htm?s_cid=mm5808a3_e>],
the mother of this calf did not die. She had a retained placenta
leading to a uterine infection and decreased milk production. The
calf had to be hand-reared as a result. The mother was successfully
treated for the retained placenta. She is currently alive and doing well.

that reported: "The African elephant calf was born in captivity on
[28 Nov 2007] (approximately 2 weeks before its anticipated due
date), with a low birthweight. Because of loss of milk by the mother,
the calf was separated from its mother on [24 Dec 2007] and
hand-reared by zoo caretakers in an individual stall of the African
elephant enclosure. ... Because of poor weight gain with bottle
feeding, a central venous line was attempted by venous cutdown in the
right neck for total parenteral nutrition on [4 Jan 2008]. Three days
later, on [7 Jan 2008], the calf developed cellulitis at the sutured
surgical site, followed by pustules on the left leg and elbow on [18
Jan 2008]. Swab samples obtained from the calf's left elbow and left
leg on [21 Jan 2008] were laboratory confirmed as MRSA on [26 Jan
2008]. After topical, oral, and intravenous antibiotics were
administered, the calf's wounds healed. Nevertheless, the calf failed
to thrive and was euthanized on [4 Feb 2008]. Necropsy revealed
_Enterococcus_ spp. vegetative endocarditis but no MRSA bacteremia.
... [The] calf's mother, tested negative for MRSA colonization." - Mod.ML]
