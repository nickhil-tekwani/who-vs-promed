Research has been underway for some time to see if it can be established
whether BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Mad Cow Disease) might
have been present in the sheep flock in the early 1990s and masked by
scrapie.
Work has been undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to seek to
establish whether BSE might be in sheep now. The results so far on about
180 TSE-affected (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy) brains have
not shown BSE.
Work on material from the early 1990s has been conducted by the Institute
for Animal Health (IAH). It was anticipated that some results would be
ready to present to SEAC (Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee)
on Friday, 19 Oct 2001. However DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs], who commissioned the work, also commissioned
cross-checking research to guard against the possibility of material
being contaminated by cattle brains, not least because it had been
collected for entirely different experiments.
This cross-checking has raised doubts about the validity of the original
sample. DEFRA has commissioned an independent scientific audit to
establish the present status of the samples and will be working closely
with the IAH to clarify this issue.
