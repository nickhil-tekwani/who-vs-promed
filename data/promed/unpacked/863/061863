The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed guidelines to states on
Friday regarding pollution control requirements for large factory farms to
increase protection of lakes and streams from harmful runoff.
Under the rules, which are expected to be made final later this year, large
hog farms and cattle feedlots and poultry operations will be required to
get pollution permits from states, similar to permits already required for
industrial plants.
EPA officials characterized the new regulations as a significant step to
curtail nitrogen and phosphorous releases into lakes, streams and other
waterways from highly concentrated factory-like hog, cattle and poultry
operations.
EPA Assistant Administrator J. Charles Fox said he expects the first
general permits to be issued by states within a year and site-specific
permits phased in over the next 6 years.
Currently fewer than 2000 livestock operations are covered by state water
pollution control permits. The new requirement would bring an additional 18
000 facilities, mostly large hog, poultry and dairy operations, under the
permit system.
"These large facilities are generally significant contributors to water
quality impairment," the EPA said in a statement.
But many environmentalists complained the EPA isn't going far enough to
ensure that waterways nationwide are protected from pollution from factory
farms. They want tougher uniform federal standards under the new permit
program because they fear some states will not follow up with strong
pollution control requirements.
"There's a tremendous amount of variability among the states," said Robbin
Marks of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy
group. "We'd like to see some firm, measurable standards for pollution
controls set across the country."
Marks and other environmentalists complained that the Agriculture
Department, traditionally an ally of agribusiness, is being given too much
say in crafting the federal guidelines.
Fox dismisses such criticism and said while the EPA will establish the
basic guidelines and leave it for states to develop permits, the states
will have an obligation to issue permits in a way that protects waterways.
"If they don't, they're subject to EPA oversight and potential citizen
lawsuits," Fox said in an interview. "There will be some differences among
states, but ultimately all states will be implementing much more protective
programs."
The EPA will take comments on the draft guidelines for 60 days, with final
rules expected before the end of the year.
Pollution from large cattle feedlots, hog farms and poultry farms have been
of particular concern because of the large and concentrated amounts of
manure they produce - much of which is applied to farms[ fertilizer
causing nutrients to run off into nearby streams and other waterways.
These agricultural runoffs, which are rich in nutrients like nitrogen and
phosphorous, deprive lakes and streams of oxygen essential to maintaining
viable fisheries. They have been linked to the growth of dangerous toxic
microorganisms such as _Pfiesteria_ sp. that scientists believe has been
responsible for major fish kills in the Chesapeake Bay area, the Carolinas
and elsewhere.

[At this point in time, there is no definition of what a "large operation"
is. Hopefully, in the final rule making, this will be clarified, or there
will be a number of operations that will slip through the loop-hole at the
state level. Let us also hope these regulations affect research
institutions, such as universities. - Mod.TG
