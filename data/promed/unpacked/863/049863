[1] Singapore: Rapid breath test and phase 3 response
Date: Thu 22 Oct 2020

Singapore researchers have developed a breath test to detect COVID-19 within one minute. For this test, as per the information provided by National University of Singapore (NUS) researchers, a person simply would have to blow into a disposable mouthpiece connected to a "high-precision breath sampler."

Basically, this test detects volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a person's breath. A machine learning software is used that subsequently analyzes the VOC profile and generates the result in less than one minute.

As further explained by Breathonix CEO Dr. Jia Zhunan, VOCs are consistently produced by various biochemical reactions in human cells. Dr. Jia said, "Different diseases cause specific changes to the compounds, resulting in detectable changes in a person's breath profile. As such, VOCs can be measured as markers for diseases like COVID-19."

While talking about its working, the firm's chief operating officer Du Fang said, "The system's disposable mouthpiece has a one-way valve and a saliva trap which prevents inhalation and any saliva from entering the machine. This makes cross-contamination unlikely," he added.

So far, this NUS start-up Breathonix technology has achieved more than 90% accuracy in a clinical trial that involved 180 patients. This technology "offers a fast and convenient solution to identify COVID-19 infection," according to the university.

Currently, Singapore is working on the roadmap for the phase 3 of easing of safety measures under the circuit breaker, or semi-lockdown, to control the spread of COVID-19. Further, the city-state will continue to remain in Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) Orange "for the time being," the highest alert, according to the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.

From November [2020], a group of up to 20 people would be allowed to take part in activities like walking, cycling and kayaking tours, which is better from the current maximum size of 10, said the Singapore Tourism Board on Monday [19 Oct 2020]. Under safety measures, travel agencies and tour operators are allowed to resume on-site operations from 19 Oct 2020.

So far, 6 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Tuesday [20 Oct 2020], which included 4 imported ones, taking the total infections to 57 921.

[The following paragraphs are excerpts from Catino A, de Gennaro G, Di Gilio A, et al. Breath analysis: a systematic review of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in diagnostic and therapeutic management of pleural mesothelioma. Cancers (Basel). 2019; 11(6): 831. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11060831:

Currently physical, biochemical and molecular biological methods, mostly focused on blood and urine analysis, can be considered as widespread routine methods used for medical monitoring and clinical diagnosis. Diagnostics based on breath analysis is much less developed and not yet widely used in clinical practice, even if it is one of the most desirable non-invasive procedures.

Nowadays the breath test is routinely used as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection through the carbon dioxide monitoring and in the detection of airway inflammatory conditions by the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level monitoring.

Moreover, the breath test is currently used for the estimation of ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in blood (alcohol test). In the last decade, researchers worldwide have developed a new generation of breath tests for the detection of acute and/or chronic diseases, based on the monitoring of endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath and on the analysis of various cytokines, chemokines and proteins in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Exhaled breath, indeed, consists of a gaseous phase, containing both inorganic (i.e., nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, inert gases) and organic species (e.g., VOCs), and a liquid phase containing water vapor and proteins, the EBC.

Starting from the assumption that VOCs are conveyed to lungs through the blood system and are exhaled as a result of alveolar gas exchange mechanism, VOC detection and identification in breath samples has attracted, over the years, the interest of the scientific community, and the development of VOC determination-based breath test has been promoted. Therefore, changes in health status of a person and thus in cellular metabolism results in changes of VOC profile in human breath.

Although the knowledge on the composition of human breath in terms of VOCs has been improved in the last decade, the biochemical background of many compounds appearing in exhaled breath remains not completely known. The monitoring of VOCs in gaseous exhaled breath could represent a new frontier in medical early diagnosis.

Obviously, compared with investigations on human fluids such as blood, urine and stools, the breath sampling and analysis is preferable because is considered a non-invasive approach and avoids potentially infectious waste. In addition, the availability of the samples is essentially limitless and the measurement and detection of volatile compounds in a gaseous matrix is much simpler than in a more complex biologic matrix like the blood.

---
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gaseous carbon‚Äêbased end-products of physiologic and pathologic metabolic processes that can be detected in all biological specimens (e.g., breath, saliva, urine, faeces, blood) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21771869/). It has been shown that VOC concentration profiles and/or VOC composition differs between patients with and without certain diseases, ranging from infectious diseases to malignancies. The volatile compounds may represent metabolites of the infecting pathogen or alternatively pathogen-induced host responses or a combination of the 2. Testing of volatiles in exhaled-breath samples is a promising tool for early detection and surveillance of infectious agents because they are easy to collect, the procedure is noninvasive and rapid, and instruments are commercially available.

As Corr.SB noted: 90% accuracy in 180 people is a beginning. A larger testing pool is necessary before this can go commercial. - Mod.LK]

[2] Excess mortality comment/correction
Date: Fri 23 Oct 2020
From: Heinzpeter Schwermer <Heinzpeter.Schwermer@blv.admin.ch> [edited]


[re: ProMED COVID-19 update (447): herd immunity, USA excess mortality, WHO, global 20201021.7878076; [2] USA: excess mortality]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, many thanks for providing everyone with all the highly accurate and up-to-date information each day.

However, to me, there seems to be an error in the moderator's comments concerning the point "[2] USA: excess mortality." There, in the 1st sentence [the moderator] makes the rough calculation, "If you add the almost 200 000 deaths to the most recent mortality figures of slightly over 225 000 deaths, the estimated mortality directly attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the USA is 425 000." However, as I understand it, the number of known deaths due to COVID-19 is already included in the excess mortality figures. This leaves only the difference of "estimated 299 028 excess deaths" minus "known 216 025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019," thus 70 000 deaths that might be attributable to additional unreported deaths due to COVID-19.

Concerning the analysis of excess deaths, I draw your attention to an EU project (https://www.euromomo.eu/) monitoring excess deaths in some European countries and regions.

[Thank you very much to Dr. Heinzpeter Schwermer for pointing out my error in calculation/interpretation of the data in the excess mortality report. My apologies for any confusion caused by my error. While it is embarrassing to have made that error, it is nice to know the report is being read and given the opportunity to correct that error for our subscribers.

I would also like to thank Dr. Heinzpeter Schwermer for sending a link to the Euro MOMO website and highly recommend our readers to link over to the website. The graphs and maps are impressive for following the excess mortality impact of the pandemic in 24 European countries. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Mask usage
Date: Fri 23 Oct 2020 06:00 EDT
Source: The Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/23/pandemic-data-chart-masks/


Americans of all political stripes overwhelmingly support [the use of masks] as a public health measure and say they wear them whenever they're in public.

Still, there are significant differences in mask-use rates at the state level. And data from Carnegie Mellon's CovidCast, an academic project tracking real-time coronavirus statistics, yields a particularly vivid illustration of how mask usage influences the prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms in a given area. Take a look.

For all 50 states plus [Washington] DC, this chart plots the percentage of state residents who say they wear a mask in public all or most of the time (on the horizontal axis) and the percentage who say they know someone in their community with virus symptoms (on the vertical axis). If you're curious about the exact numbers for your state, there's a table at the bottom of this article.

Take Wyoming and South Dakota, for instance, in the upper left-hand corner of the chart. Roughly 60% to 70% of state residents report frequent mask use, as shown on the bottom axis, which puts them at the bottom for mask rates. They also have some of the highest levels of observed COVID-19 symptoms, approaching 40% and 50%. Now, note what happens as you move across the chart. States farther to the right have higher rates of mask use. And as mask use increases, the frequency of observed COVID-19 symptoms decreases: More masks, less COVID-19. [Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce this graphic in the post, but I highly recommend one goes to the source URL to view it. - Mod.MPP]

There's a simple statistical measure of correlation intensity called "R-squared," which goes from zero (absolutely no relationship between the 2 variables) to 1 (the variables move perfectly in tandem). The R-squared of CovidCast's mask and symptom data is 0.73, meaning that you can predict about 73% of the variability in state-level COVID-19 symptom prevalence simply by knowing how often people wear their masks.

The cost of running a survey for all 50 states plus [Washington] DC would be enormously prohibitive -- to say nothing of doing so on a daily basis, which is necessary to produce the kind of real-time data of interest to epidemiologists. So, the CovidCast team partnered with Facebook, which is used by 70% of US adults and has the ability to survey tens of thousands of them every day at relatively low cost. While the resulting state-level samples aren't perfect representations of the general population, the researchers weight the responses using Census Bureau demographic data to ensure they're a good approximation.

"If Facebook's users are different from the US population generally in a way that the survey weighting process doesn't account for, then our estimates could be biased," cautioned Alex Reinhart, a Carnegie Mellon professor of statistics and data science who works on CovidCast and wrote a book on statistical methods. "But if that bias doesn't change much over time, then we can still use the survey to detect trends and changes."

He also cautioned that the old saw of "correlation doesn't equal causation" applies here as well. "There could be other explanations for the correlation," he said. "For example, states that had worse outbreaks earlier in the pandemic both have higher mask usage now and more immunity." And, he added, "if people say they're not wearing masks, they may not be taking other protective measures either. So perhaps what we see is a combination of mask usage, other social distancing behaviors and perhaps other factors we haven't measured."

Nevertheless, the chart is particularly useful in the context of all the other high-quality evidence showing that masks reduce the transmission of the coronavirus and other respiratory diseases. There's good reason to suspect, in other words, that rates of mask use are driving at least part of the relationship seen in the chart above, even if the data can't prove that definitively.

For people living in states that are driving the latest spike in coronavirus cases, the takeaway is clear: Wear a mask when you go out in public.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 217.

Data by country, area, or territory for 23 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct23_1603488388.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 29.8% of daily case numbers and 46.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.1 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica and Chile.

- The European region reported 48.0% of daily case numbers and 28.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 8.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (23 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan and Sweden. France is dominant (41 536), followed by the UK, Spain, Russia, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Netherlands, Ukraine, Switzerland, Romania, Portugal, Austria, Armenia, Turkey, and Hungary. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Israel, Ireland, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 7.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.8 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Morocco, Iraq, Jordan, UAE, and Lebanon. Libya, Kuwait, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 while Tunisia, Sudan, and Yemen did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 2.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.28 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.77% of daily case numbers and 0.80% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.69 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 14.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 13.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.7 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: There are now 25 countries in the European reporting more than 1000 new cases in 24 hours and 8 countries reporting more than 10 000 cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for more than 75% of daily reported cases and 75% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 23 Oct 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, the USA (85 302) and India (54 028) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 6476 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (22-23 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (20 countries) include the USA, India, France (42 032), Brazil (23 016), UK (20 531), Spain (19 851), Italy (19 143), Russia (17 340), Belgium (16 746), Argentina (15 718), Czech Republic (15 258), Poland (13 632), Germany (13 476), Netherlands (9996), Colombia (8672), Ukraine (7517), Switzerland (6634), Mexico (6604), Iran (6134), and Romania (5028). A total of 13 countries reported more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours, 9 of which were in the European region. A total of 49 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 47 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region and 5 were from the South East Asia region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 16.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.8%. Looking at the USA, daily case counts have increased by 16.4% and daily reported deaths have increased by 12.9%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Note that the daily case count for today was close to half a million cases and the cumulative total has surpassed 42 million. - Mod.MPP]
