A new case of imported _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria from the
Dominican Republic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria (0.33 percent parasitemia) was
diagnosed in Montreal on 12 Feb 2008, in a female tourist returning
on 2 Feb 2008 from a 2-week holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican
Republic. She claims she did not leave the hotel area. There was no
other exposure to malaria regions of the world except for the same
hotel a year earlier [2007].

[Malaria is still a problem in the Dominican Republic, and not only
close to the borders with Haiti, as Punta Cana is at the eastern tip
of the country. The Dominican Republic reported 1233 cases of malaria
to PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) in 2000, which trippled in
2005 to 3837 and slightly declined to 3525 in 2006, the last year for
which data is available. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended to all
travellers and chloroquine is still effective. - Mod. EP]
