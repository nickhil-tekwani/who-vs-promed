[1] Waterpark - USA (NY), norovirus suspected

State Department of Health officials still don't know exactly what
caused a gastrointestinal illness outbreak at the Great Escape Lodge
& Indoor Waterpark over the weekend, but the number of reported cases
of individuals sickened has risen to nearly 200. More than 300 people
have also called the department's hot line, (800) 278-2965, to report
symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting after visiting the resort or to get
information.

The Department of Health suspects a norovirus is to blame for the
sickness, but officials are still awaiting laboratory test results to
confirm that. This virus is usually very contagious, a Department of
Health announcement said, and is generally spread person-to-person by
direct contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.

While health experts await a definitive answer, Great Escape
officials seem to be taking more stringent measures to prevent the
illness from spreading. On Friday [21 Mar 2008], each person entering
the lobby of the lodge was approached by employees offering to squirt
sanitizer into their hands. An infectious disease specialist has also
been hired to consult with Great Escape on the situation. "They've
done everything the Department of Health has asked them to do, and
gone well beyond that," he said. "They sent out every piece of linen
from the rooms -- dust ruffles, pillow cases, sheets -- for outside
laundering. There was also one group of employees who worked in a
particular restaurant that got sick," Tack added. "So again,
proactively, Six Flags has closed that restaurant for 48 to 72
hours." (Six Flags is the parent company of Great Escape, and the
restaurant that was shut down was Tall Tales Tavern).

Tack said he doesn't believe it's likely that the employees or the
currently ill patrons got sick after eating contaminated food. "This
is not typically a food-borne illness," he said. "There's no evidence
this was food-borne at all. In fact, many of the guests who have had
this illness didn't eat in the lodge at all. The employees could have
contracted it, potentially, just by clearing a table or picking up a
glass, a plate or a fork," Tack added. There also isn't any evidence
that the illness was a result of tainted water.

"The water, both coming into the lodge and into the water park, has
been tested and has come back clear," Tack said. "This was not an
event tied to the water park's water or the municipal water coming
in." Tack suggested that the illness might have been brought into the
facility by a visitor last weekend.

Nevertheless, Great Escape isn't taking any chances with its sick
employees. Each staff member who is showing symptoms is being asked
to go home, and none are allowed to return until they've been better
for 48 hours, Tack said.

[2] Company HQ - UK (Scotland) - norovirus suspected
Date: Sat 22 Mar 2008

An international oil firm is expecting to find out today [Sat 22 Mar
2008] what was behind an outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea that
forced it to close its northeast headquarters. Marathon Oil UK sent
all staff at its Marathon House base in Aberdeen home on Thursday
[Thu 20 Mar 2008] to let NHS [National Health Service] Grampian and
council staff investigate the mystery bug which had struck down 100 people.

The firm, which has around 400 workers at the Rubislaw Hill complex,
said the decision to send staff home was made to stop the infection
spreading any further. An infection expert told the Press and Journal
the outbreak looked like the norovirus winter vomiting bug, which has
been rampant in the northeast, but the firm said it still did not
know the cause of the outbreak last night.

A spokesman said the firm hoped the results of tests would come back
at some point over the weekend. NHS Grampian's health-protection team
was called in to investigate the outbreaks, and members of Aberdeen
City Council's environmental health team were also at the offices on
Thursday [20 Mar 2008] to help with the cleaning of the site.
Marathon House will open again on Monday [24 Mar 2008], and it is
thought that all individuals affected by the bug are recovering at home.

NHS Grampian said anyone suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting should
be very careful with their hand hygiene and should remain at home
until 48 hours after their symptoms have settled.

[These 2 outbreaks of suspected norovirus infection are likely to be
confirmed as a consequence of their characteristic epidemiology.
Studies across the world have shown that in recent years most
norovirus outbreaks have been caused by strains belonging to a
particular genotype, named GII.4. The GII.4 strains evolve rapidly
(by mutation and recombination) and are further subdivided into
variants. Since 1995, 3 variants have emerged and replaced each other
globally, in 1995, 2002, and 2004. In 2006, 2 variants emerged that
co-circulated. Characterisation studies suggest that lineages evolve
through selective pressure and are likely to be antigenic variants
(drift variants). [see: Siebenga JJ, Vennema H, Renckens B et al.
Epochal evolution of GGII.4 norovirus capsid proteins from 1995 to
2006. J Virol., 81(18):9932-41, 2007; and ProMED-mail Norovirus,
strain characterisation 20080111.0146]. For these reasons, community
immunity is rarely built-up and retained. There is likely always to
be a high proportion of susceptibles in the population.

Noroviruses are highly contagious and often present as food-borne
infections through food-handlers and food premises. Fortunately, the
disease is short-lived, and thorough disinfection and attention to
personal hygiene can contain outbreaks, often before a definitive
diagnosis is established as in the outbreaks reported above.
