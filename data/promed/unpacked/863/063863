Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors

Epidemiological comments: outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis have been reported in piggeries in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. This represents a significant change in the virus' presence in Australia. Serological evidence of Japanese encephalitis is periodically detected in the Torres Strait region of northern Australia but has not previously established transmission on mainland Australia. Climate conditions of above median rainfall and warmer minimum temperature may be a factor in the current event.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied, domestic: traceability, quarantine, ante and post-mortem inspections, control of vectors, disinfection, disinfestation, movement control inside the country, screening, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, vector surveillance.

Control measures applied, wild: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, screening, vector surveillance, control of vectors.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (national laboratory) / Swine / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 8 / 21 Feb 2022 / Positive
Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute (EMAI), Virology ( local laboratory) / Swine / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 1 / 21 Feb 2022 / Positive

Japanese encephalitis detected in Eastern Australia
---------------------------------------------------
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been detected in piggeries in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.

Australian Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis at one piggery in Victoria's north, 6 piggeries in NSW, and in one piggery in Queensland.

"JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly occurs in pigs and horses but can cause disease in people and rarely other animals," Dr Schipp said.

"Animals and people become infected through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products. The disease is not transmitted from person to person.

"This is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure.

"The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment are collaborating closely, together with state and territory counterparts.

"We are meeting regularly and working together to work through the next steps of this situation.

"We're asking anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they're a pet in the backyard, to keep an eye out for and report any possible signs of this disease.

"The most common symptoms in pigs are mummified or stillborn piglets, or piglets who show neurological problems in the first 6 months of life. The disease tends to be asymptomatic in adult sows, but boars can experience infertility and testicle congestion.

"Horses can experience a range of symptoms. While most infected horses do not show signs of disease, some more severe signs of JEV in horses include fever, jaundice, lethargy, anorexia and neurological signs which can vary in severity.

"JEV is a nationally notifiable disease, which means if you suspect an animal is showing signs of the disease, you must report it (see contact details below). Measures should also be taken to protect animals from mosquitoes -- for instance, applying a safe insect repellent and putting a summer rug on horses."

Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Sonya Bennett said JEV infections can be contracted by humans through the bite of a mosquito. There are no confirmed human cases in Australia at this stage, although this is under active investigation. "We are aware that several cases of encephalitis of unknown cause have been identified in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia within the past month.

"JE is also a notifiable disease in humans and health authorities across the country are on the alert for human cases and are in direct contact with people associated with the affected piggeries," Dr Bennett said.

"Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes who then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.

"Severe illness arising from JEV infection in humans is rare and most people will have no symptoms at all if infected.

"However, a very small proportion of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

"Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting.

"Anyone experiencing these symptoms, particularly if they've visited regions in eastern Australia or South Australia where there has been high mosquito activity, should seek urgent medical attention.

"Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of infection caused by JEV in patients in affected areas with encephalitis and refer people for appropriate testing, after other common causes have been excluded.

"There is work underway to plan for targeted vaccinations. Two different vaccines are available for protection against JEV in Australia and are very safe and effective for both adults and children.

"However, prevention is always better than a cure and there are simple steps we can all take to avoid our exposure to infected mosquitos

"People in areas of high mosquito activity in Eastern Australia should use mosquito repellent containing picaridin or DEET on all exposed skin.

"Wear long, loose fitting clothing when outside, and ensure accommodation, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens.

"We will continue to meet with health authorities in the states and territories to progress the public health response to this disease."

To report suspected JEV in pigs or other animals, contact your local veterinarian or call the national Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

[The immediate notification report complements the information already published in ProMED postings 20220301.8701721 and 20220228.8701705.

"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae and causes encephalitis, principally in horses and humans. JEV also infects pigs where it causes abortions and stillbirths. JEV is maintained in nature between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds. The major vector of JEV throughout most of Asia is _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, however other species may be locally important. Pigs act as important amplifiers of the virus, and birds can also be involved in its amplification and spread in the environment. The disease has been observed in large parts of Asia and recently in the western Pacific region. In horses, the infection is usually inapparent. Affected horses show clinical signs that include pyrexia, depression, muscle tremors, and ataxia. In pigs, abortions and stillbirths can occur when pregnant sows are infected with JEV for the first time. Infected pregnant sows usually show no clinical signs". Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2021, Chapter 3.1.10, Japanese encephalitis (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.10_JEV.pdf)

"JEV is present in India, south-eastern parts of Russia, many parts of Asia and Papua New Guinea.

"Australia is considered free of the disease; however, the far north of Australia's Cape York Peninsula is considered an area at risk and seasonal incursions of JEV are occasionally detected in humans in the Torres Strait.

"JEV was detected in 3 people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. Two further cases were detected in humans in Queensland in 1998, including one acquired on the Australian mainland. Most recently, a human case was detected on the Tiwi Islands in 2021".
