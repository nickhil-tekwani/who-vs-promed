The depopulation of a large cattle feedlot near Ashburton to curb an infectious cattle disease is expected to have a significant flow-on effect on the local economy. Mayor Neil Brown said Biosecurity New Zealand's move to depopulate the Five Star Beef Wakanui feedlot from [13 Oct 2022], followed by a stand-down period, was "good biosecurity" and was needed if the country wanted to get rid of _Mycoplasma bovis_ (_M. bovis_). "If it's leaking out of the feedlot, let the feedlot depopulate."

The bacterial disease has plagued the dairy industry since it was discovered in New Zealand in 2017. Commonly found in cattle worldwide, it spreads from animal to animal through close contact and through movement of asymptomatic animals. It can also potentially spread on contaminated equipment and feeding of untreated milk to calves but is not windborne. The disease can cause untreatable mastitis in dairy cows and severe pneumonia in infected calves.

Although it was thought to have almost been eradicated to just the feedlot in May [2022], 3 Mid Canterbury properties, including one owned by the ANZCO-owned feedlot, were found to have the disease in June [2022]. Now Biosecurity NZ is moving to control 14 farms around the feedlot, 11 of which are privately owned. The properties have been served with a Controlled Area Notice, with those considered at high risk expected to be depopulated by mid-January [2023]. Low-risk farms will be subjected to testing.

Brown said the closure of the feedlot, which finishes 12 000 cattle on grain, would affect the local community too, including at the ANZCO meat processing plant in Ashburton. He believed almost an entire chain there was devoted to processing feedlot cattle.

ANZCO communications head Janet Wright said the company's meat processing teams had specialist skills and expertise and no-one would lose their jobs, although she did not clarify if hours would be reduced.

Brown said farmers from Mid Canterbury and all over New Zealand supplied the feedlot with young livestock to be finished, but they would now have to look at finishing them on farm. However, Wright said the company was working with its cattle suppliers to maintain the supply.

With beef prices and demand high, Brown was confident the influx of cattle on the market would not see prices fall. He believed it might also financially affect local arable farmers who supply maize and grain on contract as well as cartage companies. "It will have a ripple effect throughout Mid Canterbury."

Rakaia farmer [HS] said the _M. bovis_ eradication programme was not working. [HS] faced devastation himself after his farm became one of 3 Mid Canterbury farms infected with the disease earlier this year [2022]. "I just dropped to my knees and balled my eyes out in the kale paddock."

Also working as a stock agent, [HS] had seen several of his Mid Canterbury dairy clients lose their herds and had witnessed their heartache. [HS] said he believed the disease would never be eradicated because current thresholds allowed low numbers of positives in a herd. [Eradication of infected animals would decrease the threshold dramatically. - Mod.TG]

Under eradication threshold rules, of 250 cows tested in April [2022] in [HS]'s first herd, only 7 were positive, meaning he would not have to cull them. But his 2nd herd was higher at 19 positives. Both figures were combined, even though the herds were kept completely separate, so 966 of his cows would have to leave his farm in January [2023] to be culled. "We were that close to being non-terminal."

[HS] would have normally had to cull all his cows immediately, but officials agreed to a January [2023] date as the animals were in calf and the disease did not affect milk or meat products. All calves born had already been culled.

Rural Transport manager Lance King said the closure of the feedlot for 3 months would have a significant effect on his business and on other haulage companies in the area. The business carts livestock non-stop to the ANZCO meatworks -- up to 6 trips a day with 200 head of cattle in each load. King hoped ANZCO would have other work in the interim.

Properties being under a notice of direction means animals can't be moved off a farm until testing is completed and clear results returned. The vast majority of farms under a notice of direction return a negative result and are able to resume farming without restrictions.

_M. bovis_ infection affects animals at the herd level or management group, unlike other cattle diseases such as tuberculosis. Therefore, if a herd is confirmed to be infected, the whole herd will be culled.

[_Mycoplasma bovis_ was detected for the first time in New Zealand in July 2017. The bacterial disease is harmless to humans and not transmitted through milk or meat but can cause untreatable mastitis, abortion, and arthritis in cattle. It is present on both the North and the South islands.

This article does not mention the implementation of vaccination. There is a vaccine available to fight _M.bovis_. The vaccine may or may not be allowed in New Zealand, but it seems like it is time to get the vaccine and start a vaccination program. This vaccine helps control and prevent the spread of _M. bovis_ in calf operations. And there may be provisions for adult cattle for which I am unaware.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), arthritis, mastitis (infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue), and various other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments. Also, it sometimes works in conjunction with other pathogen organisms.

According to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/new-zealand-on-verge-of-eradicating-cattle-disease-mycoplasma published on (4 May 2022):

"The government began its elimination strategy 4 years ago as the spread of the bacterial infection threatened the health of its dairy and beef cattle herds. Since then, more than 176 000 cattle have been culled and 271 properties cleared of the infection, while the government has paid NZD 220 million (USD 144 million) in compensation to farmers who have lost their herds.

"'When we took our one shot to eradicate, we did so to protect our national herd from a painful disease, our economy from a sharp shock, and our rural communities from widespread anxiety,' Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on (Thu 28 Apr 2022) in Wellington. 'I want to acknowledge how tough it's been for those farmers who have lost their herds and stock genetics built up over decades,' she said. 'No one in the world had attempted to eradicate _M. bovis_ before, and if we were going to try something which had never been done, we needed to do so together.'

"_Mycoplasma bovis_, which occurs in many farming nations, affects the health of cattle and is spread between animals even if they show no signs of having the disease. It doesn't infect humans, and the milk or beef from an infected animal presents no food safety risk.

"The remaining infected property is a large beef feed-lot and not a working farm, and planning is underway to start clearing it later this year, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said."

We extend our sympathies to the producers and wish New Zealand well in its efforts to eliminate this disease. - Mod.TG
