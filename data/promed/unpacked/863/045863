In response to ProMED's report on 29 Dec 2007 (archive number
20071229.4171) of egg-related salmonellosis in New South Wales,
Australia, I would like to add the following information:
NSW Health is currently using both MLVA [multiple-locus
variable-number tandem repeat analysis] and phage typing for
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium isolates. These are the
results for the possible egg related outbreaks reported in ProMED to
date.
_S._ Typhimurium 44 ( MLVA 3-10-8-9-523): 11 cases consumed a variety
of cakes from a single cake shop over a weekend. Raw eggs were used
in some of the cakes, cross contamination is the likely source of the
other infections. STM 44 is an established egg-related serovar in
Australia.
_S._ Typhimurium 9 (MLVA 3-20-17-11-523): unknown source, no
individual case data collected. Multiple foods consumed. Raw eggs
were used in batter for fried ice cream.
_S._ Typhimurium 9 (MLVA 3-10-14-11-496): 11/13 people ill. Commonly
consumed foods were raw egg mayonnaise and mousse. This MLVA pattern
was previously associated with a large egg outbreak in NSW.
_S._ Typhimurium 29 (MLVA 3-11-10-8-523): 3/3 ill after consuming eggnog.
Based on the epidemiology, laboratory results, and traceback
information provided by the NSW Food Authority we do not have
evidence that these outbreaks are related at this time.
