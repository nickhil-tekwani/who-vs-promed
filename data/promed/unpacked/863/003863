Sudan measles outbreak lacks sufficient funding and vaccines
------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Sudan, UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organisations have participated in the response to Sudan's measles outbreak, but they report that they lack the necessary funding and vaccines to adequately treat the outbreak.

Since the outbreak in December 2014, there have been 710 confirmed measles cases out of the 1600 suspected cases. These have occurred in 23 different localities within 12 of Sudan's states.

In January 2015, Sudan immunized 508 954 children in the Gedarif state and 518 036 children in the Kassal state. Despite their remarkable efforts to control the measles outbreak, organisations have encountered setbacks because of the lack of funds and vaccines. Healthcare workers have continued to manage cases, respond with vaccine campaigns, raise community health awareness and alert investigators of outbreaks.

To continue battling the outbreak, the WHO and UNICEF have applied for USD 4 million in a Central Emergency Fund proposal. The plan is for UNICEF to obtain the vaccines and similar supplies, while WHO will obtain technical and operational support for another vaccine campaign.

West Darfur has been especially impacted, as many of its cases have affected goldmine workers. In recent days, North Darfur -- including Sharaf Omra and Jabel Amer -- has reported new measles cases. The areas in North Darfur compound the outbreak due to internal displacement.

Passenger on another Beijing-Vancouver flight diagnosed with measles
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials say people on a 2nd flight from Beijing [China] to Vancouver [British Columbia province, Canada] Saturday [4 Apr 2015] may have been exposed to measles after a passenger was diagnosed with the disease. The warning affects passengers who traveled on Air Canada flight AC 6601 and landed at Vancouver airport at 12:15 p.m. Saturday [4 Apr 2015]. Vancouver Coastal Health [VCH] is asking those passengers to make sure they're up to date on their measles vaccinations.

Anyone who experiences symptoms of the highly infectious disease, including, fever, cough, runny nose, pink eye and a red rash are urged to see a doctor and call in advance, so other patients aren't infected. "For those who aren't certain, or have any reason to believe they have not received these vaccines, it is safe to receive the vaccine now," said VCH spokeswoman Dr. Reka Gustafson. Symptoms should also be reported to VCH by calling 604-675-3900.

The warning comes after several other cases of the disease in Metro Vancouver stemmed from Air China flight CA 991 from Beijing to Vancouver. Two weeks ago [the latter part of March 2015], 2 Carver Christian High School students aboard an Air China flight between the cities tested positive for the disease. Health officials also said last week [the 1st week in April 2015] that a student at Vancouver's Lord Byng Secondary School had come down with measles symptoms, and vaccinations were administered.

A total of 9 people have contracted measles since the 1st case was identified in late March [2015], according to VCH. In each case, the infections were linked to trips to China. "We are actually quite confident that all the people who have developed measles were well isolated and identified very early on in their disease," said Gustafson.

Long-term complications from measles can include deafness and brain damage. The disease kills one in every 3000 Canadians who catch it, according to officials. It has an incubation period that ranges from 7 to 21 days after exposure, and the disease's early symptoms resemble those of a common cold.

Case of measles confirmed at Terry Fox Secondary School
-------------------------------------------------------
Another case of measles has been confirmed at a Metro Vancouver school. Parents of Terry Fox Secondary [School, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia] students have received letters telling them a person was infectious while at the school.

The health authority says it is linked to the original Air China flight in March [2015] carrying 2 infected students. A vaccination clinic is being held tomorrow.

11th case of measles confirmed in B.C. as debate on mandatory vaccinations continue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An 11th case of measles has been reported in Metro Vancouver [British Columbia]. Vancouver Coastal Health confirmed the new case on Friday [10 Apr 2015]. All positive cases are people who were either on the original [21 Mar 2015] Air China Flight CA991, or were in contact with someone who had been on that flight.

Today an immunization clinic is being held at Port Coquitlam's Terry Fox Secondary after it was confirmed a student has measles. [See above report, item [3].] Health officials say it is linked to the same Air China flight. Fraser Health says the student went to class while infected. An immunization clinic is open until 3 p.m. today [10 Apr 2015].

Measles were also on board another Air China flight that arrived in Vancouver on [4 Apr 2015]. With more cases in Metro Vancouver, many are wondering if mandatory vaccinations are in order. It's a debate that is happening now in California [USA] as the legislature looks over a proposed bill.

Nienke Van Houten, a lecturer in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University, says the topic of mandatory vaccinations is a very complex one. "Questions as to how these regulations are enforced," she said. "For example, you could have a fine, you could have imprisonment in the extreme cases, it may be as simple as withholding children from school, which of course might infringe on a child's right to education. Fines are regressive so it would impact a lot of lower income families."

The proposed bill in California would possibly take away a parent's right to opt out of vaccines for religious or other reasons. "Parental autonomy is important," said Van Houten, "but it's also really important to have a specific level of community immunity within a population so that we can prevent the spread of these infectious diseases." She added that there are other ways of approaching the issue of mandatory vaccinations.

"People opt out of vaccines for a number of different reasons," she said. "I think there's also other approaches we can use to broadly incentivize people to vaccinate. So one issue with vaccine compliance is this sometimes happens in small religious communities where people are home schooling kids as well, so in those cases, if they're not entering into the school system they still have the ability to not be part of the vaccination program so that still leaves open a pocket of potential susceptible people."

Progress Toward Measles Elimination -- Philippines, 1998-2014
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Yoshihiro Takashima, MD, W. William Schluter, MD, Kayla Mae L. Mariano, Sergey Diorditsa, MD, Maricel de Quiroz Castro, Alan C. Ou, MD, Maria Joyce U. Ducusin, MD, Luzviminda C. Garcia, Dulce C. Elfa, Alya Dabbagh, PhD, Paul Rota, PhD, James L. Goodson, MPH]

Background
----------
In 2005, the Regional Committee for the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) established a goal to eliminate measles* by 2012. The recommended elimination strategies in WPR include 1) greater than or equal to 95 percent 2-dose coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV) through routine immunization services and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs); 2) high-quality case-based measles surveillance; 3) laboratory surveillance with timely and accurate testing of specimens to confirm or discard suspected cases and detect measles virus genotypes; and 4) measles outbreak preparedness, rapid response, and appropriate case management. In the WPR, the Philippines set a national goal in 1998 to eliminate measles by 2008 (3). This report describes progress toward measles elimination in the Philippines during 1998-2014 and challenges remaining to achieve the goal. WHO-United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-estimated coverage with the routine 1st dose of MCV (MCV1) increased from 80 percent in 1998 to 90 percent in 2013, and coverage with the routine 2nd dose of MCV (MCV2) increased from 10 percent after nationwide introduction in 2010 to 53 percent in 2013. After nationwide SIAs in 1998 and 2004, historic lows in the numbers and incidence of reported measles cases occurred in 2006. Despite nationwide SIAs in 2007 and 2011, the number of reported cases and incidence generally increased during 2007-2012, and large measles outbreaks occurred during 2013-2014 that affected infants, young children, older children, and young adults and that were prolonged by delayed and geographically limited outbreak response immunization activities during 2013-2014. For the goal of measles elimination in WPR to be achieved, sustained investments are required in the Philippines to strengthen health systems, implement the recommended elimination strategies, and develop additional strategies to identify and reduce measles susceptibility in specific geographic areas and older age groups.

Immunization Activities
-----------------------
MCV1 and MCV2 coverage data are reported each year from the 17 regions in the Philippines to the National Immunization Programme; national coverage data are reported annually to WHO and UNICEF. WHO and UNICEF use reported data from administrative records and surveys to estimate coverage with MCV1 and MCV2 through routine immunization services. In the Philippines, MCV1 administered at age 9 months was introduced nationwide in 1983, and MCV2 administered at age 12-15 months was introduced nationwide in 2010. WHO-UNICEF-estimated MCV1 coverage increased nationally from 80 percent in 1998 to 92 percent during 2004-2008, decreased to 79 percent in 2011, and increased to 90 percent in 2013. The number of regions with greater than 95 percent MCV1 coverage decreased from 7 in 2007 to none in 2013. Estimated MCV2 coverage increased nationally from 10 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2013. During 1998-2014, approximately 76.4 million children received MCV during SIAs. Nationwide SIA coverage was 94-95 percent in 1998, 2004, and 2007, but only 84 percent in 2011 and 91 percent in 2014. There was significant regional variation in vaccination coverage with MCV1 and with SIAs.

Surveillance Activities
-----------------------
Sentinel site-based surveillance with reporting of line lists of suspected measles cases started in 1989; nationwide measles case-based surveillance with laboratory testing started in 1992, and virus genotyping started in 2010. Key surveillance performance indicators include 1) rate of discarded (i.e., nonmeasles) suspected cases reported per 100 000 population (target: greater than or equal to 2); 2) percentage of suspected cases with adequate investigation (target: greater than or equal to 80 percent); 3) percentage of suspected cases with adequate blood specimens collected for laboratory testing (target: greater than or equal to 80 percent); and 4) percentage of suspected cases with results reported within 7 days of the laboratory receiving the specimen (target: greater than or equal to 80 percent). During 2009-2011, surveillance performance improved: the discarded non-measles case rate increased from 1.6 to 3.1; the adequate case investigation rate increased from 29.5 percent to 88.6 percent; the adequate specimen collection rate increased from 74.1 percent to 98.0 percent; and the timeliness of laboratory reporting increased from 53.8 percent to 72.6 percent. However, performance declined or varied in 2012 and during the 2013-2014 measles resurgence.

Measles Incidence and Measles Viral Genotypes
---------------------------------------------
During 1998-2014, the number of annual reported measles cases varied in relation to SIAs, declining after SIAs were conducted and then increasing in subsequent years. Overall, annual reported measles cases and incidence per 1 million population decreased from 1984 and 27.1 in 1998 to 9 and 0.1 in 2006 and then increased to 21 403 and 233.2 in 2014. On the basis of SIAs conducted, 2007-2014 can be divided into 2 periods. During the 2007-2011 inter-SIA period, 142 measles cases were reported. During the 2011-2014 inter-SIA period, 58 700 measles cases were reported. At the national level, the proportion of measles cases in children aged 9 months-4 years decreased from 38 percent in the 1st inter-SIA period to 28 percent in the 2nd inter-SIA period, and the proportion of measles cases in adolescents and adults aged greater than or equal to 15 years increased from 18 percent in the 1st period to 29 percent in the 2nd period. The nationwide measles resurgence started with outbreaks in Calabarzon (Region 4A), Central Luzon (Region 3), the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR), and Western Visayas (Region 6) during the 1st half of 2013 and spread to many parts of Luzon and Visayas geographical divisions during October-December 2013. Outbreak response immunization activities targeting children aged 6-59 months were implemented in Calabarzon, Central Luzon, and the National Capital Region during January-February 2014; however, by that time the whole country was affected by measles outbreaks. After implementation of the nationwide SIA in September 2014 targeting children aged 9-59 months, 642 (37 percent) of the 1719 measles cases during October-December 2014 were in persons aged greater than or equal to 15 years. The predominant measles virus genotype was D3 before 2007, then D9 and G3 during 2007-2009 (4) and D9 during 2010-2012. During 2013-2014, of 69 cases with genotyping, 68 were B3 and one was D9. Genotypes D3 and G3 have not been reported since 2005 and 2010, respectively.

Discussion
----------
The nationwide measles resurgence in the Philippines during 2013-2014 reflected the insufficient implementation of measles elimination strategies. Persistent low vaccination coverage since 1998 combined with the relatively low level of circulation of measles virus after SIAs resulted in the accumulation of measles-susceptible cohorts of older age children and young adults and a change in the epidemiology of measles in the Philippines. The resurgence highlighted key program challenges: 1) persistent suboptimal MCV1 coverage, 2) low MCV2 coverage since introduction during 2009-2010; 3) suboptimal SIA coverage with large variations in coverage by region; 4) recent SIA target age groups too narrow to interrupt measles virus transmission among older children, evidenced by the proportion of cases occurring outside the SIA target age group; and 5) inadequate outbreak response activities before widespread measles virus transmission started. The failure to achieve high population immunity among the targeted age groups before 2013 contributed to the observed increase in the proportion of measles cases among older children and young adults that indicated a shift in the age of the measles-susceptible population from young children to a wider age group during the nationwide measles resurgence in 2013-2014. This shift will require special strategies for vaccination activities.

In June 2014, the WPR Immunization and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Technical Advisory Group recommended that countries achieve and maintain greater than or equal to 95 percent 2-dose MCV coverage through routine services and periodic SIAs, and, in addition, that endemic countries and countries experiencing nation-wide resurgence 1) update national plans and develop subnational plans with focus on high-risk and measles-susceptible groups; 2) enhance surveillance activities, including rapid case detection and outbreak investigation; 3) annually review and identify districts and age groups with suboptimal population immunity; and 4) increase population immunity by taking corrective actions such as periodic selective immunization activities and more frequent subnational or national SIAs. The Technical Advisory Group also recommended maintaining a national outbreak response plan for implementation of timely and prompt response activities.

Based on these recommendations, the Philippines Department of Health proposed new activities for measles elimination in the draft National Immunization Programme Strategic Plan for 2015-2019, with plans to conduct 1) selective immunization activities for children aged 12-35 months in all regions in 2015 and 2) nonselective SIAs for a wide target age group during 2015-2017 in regions with sustained measles virus transmission or identified measles susceptibility among older children and adults. In October 2014, the Department of Health issued an administrative order to strengthen local government capacity to identify measles outbreaks, plan outbreak response activities, and provide health workers with guidance on how to respond appropriately to new outbreaks and sustained measles virus transmission. In August 2015, the government will implement a nationwide public school-based measles-rubella-tetanus-diphtheria vaccination of 7th-grade students and establish a school entry immunization check in all public and private schools. Children with incomplete vaccination records at the time of school entry immunization check will be referred to either the school clinic or the nearest health center to receive missed vaccinations.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, administrative coverage data might be unreliable because of inaccurate estimates of the size of target populations and the reported number of doses delivered. Second, surveillance data underestimate the likely number of cases that occurred because not all persons with measles sought care and were reported through surveillance.

In 2013, the WPR Regional Verification Committee for Measles Elimination verified that endemic measles virus transmission had been interrupted for a period of at least 36 months in Australia, Macao [China], Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea. However, during 2013-2014, the measles resurgence in the Philippines led to measles virus importations and increased incidence in several WPR countries including Australia and the Republic of Korea and in countries in other WHO regions. Resuming progress toward regional measles elimination goals requires sustained investments, including strengthening health systems and implementing the recommended strategies in the Philippines.

"What is added by this report? WHO-UNICEF-estimated coverage with the routine 1st dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) increased from 80 percent in 1998 to 90 percent in 2013. The estimated coverage with the routine 2nd dose (MCV2) increased from 10 percent after introduction in 2010 to 53 percent in 2013. After nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 1998 and 2004, historic lows in numbers and incidence of reported measles cases occurred in 2006. Despite nationwide SIAs in 2007 and 2011, reported cases and incidence generally increased during 2007-2012. During 2013-2014, nationwide measles resurgence occurred, including cases among older children and young adults, because of persistent MCV1 coverage less than 95 percent, low MCV2 coverage, and suboptimal MCV coverage in several regions of the country by SIAs conducted during 1998-2011." - Mod.CP]
