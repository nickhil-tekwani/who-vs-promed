A suspected case of monkeypox disease has been discovered in Edo State.

The patient is currently receiving treatment at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital.

Management of the hospital, who disclosed this on Tuesday [31 Oct 2017], said a sample had been taken for testing, and the result was being awaited from the designated World Health Organization (WHO) accredited test center.

Public Relations of the hospital, Mr. Uwaila Joshua, in a statement said the patient was responding to treatment and was undergoing further evaluation.

Mr. Uwaila said the hospital's Chief Medical Director (CMD), Prof.Darlinton Obaseki, in preparation for a possible outbreak of monkeypox virus in the state, equipped an isolated complex designed to give emergency treatment to patients affected with the disease.

According to the statement, "The good news is that the patient is recovering very fast, and we presently do not have any reason to worry.

"The UBTH, in conjunction with the relevant agencies in the state government and local government health authorities, are working together and monitoring close contacts of this person, and, so far, no one has come down with the sickness.

"There is no need or cause for concern or worry and no danger posed to staff or patients of the hospital. The patient is in an isolated complex. The hospital is ready and prepared to contain any situation if there is need to. As of now, there is no cause for alarm," it stated.

A suspected case of the dreaded disease called monkey pox has been recorded in Gboko, Benue state.

Gboko is the ancestral home of the Tiv people and located in Benue North West Senatorial Zone.

The town is known for trading heavily in bush animals like monkey, grass cutter, and antelope, which are commonly associated with monkeypox.

The Nation gathered that a 40-year-old woman was seen with the symptoms around Agedam area in Gboko on Tuesday [30 Oct 2017].

At press time, efforts were being made by her relations to convey her to the hospital for proper diagnosis.

[Both these cases are suspected, the Benue state one not even yet taken to a hospital, and the diagnosis apparently made by relatives.

A 27 Oct 2017 report indicated that as of 25 Oct 2017, there were 94 suspected cases in 11 states and the Federal Capital (see ProMED-mail post Monkeypox - Africa (14): Nigeria 20171030.5412495). The above reports add 2 more suspected cases and 2 more states to those totals. The majority of these suspected cases await laboratory confirmation or elimination as monkeypox cases. The mix of reported negative, confirmed and suspected cases raises the possibility of a mixed outbreak. Further tests of suspected cases is urgent in order to confirm or rule out monkeypox and determine the etiologies of ruled out cases.

As noted in previous posts, the main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Laboratory confirmation of the etiologies of these 74 suspected cases, either as monkeypox, chickenpox, or some other pathogen, is essential in order to understand what is going on. There may well be more than one pathogen circulating in the 11 states.
