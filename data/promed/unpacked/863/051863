England reported 94 deaths, including those of 21 children, from scarlet fever and invasive strep A infections so far this season the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday [22 Dec 2022]. The British government last week [15 Dec 2022] said it was enacting protocols to ease shortages of penicillin medicines used to treat strep A infections, allowing pharmacists to prescribe alternatives where stocks are low.

There have been 27 486 reported cases of scarlet fever from 12 Sep to 18 Dec 2022, according to the UKHSA. That compares with 3287 reported cases at the same point in the year during the last comparably high season in 2017 to 2018, although cases in that season started to rise at a different time, the agency said.

"I understand how this large rise in scarlet fever and 'strep throat' may be concerning to parents; however the condition can be easily treated with antibiotics and it is very rare that a child will go on to become more seriously ill," UKHSA's Deputy Director Dr Colin Brown said.

The National Health Service (NHS) has been under intense pressure this winter, with thousands of ambulance workers in England and Wales walking out over pay on Wednesday [21 Dec 2022], a day after nurses went on strike.

[The previous ProMED post (Streptococcus, group A update (02): fatal, invasive, children 20221223.8707413) and the news report above, both from 22 Dec 2022, report England's death toll in children from group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is 21; the total deaths in the UK is 24 in children, which includes 21 children in England, 2 children in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The news report above adds that there have been 94 total deaths in England from GAS infection, which includes the 21 deaths in children (22.3%), and 27 486 cases of scarlet fever from 12 Sep to 18 Dec 2022.

GAS commonly causes scarlet fever, pharyngitis, local suppurative extensions to involve the middle ear (otitis media) and sinuses (mastoiditis), and superficial skin infections (impetigo, cellulitis). Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing GAS and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or even the skin lesions of chicken pox. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1%.

GAS can also cause potentially fatal invasive infections (iGAS), including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur after GAS pharyngitis.

GAS pharyngitis has rarely caused bacteremia that can lead to infections at distant sites (http://www.jstor.org/pss/4456639, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812863). Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Over 200 emm types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids in documenting a common source of an outbreak.

Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive infection. Fatal iGAS infections are currently being reported in the USA, Canada, the UK and the EU in the midst of increasing cases of localized GAS infections (e.g., pharyngitis, scarlet fever).

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in schools and in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person. - Mod.ML
