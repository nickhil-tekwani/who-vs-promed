"The massive dog population in this community, on average 3 dogs per household, cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor for this outbreak," according to Dr. Estrada-Pizarro. "This may also be a factor, especially since dogs defecate in open spaces, stools get dry, and the wind may carry contaminated particles, putting them in contact with food."

Infectious canine hepatitis is (usually) caused by a canine adenovirus (CAV-1) which can infect other species but -- to my knowledge -- has never been related to human disease. Human hepatitis A, on the other hand, is not a zoonosis.

As clearly explained by the moderator (Mod.CP), its agent is a human _Picornavirus_ that spreads human-to-human via the fecal-oral route with transmission being the result of direct contact with infected individuals with poor hygiene practices, ingestion of contaminated food, or ingestion of contaminated water (more rarely via transfusions). As such, dogs can play a passive role in transmission as fomites, having contaminated their fur with human feces or through contact with contaminated water, but not via their own feces (likely to be factors in several zoonosis (i.e., enterobacteria, several parasitoses, but not hepatitis A).

Hence, the large population of dogs in this community can be more than a confounding factor in this outbreak, but not for the reasons implied in the original posting.

The last lines in the moderator's comment point toward a complete failure in the public health system.

[ProMED-mail thanks Jose Campione for emphasizing that hepatitis A virus infection is not a zoonosis and that the high density of dogs is unlikely to be the determining factor in the prevalence of hepatitis A in this community. - Mod.CP
