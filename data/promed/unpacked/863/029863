Fruit virus found outside Niagara peninsula - again
---------------------------------------------------
The plum pox potyvirus (PPV) that threatens Niagara's $40-million stone
fruit industry has been found near Port Dover, ON. This is the second
discovery of the virus outside of Niagara. It was confirmed in Vittoria,
near Port Dover, last week and in Blenheim, near Chatham, earlier this
summer.
The finding raises fears that the [disease has spread well outside the
Niagara area where it was discovered in July. Federal investigators should
know this week if [plum pox has spread [to other parts of Canada.
Investigators from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) are looking
as far back as a decade ago for the source of the devastating virus. [They
are combing nursery records in a bid to learn when, where and how the
[disease was introduced. But those efforts may be in vain. It's possible
a traveller smuggled infected stock into this country. It may never be
known who [was responsible. The most recent find in Vittoria came about
after a farmer noted pox-like markings on fruit.
Teams continue to survey every orchard in the region. When an infected
tree is found, a buffer of 20 surrounding it [is cut down, [and roots
will be pulled out [to prevent regrowth of shoots and consequent recurrence
of disease.
Blake Ferguson of CFIA said an international think-tank on the [disease
has been called by Canada for late October, after a national survey of
orchards. Scientists from North America and Europe have been invited to
discuss how best to deal with the problem. It's possible, said Ferguson,
that scientists may decide thousands of additional trees should be taken
down as a precaution.

[The attempt now in progress to determine how PPV entered Canada may yield
important information, but it is a formidable task to say the least. I
would not be surprised if a traveller from abroad brought unwittingly
brought PPV-infected budwood to Canada illegally. As I mentioned recently
in my comments on another posting on this disease, I saw a tourist at
Schiphol airport loading plant cuttings into plastic bags and stuffing them
into his pockets before departing for New York. - Mod.DH
