New system will track foodborne illnesses nationwide.
Health agencies to be linked via the Internet.
The federal government is boosting its ability to track foodborne illnesses
from coast to coast. On Friday, officials unveiled a new computer database
tracking system called PulseNet. It will eventually link agencies in all 50
states, enabling health officials to identify outbreaks five times faster
than before. The database will compare and log the DNA "fingerprints" of
pathogens from samples of tainted food and make that information available.
Officials estimate that foodborne illnesses -- like E. coli, salmonella and
others -- contribute to an estimated 9,000 deaths and 33 million illnesses
in the United States each year.
"With this efficient new computer network, we can more effectively trace
widespread foodborne disease outbreaks and warn millions of Americans to
stay away from contaminated food products," Vice President Al Gore said in
a statement released Thursday. The move is the government's latest effort
to battle foodborne pathogens. Previous efforts include issuing new
guidelines to farms and food processors on how to guard against
contamination and adopting new inspection techniques at meat and poultry
plants.
PulseNet, which replaces the FoodNet tracking system, will use the Internet
to link the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug
Administration, the Agriculture Department, four laboratories and state
health departments. Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas, Washington,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Hampshire, New York,
Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin go on-line on Friday. The
remaining states are to be linked to the system by 1999.
FoodNet was only able to link health officials in a few states, and was not
able to cope with wide-scale outbreaks, said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food
safety director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Last
year, FoodNet helped identify the E. coli strain that sickened people in
Colorado who had eaten contaminated beef from Hudson Foods Co. Officials
recalled 25 million pounds of the meat, but they were never able to track
the outbreak on a national level.
