Multiple people in Houston County [Alabama] are being treated for potential rabies exposure after a 4-month-old stray puppy was confirmed to have the deadly disease late last month [January 2019], the state Department of Public Health said Thursday [7 Feb 2019]. A number of people were exposed to the pup and have been given standard rabies prevention treatment, the agency said. The stray puppy died.

The dog was taken in by Dothan city and Houston County Animal Control -- one of a litter of 4 puppies treated and held for required observation before adoption. The puppy began showing abnormal neurological signs soon after being transferred to a local rescue group and was taken to a local veterinarian for treatment. The pup died shortly after and was confirmed to have rabies by the Alabama Department of Public Health.

"We are working with the attending veterinarians, the rescue group, and the animal control workers to determine a list of individuals who were potentially exposed to the puppy on 21 Jan 2019 or later," said Dr. Dee W. Jones, a veterinarian with the agency.

Rabies is always fatal in dogs but can be treated in humans with timely and appropriate treatment.

"This highlights the importance of identifying anyone who was in contact with this animal within the shedding period so that treatment can be performed," Jones said.

[The article mentions the puppies were being treated prior to adoption. Likely this means they are treated for fleas and internal parasites. If this is the case and they were not vaccinated against rabies, then likely they are too young for the vaccine.

However, who is examining the other puppies? The other puppies may also be infected. Are they in quarantine? What about the mother dog? Is she in quarantine with the puppies? These animals may also have rabies. Often when one animal in a litter is exposed there are others in the same litter having been exposed.

It is great to know the authorities are tracking down those having had contact with the affected puppy to get them appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). If this puppy caused a wound on the hand or any other bodily location, from a toenail or from a nip, the wound needs to be appropriately cleaned, even if it is small.

Rabies postexposure vaccinations
------------------------------------
For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.

The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

[However, there is no value in administering rabies immune globulin greater than seven days after initiating a vaccine course, since vaccine-induced antibodies begin to appear within one week. - Mod.ML
