The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC), and the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) to investigate an outbreak of _E. coli_ infections in Ontario, Quebec, and several U.S. states.

In Canada, based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to romaine lettuce has been identified as a source of the outbreak, but the cause of contamination has not been identified. Laboratory analysis indicates that the illnesses reported in this outbreak are genetically related to illnesses reported in a previous _E. coli_ outbreak from December 2017 that affected consumers in both Canada and the USA. This tells us that the same strain of _E. coli_ is causing illness in Canada and the USA as was seen in 2017, and it suggests there may be a recurring source of contamination. Investigators are using evidence collected in both outbreaks to help identify the possible cause of the contamination in these events.

The current outbreak appears to be ongoing, as illnesses linked to romaine lettuce continue to be reported. These recent illnesses indicate that contaminated romaine lettuce may still be on the market, including in restaurants, grocery stores, and any establishments that serve food. At this time, the investigation evidence in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick suggests that there is a risk of _E. coli_ infections associated with eating romaine lettuce.

As the risk is ongoing, the Public Health Agency of Canada is advising individuals in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick to avoid eating romaine lettuce and salad mixes containing romaine lettuce until more is known about the outbreak and the cause of contamination. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that residents in other parts of Canada are affected by this outbreak. The U.S. CDC has also issued communications with similar advice for U.S. individuals. The outbreak investigation is ongoing, and this public health notice will be updated as the Canadian investigation evolves.

_E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry, and other animals. A common source of _E. coli_ illness is raw fruits and vegetables that have come in contact with feces from infected animals. Leafy greens, such as lettuce, can become contaminated in the field by soil, water, animals, or improperly composted manure. Lettuce can also be contaminated by bacteria during and after harvest from handling, storing, and transporting the produce. Contamination in lettuce is also possible at the grocery store, in the refrigerator, or from counters and cutting boards through cross-contamination with harmful bacteria from raw meat, poultry, or seafood. Most _E. coli_ strains are harmless to humans, but some varieties cause illness.

In Canada, as of Wed 21 Nov 2018, there have been 19 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ illness: 3 in Ontario, 15 in Quebec, and one in New Brunswick. Individuals became sick between mid-October and early November 2018. Eight individuals have been hospitalized, and one individual suffered from hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a severe complication that can result from an _E. coli_ infection. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 5 and 93 years of age. The majority of cases (53 percent) are female.

Most of the individuals who became sick reported eating romaine lettuce before their illnesses occurred. Individuals reported eating romaine lettuce at home, as well as in prepared salads purchased at grocery stores, or from menu items ordered at restaurants and fast food chains.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is working with public health officials and the U.S. FDA to determine the source of the romaine lettuce that ill individuals were exposed to. If contaminated food products are identified in Canada, they will take the necessary steps to protect the public, including recalling the product as required. Currently, there are no food recall warnings associated with this outbreak.

It is difficult to know whether a product is contaminated with _E. coli_, because you can't see, smell, or taste it. Romaine lettuce can have a shelf life of up to 5 weeks, and therefore it is possible that contaminated romaine lettuce purchased over the past few weeks may still be in your home. Restaurant and retailers may also still be selling romaine lettuce products. Consumers are advised to use the information in this public health notice to help make informed decisions about their own personal health situations. Individuals in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick should avoid eating romaine lettuce and salad mixes containing romaine lettuce until more is known about the outbreak and the cause of contamination.

This outbreak is a reminder that romaine lettuce and other leafy greens can be a carrier of _E. coli_. It is important to always follow safe food handling practices if you are preparing, handling, and serving any type of lettuce. The following tips will help reduce your risk of an _E. coli_ infection, but they will not fully eliminate the risk of illness.

1) Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling lettuce.
2) Handle and wash unwashed lettuce, including whole heads of lettuce sold in sealed bags, using these steps:
- Discard outer leaves of fresh lettuce;
- Wash unpackaged lettuce under fresh, cool, running water. There is no need to use anything other than water to wash lettuce. Washing it gently with water is as effective as using produce cleansers;
- Keep rinsing your lettuce until all of the dirt has been washed away;
- Don't soak lettuce in a sink full of water. It can become contaminated by bacteria in the sink; and
- Store lettuce in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. Discard when leaves become wilted or brown.
3) Use warm water and soap to thoroughly wash all utensils, countertops, cutting boards, and storage containers before and after handling lettuce to avoid cross-contamination
4) Do not rewash ready-to-eat lettuce products sold in sealed packages and labelled as washed, pre-washed, or triple washed. These products should be refrigerated and used before the expiration date.

California may be the source of romaine lettuce blamed in an outbreak of _E. coli_ infections that has made 32 people sick in 11 states and Canada, the head of the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday [21 Nov 2018].

The FDA and the CDC have cautioned people not to eat romaine lettuce while they investigate the outbreak. It's very similar to an outbreak of _E. coli_ that killed one person and made at least 25 people ill last year [2017], FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said. That outbreak was traced to leafy green vegetables but not to romaine lettuce specifically.

"The strain that caused that outbreak is very similar to the one that's causing this outbreak, and the timing is exactly the same. So it's likely associated with end-of-season harvests in California, where most of the romaine that is currently on the market is from," Gottlieb told NBC News. "I think we are going to be in a position to isolate the region soon. There is some lettuce coming in from Mexico, but most of what's on the market is the result of end-of-the-season harvesting coming out of California right now."

This is the 2nd outbreak of _E. coli_ linked to romaine lettuce this year [2018]. An outbreak this past spring killed 5 people and made 210 sick in 36 states. It was eventually traced to contaminated canal water in a farming area in Yuma, Arizona. Until a specific farm or region can be identified, CDC and FDA say it's safest just to tell people not to eat romaine lettuce and to tell restaurants and stores to throw it out. Other leafy greens appear to be safe.

Although this is the 2nd romaine-linked outbreak this year, it is not clear whether romaine lettuce itself is more likely to be contaminated than other vegetables, said Dr. Laura Gieraltowski, leader of the foodborne outbreak response team at the CDC. "It's something we've been asking," she said. "It could have to do with the way the lettuce is shaped. (A head of) romaine lettuce is kind of open, and maybe contaminated water can get into it more than into a head of iceberg lettuce or cabbage that is in a ball."

And like many other foods, romaine is often processed and repackaged before it ships out to grocery stores and restaurants.

"Is romaine somehow riskier? We don't think so," Gottlieb said. "We think it is probably related more to the way that it is packaged." So pieces of a single contaminated head of romaine could be chopped up and spread through a number of packages.

What is known is where _E. coli_ comes from. Like so many other bacteria that contaminate food, it comes from fecal matter. Wild animals may roam through fields, or irrigation water might flow from nearby pastures or feedlots where livestock is raised. Contamination can be further spread when produce is harvested and passes through machinery to clean, trim, chop, and package it.

Tracking down the source is time consuming, which is why the FDA has not announced a mandatory recall yet, Gottlieb said. But he said some growers and distributors were planning to voluntarily recall their romaine products later Wednesday [21 Nov 2018]. While it may seem that there have been more food recalls lately, both the FDA and CDC say that's not because more food is being contaminated. "The food supply in the USA is one of the safest in the world," Gieraltowski said.

Rather, FDA and CDC are better at finding ways to link the 48 million cases of food poisoning that occur each year. "It's not that there are more outbreaks. It's that we are identifying more outbreaks," Gottlieb said. "A lot of what we identify now would have been random people showing up at their doctor's office with gastrointestinal illness that we would never have associated with a common etiology (cause)," Gottlieb added. "But now that we're taking samples and looking at bacteria..., we are seeing that it's the same bug, and that clues in researchers at the CDC that there's one common element, that there's one genetic fingerprinting, that it's coming from the same source. We are seeing that it's the same bug."

The next step is speeding up the slow process of tracking the sources of the outbreaks using better technology to keep tabs on food as it moves from farms to distributors and to stores, Gottlieb said.

Contaminated food is an extremely common problem. The CDC estimates that germs in food make 48 million Americans sick every year: that's one out of 6 people. About 128 000 are made sick enough to be hospitalized, and 3000 die.
