23 more outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported in Nigeria.

Of the 4 outbreaks reported on 4 Feb 2016, 2 were in Kano and 2 were in Plateau province. Of the 19 reported on 8 Feb 2016, 8 were in Kano, 2 were in Jigawa, 3 were in Federal Capital Territory, 2 were in Adamawa, 2 were in Kaduna, one was in Plateau and one was in Ebonyi.

The outbreaks, of the H5N1 strain affected both backyard holdings and commercial farms and both broilers and layers of all ages. Poor farm biosecurity was once again implicated in the spread of disease.
