[This report confirms earlier information that the virus is not the same
one involved in the 1997 outbreak of Avian Influenza which killed 6
people. That is good news. Unfortunately, a quick scan of our archives
reveals that almost every year, Hong Kong confronts an AI outbreak in birds
and the costs involved in control measures. One wonders how the industry
can manage economically. - Mod PC]
