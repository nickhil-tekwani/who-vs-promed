Hepatitis C in the UK, 2012 report
----------------------------------
The current and future burden of hepatitis C-related infections in the UK, and progress in tackling the infection, are described in Hepatitis C in the UK: 2012 report, published on the HPA website [1,2] to coincide with the World Health Organisation's World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012 [3].

The most recent national estimates suggest that around 216 000 individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C in the UK; an estimated 160 000 of these are adults living in England according to the report. The new annual report is the 4th for the UK as a whole (the 7th for England). The main chapters describe, in turn, the scale of the UK problem; prevention; diagnosis, testing and awareness of infection; and treatment and care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Consolidated data for the UK as a whole are also presented as well as testing and diagnosis data related to particular groups (people who inject drugs, prison populations, black and minority ethnic populations and blood donors).

Data are presented to show how action plans and work programmes have driven improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C across the UK. However, they also show that morbidity and mortality from hepatitis C-related liver disease are still increasing. In particular, hospital admissions for HCV-related end stage liver disease and liver cancer, transplants and deaths continue to rise. By 2020, the report estimates that approximately 16 000 people will be living with either HCV-related cirrhosis or liver cancer in England if they are left untreated.

As in previous HPA reports on HCV, the high prevalence of infection in particular groups is shown to be a key characteristic of the disease in the UK: injecting drug users (IDUs) are at greatest risk of acquiring infection and some minority ethnic populations also have higher rates of infection than the white, UK-born population.

[Other comments in the full report are the following. "Injecting drugs with unsterile injecting equipment, particularly needles and syringes, can put people at risk of infection, even if they injected only once or twice in the past. Others at risk of hepatitis C include those who have received blood transfusions before September 1991 or blood products before 1986 in the UK. People who originate from countries where hepatitis C is endemic, such as South Asia, are also at risk -- often following medical or dental treatment with unsterile equipment."

"New drugs are now available that can help clear the most difficult to treat strain of the virus in most people. Between 2006 and 2011, an estimated 27 500 people with chronic hepatitis C in England have been treated with NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] recommended combination therapy, but more people need to access this treatment if the future burden of hepatitis C infection is to be averted."

"It's important that hepatitis C provision continues to be a priority for the NHS [National Health Service], particularly for those marginalised groups of society who are most affected by the epidemic. We also believe it's vital that local commissioners continue to work together to ensure that all affected individuals are able to access prevention and health care services." - Mod.CP
