First Report of Spread of West Nile Virus into Pennsylvania
-----------------------------------------------------------
HARRISBURG: On 26 Sep 2000, Secretary of Health Robert S. Zimmerman Jr.
confirmed that West Nile virus infection has been found in 2 crows in
southeastern Pennsylvania. Previously, all tests for West Nile virus in
Pennsylvania had been negative.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, Wis., today verified the presence of West Nile virus in 2 dead
crows; one from Levittown, Bucks County, collected 8 Sep 2000, and the
second from Treddfyrin, Chester County, collected 13 Sep 2000. The
Department of Health uses the USGS Health Center as a backup laboratory for
testing.
"No people have tested positive for West Nile virus in Pennsylvania, nor any
mosquitoes," Zimmerman said. Zimmerman encouraged Pennsylvanians to
continue to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes by eliminating
standing water. Zimmerman also reminded Pennsylvanians to call
1-877-PA-HEALTH if they come cross dead birds - especially crows.
This is the first time West Nile virus has been found in Pennsylvania since
the disease was first recognized in the United States during a 1999 outbreak
in the New York City area. Bucks and Chester counties have been in enhanced
surveillance for West Nile virus since Pennsylvania began its
mosquito-surveillance efforts on 3 Apr 2000. On 1 Jun 2000, the Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP) awarded Bucks County $226 619 and Chester
County $170 854 for mosquito surveillance and larvae control. The 2000-01
state budget includes $9.8 million to prevent and lessen the potential
public-health effects of West Nile virus on Pennsylvanians. The funds
provide necessary staffing and an improved epidemiological infrastructure
for detecting the virus.
For more information on West Nile virus or how to handle dead birds found in
the community, visit the Pennsylvania website at <http://www.state.pa.us>,
or directly at <http://www.WestNile.state.pa.us>. Alternatively, call the
Department of Health's information line at 1-877-PA-HEALTH.
