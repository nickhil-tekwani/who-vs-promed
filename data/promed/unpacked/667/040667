Summary of outbreaks
New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Tully, Corcreaghy, Dundalk, County Louth, Louth
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Mar 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (25 Jun 2015)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 289 / 1 / 0 / 1 / -
Affected population: dairy herd of rotbunt cattle.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [9 Jun 2015], the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was advised of a positive result to a rapid screening test (Idexx EIA [enzyme immunoassay]) carried out by an accredited private laboratory approved by the competent authority. The suspect animal was sampled by DAFM staff at a knackery as part of the on-going official sampling of all fallen (died on farm) animals of 48 months and older.

The sample material and the brain were subsequently forwarded to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) where samples from different brain areas were subject to confirmatory testing using an OIE-approved confirmatory Western blot method (Biorad TeSeE). In addition, the samples were subject to a 2-blot protocol for the classification of BSE isolates. All the samples had an identical molecular pattern indicating classical BSE.

In accordance with NRL protocols, samples from the animal were then sent for histopathology and immunohistochemistry on the medulla of the brain. These are further OIE confirmatory testing methods for BSE. In addition, samples were also forwarded to the European Union Reference Laboratory in Weybridge, United Kingdom.

Final confirmatory test results were received from both laboratories on 25 Jun 2015 confirming the case to be classical BSE. The animal was a rotbunt female, born on 14 Jan 2010, and it was 65 months old at the time of its death. The animal was born, reared and spent its entire life on the same farm. The farmer reported that the animal had fallen on 24 Feb 2015 but had recovered. The animal fell once again on 6 Jun 2015. The animal did not recover and the farmer took the decision to have the animal euthanized. Approximately 6 weeks prior to death the farmer had noted that the animal had lost body condition, milk yield reduced, and the animal displayed some neurological signs such as nervousness and hyperexcitability.

Both the dam and grand-dam of the infected animal were tested for BSE when they were slaughtered as healthy animals in 2006 and in 2013. Both animals tested negative for BSE. The identification of the 'cohort' group took into account animals born in the herd in the same year (2010) as the case, in the previous year (2009) and the following year (2011). The objective was to identify those animals which might have consumed the same feed as the case animal. 63 animals were still alive. With regard to the progeny of the cow, all 4 animals were identified. All progeny and cohort animals that had been identified, traced, and restricted were removed and slaughtered on 22 Jun 2015. Samples from all these animals were subjected to testing for BSE. Results from these tests were delivered on 23 Jun 2015 -- all 67 animals tested negative.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[In May 2015, during the 83rd General Session, the World Assembly of Delegates of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recognized Ireland as a country having negligible risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This recognition was based on the fact that Ireland met all the conditions stipulated in the OIE Code Chapter 11.4; see chapter at, http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bse.htm.

Among the recommendations set forth in the Code Chapter, Member countries may be considered as having negligible risk for BSE if they meet a number of health conditions, one of which is that if a country has had an indigenous case, that affected animal must have been born more than 11 years before it was diagnosed. Given that this cow was only 65 months old, and that this is a case of classical BSE, the OIE will likely need to revoke Ireland's recently granted recognition as a country having negligible risk for BSE.

The complete list of BSE Risk Status of Member Countries can be found at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/. - Mod.CRD
