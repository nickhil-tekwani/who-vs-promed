Bird flu has resurfaced in the country on the northeastern border of
Quang Ninh Province's Yen Hung District and infected more than 500 poultry.

An additional 1300 birds have been killed and disposed of to prevent
the spread of the disease in accordance with the regulations on
epidemic disease prevention, said Hoang Van Nam, head of the
Veterinary Department.

Deputy minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Diep Kinh Tan
said the reason for the problem was the lack of disease prevention
measures taken by some localities.

Tan directed the Veterinary Department to thoroughly handle the
disease in Quang Ninh and to soon build a centre for quarantining
poultry and cattle [see comment]. He also asked localities nationwide
to concentrate on vaccinating duck flocks, as they were highly
susceptible to the spread of the flu.

[Quang Ninh province is in the eastern centre of Viet Nam's Northern
area (upper map at <http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>).
The province discovered an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry earlier this
year in February 2009 (see 20090219.0701) as well as a human case in
a 23-year-old male (see 20090207.0557).

Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Viet Nam in
December 2006, 225 outbreaks in poultry (mainly chickens and ducks)
have been reported in 31 follow-up reports submitted to the OIE, of
which there were 8 during 2009, the most recent on 21 May 2009. For
their URLs and an accumulating map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4158>.

Since 2003, 111 human cases of HPAI H5N1 have been confirmed in Viet
Nam, of which 56 died. The most recent fatal case was reported at the
end of April 2009.

The cited recommendation of the authorities "to soon build a centre
for quarantining poultry and cattle" may confuse readers. Cattle are
not involved in avian influenza, and infected or suspected poultry
are not required to be moved to quarantine "centres". One could guess
that this recommendation applies to measures concerning imported
animals; a clarification will help.

Details on Viet Nam's AI prevention and control policy, including its
remarkable vaccination strategy and updates of surveillance
activities, are available at
