A 9 year old boy has been isolated at Kiwoko Hospital in Nakaseke [district, Central Uganda] for suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, CCHF. The boy from Kasiiso trading centre in Luwero district was admitted at Kiwoko Hospital [Nakaseke district] on [22 Dec 2017] after a referral from Bamugoledde Health Center III with signs related to the highly contagious CCHF.

According to case Investigation Form by Kiwoko Hospital dated [23 Dec 2017], the boy had high fever, vomiting, general weakness, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, bloody stool and headache among others. It is reported that after the boy's situation deteriorated blood samples were picked and transferred to Uganda Virus Research Institute for tests.

According to an internal memo the results, which were returned on [30 Dec 2017], revealed that the boy tested positive to the haemorrhagic fever and was thereafter isolated. Geoffrey Mulangira, the hospital administrator, confirmed the isolation of the patient and said they will address the press after they have concluded the investigations.

The father of the boy told URN that they were told that the boy contracted Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever but the case is being handled by the hospital. He added that he couldn't explain how the boy contracted the disease.

Ignatius Koomu Kiwanuka, the Nakaseke district LC 5 chairman confirmed the case and said they have embarked on sensitization of the communities to control the spread of the disease. When contacted, Vivian Sserwanja, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, said she [was] not aware of the case and promised to return the call when she [received] details.

In August 2017, an outbreak of CCHF was reported in Nakaseke and 21 probable patients were identified. Of these, 8 died and were buried by health workers under protective gear. Professor Anthony K Mbonye, acting director general of health services, issued a statement putting districts on alert and explained that the virus was transmitted to humans through bites of infected ticks, contact with infected animal blood and tissue, and through body contact with infected persons.

According to the World Health Organization CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorraghic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent.

[Records indicate that, since 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000; Bundibugyo, 2007; Luwero, 2011; Kibaale in July 2012; and Luwero in November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007. More recently, in 2012, 2 outbreaks of Marburg VHF were reported in Ibanda and Kabale districts.

Nakaseke and Kiboga districts in central Uganda reported a CCHF outbreak, including 8 deaths in August 2017 (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (02) 20170906.5299656.

According to the report above the source of exposure to the virus has not been identified in this case, which merits an early epidemiological investigation to prevent occurrence of an outbreak.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. - Mod.UBA
