Diarrhea kills dozens of monkeys in Shimla
-----------------------------------------------
Civic officials in the capital of Himachal Pradesh are struggling to
control a severe intestinal disease that has killed at least 30 monkeys.
Hundreds of other monkeys in the town, which is home to about 2000 simians,
are suffering from a severe form of gastroenteritis.
While civic authorities put the death toll at over 30, local newspapers
said it could be twice as high with 70 dead in the last 3 weeks. The
animals have been rapidly losing weight, bleeding from the mouth, and
passing bloody stools.
"The Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) has diagnosed the disease
as a severe form of gastroenteritis, which has taken the form of an
epidemic," said Arun Sirkeck, a top veterinary doctor treating wild animals
in Shimla. "In the last 3 days, we have treated about 250 monkeys with
antibiotics added to honey-smeared bread, and also to water. The drug
(tetracycline) is mixed in the water and food," Sirkeck told IANS Fri 11
Jun 2004.
The illness is being described as the most severe to hit monkeys in
decades. Several troupes of monkeys live in this picturesque wooded
Himalayan town. Most of the infected are those living at the Jakhu hill,
where there is a temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman. Hordes
of tourists visit the temple and feed the monkeys with grams and sweets
(also with junk food of late) as a ritual.

[More details on the laboratory investigation, allegedly carried out by
IVRI, may help in understanding the etiology and epidemiology of this, so
far obscure, "severe form of gastroenteritis" in simians. Such an
investigation should rule out possible hemorrhagic disease.
