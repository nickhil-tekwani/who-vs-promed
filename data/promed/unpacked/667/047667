Epidemics from Montenegro spreading in Serbia
---------------------------------------------
Mysterious, dangerous and very infectious disease called by many a "stomach
flu" has affected not only Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, but that
country's sea coast as well. It even spread into the cities in Serbia.

Death of a 26 year old woman in Kotor is believed to be caused by that
disease. As 'Blic' learns dozens of tourists from Serbia upon return from
holiday in Montenegro to their native cities complained of the same
symptoms: high temperature, throwing up, and diarrhea.

While doctors are trying to determine the cause of the woman's death, the
authorities deny any epidemic in spite of almost a thousand of registered
cases in Podgorica with the symptoms of this mysterious disease. One
official of Montenegro Ministry of Health said that the ministry would
issue a press release over the woman's death soon.

This has not been the 1st [fatal] case of this kind this year [2008]. At
the beginning of August an 18 year old woman from Macedonia died after
returning from a holiday in Montenegro.

A mysterious, contagious and very dangerous disease that has been rampant
in Montenegro and whose symptoms are high fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea
has spread to Serbia after dozens of tourists visiting Montenegro returned
home, Serbia's Blic reported.

While Montenegrin doctors are still looking for the cause of death of a
26-year-old woman, it is presumed that she died of the disease that many
call "stomach flu."

Montenegrin Health Ministry spokeswoman Lorena Vlahovic said the autopsy
would reveal the woman's cause of death. We don't know the cause of the
epidemic of the "stomach virus," but it is proven that the water in
Podgorica is good for drinking, she said. She added the ministry could not
say if there is an epidemic on the coast as well.

The woman's funeral was on Wednesday [27 Aug 2008]. She left behind her her
husband and a 7-month-old daughter. She began vomiting on 24 Aug 2008, and
she had diarrhoea and nausea. At the clinic in Kotor [Montenegro] they gave
her an IV and said not to worry, that she was the 50th case that day with
the same symptoms. But she was not getting better. Both her hands started
feeling numb. They gave her calcium in the clinic, but other body parts
began to go numb as well. She died on the way to the Kotor hospital her
husband said.

[This outbreak has all the characteristics of an epidemic of
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis. But a fatal outcome would be
exceptional. Further information is awaited regarding the cause of death of
the 26 year old woman in Montenegro, and also of the 18 year old woman who
died in Macedonia after a holiday in Montenegro.
