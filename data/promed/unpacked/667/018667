A case of malaria disease has been confirmed in Albania, Macedonian
Dnevnik Daily reports, citing Mr. Plumb Pipero with the ministry of healthcare.

A 17-year-old girl who returned from Greece 3 months ago shows
symptoms of malaria and has been put under quarantine. Blood samples
have been sent for expert lab tests.

The Zalher village, where the young girl lives, has been disinfected.
Medical authorities are making tests and studies on whether the girl
has been bitten by a mosquito in Greece or Albania.

[The information given here is very sparse, and we do not even know
which species of malaria the girl was infected with, or whether the
confirmatory tests were positive.

In 1938, malaria was a hyper-endemic disease in Albania, exhibiting a
spleen and parasite rate of 60 percent. In 1946, the insecticide DDT
was introduced, and malaria was eradicated in Albania in 1967.

Malaria was eradicated in Greece in the beginning of the 1970s, and
since then, only sporadic autochthonous malaria cases have been
recorded (3 cases in 1991, one case in 1999 and 2 cases in 2000).
