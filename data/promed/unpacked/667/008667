An outbreak of measles originating in Solihull has spread to other areas of the West Midlands prompting an urgent vaccination appeal.

Public Health England (PHE) has issued a warning to parents of children under 5 years old who have missed their measles vaccinations.

Health experts are working with local councils and NHS partners to make sure anyone who needs a vaccination is aware of their importance.

Families will receive a reminder letter from NHS [National Health Service] England (West Midlands) and PHE West Midlands this week [week of Sun 29 Apr 2018] , asking them to arrange immunisation at their GP surgery.

At the same time, PHE has written to all West Midlands GPs asking them to be on the alert for the symptoms of measles and to take the opportunity to immunise children and adults who may not have received 2 doses of the MMR (measles) vaccine.

The call comes as the outbreak, which originally focused in Birmingham and Solihull, has now become a West Midlands wide community issue with over 100 cases.

Dr Bharat Sibal, PHE West Midlands lead consultant in communicable disease control, said: "Those affected are all recovering, but it's important to understand measles can be a very serious illness and lead to severe complications, especially in people who are particularly vulnerable or have other health conditions.

"The current outbreak in the West Midlands has seen 51 per cent of cases admitted to hospital. ...

"The ages of people affected ranges from 3 months -- 50 years, however the average age is 5 years - which is why it's particularly important for parents to have their children vaccinated when offered. ...-more

Ukraine restores immunization coverage in momentous effort to stop measles outbreak that has affected more than 12 000 this year WHO Regional Office for Europe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over 12 000 people have been infected with measles in Ukraine so far this year [2018]. Of those affected, 9158 have required hospitalization and 9 have died, according to information provided by national health authorities as of [Fri 27 Apr 2018]. Large-scale outbreak response measures have been undertaken since the start of the outbreak in 2017 to curb further spread of the disease and restore high routine immunization coverage.

"Ukrainian health authorities, with WHO and UNICEF support, have recovered huge ground in the fight against measles. But there are still many vulnerable children and adults in the country; and this highly infectious disease continues to find them," says Marthe Everard, WHO Representative in Ukraine. "More needs to be done to ensure that everyone is protected."

Dramatic drop in immunization coverage.
---------------------------------------
In 2008, 95 percent of eligible children in Ukraine received their 2nd (and final) recommended dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) on time according to the national routine schedule. By 2016, this rate had fallen to 31 percent, the lowest coverage in the WHO European Region and among the lowest in the world. In addition, in 2016 only 19 percent of children received the 3rd recommended vaccine dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and 56 percent of children received the 3rd recommended dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV).

This tragic nationwide drop in immunization coverage left an increasing number of children in Ukraine susceptible to dangerous, preventable diseases. Among these dangers, it created the ideal setting for the extensive spread of measles, one of the most infectious diseases affecting humans.

Large-scale outbreak response
-----------------------------
Since July 2017, a national Measles Task Force, including the Ministry of Health, key stakeholders and partners such as WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), has been working to:
- vaccinate every eligible child as they reach the appropriate age for MMR vaccination according to the national routine immunization schedule;
- vaccinate every child who missed routine immunization in the past;
- train laboratory staff to ensure early detection of all measles (and rubella) cases;
- inform health-care professionals and parents about the disease and the importance of ensuring that children and their families are fully protected;
- ensure the availability of vaccines at all vaccination points.

During European Immunization Week [Mon 23-Sun 29 Apr 2018] stakeholders were sensitized to the importance of immunization. Kicking off with a press conference on [Mon 23 Apr 2018], events involving the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International and national Rotary clubs, a parents group (Parents for Immunization), bloggers and even participants dressed as super heroes, included a national conferences with opinion leaders, a flash mob at schools in Kyiv, a webinar on vaccination and a roundtable discussion with paediatricians.

Routine immunization coverage back on track and pool of vulnerable people shrinking.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the end of 2017, routine vaccination coverage had drastically improved compared to previous years: 93percent of 1-year-olds received the 1st dose of MMR on time in 2017 and 91 percent of 6-year-olds received their 2nd dose as recommended. Figures for January and February 2018 indicate that the country is on track to reach at least 95 percent routine coverage with both doses of MMR vaccine by the end of the year.

If Ukraine can reach and sustain this target, it will prevent the renewed accumulation of susceptible individuals and ultimately protect the population from future outbreaks of measles.

To stop further spread of the disease, those who missed vaccinations in the past also need to be protected. Since September 2017, over 621 000 un - or undervaccinated children have been identified, and over 80 percent of them have received their 1st and/or 2nd MMR dose.

Alarming increase in measles in the WHO European Region
-------------------------------------------------------
For the Region as a whole, more measles cases have been reported for the 1st 2 months of 2018 than for the same period in the previous 5 years. Ukraine is facing the largest outbreak in the Region, but high case numbers (100 or more per month) are also being reported by France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Romania, the Russian Federation and Serbia.

A 6th case of measles was confirmed in Santa Clara County, officials said, weeks after 5 people in the county and 2 others contracted the disease from exposure to a single infected person.

The most recent patient is unconnected to the earlier breakouts, officials said.

The latest incident involved a patient who had recently traveled internationally, Santa Clara County public health department spokeswoman Britt Ehrhardt said. Citing privacy laws, officials did not say whether the patient had been vaccinated.

The 1st case in the original outbreak was confirmed by county officials on [Wed 7 Mar 2018]. Four more were confirmed in Santa Clara County by [Thu 5 Apr 2018], officials said, in addition to another patient in Alameda County and a linked case in Nevada.

All of the original 7 patients were linked to a single unvaccinated traveler who had been exposed to the disease in Europe and returned to the Bay Area, officials said. The patients in the breakout were unvaccinated.

Officials said no public health preventative measures were required in response to the newest reported patient, but advised people to get vaccinated for measles if they had not been already.

Prior to this year's outbreak, measles was last reported in Santa Clara County in January 2017.

State health officials say 2 people in the greater New York City area have developed measles after they were exposed to 2 European tourists with measles at 3 Jehovah's Witness facilities last month [April 2018].

The 2 new cases of measles in Putnam County potentially put others at risk of developing measles, the state health department says. The risk is low, however, for people who have been vaccinated or are immune.

A 3rd person also developed measles from exposure to the tourists, but that person is a Connecticut resident and hasn't exposed it to anyone in New York, officials said. ...

[See URL for locations and times of possible exposure to infected individuals.]

This most recent incident marks the 4th month in a row that European tourists with confirmed cases of measles have traveled through the tri-state area. Officials previously warned of one incident in Manhattan and 2 at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The Department of Health and Human Services is alerting passengers from an international flight from Singapore to Melbourne to the signs and symptoms of measles, following a confirmed diagnosis last week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2018] of a case from the flight.

Qantas QF 36 from Singapore arrived at Tullamarine on [Mon 16 Apr 2018] at 6.40am. An adult man became ill after the flight, but may have been infectious during the flight and while travelling earlier in Thailand.

Before his diagnosis for measles was made, he had attended a number of public places.

"We are working with airline officials to identify and contact passengers who shared the international flight into Melbourne," Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton said.

"Unfortunately the notification was made late to the department, so it's only now that passengers are being warned and some may already be showing early symptoms.

"It's critical that diagnosing doctors and laboratories notify the department as soon as they're aware of cases to enable immediate follow-up. ...-more

A nongovernment organization providing medical care to poor communities warned on [Wed 2 May 2018] that Manila was facing a measles outbreak, partly because of a vaccination scare caused by the Dengvaxia fiasco. In a forum, Likhaan executive director Dr. Junice Melgar said his group had received reports that at least 2 children from Barangay 105 in Tondo died due to measles. Another case was being verified to determine if the patient died of diphtheria or pertussis. These diseases, Melgar stressed, could have been prevented had the children been vaccinated. She said Manila officials seem to have underestimated the problem, noting the lack of vaccines and medical personnel in the city. It also didn't help that the Manila city government had remained silent about the matter, she added.

Dr. Salvacion Gatchalian of the Philippine Pediatric Society said parents should not be afraid to have their children vaccinated especially since yearly, vaccines prevent 3M deaths.

[It is unfortunate that people are extrapolating from a new vaccine that encountered problems with safety (Denvaxia) to a completely different virus infection with a well-tested vaccine that has been in use since 1963 (MMR). The CDC reported that before the measles vaccination program started approximately 55 years ago, an estimated 3 -- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; of these, 400 -- 500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era.] - Mod.LK
