Venezuela: jungle yellow fever in the state of Monagas
-----------------------------------------------
On Thu 5 Oct 2004, the Ministry of Health and Social Development
(MSDS) of Venezuela reported 3 new cases of Jungle Yellow Fever to
PAHO, with 2 deaths. These were confirmed in the laboratory by
isolating yellow fever virus from one febrile case. All 3 cases were
identified between Epidemiological Weeks (EWs) 30 and 34, in the
northeastern State of Monagas, in the municipalities of Bolivar (with
2 cases) and Maturin (with one case). This region is predominantly
wooded and also includes some cocoa plantations.
For this year [2004], the total number of reported cases in
Venezuela, so far, is 5, with the 3 cases in Monagas added to the 2
cases previously reported in the State of Merida. The MSDS
immediately intensified vaccination efforts in this area, which was
already being vaccinated due to epizootics having been identified
over the past few weeks [the latter weeks of September 2004 through
the 1st 2 weeks of October 2004]. For the period between 1998 and
2004, vaccine coverage for Bolivar was 65 percent and for Maturin was
50.3 percent.
Between 2002 and 2004, Venezuela has vaccinated approximately 1.9
million people in areas considered to be enzootic. The country's goal
for 2006 is to have 7 million people residing in high-risk cities and
towns vaccinated.

[For this year [2004], the total number of reported cases in
Venezuela, so far, is 5, with the 3 cases in Monagas added to the 2
cases previously reported in the State of Merida. But, we have
already reported 5 confirmed plus one suspected case in Tachira
province. (See: Yellow fever - Venezuela (Tachira) 20040905.2485).
Corposalud (the National Health Corporation) in Tachira, Venezuela,
which is a border province with Colombia, has registered 5 cases of
yellow fever, 3 of them fatal, in 2004. Another suspected fatal case
is awaiting laboratory confirmation, and, later in the same post,
PAHO reported 23 confirmed cases in Venezuela. Ministry of Health
statistics show 23 cases, including 15 deaths. (Another report gives
21 cases with 15 deaths). PAHO notes that 8 of the 23 cases were
infected in Colombia but fell ill in Venezuela (presumably referring
to the country office of PAHO in Caracas). - Mod.JW]
[Yellow fever in Araguato monkeys was reported from this region
earlier this year (Feb - May 2004; see report ProMED-mail report
20040618.1628) and a vaccination campaign was conducted to counter
the threat of epizootic spread at that time. - Mod.LM]
