More intensive sampling would be done this week to assess the extent of the
bonamia outbreak in Foveaux Strait oyster beds.
Ministry of Fisheries policy analyst Allen Frazer said the National
Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) would test other areas
in the fishery so the level of infection could be mapped. "Although at this
stage there is no indication it has spread," he said.
After the results were known, the Bluff Oyster Management Company and Niwa
would know what further action was required.
The industry had the benefit of hindsight this time, Mr Frazer said. "We
didn't even know bonamia existed as a disease in the late 1980s. "We are
much better prepared this time around. While the disease was deadly in
oysters, it had no effect on humans," Mr. Frazer said.
The Bluff Oyster Management Company on Monday asked fishermen to stay away
from the affected part of the oyster beds. Meanwhile, the bonamia outbreak
was not harming Bluff oyster sales in Invercargill yesterday.
Barnes Oysters Ltd manager Graeme Wright said the start of the "oyster
season frenzy" was continuing, with good sales of the southern delicacy.
"It's just business as normal."
Superior Oysters owner-manager Brent Fairweather said he was not panicking
about the bonamia resurgence and nor should oyster consumers.
There had been no decrease in the oyster sales at his retail business, The
Cod Pot, yesterday.

[The disease is due to a microsporidian and has commonly been observed in
oysters in France, certain Southeast Asia countries and in the New England
area of the US. It affects the Atlantic Oyster (_Crassostrea americanus_),
but doesn't appear to affect the Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_). In
some years, it has devastated the New England oyster fisheries. I'm not
aware of its causing devastation in the Gulf of Mexico, but not sure why
unless there is a temperature relationship. I would like to express my
grateful appreciation to Dr. Don Lewis for providing information regarding
this disease. - Mod.TG]
