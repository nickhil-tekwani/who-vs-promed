Cattle with lumpy skin disease [LSD] have been slaughtered in eastern Mongolia, Mongolia's Food and Agriculture Minister Zagdjav Mendsaikhan said on Tuesday [16 Nov 2021].

The disease, characterized by fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes and multiple nodules on the skin and mucous membranes, has spread to 3 eastern provinces of the country.

"So far, a total of 1734 cows and bulls infected with the disease have been slaughtered," Mendsaikhan said in a statement.

"We have been using sheep pox virus vaccines for cattle against the viral disease," he said, adding that the vaccination has been highly effective [see comment].

The disease has never occurred in Mongolia before, according to the General Authority for Veterinary Services.

The livestock sector is a main pillar of the Mongolian economy, with around 70 million head of livestock in the country.

The country will not export meat until the end of this year [2021] due to infectious animal diseases, the minister said in October [2021].

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD), an OIE-listed viral disease of cattle, is caused by a capripoxvirus (e.g. sheep and goat pox viruses). It is characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, and it may lead to severe losses, especially in naive animals. The principal method of transmission is thought to be mechanical by various arthropod vectors.

Originally affecting cattle across Africa with sporadic introductions into neighboring Middle-Eastern countries, the disease has spread, since 2013, outside the continent with epizootics in Balkan countries, western and central Asia and the Russian federation. In August 2019, LSD was reported for the 1st time in China; since then, it has spread to other territories in East, South and South-East Asia, including Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Viet Nam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Mongolia (in order of reporting).

Capripoxviruses are cross-reactive within the genus. Consequently, it is possible to protect cattle against LSD using live-attenuated strains of capripoxvirus derived from sheep or goats. Such is, as reported above, the case in Mongolia. However, it is recommended to carry out controlled trials, using the most susceptible breeds, prior to introducing a vaccine strain not usually used in cattle. Further information on the disease, its diagnosis and vaccines, is available in OIE's Manual, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf.

Once the disease has got a foothold in a country, the most effective way to control it is by mass vaccination of cattle. An EU scientific assessment of LSD preventive vaccination policy as compared to total or partial stamping-out policies, is available in EFSA Journal 2016;14(8):4573, 27 pp. doi:10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4573.

For a recent evaluation of 5 commercially available LSD vaccines, please refer to Ref 1.

LSD is not zoonotic.
