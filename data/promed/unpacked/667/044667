The pandemic-related disruptions, diversion of resources from routine immunization, and the relaxation of movement restrictions are some of the factors that have been attributed to the increase in measles cases globally.

In India, measles cases more than doubled in the 1st 2 months of 2022 compared to the previous year. A similar pattern was observed globally, as measles cases increased by 79% in the same period. The WHO labelled this development as a "worrying sign of a heightened risk for the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases." The global body cited pandemic-related disruptions and diversion of resources from routine immunisation as the major reasons for the rise. For instance, in India, the 1st dose coverage of the measles vaccine dropped to 88% in 2020 from 100% in 2018. The relaxation of movement restrictions is another factor that heightens the risk of larger outbreaks. Google mobility data show that in India, visits to parks have increased more than 80% in May 2022 compared to the pre-pandemic levels.

[2] Zimbabwe (Mutasa district, Manicaland province): fatal, vaccination
Date: Thu 12 May 2022

Measles kills 14 in Zimbabwe as 17 500 cases recorded in Africa this year [2022]
- 72 cases of measles were reported in an outbreak that has killed 14 children in Zimbabwe.
- Between January and March 2022, the WHO recorded about 17 500 cases in Africa.
- The WHO conducts routine vaccination campaigns to counter vaccine-preventable diseases.

A measles outbreak in Zimbabwe has resulted in the deaths of 14 children in Manicaland, at a time when about 17 500 cases have been confirmed in Africa so far this year [2022].

In a statement, Zimbabwe's health ministry said 72 cases had been recorded. "To date, a total of 72 cases and 14 deaths have been reported. Of the reported cases, only 9 had been vaccinated, while the remainder had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown," said the ministry.

With a low vaccination rate and, in some cases, no record keeping, the government has since resolved to start a mass vaccination campaign in areas where the outbreak was recorded.

"To control this outbreak, the ministry has started a mass vaccination campaign in Mutasa District, Manicaland Province, targeting the 6 months-15 years [age group], regardless of their vaccination status," the ministry said.

The new cases recorded in Zimbabwe, with a mortality rate of 19.4%, are a shock to the country's shambolic health sector -- and the government has since called on the World Health Organisation (WHO) for assistance.

In Zimbabwe, measles, along with poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, and tuberculosis, are called the "6 child killer diseases."

Fighting measles in Africa
--------------------------
"Almost 17 500 cases of measles were recorded in the African region between January and March 2022, marking a 400% increase compared with the same period in 2021. 20 African countries reported measles outbreaks in the 1st quarter of this year [2022], 8 more than in the 1st 3 months of 2021," the WHO said.

The sudden rise in measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is largely blamed on disruptions by COVID-19, which resulted in huge strains on health system capacities in many African countries.

Two doses of the measles vaccine provided on schedule results in long-lasting protection against the potentially deadly disease, the WHO said, urging more African countries to scale up measles vaccination programmes.

"WHO and partners are supporting African countries to carry out catch-up routine vaccination campaigns," the organisation said.

Last week [week of 2 May 202], Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa, told journalists that vaccines were at the heart of successful public health response -- and, as countries restore services, routine immunisation must be at the core of revived and resilient health systems.

[A 400% increase in the number of measles cases in 2022 compared with 2021 is staggering. As in India, discussed in item [1] above, the pandemic interrupted vaccination schedules in 2021, then restrictions on movement were lifted. These 2 factors taken together likely led to a large increase in cases.

"Health workers are carrying out an intensive door-to-door education campaign against this disease. All provinces are being encouraged to be on high alert and to report any suspected measles to the nearest health facility. Those who attended church gatherings especially in Manicaland during the Easter period [17-24 Apr 2022] should be on the lookout for suspected measles among their children," the ministry said.

"Officials maintain that "the situation is currently under control and people should not panic."

"The risk of developing severe measles or dying from complications of measles is very high in unvaccinated children. There is no known treatment to get rid of an established measles infection, but over-the-counter fever reducers or vitamin A may help with symptoms.

"In April 2022, the WHO and UNICEF warned there would be a global outbreak of child killer diseases this year due to lack of and disruption of mass vaccination programmes over the past 2 years owing to the COVID-19 pandemic."

The Ministry of Health and Social Development in West Kordofan State announced the emergence of suspected cases of measles among South Sudanese refugees who live in Ghabaish.

The total number of cases reached (46) cases, including (9) deaths.

The emergency unit for the Eid Al-Fitr holiday [1-2 May 2022] held a meeting today headed by the Director General of the Ministry in charge, Dr Salim Salem Musa, during which the Director of the General Department of Health Emergencies and Epidemiology at the Ministry, Dr Safaa Moussa Al-Dalil, presented a detailed report on the suspected measles cases reported by the Ghabaish locality... The local rapid response has intervened and investigated the cases, the Federal Ministry of Health has been contacted regarding the matter, and samples of the disease will be sent to confirm it.

The meeting decided to send a medical team from the state presidency to the city of Ghabaish to carry out the necessary interventions, support the investigation and treatment teams, and isolate patients to prevent the expansion of [the disease].

SUNA [Sudan News Agency] indicates that the meeting was attended by a number of directors of public departments at the Ministry of Health, in addition to the representative of the World Health Organization, Dr Muhammad Marjib Tares, and the meetings will continue on a daily basis to follow up efforts to combat the disease and receive local reports on any health emergencies.

The Ministry of Health in West Kordofan state announced 9 deaths as a result of the measles, and a further 46 cases that may have emerged. Sources indicated that the measles cases may have originated from a South Sudanese refugee camp in the Ghubeish locality of West Kordofan.

A state health medical team was sent from Khartoum to Ghubeish, to retrieve samples of the disease and confirm it in their laboratory. According to government sources, the team will also carry out "necessary interventions" and help isolate the spread in order to prevent further cases.

Médecins Sans Frontières initiative
-----------------------------------
The Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) initiative targets about 30 000 children, including South Sudanese refugees, between 6 months and 15 years.

According to MSF, hundreds of suspected cases of measles have been reported across East Darfur since early 2022. MSF received the 1st suspected measles patient in the East Darfur Kario camp primary health care centre, at the beginning of January [2022]. By the end of March [2022], PHCC received many patients who were exhibiting the symptoms of measles and managed the cases accordingly, the statement says.

"This vaccination campaign is targeting both the South Sudanese refugees in Kario camp and the host communities in the nearby El Ferdous and Bahr El Arab localities," underlines Topher Mongeon, the project coordinator of MSF in East Darfur. "While the campaign is an initiative of the Ministry of Health, MSF is covering the costs for medical staff and transportation means, as well as ensuring the cold chain."

Through this vaccination campaign, the health authorities and MSF are also aiming to strengthen the surveillance system at health facility and community level.
