All 7 foxes at Ranchi's Birsa zoo died in the last one month of the highly contagious canine distemper virus (CDV), officials said on Wednesday [13 Apr 2022].

Foxes, an endangered species, are protected under Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

"The 1st fox death was reported in the first week of March. Thereafter, one by one, all the foxes in the zoo died in a month. Most of the foxes were, however, aged," director of Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park Jabbar Singh told PTI.

Experts of the Ranchi Veterinary College were informed when the 1st death was reported, he said.

"We have also sent samples to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) for examination. Though we have not yet received any official report from the IVRI, the institute verbally hinted that the deaths might be due to CDV," Singh said.

A scientist of IVRI-Bareilly told PTI that the sample was found to be CDV-positive.

"The zoo authority has been informed about this and has also been suggested precautionary measures needed to be taken for protecting other animals. We will send the official report to the zoo authority in a day or 2," the scientist said on condition of anonymity.

Canine distemper, a naturally occurring viral infection, is considered fatal for canine families such as foxes, dogs, and wolves. It infects the lungs and affects respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, experts said.

[The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic carnivores can transmit to wild carnivores, and thus conservation efforts should take into account all infectious agents that are potentially flowing at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface in the region.

It is not specified, but according to images from Birsa zoo, the foxes that were kept there were Bengal foxes (_Vulpes bengalensis_). The Bengal fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent, and it is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
