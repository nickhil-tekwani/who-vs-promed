Paraguay is banning all beef exports in response to an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease that could devastate its cattle industry. The
government of Fernando Lugo is moving swiftly to contain the outbreak
of the disease, which is highly infectious to cows.

Beef is hugely important to Paraguay. It's the No. 2 agricultural
export after soy and a major source of jobs. The country sold 170 000
tons of beef last year [2010], generating USD 800 million. Most of the
exports went to Chile. Tests show just 3 infected cows, but their
entire herd of 819 cattle will be destroyed.

Ranch owner Silfrido Baumgarten said Monday [19 Sep 2011] that he
vaccinated the herd and doesn't know how they got sick.

[There are a number of questions that arise here. Did he vaccinate all
of the cattle? Did he bring in one that was not vaccinated? Were the
cattle up to date on these vaccinations, or were they overdue to be
vaccinated?

Lastly and unlikely is the issue of vaccine contamination. If this
were the case, it is likely there would be other herds with this
disease.

Vaccine must be specific to the serotype. Did he vaccinate with the
correct serotype? The likely answer here is yes. Generally, a certain
serotype is circulating in a certain area, and the vaccines being used
are for that serotype.

OIE was very quick with its notification, about 48 hours. Hopefully,
the samples have been sent to a world reference laboratory for
confirmation. - Mod.TG]
