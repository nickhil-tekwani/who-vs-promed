Until now, 8 human deaths of Q fever
------------------------------------
Since the beginning of January 2010, 2 people have died of Q fever. This
was announced by the National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment (RIVM). The 2 victims suffered of chronic Q fever which they
acquired a long time back; they had also additional illnesses.

The total number of officially reported human fatalities, due to Q fever,
is 8. According to experts, the actual number of victims is rather higher.

Most Dutch goat breeders are infected by Q fever
------------------------------------------------
The majority of the Dutch goat holders and their family members are
infected by Q fever. This information emerged during the international
congress on Q fever in Breda. Tests, carried out by RIVM, involving 120
goat holders and their family members, showed that 83 per cent of them were
infected by the _Coxiella burnetii_ bacterium. Veterinarians were found to
be infected as well: 80.5 per cent of the 133 tested vets were found to
have had contact with _Coxiella burnetii_.

An investigation covering 5600 blood samples showed that some 2.4 per cent
of the Dutch population has already been infected. For people in close
contact with animals, the percentage is 6.9 per cent [this relates, most
probably, mainly to contact with pets; details would help. - Mod.AS]

International specialists question the Dutch handling of Q fever
----------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign specialists, mainly from France and Australia, have their doubts
about the Dutch policy regarding Q fever. This has become apparent during
an international congress in Breda concerning the disease.

The Australian Q fever specialist Stephen Graves said: "Killing of goats
does not safeguard the killing of the bacterium, but will destroy an
important economic sector." Graves recommends replacing culling by
vaccination of young animals, combined with vaccination of humans. In
Australia, human vaccination has been used for the last 20 years.

Also in France and Belgium, culling is not applied since the eradication of
the bacterium from the environment is impossible.

[The above data from the Breda conference are partial and should be
referred to with caution; 1st-hand proceedings are expected with great
interest. For example, what population sector is liable to be vaccinated in
Australia?

The RIVM data (item 1) may be a cause for concern; if the survey covered
goat owners in the entire country, the results may mean that most, if not
all, goat farms are already infected. Full data are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
