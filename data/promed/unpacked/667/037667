Another "presumptive positive" sample still awaiting results
------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 Mar 2010, the Kansas Department of Wildlife
and Parks (KDWP) announced that 10 white-tailed
deer from northwestern Kansas had tested positive
for chronic wasting disease (CWD). These were
animals taken by hunters in the 2009 hunting
seasons. The agency is still awaiting the result
from another deer sample that was presumed to be
positive after preliminary testing at the K-State
Diagnostic Veterinary Lab in Manhattan. That
"presumptive positive" has been sent to the
National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa, for confirmation.

The one presumptive positive deer was taken by a
hunter in Decatur County, and another 4 deer from
that county have been confirmed positive. The
other confirmed positives include 2 from Rawlins
County and one each from Sheridan, Graham, Logan,
and Thomas counties. One deer each from Sheridan
and Thomas counties were exhibiting clinical signs of CWD.

In total, 2702 animals were tested for CWD,
including 16 elk, 278 mule deer, and 2408
white-tailed deer. Although the agency has
completed testing of its target sample for this
hunting season, biologists are still collecting
heads from road-killed deer in northwest Kansas.
In addition, the agency is collecting road-killed
deer in Harper County, near an area where a
captive elk herd had to be destroyed in 2001 because of CWD.

Annual testing is part of ongoing effort by KDWP
to monitor the prevalence and spread of CWD. The
fatal disease was 1st detected in a wild deer
taken in Cheyenne County in 2005. Three infected
deer were taken in Decatur County in 2007 and 10
tested positive in 2008, all in northwest Kansas.

CWD is a member of the group of diseases called
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
Other diseases in this group include scrapie in
sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE or Mad Cow Disease) in cattle, and
CreutzfeldtÂ­Jakob disease in people. CWD is a
progressive, fatal disease that results in small
holes developing in the brain, giving it a
sponge-like appearance under the microscope. An
animal may carry the disease without outward
indication but in the later stages, signs may
include behavioral changes such as decreased
interactions with other animals, listlessness,
lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive
walking in set patterns, and a lack of response
to humans. Anyone who discovers a sick or suspect
deer should contact the nearest KDWP office.

There is no vaccine or other biological method
that prevents the spread of CWD. However, there
is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or
livestock. Still, precautions should be taken.
Hunters are advised not to eat meat from animals
known to be infected, and common sense
precautions are advised when field dressing and
processing meat from animals taken in areas where
CWD is found. More information on CWD can be
found on KDWP's website,
<http://www.kdwp.state.ks.us> or at the Chronic
Wasting Disease Alliance website, <http://www.cwd-info.org>.

[The northeastern portion of Colorado has had CWD
for many years. Colorado was the 1st area to have
CWD. So it seems that the natural spillover from
north eastern Colorado is into northwestern Kansas.

Testing hunter killed animals and road kill is
part of the surveillance of many states. - Mod.TG]
