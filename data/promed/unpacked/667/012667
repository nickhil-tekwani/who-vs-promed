The Middlesex-London Health Unit announced that a dead crow found in
London's east end has tested positive for West Nile virus and is the
1st in Middlesex-London to test positive for the disease this year
[2009].

"What this tells us is that West Nile virus is still present in our
community and that we need to be vigilant in protecting ourselves
from mosquito bites and reducing the places where they breed," says
Andrew Powell, Vector-Borne Disease Coordinator with the
Middlesex-London Health. "The community has always been a great
partner in our surveillance and control programs, whether by letting
us know when they find dead birds or by eliminating standing water
found on their properties."

To protect yourself and your family against West Nile virus
[infection], the Health Unit recommends:

* Wearing light coloured clothing with long-sleeves, pants and socks
in areas where mosquitoes are present, especially at dusk and dawn
when they are most active.

* Using an insect repellent with DEET. Follow directions for use,
especially for children.

* Fixing holes in screens, windows and doors.

* Regularly emptying standing water from garbage cans, wheelbarrows,
toys, flowerpots and saucers, pool covers, tires, and other items
around your home and yard.

* Cleaning clogged eaves troughs.

* Cleaning and changing water in bird baths every other day.

* Keeping pool pumps circulating.

* Aerating ponds or stocking them with fish.

* Covering openings in rain barrels.

The MLHU Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Team has made more than
2104 monitoring visits to approximately 220 sites this summer [2009],
treating over 8 hectares of surface water; this is in addition to the
treatment of more than 100 000 roadside catch basins in London and
Middlesex County. Although the Health Unit is reporting its 1st West
Nile Virus-positive bird, none of the mosquitoes trapped so far this
summer have tested positive for the disease [virus].

[This report provides additional evidence of the presence of West
Nile virus (WNV) in the UK. Previous reports in 2006 indicated that
sentinel chickens developed antibodies to WNV or a closely related
flavivirus, and a 2003 publication reported detection of WNV
neutralizing antibody and small WNV-related RNA fragments in
migratory and resident wild birds (Journal of General Virology for
October 2003. Buckley A, Dawson A, Moss SR, Hinsley SA, Bellamy PE,
Gould EA. Serological evidence of West Nile virus, Usutu virus and
Sindbis virus infection of birds in the UK
<http://www.sgm.ac.uk/JGVDirect/19341/19341a.htm>). The question of
whether WNV is endemic in the UK or periodically reintroduced by wild
birds remains unresolved, but repeated detection of the virus or
specific WNV antibodies would add weight for endemicity. - Mod.TY]
