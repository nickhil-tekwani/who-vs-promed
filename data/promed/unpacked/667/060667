Two macaque monkeys at Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden have tested
positive for a type of herpes virus. The tests were conducted after one of
he monkeys bit a visitor who poked an index finger into the lion-tailed
macaque exhibit on Oct. 3. The family then notified the zoo.
The zoo said blood tests on two randomly selected female macaques show they
carried Herpes B virus, a [virus difficult for humans to acquire. It is
unknown if the monkey who bit the zoo visitor was subjected to the test.
Zoo director Ron Young said the tests may be unreliable because other such
tests, conducted last year as a precaution, came back negative. The
director, however, said there is always a chance that the test results are
incorrect, which is why additional tests have been ordered on all of the
zooÂ’s six macaques monkeys. Tests will now be taken, however, from every
macaque to determine if they, too, are possible carriers of the disease.
He said there are only 40 known cases in several decades; however, about
70% of them were fatal.
The macaques have been taken off exhibit. As a precaution, zookeepers will
wear masks, safety goggles and gloves while working with them.
Young said no new animals have been introduced into the troop, but added
that veterinarians have since told him the antibodies [sic can remain
dormant in the animals for 20 years or more.

[Not much of a report as the laboratory test results are not clear. First
the monkeys are said to be negative, then the next year some are positive.
Antibodies do not remain dormant but viruses might. My guess is that this
should have read "virus can remain dormant". - Mod.CHC
