Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 12 Mar 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. One case was reported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on [11 Mar 2014] and 2 cases from Saudi Arabia on [5 Mar 2014].

Details of the case reported by the UAE are as follows:
- The patient is a 68-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, UAE. He became ill on [1 Mar 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [3 Mar 2014] and is currently in a stable condition. The patient has underlying medical conditions. He had no contact with other known MERS-CoV cases and had no travel history. The patient owns a farm that he visits daily, and where he had contact with animals, including camels which he breeds.

Details of the cases reported by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia are as follows:
- A 51-year-old man from Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on [28 Feb 2014] and was hospitalised on [2 Mar 2014]. He is reported to have had exposure with animals.
- A 56-year-old woman from Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. She became ill on [17 Feb 2014] and was hospitalized on [25 Feb 2014] and died on [3 Mar 2014].

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 189 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 11 Mar 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [20 Feb 2014], the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the cases provided to WHO are as follows:
- The 1st case is a 58-year-old man from Al-Ahsa province. He became ill on [2 Feb 2014] and was hospitalised on [4 Feb 2014]. He recovered from the infection and was discharged from hospital on [24 Feb 2014]. The patient suffered from multiple chronic diseases, and was reported to have had contact with animals.
- The 2nd case is an 81-year-old woman from the Riyadh region. She had multiple underlying medical conditions, and was hospitalised on [2 Feb 2014], where she developed symptoms of MERS on [5 Feb 2014]. The patient died on [8 Feb 2014]. She had no reported contact with animals prior to falling ill.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 186 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 81 deaths.

Abstract
--------
Background. Saudi Arabia is annually the host of the Hajj mass gathering. We aimed to determine the MERS-CoV nasal carriage rate among pilgrims performing the 2013 Hajj and to describe the compliance with the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) vaccine recommendations.

Method. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 5235 adult pilgrims from 22 countries and screened for MERS-CoV using RT-PCR. Information regarding the participants' age, gender, country of origin, medical conditions, as well as vaccination history were obtained.

Results. The mean age of the screened population was 51.8 years (range: 18-93 years) with a male/female ratio of 1.17:1. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples tested (3210 pre-Hajj and 2025 post-Hajj screening). According to the vaccination documents, all participants had received meningococcal vaccination and the majority of those from at risk countries were vaccinated against yellow fever and polio. Only 22 percent of the pilgrims, 17.5 percent of those greater than or equal to 65 years and 36.3 percent of diabetics, had flu vaccination and 4.4 percent had pneumococcal vaccination.

Conclusion. There was no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage among Hajj pilgrims. While rates of compulsory vaccinations uptake were high, uptake of pneumococcal and flu seasonal vaccinations were low including amongst the high risk population.

[According to the most recent global tally of laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections reported by WHO provided in the 12 Mar 2014 update, there have been a total of 189 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths. This tally does not include information on a 55-year-old male from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia reported on the Saudi MOH website on 5 Mar 2014 and in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (12): Saudi Arabia 20140306.2317828, and the asymptomatic infection in the 86-year-old male contact of a confirmed case, reported by the MOH on 6 Mar 2014 and included in section [3] above. With the addition of these 2 cases, the global tally will be 191 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 82 deaths, of which 151 cases including 62 deaths have been reported by Saudi Arabia.

The study on nasal carriage of MERS-CoV among 2013 Hajj attendees described in item [4] above is very interesting and is a good step forward in studying the epidemiology of the MERS-CoV. This moderator highly recommends reading the full article, especially the discussion section, where the authors clearly point out limitations in interpretation of the results. The absence of identification of any MERS-CoV infection among attendees sampled is intriguing, however the use of nasopharyngeal swabs for testing biases the sampling to lower viral loads in the upper respiratory tract vs observed higher viral loads in lower respiratory tract. In addition, the sample size of 2025 attendees post exposure (exit samples) out of approximately 1.9 million attendees is small, for a disease that has a low incidence to date (151 infections confirmed in Saudi Arabia to date out of a population of approximately 28.3 million in 2012).

The disturbing finding was the profile of the Hajj attendees, with 15 percent over 65 years of age, and for those where information was available (approximately 3 percent of the study population) 13.1 percent had hypertension and 6.8 percent were diabetic. Thus, while self exclusion to prevent high risk individuals from attending the Hajj (high risk groups included over age 65 years and those with chronic diseases) was recommended, it appears that this voluntary self-exclusion request was not fully successful in reducing the attendance of high risk groups. Hence, it highlights the need for identifying the high risk exposures that lead to MERS-CoV transmission from the infected reservoir animal host to humans, to implement control measures that will reduce transmission, especially during mass gathering events where the potential for enhanced human to human transmission of microbial organisms is high.
