Cote d'Ivoire: 40 dead in meningitis epidemic in Northeast Bouna region
-----------------------------------------------
The WHO in Cote d'Ivoire said Tuesday [22 Mar 2005] that 40 people
have died in a meningitis epidemic that has swept the rebel-held
northeastern Bouna region.
Since January 2005, officials have registered 210 cases of meningitis
in the rebel- controlled area near the border with Burkina Faso,
around 500 km from the economic capital Abidjan, WHO doctor Aka Bian
Tanoh told IRIN. Tanoh said the epidemic had spread, because there
had been no vaccinations last year [2004], and there was a shortage
of medical staff in the region.
Most health centers have closed down in northern Cote d'Ivoire, which
was seized by rebels in September 2002.
"The need for a vaccination campaign to stop the transmission is
urgent," Tanoh said. "We are talking with the Health Ministry this
week [4th week March 2005] to discuss what can be done."
Tanoh, speaking after the return of a WHO team from a 2-day
assessment visit to the area, said there were still "several" cases
of meningitis, mainly in villages around the town of Bouna.
Earlier reports that over 100 people had died from meningitis were
false, he said. But he stressed that the epidemic was not over yet
and that people could still die from the disease.

UN declares meningitis outbreak in Darfur
-----------------------------------------------
The UN has declared a meningitis outbreak in Sudan's troubled North
Darfur state, with 27 suspected cases and 2 deaths, an official said
on Wed 23 Mar 2005.
UN spokeswoman Radhia Achouri told reporters in Khartoum that 4 cases
of bacterial meningitis had been identified in Saraf Omra camp, set
up for those who have fled fighting in Darfur. 3 cases were in the
same week. "About 160 000 doses of meningitis trivalent vaccine have
been requested from the WHO in Geneva," she said. Sudan's health
minister warned last week [3rd week March 2005] that he expected an
epidemic of meningitis in Sudan and said the government had
stockpiled vaccines to deal with it.

Meningococcal disease in Sudan
---------------------------------
As of the week of 14-20 Mar 2005, 27 suspected cases of meningococcal
disease have been reported from Saraf Omra, Kabkabia locality, North
Darfur State. Out of 20 specimens collected, 11 (55 percent) have
been confirmed as _Neisseria meningitidis_ W135 by either latex test
or culture.
Based on these findings, the Federal Ministry of Health, Sudan has
requested 161 000 doses of trivalent vaccine from the International
Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis
Control for a mass-vaccination campaign in the affected area. The
vaccine is expected to arrive this week [4th week March 2005]. The
mass-vaccination campaign will target the population at risk in the
Saraf Omra administrative unit and surrounding villages and will be
implemented by the Federal Ministry of Health with support from
Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium and WHO.
