Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case confirmed in Buenos Aires Province
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Buenos Aires policeman has been admitted to hospital in serious condition
after having contracted a hantavirus infection and the sanitary authorities
of the province are investigating if the infection was acquired in [Buenos
Aires] or in Pinamar, where the patient was working temporarily. According
to the specialists, [the patient] may have contracted [hantavirus
infection], transmitted by [the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_] present in Pinamar's police stables. [The long-tailed pygmy
rice rat is a reservoir host for _Andes virus_, a hantavirus present in
Chile and south western Argentina to about 50 degrees south latitude. This
virus has been associated previously with cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in this region. - Mod.CP]
The Health Department of Buenos Aires stated that [specialists in zoonoses]
were already at the site. The aim is to corroborate the presence of
long-tailed pygmy rice rats in the area, and if found to take action to
eliminate them. Last Wednesday [8 Jan 2003], the policeman was moved into
the intensive care unit of the Hospital San Juan de Dios, in serious
condition. The Health Department of Buenos Aires [stated that hantavirus
infection had been confirmed by appropriate diagnostic tests].
