----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tomato powdery mildew can cause remarkable reduction in fruit size
and quality. In March of 2008, powdery mildew appeared as circular,
white colonies on leaves, petioles, and stems of tomato plants grown
in greenhouses in Shangqiu, Henan Province, China. The pathogenic
fungus had unbranched conidiophores, conidia were hyaline,
elliptical, and were borne singly. Average length and width of
conidia were 30.6 and 15.1 micrometer, respectively. Germ tubes were
straight and formed at the ends or very close to the ends of conidia.
_Chasmothecium_ was not found in the collected samples.

Different tomato cultivars and species, including _Lycopersicon
esculentum_ cultivars, _L. peruvianum_, and _L. hirsutum_, were
inoculated with a conidial suspension. Plants developed powdery
mildew symptoms as early as 4 days after inoculation. Symptoms
developed on all _L. esculentum_ cultivars, while _L. peruvianum_ and
_L. hirsutum_ displayed complete resistance, which is similar to
previous results. Morphological characteristics of the pathogen on
susceptible genotypes were similar to those from naturally infected plants.

On the basis of the characteristics of the asexual stage, the
pathogen was identified as an isolate of _Oidium neolycopersici_,
which was confirmed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence
analysis. The nucleotide sequence had a 100 percent homology with 10
ITS sequences of _O. neolycopersici_ in GenBank [data base].

In Asia, the spread of this pathogen has been recently reported in
Japan. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of tomato powdery
mildew in China.

neolycopersici_ in Changchun in China. BSPP New Disease Reports vol. 16]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A powdery mildew was observed on tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_,
formerly _Lycopersicon esculentum_) in greenhouses in Changchun in
September 2006. Mildew first appeared as white circular patches on
the adaxial leaf surface (Fig.1). As the disease progressed, abaxial
leaf surface, stems, and petioles were covered by cotton-like masses
of mycelia and conidia. Yellow lesions appeared on the abaxial
surfaces, which turned necrotic and led to defoliation. Young plants
(cotyledon period) through to flowering plants were affected, while
the fruits remained free from infection. The latent period of this
disease was 5-7 days. The fungus from tomato also infected tobacco
(_Nicotiana tabacum_) by inoculation but the symptoms on tobacco were
usually small and localized.

The morphological characteristics of the fungus fit _Oidium
neolycopersici_. In June 1988, tomato powdery mildew was found in
Xinjiang, and the pathogen was identified as _Oidiopsis taurica_.
_Oidium neolycopersici_ clearly differs from _Oidiopsis taurica_ by
its ectophytic nature. In 1991, tomato powdery mildew was found in
Shengyang and the pathogen identified as _Erysiphe polygoni_. In 2003
tomato powdery mildew in Shengyang was identified as _Oidiopsis
lycopersici_. _Oidium neolycopersici_ sometimes forms conidiophores
with pseudo-chains in humid conditions, and has been confused with
_Oidiopsis lycopersici_ with conidia produced in chains. This is the
1st report of tomato powdery mildew caused by _Oidium neolycopersici_
in Changchun in China.

[Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a
range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of
genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of
host species it affects. The pathogens cause serious losses in many
important crops including cereals, hops, canola, sugar beet, and a
number of vegetable crops. Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildew
have reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant
vigour. Spores are spread mainly by splashing rain, wind, or
mechanical means. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the
ground. The disease can be extremely serious and cause severe crop
losses. It is usually controlled with fungicides.

It appears that item [2] was published earlier but was missed when
item [1] was written and published. Item [2] appears to be really the
1st report of _Oidium neolycopersici_ in China.
