Close Monitoring Is Planned for Smallpox Vaccinations
-------------------------
Federal health officials said today that a network of experts would be made
available for consultation at any hour in case of bad reactions to smallpox
vaccine, which may be given soon to a half-million hospital workers.
The network would be part of the most comprehensive system ever to monitor
the safety of a vaccine, officials of the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention here said.
It would also be the first formal program in which doctors treating a
patient with a vaccination complication could immediately consult with
designated experts at selected medical centers around the country. Such
consultations have been done informally, with the disease centers relying
on reports from doctors that were not collected in a standard way.
"We are responding to criticism that we have not had comprehensive,
standard clinical evaluations" of adverse reactions to vaccines, Dr. Walter
Orenstein, an official at the disease centers, said.
The monitoring system will help determine the frequency of complications
caused by the smallpox vaccine, the riskiest of all vaccines.
The network will also be used to determine who will get the scarce and
dangerous drugs needed to treat complications of the smallpox vaccine, and
when, said Dr. Gina Mootrey, another official at the centers, in announcing
the monitoring plan to a panel advising the government on smallpox
vaccinations.
On Wednesday, the advisory panel recommended offering the immunization to
an estimated half-million emergency room and other hospital workers because
of the possibility of a bioterrorist attack.
Today, the panel recommended that anyone with either of 2 common skin
conditions -- eczema and atopic dermatitis -- not receive a smallpox
vaccination. The exclusion also applies to anyone who has had either
condition in the past, even a mild case. Such individuals are at increased
risk of developing a severe and potentially fatal illness known as eczema
vaccinatum.
The panel also recommended not giving smallpox vaccine to anyone who has a
family or household member with either skin condition because the virus in
the vaccine could be transmitted to them.
The panel's chairman, Dr. John F. Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School, said
the criteria might exclude an estimated 7 percent to 17 percent of
Americans from receiving the vaccine.
Individuals infected by the AIDS virus and women who are pregnant, or who
are trying to become pregnant, should also not be given the vaccine, the
panel said.
Modern knowledge about the safety of the vaccine is limited because the
government stopped standard use of smallpox vaccine in 1972 as the disease
was being eradicated from the world.
Earlier this year, researchers reported that 36.4 percent of volunteers in
a study missed school, work, or recreation or had difficulty sleeping after
receiving a dose of the smallpox vaccine that was used before smallpox was
declared eradicated in 1980.
Individuals with severe reactions might be treated with either of 2 drugs.
One is vaccinia immune globulin, a drug that is derived from the blood of
individuals who have been immunized against smallpox, and is now in short
supply. The government owns the only stores.
The other is cidofovir, a drug that experts hope might be effective against
vaccinia, the virus in the vaccine that protects against smallpox.
Cidofovir must be injected, is dangerous, and its only approved use is for
a different virus.
Another reason for instituting the monitoring system is to maintain
credibility and public confidence, Dr. Mootrey said. Last year during the
anthrax attacks, the centers were widely criticized for failing to
communicate pertinent information about anthrax in a timely manner to
health officials, doctors and the public.
The monitoring system will require extensive cooperation from state and
local health departments and hospitals to resolve a number of issues,
including liability for the health professionals involved. The centers plan
to start discussions with state and territorial health officials on Friday.
Most experts at the meeting were cautiously optimistic about the plan.
Dr. Guthrie S. Birkhead, an official of the New York State Health
Department, called the plan comprehensive but underscored the need for
health officials and hospitals to immediately talk through the issues.
Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, complimented the center for
developing "a good system," but added that "it will take months for it to
go right and that is a reason to go slowly at first."
Under the monitoring system, each hospital worker will be given a personal
identification number at the time of vaccination.
The recipients will also receive a telephone hotline number to report any
possible adverse effect like fever, a spreading rash or altered mental
status caused by encephalitis.
An estimated 35 percent, or 175 000, of the recipients are expected to call
the hotline, where the staff will provide advice and refer those needing
immediate care to their doctors.
Of these, about 17 500 are expected to need care from a designated local
specialist in dermatology, allergy, neurology, and infectious diseases. In
turn, about 30 percent of this group will need referrals for more extensive
consultation with experts at designated hospitals around the country.
The experts are at Columbia-New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan,
Boston University, Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, the Northern
California Kaiser Permanente hospital, Stanford University, and Vanderbilt
University.
About 100 recipients are expected to need treatment with vaccinia immune
globulin, cidofovir, or both.
The disease centers plan to conduct a telephone survey involving 15 000 to
20 000 vaccine recipients on the tenth and twenty-first days after vaccination.

ATLANTA (Reuters Health) - Healthcare workers who receive smallpox vaccine
should keep the vaccination site covered until the scab separates, but they
can care for patients immediately after vaccination, federal health
officials announced Thursday.
Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that over
500,000 healthcare workers--those most likely to treat patients in the
event of a smallpox outbreak--should be vaccinated against smallpox.
In a telephone media briefing, Dr. John Modlin, chair of the ACIP,
summarized several specific recommendations made on the vaccination of
healthcare workers.
A key issue the guidelines addressed was preventing the transmission of
vaccinia virus, the virus used in the vaccine, from healthcare workers who
have been vaccinated to those that have not. Vaccinia virus is related to
the smallpox virus, but much less dangerous. The virus generally poses no
risk to healthy individuals but could be a problem for certain individuals,
including those with weakened immune systems.
Between two to six unvaccinated people might contract the virus for every
100,000 people immunized, according to a report in The Journal of the
American Medical Association Tuesday [see ProMED-mail posting Smallpox
vaccine hazards (02) 20021015.5559 - Mod.MPP]
ACIP is recommending that healthcare workers involved in direct patient
care cover the vaccination site with absorbent material, such as gauze, and
"at least a single layer of impermeable acoustic dressing," until the scab
separates.
However, the committee recommended against the need for healthcare workers
to be placed on leave after receiving smallpox vaccination unless they
develop symptoms from the vaccination or do not adhere to infection control
precautions.
"Very close contact required for transmission of vaccinia to household
contacts is unlikely to occur in the healthcare setting," Modlin stressed
during the briefing.
ACIP also recommends that healthcare workers with eczema, a type of
allergic skin rash called atopic dermatitis, or other skin conditions avoid
receiving the smallpox vaccine.
According to Modlin, about 2% to 5% of adults have eczema or atopic
dermatitis, although when other skin conditions that could make the vaccine
risky are included, the vaccine may be contraindicated for up to 10% to 20%
of people.
Pregnant healthcare workers, those with HIV/AIDS or other immunocompromised
individuals should not receive the vaccine, but neither routine pregnancy
testing nor mandatory HIV/AIDS testing is recommended. Female healthcare
workers should be counseled not to become pregnant for 4 weeks after
vaccination and HIV testing should be offered, they suggest.
Smallpox vaccine may be administered at the same time as any inactivated
vaccine or live vaccine, with the exception of varicella (chickenpox),
according to ACIP.
Regarding the risk to household contacts of healthcare workers, Dr. Walter
Orenstein, director of CDC's National Immunization Program, told Reuters
Health that the same kinds of contraindications considered for those being
vaccinated should be applied.
"So, for example, if a healthcare worker has a child in the home with
eczema, then that worker should not be vaccinated," Orenstein said.
Modlin pointed out that "for the most part...organizations representing
emergency room physicians, nursing staff and others have been very
supportive of the process and have participated and, more or less, agree
with the ACIP's actions."
According to Orenstein, the order in which healthcare workers will be
vaccinated is still being worked out.

[ProMED-mail has been covering the debates and discussions related to a
resumption of vaccination with smallpox vaccine in the USA. All of the
information currently available on the risks of the smallpox vaccine are
based on data collected 30 or more years ago, when smallpox vaccinations
were routine in the USA and elsewhere (prior to the declaration of global
eradication of the disease). There has been much discussion re: the
changed environment (HIV/AIDS, increased population with eczema and atopic
dermatitis, increased people on immunosuppressant medication, transplants,
etc.) since vaccination was stopped, with an awareness of an increase in
the numbers of persons at high risk of complications following receipt of
the vaccine.
As a note, it is interesting that Dr. Modlin gives a range of 7-17 percent
of the population that would have to self exclude from vaccination by
virtue of their own risk or risk of a close contact. Remembering the back
of the envelope estimates proposed by Dr. Kemper et al Expected Adverse
Events in a Mass Smallpox Vaccination Campaign Effective Clinical Practice,
March/April 2002 [URL below], they estimated that 25 percent of the
population would be excluded from vaccination because of high risk or the
possibility of coming in contact with a high-risk individual.
<http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr02/kemper.htm>
While the plan does address the issue of vaccination of healthcare workers
involved in active patient care, with requirements for an occlusive
impermeable dressing until the scab separates, one can't help but remain
concerned that the combination of a large pool of health care workers who
were born after smallpox vaccination was discontinued (and hence will be
primary vaccinees) combined with today's larger pool of high risk patients
(with either acquired via infection or have iatrogenically acquired
immunosuppression) may be very risky. In the article by Neff JM, Lane JM,
Fulginiti VA, Henderson DA. Transmission of Vaccinia Virus JAMA 16 Oct 2002
288 /15 (discussed in ProMED-mail posting Smallpox vaccine hazards (02)
20021015.5559) there is mention that "most contacts were in the home, but a
few patients apparently acquired vaccinia from a recently vaccinated nurse
in the hospital". They also mention that while there were no reports of
progressive vaccinia in contacts of vaccinees, these data came from the
1960s when there were fewer immunosuppressed persons. Given today's
environment, there may be a real need to exclude recently vaccinated health
care workers (especially those receiving a primary vaccination) from active
patient care.
In the article by Neff JM et al, there was mention of a case of
disseminated vaccinia that occurred in an apparently healthy military
recruit (in 1984) who was later diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. While we do
not know how many HIV infected persons were vaccinated before the military
stopped using the vaccine, the prevalence of HIV infection was much lower
in 1984 than it is today. This last finding raises concerns re:
vaccination of healthcare workers without requiring HIV testing prior to
vaccination.
The above plan as stated will hopefully provide a better data base on the
risks associated with smallpox vaccination in the current
environment. Through active and passive surveillance, more data should
become available on the actual risks associated with the vaccine, with the
ultimate outcome being recommendations based on real rather than
hypothesized data. What this plan does not discuss is how the liability
issues will be handled. Yes, there will be individuals with serious
complications from receipt of the vaccine, or from contact with a recent
vaccine recipient. And in today's heightened litigious environment, who
will shoulder the burden of the liabilities for the medical and other costs
associated with these serious reactions? - Mod.MPP]
