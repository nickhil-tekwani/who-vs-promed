Syria Cholera Outbreak
----------------------
Epidemiological Overview
------------------------
Since the last situation report, the number of confirmed and suspected cases continues to rise. Suspected cholera cases (AWD) have been reported from all 14 governorates, of which 12 have reported cases that were positive by rapid diagnostic test. Between 25 Aug 2022 and 8 Oct 2022, 15 823 suspected cases have been reported, including 68 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.43%).

Of the 1635 samples tested with rapid diagnostic tests, 807 have tested positive. To date, 644 stool samples have been cultured, of which 245 have tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. The overall proportion of positive cases is 46%. The most affected governorates to date [14 Oct 2022] are:
• Deir-ez-Zor (8940 cases, 56.5 %)
• Ar-Raqqa (3325 cases, 21%)
• Aleppo (2411 cases, 15.2%)
• Al-Hasakeh (841 cases, 5.3%)

Approximately 54 suspected cases have been reported from IDP camps and sites to date.

Health Surveillance and Laboratory
----------------------------------
• Integrated epidemiological analysis and the distribution of cases at community level are being shared by WHO with partners in the respective response locations to help drive rapid response activities in response to suspected and confirmed cases.
• Through WHO support, surveillance and active case finding have been intensified in high-risk areas, including Aleppo, Deir-ez-Zor, Ar-Raqqa, Al-Hasakeh, and IDP camps/sites. Support also continues to 101 rapid response teams through operational costs and the transport of samples to the main reference laboratory in Damascus.
• The NES NGO Forum, the Health Working Group, and information management partners continue to work with WHO to fill gaps in reporting and surveillance, and to ensure operational information on cases is shared with WASH partners to enable investigations and targeted interventions.
• UNHCR has trained 72 community health workers and 413 community health volunteers on surveillance activities. Health sector partners, including IMC, are working to enhance the integration of AWD/cholera data as part of their routine health information management systems.
• WHO is in the process of procuring additional laboratory supplies sufficient to support 7000 tests, as well as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for distribution.
• With WHO support, laboratory teams continue to monitor stool culture sensitivity and resistance to antimicrobials. Culture sensitivity results showed sensitivity to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole, while results indicated resistance to tetracycline and imipenem.

Case Management
---------------
• Ministry of Health (MoH) facilities with 1096 beds are now operational. A total of 96 rehydration points has also been established at various public primary healthcare centers.
• In Northwest Syria, cholera treatment centers (CTC) supported by IDA in Jarablus and A'zaz are ready to receive patients, each with 20-bed capacity. The cholera treatment unit (CTU) in Afrin, also supported by IDA, will be ready to ready to admit patients as of 15 Oct 2022.
• Additional treatment capacity in Northwest Syria is being established through support from MSF-B in Idleb (Salqin sub-district), MSF-S in Aleppo (Al Bab sub-district), Al Ameen Organization in Aleppo (Afrin and Al Bab sub-districts), and Al Seeraj Organization in Aleppo (Al Atareb and Daret Azza sub-districts).
• NES NGO partners continue to support cholera case management at primary healthcare centers and hospitals across Northeast Syria.
o 101 beds are operational across 6 CTUs in Deir-ez-Zor, as well as 42 beds at a CTC and hospital in Ar-Raqqa.
o A new CTU began operating on 12 Oct 2022 at Hasakeh National Hospital through the support of an NES NGO partner.
o Partners are also in the final stages of establishing CTCs in Sa'wa in Deir-ez- Zor, Tabqa and Ain al-Arab (Kobane) in Ar-Raqqa governorate, and Washokani camp in Al-Hasakeh.
o Resources have been mobilized by 2 NES NGO partners to procure critical supplies required for cholera treatment.
o Training of healthcare providers in NES NGO supported facilities continues on cholera case management.

Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
------------------------------------
WASH Rapid Response:
• Mobile teams deployed by NES NGOs have investigated a total of 1167 suspected cases in 206 communities and provided targeted assistance to 314 cases.
• In 9 IDP camps in Northeast Syria, WASH partners and camp management have reviewed preparedness checklists to help ensure appropriate cholera prevention measures are implemented.
• In Northwest Syria, during the last week, 11 rapid response teams conducted investigations in 15 communities and implemented chlorination and hygiene promotion activities. An interactive dashboard has also been established by WASH health cluster partners detailing AWD/cholera response activities.
• The Norwegian Refugee Council has distributed 5755 hygiene kits in Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.

Access to Safe Water:
• UNICEF has distributed 683 tons of sodium hydrochloride to all governorates to support water disinfection at smaller water treatment facilities.
• WASH sector partners, including UNICEF and Action Against Hunger, continue to provide emergency water trucking to neighborhoods in Al-Hasakeh and Aleppo, delivering an average of 2000 cubic meters of water per day. Within the same neighborhoods, Action Against Hunger has conducted full disinfection of 364 communal tanks and is in the process of procuring 1200 cholera hygiene kits as part of planned RCCE interventions.
• Chlorination and water quality control activities for trucks entering Al-Hasakeh City maintained at 32 private truck filling points along the Euphrates River and connected canals.
• In partnership with the DoH, WHO and local partners continue to conduct awareness raising and distribution of aqua tabs in Deir-ez-Zor as part of a 1-month campaign, involving 132 participants and targeting more than 1/3 of the population in the governorate.
• WHO has finalized plans for the delivery of chlorine to both Latakia and Tartous DoH for distribution to health centers and hospitals to disinfect water tanks.
• UNICEF is in discussion with the Ministry of Water Resources to assess and support procurement of reagents and consumables for laboratories testing drinking water and water analysis at pumping and treatment stations.
• UNDP has completed the rehabilitation of a sewage network in Latakia (Wadi Alqalaa).
• A total of 1600 samples from various water sources (main network, wells, tanks, ice factories), including environmental samples, have been collected by WHO to date and sent for testing at the central public health laboratory (CPHL) in Damascus.
• WHO continues to monitor key locations, including 11 IDP camps and sites, 38 collective shelters in Al-Hasakeh, 23 collective shelters in Tabqa, 19 boreholes, and 41 drinking stations in Deir-ez-Zor.

Challenges / Gaps
-----------------
• Severe funding gaps in the health sector that have led to reduced availability of basic life-saving health services. Funding challenges extend to the AWD/cholera response and limits the ability of Health, WASH, and RCCE partners to scale up activities and ensure adequate pipelines of critical medicines and supplies.
• Limited existing capacity within the health system to care for and treat AWD/cholera cases with low knowledge and skill levels among health workers and only 54% of primary healthcare centres and 58% of hospitals functional as of June 2022.
• Limited availability of laboratory capacity to culture tests.
• Limited global supply of oral cholera vaccines due to multiple ongoing outbreaks, potentially limiting the number of doses and supplies available to Syria.
• Access to safe water remains challenging, leading to the use of infected (untreated) drinking water from the Euphrates River. In the Northeast, the pumping from Alouk water station has been interrupted since 11 Aug 2022 contributing to critical shortages in Al-Hasakeh governorate and surrounding areas, affecting over 900 000 people including people in IDP camps. This has led to alarming over extraction of groundwater in Shamouka to fill water tanks that serve almost half a million people in and around Al- Hasakeh City. In Northwest Syria, water pumping from Ein Al Beyda has not been available since 2017, forcing 185 000 people to rely on unsafe water sources.
• Limited availability of electricity, creating bottlenecks for water production and distribution.
• At least 70% of sewage is untreated/unsafely disposed of, and at least half of the sewage systems are not functional.
• Lack of expertise and knowledge within the WASH sector on cholera preparedness, prevention, and response.
• Low community awareness of cholera prevention measures.
• Shortages in cholera supplies, including medicines and WASH supplies, as well as challenges with importation, local procurement, and rapid dispatch.

[2] Cholera: Lebanon
Date: Wed 19 Oct 2022

Cholera - Lebanon
-----------------
The Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon notified WHO on 6 Oct 2022 of 2 laboratory culture-confirmed cholera cases reported from the northern part of the country. As of 13 Oct 2022, a total of 18 cases have been confirmed, including 2 probable deaths (CFR 11.1%). This represents the 1st cholera outbreak in Lebanon since 1993. Responding to the current cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.

Outbreak overview
-----------------
On 6 Oct 2022, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) of Lebanon, notified WHO of 2 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases, confirmed by bacteria culture test, reported from North and Akkar governorates, northern Lebanon. The index case, a 51-year-old Syrian man living in an informal settlement in Minieh-Danniyeh district (North governorate), was reported to the MoPH on 5 Oct 2022. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 1 Oct 2022 with rice water stool and dehydration. Following a possible healthcare-associated transmission, the 2nd case, a 47-year-old health worker, was reported, representing the 1st nosocomial infection of this outbreak.

Immediately following the confirmation of the 1st 2 cases, active case finding in the informal settlement where the index case lived, identified 10 additional cases confirmed by bacteria culture test. In addition, _Vibrio cholerae_ was found in potable water sources, irrigation, and sewage. These positive cultures were confirmed on 9 Oct 2022.

In Halba (the capital of Akkar Governorate), an additional 2 cases were culture-confirmed among Lebanese nationals. On 10 Oct 2022, an additional 4 cases were culture-confirmed among Syrian nationals living in an informal settlement in Aarsal town of the Baalbek district.

As of 13 Oct 2022, a total of 18 confirmed cases have been reported. The most affected age group are children under 5 years (44.4%; n = 8), followed by persons aged 45 to 64 years (22.2%; n = 4), 25-44 years (16.7%; n = 3) and 5-15 years (16.7%; n = 3). Females are disproportionally affected in the outbreak (72%; n = 13). Of the total cases, 11 (61.1%) were reported from the district of Minieh - Danniyeh, 4 cases (22.2%) from Baalbek district and 3 cases (16.7%) from Akkar district (Figure 1) [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL].

In parallel, sewage water testing conducted in Ain Mraisseh in Beirut, Ghadir station in Mount Lebanon, and Bourj Hammoud also in Mount Lebanon, confirmed the presence of _V. cholerae_ in all 3 sources, indicating that cholera has spread to 2 other regions of the country (Beirut Area and Mount Lebanon) located far from the initial confirmed cases.

This is the 1st outbreak of cholera in Lebanon since the last case was reported in 1993 with no local transmission documented since then.

At this stage of the outbreak, laboratory confirmation of cases is done by bacterial culture and MALDI-TOF spectrometry which is conducted at the Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology, and Microbiology at the American University of Beirut, a WHO collaborating centre.

Public health response
----------------------
The Ministry of Public Health has established a coordination mechanism with multi-sector partners including the Ministry of Energy and Water, WHO, UNICEF, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

Response measures implemented, include the following:
- Intensification of active surveillance and case finding in high-risk camps, informal settlements and hotspot areas, including water quality monitoring (free residual chlorine).
- Training of trainers for the central and peripheral teams of the surveillance unit was held on 10 and 11 Oct 2022, and will be followed by training of registered local physicians, hospitals, medical centers and public health centers (PHCs) at central and peripheral levels from 19 to 25 Oct 2022.
- Updating of surveillance protocols.
- Designation of 9 referral governmental hospitals to act as cholera treatment centers.
- Development of a cholera preparedness and response plan, in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF and in agreement with all healthcare partners, that includes the following, but not limited to:

• Improving capacity for early detection and ensuring proper linkages with WASH response through the support of integrated multisectoral field mission in the Akkar region.
• Circulars have been issued to hospitals, health centres and health workers regarding the necessity of informing MoPH of any suspected case.
• Distribution of 1000 Bioline rapid diagnostic tests.
• Initial stock of medicines required to treat 400 cases was secured.
• MoPH is exploring a potential request to the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for oral cholera vaccine (OCV) doses to cover 400 000 refugees and hosting communities including potential vaccination for prisons.
• The functionality of water testing laboratories is being assessed in 8 hospital laboratories as a first stage to allow for quick, decentralized case identification in various Lebanese regions.
• A crisis cell was formed to coordinate the provision of clean water, water quality monitoring, and access to adequate sanitation, targeting vulnerable groups living in informal settlements.
• The associations of doctors and nurses and the Lebanese Society of Bacterial Diseases were contacted to develop training courses for healthcare workers on case management and methods of infection prevention and control, especially within health institutions.
• Collaboration with relevant ministries, especially energy and water, interior, municipalities, and the environment, to provide safe water and sanitation.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Lebanon's health system has been hard-hit by a 3-year financial crisis and an explosion at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that destroyed essential medical infrastructure in the capital. In this context, responding to a cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.

According to The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees in the world per capita and square kilometre, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees and about 13 715 refugees of other nationalities. Additionally, there is a large population of Palestinian refugees that are particularly exposed due to unsafe WASH services in various camps (Beqaa, Trablos, Beirut, Saida, Sour), possibly with limited medical services provided.

Due to porous borders allowing free movement between Lebanon and neighbouring countries, the exportation of cholera cases is highly likely.

The current cholera outbreak in Lebanon was reported 6 weeks after a cholera outbreak was declared in neighbouring Syria. On 15 Sep 2022, WHO assessed the risk of the cholera outbreak in Syria and predicted that due to shortages of drinking water and a fragile and limited health system in Lebanon, there was a risk of a cholera outbreak should the disease be introduced into the country.

Power cuts, water shortages, and inflation have strained the already fragile health system in Lebanon. Poverty has also worsened for many Lebanese, with many families frequently rationing water, unable to afford private water tanks for consumption and domestic use.

Since the last cholera outbreak in Lebanon occurred in 1993, there is a need to update cholera surveillance and case management guidelines and re-train healthcare workers.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends improving access to proper and timely case management of cholera cases, improving infection, prevention, and control in healthcare facilities, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as, improving hygiene practices and food safety in affected communities as the most effective means of controlling cholera.

Oral cholera vaccine should be used in conjunction with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in targeted areas known to be at high risk for cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided to the population.

Surveillance for early case detection, confirmation and response in other provinces and regions of Lebanon should be reinforced especially at the district level while expanding community-based surveillance.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on international travel or trade to or from Lebanon based on the currently available information.
