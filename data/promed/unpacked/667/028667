Cholera disease killed 7 and more than 667 infected in Kandahar, Afghanistan
------------------------------------------------------------
At least 7 children were killed due to a cholera outbreak and 667 others were infected with the disease in less than a week in Afghanistan's Kandahar province, media reports citing doctors in the province stated on Wednesday [27 Jul 2022]. "A total of 9500 patients affected with diarrhea have been taken to the healthcare center, where 667 of them were diagnosed with cholera disease," said Mohammad Daud Ayubi, as quoted by Xinhua News Agency. The doctor also confirmed that 7 children have died of the disease over the past several days in the province.

According to reports, the cholera outbreak had earlier claimed the lives of 20 children in the neighboring Helmand province, while hundreds of cases have been reported in Kandahar, Helmand and neighbouring Zabul, and thousands of cases in northern Jawzjan and Kunduz provinces.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, Sharafat Zaman had earlier said that over 100 cases of the disease have been recorded in the provinces of Helmand and Kandahar and that more than 15 people have died as a result of severe cholera in Helmand province alone, Tolo News reported. Health officials said that this disease, which causes severe diarrhea and nausea, has been spreading in the small villages of Dasht, Giro Joy, Tak, Shina, and other areas for the past week or so.

A health official in Daikundi province, Sayed Ishaq Hosseini said, "The cholera-like disease, which has severe diarrhea and vomiting as symptoms, has spread from 6 Jul 2022 in the border region between the Baghran district in Helmand and Nawa Mesh district in Daikundi province. In Helmand and Daikundi provinces, in central and southern Afghanistan, the cholera outbreak has recently killed 11 people in the districts of Nawa Mesh and Baghran.

According to the World Health Organization, "Cholera remains a global threat to public health and is an indicator of inequity and lack of social development."

_Vibrio cholerae_ linked to Davao City diarrhea outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up report, the Davao City Health Office (CHO) reported recently that the cause of the large diarrhea outbreak in Toril district that sickened more than 200 people and killing 6 was due to foodborne contamination with _Vibrio cholerae_.

"I announce that the diarrhea outbreak was due to a foodborne microorganism, with _Vibrio cholerae_ as the pathogen of concern. The most likely vehicle of transmission is contaminated food," CHO acting chief Dr Ashley Lopez said. "Based on investigations, food may have been contaminated during preparation and handling by infected handlers. It was also found that proper storage, delayed serving, and unsanitary environment may have contributed to the food contamination because of exposure to elements," Lopez added.

A total of 217 cases were reported, including 6 deaths since 15 Jul 2022. Rectal swabs done on the affected cases showed that 60% turned out positive in the bacteriological culture testing, she added.

200 dead in 10 months after resurgence of cholera in Cameroon
-------------------------------------------------------------
A resurgence of cholera has killed 200 people since October 2021 in Cameroon, where more than 10 300 cases of the disease have been reported, the health minister said on Thursday [4 Aug 2022].

Cholera, an acute diarrhoeal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated, periodically appears in Cameroon, a central African country with a population of more than 25 million.

Since the start of the cholera epidemic in late October 2021, 200 people have died out of a total of 10 322 cases, Cameroon's health minister, Manaouda Malachie, announced in a tweet.

Five of Cameroon's 10 regions, including the Littoral, which includes the economic capital Douala, and the Centre region, which includes the capital Yaound√©, are affected by the epidemic, according to the health minister. "Beware!!! Let us observe hygiene measures," Malachie urged.

The previous outbreak of cholera killed 66 people in Cameroon between January and August 2020. In early 2021, WHO estimated that there were 1.3 to 4 million cases of cholera and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths from the disease worldwide each year.
