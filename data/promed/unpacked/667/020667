In general, public health care in Guinea is insufficient, with lack of funding, lack of modern equipment, lack of diagnostic [facilities], etc. The "Provincial Hospitals" of Boffa, Gaoual, Kouroussa, Krouan, Beyla, Lola, Yomou, *Macenta* and *Kissidougou* do not fulfill the minimum WHO-standards, i.e.: no potable water, no access to a latrine in function, etc. Since a renovation program, the infrastructure of all "Regional Hospitals" is satisfying.

[This report is 5 years old. If any reader knows that the situation of Provincial Hospitals has improved since then, we would be glad to receive that information, with date and source. - Mod.JW]

The death toll from the worst EVD outbreak in 7 years climbed to 83 in Guinea as the aid organization Doctors Without Borders said the disease's geographical spread marks the flare-up as unprecedented.

In neighboring Liberia, one of 2 confirmed cases has died, while a 2nd person who died with suspected EVD tested negative for the virus, the World Health Organization said in a statement. Both confirmed cases in Liberia were exposed to EVD in Guinea, Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman, said on Twitter.

The outbreak is the 1st in Guinea, which reported 5 new cases, raising the total to 127 suspected or confirmed illnesses, Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman in Guinea, said today [31 Mar 2014]. Guinea's government has asked people not to eat monkeys, chimpanzees, or bats and to avoid travel in the affected areas, while Senegal closed its southern border with Guinea.

The WHO said it doesn't recommend any restrictions on travel to or trade with Liberia or Guinea.

The Economic Community of West African States expressed "deep concern" over the outbreak and asked for international help in combating the "serious threat" to regional security. The Guinean towns of Gueckedou and Macenta, near the border with Liberia, have been hardest hit, with 55 and 14 deaths, respectively, according to the nation's health ministry. There are 11 confirmed cases in the capital Conakry and 3 deaths, Jasarevic said yesterday [31 Mar 2014] by phone from Guinea.

The WHO has distributed single-use protection equipment and hygiene kits to health-care workers in hospitals in an effort to stem the spread of EVD, Jasarevic said. All the outbreaks of the past decade have been in Congo Democratic Republic, the neighboring Republic of Congo, and Uganda, with the exception of one in Sudan in 2004. There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat or prevent EVD.

In response to the government of Guinea's request for assistance in responding to the EVD outbreak, a team of 5 specialists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Conakry on 31 Mar 2014.

The American health officials are joining their Guinean and international counterparts, who have been working effectively to monitor and halt the spread of this disease and to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to control the further spread of the infection. We extend our sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have died. Our thoughts and prayers are with those fighting the infection.

We continue to closely monitor the situation. The U.S. Embassy in Conakry, following the recommendations of the Guinean government, the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] (CDC) and others, strongly recommends that U.S. citizens in Guinea avoid contact with individuals exhibiting the symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever until further information becomes available. Neither the United States nor the World Health Organization recommend general travel restrictions at this time.

Updates for U.S. citizens regarding the Ebola outbreak are posted on the U.S. Embassy website and Facebook as they become available at http://conakry.usembassy.gov. For more information on Ebola hemorrhagic fever, please visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola.

The Embassy of the United States in Conakry cordially invites members of the greater American community residing in Guinea to participate in a town hall meeting on Wed 2 Apr 2014 at the U.S. Embassy for a briefing by the Centers for Disease Control http://conakry.usembassy.gov/townhall-1042014.html. Please register by contacting the Consular Section at <conconakry@state.gov>.

"...Everything started with the case of a young man who happens to be the nephew of our counterpart, previously Director of the Prefectural Hospital Macenta..."

This report [in French] describes the tragic story of a doctor in Guinea who died from EVD and gave several members of his family fatal infections.

Many health workers -- including at least 3 doctors -- were amongst the 1st victims. "Most doctors at 1st treated the infected patients for malaria, hence, medical staff treating these patients also got infected," Dr Sakoba Keita, from the health ministry, said.

"I no longer go out of the house just so that I do not have cause to shake people's hands," Mohamed Barry, a 65-year-old retired civil servant, said [An unnecessary precaution, unless the other person is ill and has blood on their hands. - Mod.JW].

All homes now have bowls or buckets filled with disinfectant at their entrance for both inhabitants and visitors to wash their hands.

The outbreak is also affecting business. Senegal, for example, has closed its land borders with Guinea until further notice, and hundreds of people and their merchandise are stranded in vehicles on the Guinean side. "Our goods are about to perish," one businessman told a local radio station on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014]. The border is one of Guinea's busiest when it comes to cross-border trade; it shares borders with 6 countries in total. Some shopping centres in the capital, Monrovia, have made it compulsory for the supermarket employees to wear gloves. Schools initially closed, but have been ordered to reopen so as not to cause panic.

Some flights have been affected as well: Air Mauritania has refused to fly Guinean passengers in transit in Dakar to Conakry on the grounds of the EVD outbreak.

But funeral corteges are also getting smaller and smaller as a result of a fear of infection by someone who has had contact with a corpse. "I don't go to any funeral now whether it is an EVD-related death or not or whether it is my relation that has died or not," says schoolteacher Mariam Mansare.

Liberia's Health Minister Walter Gwenigale raised a laugh on Monday [31 Mar 2014] at a press conference when he warned people to stop having sex because the virus was spread via bodily fluids. "I see some people smiling, but we have to tell you all the facts so that you don't get contaminated," he said.

[Ebola is not transmissible until the victim starts a fever. Patients who are ill and bleeding are liable to lack interest in sexual intercourse. But an alert to survivors: Ebolavirus was isolated from the semen on the 61st, but not the 76th, day after onset of illness in a laboratory-acquired case (Ref. Heymann DL (ed.) 2008 Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 19th edition).]

This was in addition to existing advice to stop shaking hands and kissing [Also an unnecessary precaution, unless the other person is feverish and has blood on their hands or in their mouth. - Mod.JW].

In Sierra Leone, where there are 5 suspected cases of EVD, none of which have yet been confirmed, travel restrictions are in place. Travellers have to fill out a questionnaire and indicate whether they have suffered from a fever, vomiting or diarrhoea in the last 2 weeks. The authorities have also banned relatives from bringing corpses into Sierra Leone from Guinea for burial.

Weekly markets near Guinea's border have been suspended to prevent the spread of the disease, and the border has been shut.

In most countries of the region, like in Ivory Coast, the government has advised people not to consume bush meat, but it has not been banned, and I am told that you can still see it on sale on the side of the road outside the main city Abidjan.

The Health Protection Agency's director of Global Health has said that UK hospitals have been put on "alert" over EVD after an outbreak of the virus killed at least 78 in Guinea, West Africa.

Dr Brian McClusky told ITV News: "What we have done is make sure all hospitals in the UK have been alerted, so if a patient turns up who has those symptoms who has been to that part of West Africa, they can be tested and looked after in specialist facilities in London. He added: "The chance of it spreading outside West Africa is relatively small, because essentially people get ill relatively quickly. They are not likely to get on a plane and survive a journey. It's technically possible that somebody could get on a plane and arrive in the UK. It's extremely unlikely."

Morocco's health ministry said no cases have been recorded in Morocco, which announced extra health screening measures on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014] at entry points to the country, in particular at Casablanca airport, after the outbreak of the deadly Ebola epidemic in Guinea. Casablanca airport has daily links with Conakry, the capital of Guinea.

"As a precautionary measure," the health ministry has stepped up "sanitary checks at entry points ... especially at Casablanca airport," a key transportation hub for north and west Africa, the official MAP news agency reported. Travellers from countries with recorded cases of EVD will undergo medical tests for signs of haemorrhagic fever, the ministry said in a statement carried by MAP.

The World Health Organization has said it is not recommending travel or trade restrictions to Guinea; to Liberia, which has also confirmed cases of Ebola; or to Sierra Leone, which has reported suspected cases, based on the information currently available; but Senegal has closed border crossings to Guinea "until further notice."

An EVD outbreak that has killed at least 78 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone could land in the USA, health officials warned today [1 Apr 2014].

Symptoms of the disease, such as fever, red eyes and bleeding, can take up to 3 weeks to appear, ample time for an unwitting victim to travel outside the West African hot zone. "It's true that anyone with an illness is just one plane ride away from coming to the U.S.," said John O'Connor, spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "But we have protections in place."

Airline workers are trained to spot symptoms, and quarantine officers at 20 major U.S. airports like New York City's JFK are ready to respond to an in-flight illness. The CDC has also deployed a 5-person team to help contain the outbreak on the ground in Guinea, O'Connor said. They arrived Monday night [31 Mar 2014].

"There's nothing to prevent someone traveling here asymptomatically during the incubation period," said ABC News' chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser, who served as acting director of the CDC during the swine flu outbreak. "It's one of the reasons we have a vested interest in helping to control outbreaks where they start."

The World Health Organization has yet to impose any travel restrictions on the area, stressing that it's "highly unlikely" for the outbreak to spread by plane. "The people who get EVD tend to be in remote villages and tend not to have the money to be able to get on planes," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said, adding that it's equally unlikely for an American traveler to bring the disease back.

"They would probably be aware of the situation going into it and be advised not to touch someone who looks ill and feverish."

Saudi Arabia on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014] announced the suspension of visas for Muslim pilgrims from Guinea and Liberia, 2 African countries hit by an outbreak of the deadly EVD epidemic.

The "preventive" measure came at the request of the Saudi health ministry "due to the danger of the disease and its highly contagious" nature, state news agency SPA reported. Once a year, Muslims perform the Haj pilgrimage to the Saudi city of Mecca, home to Islam's holiest sites, but they can make the minor Umrah pilgrimage to the kingdom all year round.

The World Health Organization has said it is not recommending travel or trade restrictions to Guinea, Liberia, or to Sierra Leone, which has reported suspected cases of EVD, based on information currently available.

[There is a lot of scary misinformation circulating in Guinea and elsewhere about the transmission of EVD by contact. The greatest danger is not from people you meet in the street but from people who are already showing signs of illness at home or in a clinic or who have been hospitalized. These people are very unlikely to be boarding planes going to Morocco, Mauritania, or the USA. - Mod.JW
