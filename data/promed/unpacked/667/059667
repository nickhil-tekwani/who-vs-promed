Saudi authorities have culled 37 falcons after discovering cases that have
tested positive to the H5 [strain] of the avian flu [virus], the
agriculture ministry said.
A ministry team inspecting falcons kept in a veterinary centre in Riyadh,
which takes care of the birds that are usually used for hunting, discovered
the cases, said a ministry statement carried by SPA official news agency.
The ministry said 37 falcons, including the 5 cases "were killed and
burned." [Map at

Laboratory tests were being conducted to establish if the cases test also
positive for the N virus -- "the other component of the (bird flu) virus,"
it added.
Saudi Arabia had said in November [2005] that it was banning all bird
imports from neighbouring countries amid heightened regional concerns about
bird flu. That decision came a day after Kuwait announced a bird stricken
with avian flu in the country carried the deadly H5N1 strain, in the first
case of its kind in the Gulf region. Another bird was found to have the
milder H5N2 strain.

[The identity of the neuraminidase component of the virus and confirmation
from a reference laboratory are expected.
If confirmed, and in the absence of disease in domestic poultry, the
infection in falcons could have been the result of contacts (during
hunting?) with (migratory?) wild birds.
An H9N2 avian influenza virus has been present for the past several years
in various Middle-Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. Though not an
HPAI virus strain, losses at times have been considerable. - Mod.AS]
