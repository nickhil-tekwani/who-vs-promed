Seal morbillivirus on west coast of Ireland
-------------------------------------------
Tests carried out in the Veterinary Sciences Division of the Department of
Agriculture and Rural Development in Belfast, Northern Ireland have
identified morbillivirus infection in a common seal from the west coast of
Ireland.
Dr Jimmy Dunne and Ms Jane Gilleran from the Zoology Department, University
College Galway, Ireland collected tissues from 2 harbor seals found dead at
Inishmore, one of the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland, on 21 Sep
2002. Subsequent immuno-histochemical examination at the Belfast laboratory
has identified morbillivirus antigen in lung, spleen, and gastric mucosa of
one of these animals. No antigen was found in the autolytic tissues of the
second seal. The advanced state of decomposition of 2 other seal carcasses
found in the same region precluded necropsy. Oculonasal discharges have been
seen in several live seals from the region, but high mortality has not been
reported.
Tests carried out at the Belfast laboratory in early August 2002 revealed
that the seal morbillivirus had spread to the east coast of England. Similar
tests carried out last week indicated that it had reached the east coast of
Scotland. So far, there are no reports of morbillivirus infection in seals
along the east coast of Ireland.
It is too early to know whether the case found at the Aran Islands is a
"one-off", or represents the beginning of a seal epidemic in Ireland.

[The first identification of PDV in Ireland is alarming news; thanks to Dr
Kennedy for updating ProMED-mail.
The following information is derived from the last (No. 8) UK Report on
Phocine Distemper, published by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), St
Andrews, Scotland, on 03 Oct 2002:
"Between 25 Sep and 1 Oct 2002 there were 308 reports of dead seals around
the UK, making a total of 2114 since the beginning of the outbreak. The
majority of these (1896) have been from the English coast.
In England 70 post-mortem examinations have been carried out, 35 have been
confirmed as positive for PDV (34 common, 1 grey), 5 have been confirmed as
negative for PDV, and the results from 30 post-mortems are pending.
A total of 133 dead seals have been reported from Scotland, where 10
post-mortem examinations have been carried out and one case has been
confirmed as positive for PDV.
In Wales a total of 52 dead seals have been reported, and one post-mortem
examination carried out showed no signs of PDV, although further test
results are awaited.
A total of 33 dead seals have been reported from Northern Ireland; one
post-mortem examination has been carried out that has been confirmed as
negative for PDV."
