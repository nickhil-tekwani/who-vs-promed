RVF reported in Jizan; livestock owners warned
------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture Minister Dr. Fahd Balghaneim has called on livestock
owners and breeders in the southern Jizan region to take
precautionary measures against Rift Valley Fever, after reports
that 5 animals in the region had tested positive for the deadly virus.

The minister, however, downplayed the new RVF outbreak, saying
that there was only "a limited activity of the virus" in the region. His
ministry was implementing a comprehensive plan to deal with the
situation and prevent the spread of the disease.

The Agriculture Ministry discovered 5 positive samples of the virus -
- 4 in Abu Areesh and one in Aaridah -- during periodic
examinations, the Saudi Press Agency said, quoting the minister.
"These positive results from the tests do not mean that the
situation in the region has reached epidemic proportions,"
Balghaneim said. [The correct word to use, when only animals are
involved, is "epizootic". - Mod.JW]

The RVF outbreak in Jizan 3 years ago killed more than 125
people. In April of this year [2004], the ministry lifted a 3-year-old
ban on the movement of livestock between regions hit by the virus.
The authorities agreed to lift the ban in light of a ministerial
committee report that said that the campaign to contain the disease
had been successful. "The situation is now stable, as no RVF viral
activity has been found in humans, animals, or mosquitoes,"
Balghaneim said, when the ban was lifted.

The minister urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF
virus, which is capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a
long time, and, can surface whenever it finds a hospitable
environment.

The Agriculture Ministry has set up an early warning unit to monitor
and contain infectious diseases affecting agricultural and animal
resources in certain regions, before they spread to other parts of
the Kingdom. The ministry also established a laboratory in Jizan to
carry out medical tests and check the effectiveness of insecticides.

RVF primarily affects animals, but, occasionally, causes illness and
leads to high morbidity and mortality in humans. According to the
World Health Organization, many different species of mosquitoes
are vectors for the RVF virus.

Comment Re. Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia (Jizan): suspected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The [Saudi] Ministry of Agriculture must be commended for
detecting and reporting animal cases before detection in human
subjects. This was not the case during the 2000 outbreak. I hope
that more details will soon be provided. Helpful details would include
the types of tests employed (probably ELISA), the total number of
animals tested, the species tested, and mosquitoes spp. tested. No
details could be found on the Ministry's web-site:
<http://www.agrwat.gov.sa/index.php?newlang=english>.
The spread of the virus can be evaluated only if more data are
provided.

However, the recurrence of RVF in Jizan is not surprising.
Expectations of new RVF cases, due to floods and altered ecology,
have been discussed before (see ProMED posts 20031016.2612
and 20031016.2606). There have been severe floods in Jizan, and
other parts of South Western Saudi Arabia, with loss of life,
livestock, and infrastructure, in April and August 2004.

As regards the intended surveillance, this outbreak reinforces the
fact that surveillance should be more widespread and of a
permanent nature. The possibility of potentially exposed vacation-
goers returning to other parts of the country is present, and these
people may not be covered by geographically-restricted
surveillance.

Additionally, surveillance will not be fully effective unless
awareness of the differential diagnosis of RVF is not practically
applied. Other zoonoses/diseases such as brucellosis, Q fever,
and malaria should be factored into a nationwide surveillance. This
was not the case during the 2000 outbreak [see Fagbo SF. Rift
Valley fever epidemic in Saudi Arabia: disconcerting
epidemiological defects and lack of differential diagnoses and
concordance in studies. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004 May
15;38(10):1503].

Some of the figures and lay statements from the Saudi Gazette
news wire definitely do not help to put things in perspective. For
example, to date, there has been no scientific proof to justify the
claim that the "virus had reached the Kingdom from Africa through
infected sheep and was passed on by mosquitoes." In the article,
"livestock breeders" seems to be an inaccurate translation from
the Arabic original, a government press release. I think "livestock
owners" was intended.

The recent reports of active dengue transmission in the Jeddah
area lead to worries about the presence of potential RVF
transmitting mosquitoes in this vital area. Monitoring and
surveillance in this area should also be enhanced.
