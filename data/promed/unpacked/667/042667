Oregon strawberries, an iconic crop that heralds summer and has long
been a source of state pride, caused the nation's 1st _Escherichia
coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak ever traced to the fruit, killing one woman
and sickening 16.

Health officials linked the outbreak on Monday [8 Aug 2011] to one
supplier: Jaquith Strawberry Farm in rural Washington County. The
medium-sized strawberry producer, with about 35 acres [14 ha], sold
potentially tainted fresh strawberries to buyers who in turn
distributed them to roadside stands and farmers markets in Multnomah,
Washington, Clackamas, Yamhill, and Clatsop counties.

The last of the berries was sold 1 Aug 2011, but health officials are
worried that consumers might have stored some of them in the freezer
or turned them into uncooked jam. Anyone who bought strawberries from
a stand north of Marion County and as far east as Clackamas County
should throw them out. They were sold in unmarked containers without
labels.

The outbreak has sent 4 people to the hospital, including 2 people who
suffered kidney failure, said Dr Paul Cieslak, manager of the
communicable disease program at Oregon Public Health. One of them, an
elderly woman in Washington County, died of kidney failure.

The 1st person became ill 10 Jul 2011 and the last one reported
getting sick 29 Jul 2011. That day the farm stopped production of
potentially tainted berries and they were off the market by 1 Aug
2011. _E. coli_ O157:H7 has an incubation period from 1 to 10 days, so
the state might get more reports of illnesses.

"We're likely to see a few more cases trickle in for a bit, but the
stuff is gone from the shelves," Cieslak said. Anyone who's eaten
berries from a stand more than 10 days ago has no reason to fret. "If
you haven't become sick by 10 days, you're not going to," he said.

Strawberries had never before been implicated in an _E. coli_ O157:H7
outbreak in the US, and state officials weren't sure at first what was
making people sick. The 1st case appeared to be an isolated illness.
Oregon Public Health officials put it in their files and moved on.
Then lab results of 2 more cases, a married couple in Clatsop County,
came in. Matt Laidler, a state epidemiologist, began investigating.

The couple thought a restaurant meal had poisoned them 15 Jul 2011.
They developed diarrhea a few days later. Another couple at the same
dinner also got ill. Laidler called the restaurant and interviewed
other diners.

While he was trying to unravel the source of their illness, Multnomah
and Washington counties reported other cases to the state. It quickly
became clear that Oregon had an outbreak on its hands. Epidemiologists
kicked into high gear, grilling patients on what they had eaten and
where to find a common link. Many said they bought strawberries from a
roadside stand.

Next, epidemiologists drove to homes to collect berries from freezers
for testing. They quizzed roadside stands where patients had shopped.
Those questions turned up Jaquith Strawberry Farm as the likely source
of the contamination.

No one knows for sure how the berries got contaminated. So far, none
of the fields or berries have tested positive, though lab work is
continuing. William Keene, senior epidemiologist with Oregon Public
Health, suspects the source might be deer he saw roaming through the
fields. He hauled samples of animal feces to a specialized lab outside
Seattle for testing.

[Berries have been associated with foodborne illnesses before. It is
not too surprising that O157:H7 is picking up its nasty head in the
middle of a strawberry farm. - Mod.LL
