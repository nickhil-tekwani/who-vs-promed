A diagnosis of anthrax was confirmed today in 2 individuals admitted
to hospital in Urdzhar District in East Kazakhstan Region. The first
person to contract the disease was made public at the beginning of
June [2001. The second was admitted to hospital early this week.
The deputy head of the public health service said that staff of the
public health and veterinary services have searched out people who had
been in contact with those infected. There were 84 such people, and
all these people have been under observation since early June.
The first person who contracted the disease was admitted to hospital
with anthrax with complications, while the second was admitted
suffering from the initial stage of the disease. After initial
concerns both are getting better. Physicians say that the 2 had the
skin form of anthrax.
The veterinary service has examined all the cattle in Urdzhar District
and has vaccinated and disinfected [!? them. The deputy head of the
public health service, Yuriy Koleda, said that the quarantine will be
lifted in this district on Monday (25 June 2001). At the moment, more
than 50 per cent of those people who have been under observation have
been cleared. Physicians are confident that [those under observation
have not contracted the disease.
It should be stressed that the news about the first infected
individual was announced on 2 June, but ever since, epidemiologists
have been keeping this case quiet so as to prevent panic among the
population.

[This disease is most common in southern Kazakhstan. Therefore one
must presume that the epidemiological "concern" was related to the
proximity of this outbreak to the capital Almaty and the possibility
of contaminated meat, yet again, finding its way into Kazakh urban
markets. This would also explain why the information on the extent of
livestock cases is absent from this report. As this infection is not
contagious, the 84 in contact with the 2 clinical cases would have
either participated in butchering other possibly infected carcasses,
or had purchased contaminated meat. - Mod.MHJ
