3 of the 4 bison found dead on Syncrude's Beaver Creek ranch's main pasture have tested positive for anthrax, according to a company spokesman Sat 22 Aug 2015.

The carcasses were found on the Beaver Wood Bison Ranch, a herd that's made its home on reclaimed land on the Mildred Lake oilsands site for more than 20 years. Syncrude has closed the area, where an average of about 300 bison and usually up to 5 workers [live] on the ranch.

Company spokesman Leithan Slade told the Edmonton Journal, "We recognize the possibility of more deaths due to the nature of the disease and the confirmation of these 3 cases."

[Lethbridge should now have sufficient samples for genomic analysis and we must await their findings, as well as investigations on the ground as to the possible source of this outbreak of infection.

To see a picture of a wood bison bull on this ranch, go to: https://www.flickr.com/photos/syncrudecanada/7257355120/in/photostream/. You will see how big they are. Impressive! In comparison, plains bison are pussy cats.

For a map of wood bison herds in Canada & Alaska, go to this link to the book "Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation": https://books.google.com/books?id=-xQalfqP7BcC&pg=PA1042&lpg=PA1042&dq=Beaver+Creek+Wood+Bison+Ranch&source=bl&ots=XQl4Fw_4b6&sig=5x2j5u0ucYKrd2wJsBwvTgCXvx4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCGoVChMI1-GztYbCxwIVkpSICh22GQGU#v=onepage&q=Beaver%20Creek%20Wood%20Bison%20Ranch&f=false.

In the map Fig.48.7 of "Wild Mammals of North America", infected refers to bovine TB & brucellosis, not anthrax. The Alaskan herd of 130 free-grazing wood bison was established this summer on the Yukon Flats and are doing very well, according to my informed Alaskan source. This herd includes 125 cows and calves and 5 bulls. - Mod.MHJ/JW
