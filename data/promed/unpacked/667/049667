The new coronavirus that's killed 33 people since September [2012] may have emerged almost a year earlier than the 1st known case and circulated unnoticed for that time, a new study has shown. The genetic sequence of a virus taken from a 73-year-old patient who died in Munich in March [2012], together with sequences from 4 other patients, suggests a common ancestor halfway through 2011, researchers at the University of Bonn Medical Center in Germany, wrote in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal today [17 Jun 2013; see below]. The 1st known case was in Jordan in April 2012. This finding provides another clue as researchers try to figure out where the virus came from and how it's spreading. While most cases have been identified in Saudi Arabia, they've also been detected in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the UK, according to the World Health Organisation.

"Genetic data are urgently needed to establish the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, estimate the number of independent human chains of transmission, and thus better assess the threat" the virus poses, researchers led by Christian Drosten wrote. The virus now known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, has sickened at least 58 people worldwide since September [2012], and killed 33, according to the WHO. The virus appears most closely related to one taken from a bat in the Netherlands in 2008, Andrew Rambaut, a professor molecular evolution at the University of Edinburgh, wrote on his blog. The virus may have crossed from bats to a domesticated or agricultural animal, and from there spread into humans, Rambaut wrote. The Munich patient owned camels and had taken care of a sick animal shortly before showing symptoms of disease, Drosten and colleagues wrote, citing the dead man's relatives. No animal samples could be retrieved, they said.

Coronaviruses are a family of pathogens that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, which sickened more than 8000 people and killed 774 in 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO. While the new virus is related to the one that causes SARS, it appears far less transmissible, the WHO has said.

[The paper referred to above by Christian Drosten and colleagues is entitled: "Clinical features and virological analysis of a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection," published in Lancet Infectious Disease, online 17 Jun 2013 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70154-3/abstract. The abstract reads as follows:

Background
----------
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK. We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.

Methods
-------
We report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection. We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.

Findings
--------
A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on 19 Mar 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18 [26 Mar 2013], due to septic shock. MERS-CoV was detected in 2 samples of bronchoalveolar fluid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to [1.2 million] copies per mL). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13 [21 Mar 2013]; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14 [22 Mar 2013]. Stool samples obtained on days 12 [20 Mar 2013] and 16 [24 Mar 2013] contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of 2 oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 [24 Mar 2013] were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with 4 other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Interpretation
--------------
We have provided the 1st complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.

Points from the authors' discussion: "We have outlined the chronological follow-up of a patient with MERS-CoV, in which we used quantitative virological diagnostic tests. Viral loads were highest in the lower-respiratory tract. The viral sequence from this patient clustered with sequences from nearby Qatar.

Laboratory data are crucial for diagnostic recommendations, to make projections about prognosis, and to estimate infection risks. Without quantitative laboratory data from well documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, most considerations had been made on the basis of an assumed analogy to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). However, elementary traits of the virus, such as its receptor usage and sensitivity to type I and type III interferon, differ substantially from that of the SARS coronavirus, suggesting that differences in disease patterns (such as, in organ tropism or in virus shedding) might exist. We focused on these aspects with quantitative virus testing in all relevant body compartments, including viral loads in non-respiratory samples. However, our patient -- like most other cases anecdotally reported so far -- had an underlying disease that could affect virus shedding patterns. Only analysis of a large number of patients can yield general figures about qualitative virus data.

Faecal shedding was of particular interest, because patients with SARS regularly showed high virus concentrations and prolonged virus excretion in stools that led to the use of stool samples, even for routine SARS diagnostic tests. Diarrhoea was reported in 2 descriptions of MERS-CoV clusters, and it was speculated that faecal virus shedding might have occurred. However, no laboratory data for virus in stool samples were provided. Our patient had low faecal virus concentrations that were close to the lowest detection limit on days 12 [20 Mar 2013] and 16 [24 Mar 2013] of illness. In the only other description so far, one stool sample from a patient with MERS-CoV had a negative result. Stool samples from many patients, including those with early stages of disease, should be tested to assess whether faecal sources could have a role in transmission, or whether MERS-CoV differs from SARS in this aspect.

Another important finding was that we recorded low concentrations of virus in urine samples. This finding is surprising, because early kidney failure during the course of MERS-CoV infection has been reported, and kidney cells in laboratory models are highly permissive for MERS-CoV replication. The fact that the virus was present in urine but not in the blood suggests autonomous virus replication in the kidneys, potentially without active secretion of virus into the urine. However, renal failure due to specific viral infection or immunopathogenesis is not necessarily indicated, because the patient had received several doses of potentially nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents in a setting of underlying multiple myeloma. Post-mortem examinations are urgently needed to clarify whether kidney failure in MERS-CoV infection is a primary and preventable result of viral infection, or a secondary complication of severe systemic disease.

Quantitative virus data are needed to orient diagnostics and hospital infection control measures. The recorded viral load profile, with highest RNA concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheobronchial aspirates, confirms suggestions made in another report about the preferential use of lower-respiratory-tract samples for virus diagnostic tests. Notably, the reported overall stability of detectable virus RNA in closed suction catheters indicates a straightforward and non-contagious way to collect diagnostic samples even from non-intubated patients. Oronasal swabs should not be preferentially submitted for testing, especially in patients presenting late in their disease course with substantial lower respiratory involvement.

Our data for stool, urine, and blood samples suggest a fairly low infection risk during non-respiratory care procedures. The absence of detectable virus in blood matches reports made in an earlier case of MERS-CoV infection. However, Guery and colleagues reported low semi-quantitative virus measurements in the blood of one of their patients. Moreover, initial experimental studies suggested that MERS-CoV infected vascular endothelial cells. However, quantitative data suggest a low risk from general laboratory procedures involving blood.

By contrast, the low virus concentrations and failure to isolate infectious virus from respiratory secretions should not be taken as a general indication of airway-associated infection risks. Virological monitoring of the patient started only late in the disease course, at a time when the infectiousness of the virus could already have been reduced (as suggested by the occurrence of neutralising antibodies). The fact that we could not isolate MERS-CoV could have been due to the concomitant presence of herpes simplex virus type 1, which overgrew some of the diagnostic cell cultures"

As well as establishing the earlier appearance of MERS-CoV as a human pathogen than previously recognised, this report includes a viral load profile in cases of MERS-CoV infection. The distribution of viral loads in the respiratory tract suggests lower respiratory tract samples should be taken preferentially. Low concentrations of virus in stool, urine, and blood samples suggest little virus excretion from body compartments other than the respiratory tract.

This research also illustrates the potential of whole genome analysis in epidemiology. Analysis of 5 available MERS-CoV sequences suggested that the common ancestor of all 5 viruses was midway through 2011. - Mod.CP]
