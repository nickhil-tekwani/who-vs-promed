The FBI says scientists have confirmed that a 5th letter sent recently from Spokane, Washington did indeed contain active ricin toxin. Frank Harrill, the FBI supervisory senior resident agent in Spokane, announced that test result late Friday [14 Jun 2013] in an email.

Workers at a Spokane post office found the letter on 8 Jun 2013 after it was returned as undeliverable. It had been addressed to the Central Intelligence Agency.

Harrill said the letter is similar in appearance to 4 other letters sent from Spokane last month [May 2013] that contained the deadly poison. Those were addressed to President Barack Obama, a federal judge, a Spokane post office, and the nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.

No one has been sickened. Harrill said the 5th envelope was unopened and had not leaked.

A Spokane man named Matthew Ryan Buquet faces a one-count grand jury indictment for mailing threatening communications in connection with the case.

[One has to wonder how many people are sending ricin letters. There have been reports of people in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana being arrested for sending them, yet this report says the 5th letter is similar to 4 others mailed from Spokane. So how many people are involved? How many have been arrested without much if any proof? I ask these questions because of the number of letters vs. the number of arrests.
