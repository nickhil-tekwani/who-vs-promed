California authorities on Tue 18 Aug 2015 reported that they're looking at a 2nd person with the plague in the state, and, like the other case, this one visited Yosemite National Park. The California Department of Public Health announced "a presumptive positive case of plague" involving someone from Georgia who had spent time in early August 2015 in the state.

Before feeling sick, this person visited Yosemite, the Sierra National Forest, and nearby areas. No other details were given, including who the person is, their current medical condition, and where exactly he or she stayed overnight. Nor is it certain this person contracted the plague while in California.

Still, the report suggests that 2 people recently in California have a disease best known for killing millions centuries ago, which, despite all the advances of modern science, remains a real, present-day problem. In addition to the California cases, 2 people contracted the plague this year [2015] in Colorado. Both of them, a teenager in Larimer County and the other an adult in Pueblo County, died of the disease.

News of the latest probable plague case in California comes just after Yosemite National Park shut down its Tuolumne Meadows Campground after authorities determined 2 dead squirrels had the plague. The campground will be closed from Mon 17 Aug - Fri 21 Aug 2015. It is one of 13 around Yosemite, which, with about 4 million visitors, is the 3rd most visited U.S. national park. Staff will treat the Tuolumne Meadows site with deltamethrin, a chemical that kills fleas that spread the plague, according to the park.

The 1st Yosemite campground to get the once over was Crane Flat, which is where a child -- after visiting nearby Stanislaus National Forest -- had stayed in mid-July 2015. In that case, an insecticide that contained deltamethrin was used on rodent burrows on 10-11 Aug 2015. That child is recovering from the plague, and no other members of the camping party have reported any related symptoms, according to authorities.

Until now, California hadn't had an instance of human plague since 2006, when there were 3 cases in Mono, Los Angeles and Kern counties, according to state health officer Dr. Karen Smith. There have been 42 cases in the state since 1970, of which 9 proved fatal. "Although this is a rare disease, people should protect themselves from infection by avoiding any contact with wild rodents," Smith said.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the Four Corners area of the USA, where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/diagnosis.htm: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
