Veterinarians are recommending that all horses in west Kentucky be tested for a viral disease after 4 horses in Marshall County tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) early last month [September 2015].

The Kentucky Department of Agriculture reports the 4 horses with equine infectious anemia have been humanely destroyed and buried. Seven other horses from the site remain under a 60-day quarantine.

Breathitt Veterinary Center Director Debbie Reed said the disease spread because one of the horses went many years without being tested.

"It is important for all horses to be tested at least yearly. That's the best way for us to track the disease and to stop it from spreading," Reed said.

Reed said EIA is primarily spread through insect bites but can also spread through vaccination procedures.

"One of the things that I would recommend is to make certain that they use good fly control," Reed said. "I would also caution horse owners to make sure that if they're giving their horse vaccines, that use a new needle every single time they give an injection."

According to Reed, horses within a few miles of the affected site are at risk of contracting the disease, but all horses in Western Kentucky should be tested. She emphasized that there is no need for horse owners to panic.

This is the 1st case of EIA in Kentucky since 2007.

[Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for this disease in the USA.

Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell-associated principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

Additionally, EIA can be readily transmitted iatrogenically through use of blood-contaminated syringes, needles, or surgical equipment, or by transfusion of infective blood or blood products. Infrequently, transplacental transmission can occur in infected mares that experience one or more clinical episodes during pregnancy. There is evidence, although circumstantial, from a significant outbreak of EIA in an equine hospital in Ireland of probable spread of the virus by direct or indirect transfer between horses in stalls sharing the same barn. - Mod.TG
