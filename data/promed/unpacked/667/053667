UK doctors are being told the antibiotic [cefixime] normally used to
treat gonorrhea is no longer effective because the sexually
transmitted disease is now largely resistant to it.

The Health Protection Agency [HPA] says we may be heading to a point
when the disease is incurable unless new treatments can be found. For
now, doctors must stop using the usual treatment with cefixime and
instead use 2 more powerful antibiotics. One is a pill and the other a
jab. The HPA say the change is necessary because of increasing
resistance.

Tests on samples taken from patients and grown in the laboratory
showed reduced susceptibility to the usual antibiotic cefixime in
nearly 20 percent of cases in 2010, compared with just 10 percent of
cases in 2009.

As recently as 2005, no gonorrhea bacteria with reduced susceptibility
to cefixime could be found in the UK. The bacterium that causes the
infection -- _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ -- has an unusual ability to
adapt itself and has gained resistance, or reduced susceptibility, to
a growing list of antibiotics -- first penicillin itself, then
tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, and now cefixime.

The World Health Organization recommends that the 1st-line antibiotic
used is changed when treatment failure in patients reaches 5 percent.
But for cefixime, the change is being made preemptively, owing to the
alarming rise in resistance that is emerging. Prof Cathy Ison, a
gonorrhea expert at England's HPA, said: "Our lab tests have shown a
dramatic reduction in the sensitivity of the drug we were using as the
main treatment for gonorrhea. This presents the very real threat of
untreatable gonorrhea in the future. "We were so worried by the
results we were seeing that we recommended that guidelines on the
treatment of gonorrhea were revised in May this year [2011], to
recommend a more effective drug. But this won't solve the problem, as
history tells us that resistance to this therapy will develop too. In
the absence of any new alternative treatments for when this happens,
we will face a situation where gonorrhea cannot be cured."

She said patients who refuse the jab will be offered oral antibiotics
instead. She added: "This highlights the importance of practising safe
sex, as, if new antibiotic treatments can't be found, this will be
only way of controlling this infection in the future."

After genital chlamydia, gonorrhea is the 2nd most common bacterial
sexually transmitted infection in the UK. According to HPA figures,
there were 16 145 new diagnoses of gonorrhea in 2010, a 3 percent
increase on 2009 when there were 15 606.

[Resistance of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to cefixime, reported in approximately
30 percent isolates in Japan, led to withdrawal of cefixime in Japan
for the treatment of gonorrhea; (see ProMED-mail Antibiotic
resistance, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - Japan: ceftriaxone 20110713.2114).
Reduced susceptibility to cefixime was found to be due mostly to an
altered penicillin-binding protein 2 encoded by a mosaic _penA_ gene
and was found in several different multilocus sequence types (MLST) of
_N. gonorrhoeae_, although the MLST 7363 was the predominant type. The
majority of isolates (71/96, 74 percent) in England and Wales with
decreased cefixime susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of 0.125 mg/L or more) has been found to belong to sequence
type (ST) 1407
(http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/08/16/jac.dkr332.abstract).

Ceftriaxone, an injectable 3rd generation cephalosporin, is the most
effective cephalosporin for treatment of gonorrhea, but the percentage
of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with elevated MICs to cephalosporins has
been rising (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a2.htm).
In an attempt to forestall loss of ceftriaxone for the treatment of
gonococcal disease and anticipating the emergence in the United States
of resistance to cefixime before resistance to ceftriaxone, the CDC
has recommended the routine use of the combination of 2
anti-gonococcal antibiotics, ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly plus
azithromycin 1 g orally (preferably) or doxycycline for treatment of
uncomplicated gonorrhea.

In the UK, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated anogenital
gonococcal infection in adults is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single
dose with azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose
(http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1221117908959).
Cefixime 400 mg oral as a single dose is only recommended if an
intramuscular injection is contra-indicated or refused by the patient
and is always accompanied by azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose.

gonorrhoeae_ isolates in the United States, see CDC Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 8 Jul 2011; 60(26): 873-7
