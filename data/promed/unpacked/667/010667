Updated Situation Assessment no.13
ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in Europe
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Europe
--------------------------------------------------
Situation assessment
--------------------
Germany reported an outbreak of HPAI H5N8 in breeding turkeys on 21 Mar 2020, in the Aurich region, in the north-west of the country, close to border with the Netherlands. The affected premises is a large turkey breeder farm with 10 579 birds. Of these, 130 were reported to have died from disease, and the remaining birds were culled. Following an outbreak in a backyard poultry holding on 12 Mar 2020 in Leipzig, a wild bird case, in a common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_), was reported in the same area (see map at the source URL above) on 21 Mar 2020.

Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine have reported no new outbreaks since our last update on 16 Mar 2020.

Conclusion
-----------
The OIE/FAO international reference laboratory/UK national laboratory at Weybridge [UK] has the necessary ongoing diagnostic capability for these strains of virus, whether low or high pathogenicity AI, and continually monitors changes in the virus.

Although an outbreak of HPAI H5N8 has occurred in poultry in north-western Germany near to the eastern border of the Netherlands, there are no more reports of cases in wild birds near to the UK. The H5N8-positive common buzzard was located in eastern Germany where H5N8 has recently been reported in poultry. The detection of HPAI in poultry in Germany, particularly along the north-coast so near to the Netherlands, would be of great concern to the UK were it to occur in the autumn months, when wildfowl are migrating westwards to the UK. However at this time of year in late March, with the start of the migration of wild ducks, geese, and swans away from their wintering sites in the UK to their breeding grounds in northern Europe/Russia, the risk of HPAI incursion in wild birds in the UK should be decreasing and is therefore still considered to be LOW (that is, no change at present). We are monitoring this very closely.

The overall risk for poultry in the UK remains low, but the risk of introduction to individual premises depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on the farms to prevent direct or indirect contact with wild birds. It should be noted that the virus could potentially survive on pasture in wild bird faeces for several weeks at ambient temperatures in late March, emphasising the importance of these measures. We recommend biosecurity measures should be maintained. We are keeping this under review.

[While UK retains its 'country free' status for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with no confirmed cases since June 2017, low pathogenic (thus non-notifiable) strains of the virus have been recently reported from poultry and wild birds. According to a media report dated 24 Mar 2020, a total of 16 such cases are believed to have been confirmed by authorities in Northern Ireland (12), Scotland (2), and England (1; see https://www.farminguk.com/news/16-cases-of-bird-flu-confirmed-in-uk-so-far-this-year_55277.html). The virus strain involved, in all said cases, was LPAI H6N1.

In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) detected the presence of a strain of low pathogenic avian influenza, subtype H6N1, at 12 premises.

One of those affected was Ready Egg Products, which culled all 375 000 enriched cage birds on the site involved. The low pathogenic virus is not notifiable and, as such, there is no requirement by the authorities to cull birds. However, Ready Egg took the decision unilaterally to remove the birds.

A similar strain was confirmed in Scotland -- at a site run by Glenrath Farms. A Scottish government spokesperson said there had been other cases.

"There have been 2 businesses within Scotland, where we have identified non-notifiable strains of avian influenza," he said. "These are mild strains and do not require government intervention. Precautionary restrictions were put in place as part of our routine investigations. These have now been lifted."

He added: "We would continue to encourage bird keepers to maintain high levels of bio-security and follow advice. Anyone who suspects a notifiable avian disease must report it immediately to their local animal and plant health agency."

The Scottish government said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds. It could infect people but does not do this easily.

"The risk of humans catching avian influenza is extremely low. Any bird keepers who may have concerns should immediately seek veterinary advice," he said.

Defra has confirmed just one case of low path AI in England.

"The UK retains its country free status for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with no confirmed cases since June 2017," said a spokesman. "APHA regularly respond to suspect cases of notifiable avian disease. Notifiable avian disease has been ruled out in all of these since December 2019, but there has been one case of non-notifiable avian influenza identified in England."

The spokesman said that bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.

An exceptional case of human infection by LPAI H6N1 strain was reported from Taiwan in 2013; see, including Mod.CP's comment, in 20131114.2055317. The case was addressed in a 2015 paper available a http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312815000621 (details in 20150315.3232207). - Mod.AS]
