In the last 2 weeks, 11 wild animals have been reported dead of
suspected anthrax in Namibia's eastern Caprivi Strip. The carcasses
have been burnt.
Caprivi regional governor Bernard Sibalatani said the suspected
outbreak was in the same area where the disease broke in September
2005, leaving more than 50 animals dead. Some people were
hospitalised after they got in contact and ate carcasses of animals
that had died of the disease.
Some 6 buffaloes and 5 elephants found dead in the area along the
Chobe River had anthrax symptoms. He said this area stretched from
Kasika to Masikili, close to Botswana's Chobe National Park, where
hundreds of animals died of the highly contagious disease during 2005.
Namibian veterinary authorities last week started vaccinating cattle
in the affected areas. Dr Frans Joubert, the chief veterinarian for
animal disease control in the ministry of agriculture, said although
so far no death of livestock had been reported, the vaccination had
been introduced as a precaution. Joubert said the vaccination was
currently concentrated on the affected areas as the vaccine was very
expensive. "We are hoping to get more vaccine so that we can extend
it to a larger area," he said.
Namibia imports the anthrax vaccine from Botswana and South Africa.
The deputy director of parks and wildlife management in the ministry
of environment and tourism, Sacky Namugongo, said preliminary tests
had shown that the 11 animals that died recently had succumbed from
anthrax. However, the blood had been sent to laboratories in Windhoek
for further tests, he said.
During 2005, anthrax was believed to have spread into the Caprivi
Strip from the neighbouring Chobe National Park in Botswana. This
resulted in Namibia's directorate of veterinary services imposing
restrictions on the movement of livestock from Botswana. Botswana's
department of wildlife and national parks has said "the outbreak of
anthrax in the Chobe National Park is now subsiding." To hinder the
further spread of the disease, which is also highly lethal to humans,
"a small portion" of the Chobe National Park was closed by Botswana
authorities.
In October 2005, 56 buffalo and 4 zebras also died of the disease in
eastern Caprivi. Approximately 40 cattle have died since the start of
the outbreak, and several scavengers such as jackals, hyenas and
wolves are also believed to have died.
Veterinary officials have once again appealed to people in the
affected areas not to eat the meat of animals that died of anthrax as
the disease is highly contagious. [Sic: Contaminated meat is
infectious, not contagious. A constant problem in Africa is that
villagers close to national parks will graze their animals within the
park boundaries -- whatever the authorities command. And virtually
without exception the African parks have anthrax in their wildlife on
an annual basis. - Mod.MHJ]

[Actually the animal vaccine Sterne is one of the world's cheapest,
so Joubert's claim that it is expensive merely reflects their badly
stretched budget and inability to proactively protect livestock at
high risk through routine vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
