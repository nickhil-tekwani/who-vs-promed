During the past few weeks, the GeoSentinel Surveillance and Research Network has identified 4 travelers to Bali, Indonesia with acute chikungunya. Two of the 4 had their infection confirmed by PCR, while one had a probable infection with a high IgM titer with follow-up serology showing declining IgM and rising IgG, and the 4th had a probable chikungunya infection based on testing done in Bali. All 4 traveled to Bali as tourists between March and June 2022 and had onset of symptoms either during travel or shortly after returning to their home countries in Europe (the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Spain). Although the GeoSentinel Network has seen 60 patients with confirmed or probable chikungunya after travel to Indonesia since 2000, there have not been any cases since 2020. Although there have not been any recent reports of chikungunya transmission on the island of Bali, there have been outbreaks of this disease in the past, including an outbreak from 2009 to 2011 and a more recent small outbreak in north Bali in late 2015 and 2016 (Sari K et al. Chikungunya fever outbreak identified in North Bali, Indonesia. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2017; 111: 325-7; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/trx054).

Given these recent returned travelers from Bali with chikungunya infection, we believe it is important for travel medicine specialists and primary care providers to be aware of the ongoing risk of chikungunya on this island so that they can counsel travelers to this popular tourist destination to use anti-vector personal protective measures.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Hamer for providing this information and cautionary advice for travelers to Bali, Indonesia. This is the current vacation period for tourists from North America and Europe, making this information timely for those planning to travel to Bali.

Chikungunya virus is endemic in the Indonesian archipelago, and sporadic cases are reported from various islands, including Bali. Bali is a favorite tourist destination, and visitors should be aware of the risk of chikungunya virus infection and how to avoid it. There are reports of tourists becoming infected on Bali and coming down with clinical disease on return to their home country. The arthralgia resulting from infection with this virus can be incapacitating and last for weeks, months and even years. There is no vaccine available for chikungunya virus, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
