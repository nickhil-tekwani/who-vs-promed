The New Budgerigar Disease
--------------------------
The Society is still waiting definite confirmation of what type of PMV
virus has been affecting a very small [How many? - Mod.AS] number of
Budgerigar studs.
Dr Baker has indicated that the virus is probably Type 5, which only
affects Psittacines, and unfortunately there is no known cure of this type
of PMV at the present time.
Fanciers are strongly encouraged to respect the previous advice given by Dr
Baker and not attend any bird event or mix with other fanciers. This is the
best way to isolate and avoid the spread of the virus.
A number of companies and individuals have contacted the Society with
potential cures and/or prevention remedies for the virus. The Society
is grateful for this, however, until the exact virus is known cannot
endorse or recommend any such products at the present time.
Once definite confirmation of the virus has been received [the site
referenced above] will be updated and all members advised. Meantime, thanks
to all members of the Society for their patience, support and understanding
at this time.

[So far, there is no confirmation from the investigating laboratory,
VLA-Weybridge, that PMV-5 is the causative agent. The definite etiology of
this budgerigar disease, initially recorded in the UK in November 2002, may
be established only if sufficient material from affected birds is received
in the laboratory. This might now be anticipated, in view of the following
remark by the editor of the Budgerigars Society web-site in a 20 Jun 2003
update: "Dr Baker has advised that since the membership has become more
aware of the situation, they are speaking to him more freely and sharing
information. He is also receiving more specimens, which will greatly assist
in identifying the disease, and members should continue to contact the
Office and/or Dr Baker directly to continue this trend".
In ProMED-mail posting 20030703.1639, we mentioned a previous outbreak of a
disease in budgerigars in the UK, described in a letter to The Veterinary
Record in 1993 (see: Gough et al., Veterinary Record , 31 July 1993, Vol
133 (5),p 123). Paramyxovirus type 5, the so-called Kunitachi virus, was
isolated; reportedly, the signs were vomiting, diarrhoea, and approximately
20 percent mortality over the previous 2-year period.
Recently, the Veterinary Science Division of the Scottish Agricultural
College (SAC) observed that the virus collected from the current outbreak
[in England and Scotland] was associated with much higher mortality -- over
a shorter period of time -- than the 1993 outbreak, more akin to the
outbreak in Australia described by Mustaffa-Babjee and others (see: A
pathogenic paramyxovirus from a budgerigar (_Melopsittacus undulatus_).
Avian Dis. 1974 Apr-Jun;18(2):226-30.). During the Australian outbreak, an
estimated 50 percent of 80 caged budgerigars died within a period of 2 weeks.
We are looking with great interest to further data on the nature of the
causative agent. - Mod.AS]
