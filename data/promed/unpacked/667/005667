A new outbreak of avian flu has been confirmed at a commercial unit for raising turkeys in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, announced the Directorate-General for Food and Veterinary Medicine (DGAV) on Friday [30 Sep 2022].

According to a note released by DGAV, animal disease control measures have already been implemented, such as the slaughter of affected animals.

All poultry farms within the protection zone, a radius of 3 km of the outbreak, as well as in the surveillance zone within a radius of 10 km, have already been notified and inspected.

DGAV said that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, subtype H5N1, has affected wild and domestic birds in the European Union.

The 1st outbreak of avian influenza in Portugal was detected a year ago [2021], on a domestic property in the city of Setubal, south of Lisbon. Since then, 31 outbreaks of avian influenza have been confirmed.

France reacts to spike in avian flu cases in poultry
----------------------------------------------------
Following a 2nd consecutive year of heavy losses to the poultry sector from highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], France has introduced strict biosecurity measures early for the coming season.

Rapid developments in the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) situation in France have led the agriculture ministry to raise the disease alert level from "low" to "moderate". As a result of rising mortalities in both commercial poultry and wild birds, preventative measures will be reinstated.

During the summer [2022], cases dwindled to lower levels although -- unlike in previous years -- new cases continued to be reported in France over those months. In recent weeks, deaths of wild birds have risen to "several hundred," the ministry reports, even before wild bird migrations reached their seasonal peak.

Of particular concern are the 18 confirmed outbreaks on French poultry farms since August [2022] (as of 29 Sep 2022). Affecting birds in 11 departments, these indicate the persistence of the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype in the environment, according to the ministry.

France introduces new disease control zone
------------------------------------------
Among the new control measures in place in France are a requirement to house poultry in high-risk areas. This covers wetlands, and those crossed by migration corridors, particularly for waterfowl such as ducks and geese in areas of high poultry density.

Furthermore, testing of farmed waterfowl is being ramped up in these areas.

In addition to the 3-km protection zone and 10-km surveillance zone around each outbreak, there will be additional requirements within a 10-20-km radius of an outbreak. In this area, poultry will need to be confined, regularly checked for HPAI. In addition, placement of birds will only be allowed after the premises passes a biosecurity audit.

Following confirmation of an outbreak, hunting activity in the area will be restricted.

Last but not least, a 20-km temporary control zone will be effected around any HPAI case in wildlife. Within this area, poultry must be confined, and additional HPAI testing carried out.

Since the 1st cases of HPAI in France in November of 2021, 1393 outbreaks linked to the H5N1 virus variant have been reported officially to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Directly impacted have been more than 16 million commercial poultry, as well as over 2000 backyard birds and 1000 wild birds.

Over the past 3 weeks alone, 10 farm outbreaks impacting more than 198 000 birds have been confirmed to WOAH by the French veterinary body.

Western European nations see rising HPAI cases in poultry
---------------------------------------------------------
The early start to the HPAI season is not only a concern in France.

Over the past 3 weeks, 8 new outbreaks involving a total of over 400 000 poultry have been reported to WOAH by the Netherlands.

In the German state of Lower Saxony, almost 87 000 poultry have been impacted in 4 new outbreaks.

In the United Kingdom (U.K.), 4 outbreaks during September [2022] took the total over the past 10 months to 101. Numbers of the country's poultry directly affected through mortality and preventative culling now exceeds 3 million.

Latest to test positive for the H5N1 HPAI virus in Belgium have been around 213 000 poultry at 3 farms in one East Flanders town.

In Spain, the virus was detected in 2 more flocks of laying hens totaling around 752 000 birds in early September [2022]. Affected farms were both in the province of Guadalajara in Castilla-La Mancha. These were the 1st H5N1 cases on this central Spanish autonomous region.

First HPAI outbreaks of the autumn/fall [2022] have been reported in Italy and Poland.

Having declared the previous HPAI series closed in April this year [2022], the Italian veterinary authority registered the country's 1st outbreak of the season to WOAH in September [2022]. Presence of the H5N1 virus serotype was confirmed after 10 birds died at a farm in the northwestern region of Veneto.

In Poland, there was just one month between the closure of a previous HPAI outbreak series and the detection of the 1st H5N1 cases in the central province of Lodz.

According to the nation's chief veterinary office, a spike in mortality was observed among the 1643 meat geese and 43 hens at the infected farm.

Rising cases among Europe's backyard flocks
-------------------------------------------
In its reporting system, the EC has recently introduced a separate category for HPAI outbreaks in captive birds. Covering non-commercial poultry flocks, zoos, and similar premises, this year's [2022] total stands at 121 (as of 25 Sep 2022).

With 47 so far this year [2022], France leads the region's nations for this type of outbreak, followed by the Netherlands (34). Each of the 13 other countries has no reported no more than 8 outbreaks in captive birds so far this year [2022].

Since 5 Sep 2022, Netherlands has registered cases in 13 more backyards flocks with the EC. Further outbreaks have also been recorded in captive birds in France (5), Belgium (2), and Germany and the U.K., each with one.

Over the past 3 weeks, Germany's veterinary authority has registered HPAI cases in 7 more non-commercial poultry flocks -- 4 in Schleswig-Holstein, and 3 in Lower Saxony.

Based on WOAH reports, there have also been 7 further outbreaks in the Netherlands (involving hobby flocks of pheasants), 5 more outbreaks in France, 2 with poultry traders in Belgium, and one on the island of Jersey (a self-governing dependency of the U.K. located in the English Channel).

Following a single backyard outbreak linked to the H5N1 virus variant in May [2022], Croatia has official declared the HPAI outbreak series "closed" to WOAH.

A similar declaration has been made by Moldova. During July and early August of this year [2022], 2 non-commercial flocks in the western district of Falesti were involved in HPAI outbreaks.

Last but not least, Sweden has also closed the H5N1 HPAI situation in birds other than commercial poultry. This followed 79 confirmed outbreaks that included 152 captive birds.

HPAI outbreaks continue in wild birds across Europe
---------------------------------------------------
For the year to 25 Sep 2022, a total of 2663 HPAI outbreaks in wild birds have been reported to the EC. One or more outbreaks have now been confirmed in 32 European states in 2022. For the 1st time this year, the figure includes Serbia (4 outbreaks).

Of the total, more than 40% (1131) outbreaks have been reported by Germany, followed by Netherlands (542) and France (237). Over the previous 3 weeks, totals have also increased for Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Northern Ireland.

For comparison, the EC disease system recorded a total of 2437 HPAI outbreaks in captive and wild birds in 31 European states during the whole of 2021.

Not covered by the EC system (except for Northern Ireland), the U.K. has registered a further 22 cases of HPAI in wild birds with WOAH.

For all of the outbreaks described above, tests were positive for the H5N1 serotype of the HPAI virus.

For the 1st time, the H5N5 serotype has been detected in Finland. In mid-September [2022], an eagle found dead tested positive for this virus variant, according to a WOAH notification.

Meanwhile, Norway has reported that another gull found dead was infected with the same virus serotype. It is that country's 22nd positive case.

Disease situation in Russia
---------------------------
The EC System does not monitor the HPAI situation in Russia.

In the Volga federal district in western Russia, the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype has been detected for the 2st time since early 2021.

According to a recent notification to WOAH, 5 birds tested positive for the virus at a farm in Saratov oblast in mid-August [2022]. Five of the 8000 poultry there died. In early September [2022], a backyard flock of 20 birds in the same region were found to be infected.

Furthermore, mass mortalities of almost 7000 wild water birds in Russia's Southern federal district were also linked to the H5N1 virus. The latest WOAH report indicates these include 4800 gulls, 2000 terns, and 13 Dalmatian pelicans.

https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/2021-2022-data-show-largest-avian-flu-epidemic-europe-ever


The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season is the largest observed in Europe so far. The latest data from the joint EFSA, ECDC and EU reference laboratory report show a total of 2467 outbreaks in poultry, 48 million birds culled in the affected establishments, 187 detections in captive birds, and 3573 HPAI events in wild birds. Additionally, the geographical extent of the outbreak is unprecedented, ranging from Svalbard islands to South Portugal and eastern to Ukraine, affecting 37 European countries.

Influenza viruses circulating in animal species such as pigs or birds can sporadically infect humans, causing mild to very severe disease. These viruses have the potential to severely affect public health, such as during the epidemics of avian influenza H5N1 in Egypt or H7N9 in China, or the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic caused by a virus initially spreading from pigs to humans. Despite the exceptionally large number of cases recently detected in poultry and birds as well as numerous transmission events of avian influenza to different mammal species, no human transmission has been observed in the EU/EEA in recent years. [This is incorrect-see ProMED post 20221005.8705973 which references 2 H5N1 human cases in the EU in 2022. - Mod.JH] In addition, only a small number of human infections with asymptomatic or mild disease have been reported globally. Therefore, the overall risk to the population remains at low levels, but slightly higher to people in occupations where they are directly exposed to infected birds.

New guidance released today [3 Oct 2022] by ECDC stresses the importance of occupational safety and health measures to be taken at workplaces where animal contact cannot be avoided, and enhanced at those where zoonotic influenza in animals have been identified. Employers should periodically revise their workplace risk assessment and ensure that all necessary technical, organisational, maintenance and hygiene measures are taken to prevent the infection of workers. These measures include the avoidance of aerosol and dust, proper ventilation, separation of work and personal clothing, as well as measures to prevent contamination of workers accommodation.

Public health professionals and clinicians need to be aware of the need to test for infections in patients with respiratory illnesses and recent exposure to potentially infected animals. Testing for zoonotic influenza should also be considered in patients with severe acute respiratory disease of unknown origin, as well as severely ill patients with prior animal exposure. It is of utmost importance to identify transmission events early.

Preparedness plans, as well as regular training and simulation exercises covering zoonotic influenza updates, are additional important measures. Surveillance by genomic evaluation has become indispensable, and countries with available capacities and resources should use this in the identification of emerging zoonotic influenza viruses.
