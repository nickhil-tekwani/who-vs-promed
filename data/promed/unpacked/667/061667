Two isolated cases of a type of bacterium known as _Salmonella_
[enterica_ serotype] Schwarzengrund in humans has caused a
Pennsylvania pet food manufacturer to recall a number of dry dog and
cat food brands nationwide.

Mars Inc.'s Mars Petcare is recalling cat and dog food made at its
Everson, PA facility, according to wire service reports.

While Mars Inc. maintained that no direct connection has been made
between illness in either animals or humans and its pet food product,
the possibility that 2 humans may have contracted salmonella caused
the recall, which began at the beginning of August 2008.

The latest announcement expanded the pet food brands being recalled
to include some Pedigree brands, Country Acres, Retriever, Doggy Bag,
Members Mark, Natural, Ol' Roy, Special Kitty, Paws & Claws,
Wegman's, Pet Pride, PMI Nutrition and Red Flannel.

Consumers should look for "17" as the 1st 2 digits of the 2nd line on
the Universal Price Code. Pedigree products will have "PAE" on the
bottom line. Consumers can also call 1-877-568-4463 for more information.

[The same serotype of _S._ Schwarzengrund and the same manufacturer
were involved in another situation in 2007. It is not clear whether
the same plant was involved and whether the strains are genetically
linked. The relationship between the 2 human cases and the dog food
is likewise unclear. - Mod.LL]
