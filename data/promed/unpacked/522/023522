Spotted fever is a relatively common disease in the south eastern Brazilian
states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. It is known also as Brazilian spotted
fever or, in Portuguese, febre maculosa brasileira (please note, febre, not
fiebre). It is highly similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, with only
subtle differences. The etiological agent, _Rickettsia ricketsii_, is
considered almost identical to its American counterpart.
It was first described in 1929 but underwent a still-unexplained
disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985 it has been found with
increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, but cases have been
seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo, also in the Brazilian south
east. Recently cases have been identified in the state of Santa Catarina,
in the south. The main vector tick is _Amblyomma cajennense_, but _A.
cooperii_ has been also implicated.
Vertebrate reservoirs for _A. cajennense_ are the capybara (_Hydrochaeris
hydrochaeris_), horses and sometimes dogs. Other animals can harbor _A.
cajennense_, but seem to have little or no importance in the dynamics of
disease transmission.
Cases in the state of Sao Paulo number usually from 10 to 20, with large
deviations, possibly due to ecological factors that are not well
understood. Cases occur usually in the drier season, from April and May to
September and October. See:
