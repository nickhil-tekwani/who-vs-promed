----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following review of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand is abstracted from Gideon and the Gideon e-book series (1,2). Primary references are available on request.

_Campylobacter_ infection is the most common reportable cause of bacterial diarrhea in New Zealand. In fact, the incidence of campylobacteriosis exceeds that of any other reportable disease in New Zealand, accounting for 42.5 percent of notified cases of infectious disease in 2010 (see graph (3) http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/NZ-Diarrhea.png.)

Rates of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand exceed those of the other major English-speaking countries (see graph (3) http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Campy-English.png.)

Campylobacteriosis is not reportable on a national level in the USA.

Time and place
--------------
- Highest rates are reported during late spring and early summer (November to January).
- Rates on South Island are correlated with lower socio-economic level, proportion of persons ages 25 to 44 and density of fresh food outlets.
- The Far North and much of the rural North Island report relatively low disease incidence during summer, with minimal interseasonal variation.
- A higher summer incidence and more seasonality variation is found in some North Island cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Napier) and some areas of the South Island.
- The highest summer incidence and interseasonal variation is reported in Christchurch, Dunedin, much of the South Island, Wellington, and Upper Hutt.

Graph notes
-----------
- Disease incidence varied from 1915 cases in 1984 to 15 873 in 2006.
- Decreasing disease rates after 2007 were ascribed to disease control among poultry.
- 17 fatal cases were reported during 1997 to 2011 including 5 in 2002.
- 2056 patients were hospitalized for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) often associated with campylobacteriosis) during 1988 to 2010.
- During this period, rates of GBS declined by a factor of 13 percent, following control of campylobacteriosis in poultry.
- During 1997 to 2011, between 10 outbreaks (1997) and 57 outbreaks (1999) have been registered per year.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 6.8 percent of dairy calves (_Campylobacter jejuni_, Manawatu region, 2002)
- 44.8 percent of broiler chicken carcasses (2008 publication)
- 89 percent of domestic backyard chicken flocks in Canterbury (2011 publication)
- 0.34 percent of raw milk samples (2012 publication)
- 85 percent of surface water samples in Canterbury (2009 publication)

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1987 (publication year): an outbreak (19 cases) of campylobacteriosis in Christchurch related to contamination of the water supply.
- 1990: an outbreak (44 cases) of campylobacteriosis at a camp near Christchurch.
- 1997 (publication year): an outbreak (19 cases)related to contamination of a town water supply.
- 1990: an outbreak (99 cases) of campylobacteriosis at a camp near Christchurch. Drinking water was identified as the source.
- 2005 (publication year): an outbreak (3 cases) in Christchurch was associated with consumption of pre-cooked sausages.
- 2006: an outbreak (100 000 cases estimated) was associated with contaminated chicken.

[In this outbreak, we only know that only a small number of cases have been demonstrated to be campylobacteriosis. The comment by Mod LL in Gastroenteritis - New Zealand: (Canterbury) waterborne 20120825.1261544 should be noted. "Sewage-contaminated water is likely to cause a variety of cases of gastroenteritis include viral and bacterial. Campylobacteriosis has been diagnosed in a small number of cases but other cases are likely to be present in other individuals."
