The Department of Health - Center for Health Development VI (DOH-CHD
6) revealed that ciguatoxin caused the food poisoning of 22
individuals in Brgy. Bangac, Mina, Iloilo very recently.

According to DOH-CHD6 Regional Epidemiology Center chief Dr. Glen
Alonsabe, their initial investigation based on the sample they got
revealed that the victims ate fish that had ciguatoxin in it.

According to Medterms.com, ciguatoxin is a seafood toxin that is
acquired by eating fish that have consumed toxic single-celled marine
organisms called dinoflagellates or fish that have consumed other
fish that have become toxic. When someone eats these fish, they
suffer seafood poisoning. Food poisoning from ciguatoxin is called ciguatera.

Further, ciguatera can cause gastrointestinal, neuromuscular symptoms
and respiratory problems. The gastrointestinal problems include
abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The neuromuscular
problems may include tingling around the lips, abnormal or impaired
skin sensations, hot-to-cold reversal, vertigo, lack of muscle
coordination, weakness and numbness, muscle pain, and itching. There
may be respiratory paralysis. Ciguatera symptoms strike shortly after
eating tainted fish. Symptoms may recur up to 6 months. Death is
uncommon, but is known.

It was gathered that the victims consumed a fish locally known as
"maya-maya." But Alonsabe said that "maya-maya" per se are not
poisonous during these times; most "maya-maya" are in the spawning
stage and are aggressive about eating fishes or sea grasses that have
ciguatoxin.

Alonsabe added that due to the change of climate, fishes could
accumulate ciguatoxin faster. He claimed that there is no long-term
effect to individuals who have consumed fish contaminated with
ciguatoxin. "But for those who have existing illnesses like asthma,
it could trigger asthma attacks," he added. On the other hand, for
those who suffered stroke, it could further promote motor weakness
because of the neurotoxin in it.

To avoid ciguatera, Alonsabe pushed for cooking fresh and thoroughly
cleaned fish. He also discouraged the entrails or parts of the
intestinal organs to be included in the cooking.

Meanwhile, Bureau of Fish and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) regional
director Dr. Drusila Bayate said that they would conduct their own
investigation once they get a copy of the examination from the DOH.

She also debunked the possibility of a red tide in Western Visayas.

Last Monday [14 or 21 Jun 2010?], 22 persons were rushed to the
hospital after they became ill Monday morning. The victims are
neighbors at Brgy. Bangac, Mina, Iloilo.

They claimed to have consumed a variety of fish, locally known as
"maya-maya", which they bought from an ambulant vendor, a certain
Freddie of Janiuay town, Iloilo, last Sunday [13 or 20 Jun 2010?]
morning. At around 10:00 a.m. Monday, the 3 families started
complaining of stomach pain, and some of them, especially the young
ones, were already vomiting.

The victims are not recuperating at the Western Visayas Medical
Center in Iloilo City.

FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition website:

Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the
most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and
semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and
grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on
plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or
another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large
dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4).
Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus spp._ are converted into more
potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been
caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not
deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are
exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the
fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the
viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate
can be as high as 80 to 90 percent in persons who eat affected fish, dependi!
ng on the amount of toxin in the fish.

Ciguatoxin produces toxic effects by activation of voltage-dependent
sodium channels, resulting in hyperexcitability, decreased
conduction, and prolonged refractoriness. And Ciguatoxin does not
affect, color, odor or taste of the fish.

Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of
subtropical and tropical marine finfish which have accumulated
naturally occurring toxins through their diet. The toxins are known
to originate from several dinoflagellate (algae) species that are
common to ciguatera endemic regions in the lower latitudes.

Manifestations of ciguatera in humans usually involves a combination
of gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders.
Symptoms defined within these general categories vary with the
geographic origin of toxic fish.

Clinical testing procedures are not presently available for the
diagnosis of ciguatera in humans. Diagnosis is based entirely on
symptomatology and recent dietary history. An enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) designed to detect toxic fish in field situations is under
evaluation by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)
and may provide some measure of protection to the public in the future.

Marine finfish most commonly implicated in ciguatera fish poisoning
include the groupers, barracudas, snappers, jacks, mackerel, and
triggerfish. Many other species of warm-water fishes harbor ciguatera
toxins. The occurrence of toxic fish is sporadic, and not all fish of
a given species or from a given locality will be toxic. - Mod.TG]
