Champagne drinkers in the Netherlands have been warned to check their bottles after a man died after gulping down ecstasy-spiked Moet & Chandon. 4 people took ill after drinking from a tampered GBP 365 bottle [about USD 480], Dutch health authorities said.

It came after 8 were hospitalised in Germany after receiving a 3-litre bottle at a restaurant on 13 Feb 2022 with a 52-year-old dying from the spiked booze.

The bottles were bought from the same website but authorities do not know why they were spiked or if more are in circulation.

The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority [NVWA] said: 'Recently, both in Germany and the Netherlands, a bottle of [3-litre MoÃ«t & Chandon Ice Imperial] was found to be filled with the hard drug MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine] (also known as ecstasy).

"Touching and/or drinking the contents of the bottles is life-threatening. This has led to 7 very serious illnesses and 1 death in Germany.

"According to the producer, there were 4 cases of illness in the Netherlands. In both cases, the affected bottles were purchased through a hitherto unknown website."

Manufacturer Moet Hennessy informed the NVWA about the tampered bottles this week.

It is not known how or why the drug ended up in these bottles, the authority said.

It continued: "The NVWA is therefore unable to estimate whether there are any more of these bottles containing the hazardous substance in circulation. It cannot be ruled out there are other bottles of the same brand in circulation also containing MDMA."

Dutch people buying bottles with the code LAJ7QAB6780004 on the bottom of the label were told to be careful.

MDMA has a reddish-brown colour in the liquid and solidifies over time. It also produces an anise scent that differs from champagne.

The bottles leading to the man dying in Weiden, Bavaria, also hospitalised 7 other people aged 33 to 52.

German police are continuing to investigate how the substance got in the bottle, suspecting a case of negligent homicide.

The victim who died, [HGZ], had met with 8 friends at the La Vita restaurant in Weiden, Germany when the group ordered a bottle of champagne.

One of those present had appeared as a contestant on the TV dating show Take Me Out and the group had decided to celebrate.

However, shortly after the bottle was 'opened at the table', all the guests were experiencing extreme symptoms of poisoning by having 'seizures and foaming at the mouth'.

Project manager GZ took 'a large sip of the champagne' and 'collapsed whilst foaming at the mouth', according to witness statements seen by German news website Bild.

'There were things in it normally not in champagne.' senior prosecutor Gerd Schaefer said. 'It had a toxic, a poisonous effect.'

Police reports have suggested the 3-litre bottle of champagne contained 1000 times the 'normal' dose of ecstasy and was believed to be drugged with a lethal amount of MDMA.

[Ecstasy is MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, "a synthetic drug capable of altering mood and perception (awareness of surrounding objects and conditions). It is chemically similar to both stimulants and hallucinogens, producing feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted sensory and time perception."
(https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly)

While this article does not tell us how the ecstasy got into the bottle of champagne, other ways the drug is ingested are via pills (capsules or tablets) or liquid. There is also a crystal form, the crystalized drug commonly known as 'molly'. The crystal molly is occasionally encapsulated. Molly is also mixed with other drugs such as synthetic cathinones, which are referred to as "bath salts."

MDMA, or ecstasy, has a number of effects on the body, especially on 3 key receptors of the brain, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
"- Dopamine: produces increased energy/activity and acts in the reward system to reinforce behaviors.
- Norepinephrine: increases heart rate and blood pressure, which are particularly risky for people with heart and blood vessel problems
- Serotonin: affects mood, appetite, sleep, and other functions. It also triggers hormones affecting sexual arousal and trust. The release of large amounts of serotonin likely causes the emotional closeness, elevated mood, and empathy felt by those who use MDMA.

"Other health effects include
- nausea
- muscle cramping
- involuntary teeth clenching
- blurred vision
- chills
- sweating

"MDMA's effects last about 3 to 6 hours, although many users take a 2nd dose as the effects of the 1st dose begin to fade. Over the course of the week following moderate use of the drug, a person may experience
- irritability
- impulsiveness and aggression
- depression
- sleep problems
- anxiety
- memory and attention problems
- decreased appetite
- decreased interest in and pleasure from sex"

"Adding to MDMA's risks is pills, capsules, or powders sold as ecstasy, and supposedly 'pure' molly may contain other drugs instead of or in addition to MDMA. Much of the molly seized by [law enforcement] contains additives such as cocaine, ketamine, methamphetamine, over-the-counter cough medicine, or synthetic cathinones ('bath salts'). These substances may be extremely dangerous if the person does not know what he or she is taking. They may also be dangerous when combined with MDMA. People who purposely or unknowingly combine such a mixture with other substances, such as marijuana and alcohol, may be putting themselves at even higher risk for harmful health effects."

What is mysterious about this situation is how did the ecstasy get into the bottles? How much ecstasy was in the bottles? Were the bottles not opened in the presence of the patrons? If they weren't opened, could someone in the establishments have spiked them? If they were opened in their presence, when was the drug put into the bottles? When were the bottles filled and corked? Was a tiny hole drilled into the cork and the drug added to the bottle of champagne via a needle? Or perhaps it happened at the bottling facility and there are more "spiked" bottles? Hopefully there will be a follow-up on the outcome of these champagne bottles. - Mod.TG
