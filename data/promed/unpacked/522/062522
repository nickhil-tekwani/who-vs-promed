A mono [mononucleosis or acute Epstein-Barr virus infection] outbreak has shut down the Woodland Public School district in Fairfax [Osage County, Oklahoma] until December [2014]. Classes and school activities are canceled until the 1st of next month as the district works to disinfect all its school buildings to prevent the infection from spreading.

According to reports, more than 30 people are infected so far.

The school released the following statement on its web site: "After consulting with local and county health officials, a decision was made to cancel all classes and school activities for [20 Nov, 24 Nov, and 25 Nov 2014]. The closure is due to a high infection frequency of mononucleosis in our community. During the closure, all school buildings will be thoroughly disinfected in hopes of curbing the spread of the virus."

[Acute mononucleosis (often called "mono" for short) is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV infection is very common. Most people in the U.S. have been infected with EBV; an estimated 90-95 percent of persons greater than 21 years of age have antibody to EBV (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00014974.htm). EBV infections in young children usually do not cause symptoms or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. In developed countries such as the United States, the age of 1st exposure may be delayed to older childhood and young adult age when symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (IM) are more likely to occur after an incubation period of 4 to 6 weeks. IM is characterized by fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and sometimes an enlarged liver and spleen. Symptoms usually last for 2 to 4 weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months after infection.

Symptoms of IM are usually mild and self-limited, but the EBV is shed in the throat during the illness and for up to a year after infection and persists in lymphocytes for life. EBV can reactivate without causing symptoms when it may again appear in saliva and other body fluids (http://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html and (https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/mononucleosis/fact_sheet.htm). Thus, otherwise healthy people can spread the virus to uninfected people through kissing or sharing food. Hence, mononucleosis is sometimes known as the "kissing disease." Although EBV spreads to other people primarily through saliva, EBV can possibly spread through semen during sexual contact (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12801561 and http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/195/4/469.full.pdf), and rarely following blood transfusions or organ transplantations (http://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html).

Using objects, such as a toothbrush or drinking glass, that an infected person recently used can spread EBV. The CDC notes that EBV probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist, but there is no evidence that disinfecting the objects will prevent EBV from spreading (http://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html).

Patients with IM have an elevated blood lymphocyte count and 10 percent or more atypical lymphocytosis on a peripheral blood smear; liver enzymes are also commonly elevated. However, other microorganisms (for example, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and toxoplasma) can also cause an IM-like illness. Heterophil tests are commercially available tests for diagnosis of IM caused by EBV, which are reported to be 70-92 percent sensitive and 96-100 percent specific (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928019796002450). However, these tests do not directly measure EBV antibody and usually become positive 7-10 days after onset of symptoms. When positive, they are considered reliable routine diagnostic tests, but diagnostic testing in a population with a low prevalence of the disease results in the test having a lower positive predictive value (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00014974.htm).

Serological tests for antibodies specific for EBV antigens are also available; detection of IgM antibodies to EB viral capsid antigen (VCA), high titers of IgG antibodies to VCA, presence of antibodies to the D (diffuse) component of the EBV-induced early antigen (EA) complex, and initial absence and later development of antibodies to the EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) indicate acute IM. PCR tests that detect EBV DNA are available in some laboratories.

Outbreaks of acute IM are very rarely reported. However, during a 4-week period, 9 current or recent primary EBV infections were identified among 29 staff members of an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic at an air force base hospital by EBV-specific serologic tests (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/104/5/571.abstract). More commonly, pseudo-outbreaks of IM have been reported and linked to laboratory error involving heterophil tests (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00014974.htm).

We are not told in the news report above clinical or epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreak, or how the diagnosis was confirmed in the 30 affected individuals in the Woodland Public School district in Fairfax, Oklahoma. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources concerning the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreak, and how the diagnosis of IM was confirmed in the affected individuals to be due to EBV.

Also, decontamination of the environment, as is being planned for Fairfax, Oklahoma school buildings, to prevent continued spread of EBV seems not to be indicated. The CDC suggests that prevention should be aimed at not kissing or sharing drinks, food, or personal items, like toothbrushes, with people who may be shedding EBV.

Fairfax, with a population of 1380 at the 2010 census, is a town in Osage County, Oklahoma, United States, within the Osage Indian Reservation; approximately 24 percent of the population is Native American and 28 percent of the population is below the poverty line (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax,_Oklahoma).
