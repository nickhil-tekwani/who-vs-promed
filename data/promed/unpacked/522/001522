A kitten has tested positive for rabies in the City of Rome [Oneida County]. Multiple pets and humans were exposed to the kitten and are currently receiving treatment.

Signs of rabies include animal acting strangely; animal acting mad; animal acting shy -- the animal may get unusually close; drooling or foaming from the mouth.

If you see an animal, wild or stray, with these signs, do not approach it and stay away.

A fox that attacked a Brunswick [Cumberland County] man 3 times on Thursday [13 Aug 2020] has tested positive for rabies, according to the Brunswick Police Department. The fox was euthanized by authorities on Thursday and taken to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.

The man was in the backyard of his Oak Street home about 10:41 a.m. when a rabid fox "aggressively" attacked him, according to Brunswick police Chief Scott Stewart.

He successfully fended off the fox, but it returned and attacked him 2 more times, Stewart said. Each time the man kicked the fox away.

A Brunswick police officer and animal control officer arrived and found the fox still in the man's backyard. The fox tried to attack the animal control officer and was euthanized, according to Stewart.

[3] Colorado: bat, human exp
Date: Sat 15 Aug 2020
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]

CDPHE officials agree even seemingly insignificant contact with a bat may be sufficient to transmit the rabies virus. Rabies is spread most often through contact with bat saliva, as a result of bites or from exposure to cuts on a person's skin. The bat was found outside and is not known to have entered any apartments. People who had direct contact with the bat may be unaware they were bitten and may not see bite marks.

Colorado residents can be reassured only a small percentage of bats are likely to be carrying rabies, but it is important to avoid contact with all bats. The public should contact their local animal control to collect bats for rabies testing when exposure is suspected.

Steps to control and prevent rabies:
- avoid stray and wild animals;
- vaccinate cats, dogs, ferrets, and livestock;
- do not allow pets to roam freely;
- if bitten or scratched by a pet or wild animal, immediately wash any wounds with soap and water, and contact your family doctor;
- teach children who find a bat to leave it alone and tell an adult;
- do not pick up a bat with your hands, even if you're wearing gloves; use a shovel;
- if you are bitten by a bat, suspect you've been exposed to bat saliva, or awake to find a bat in the room where you are sleeping, contact your medical provider;
- keep your doors and windows covered with intact screens; do not leave screenless doors or windows open in the evening;
- if you have bats in your house, call a professional wildlife control operator who has experience eliminating bats from homes;

The Colorado Department of [Public Health and Environment, CDPHE] reported recently the state lab determined a bat found at Hidden Lake Apartments at West 68th Avenue and Lowell Boulevard [Westminster, Adams and Jefferson counties] on 4 Aug 2020 tested positive for rabies.

Westminster Police Department received a report that a group of approximately 16 children was seen playing with the injured bat outside the apartment complex. Animal management officers submitted the bat to the state laboratory on 4 Aug 2020 for testing, and the lab confirmed it to have rabies on 6 Aug 2020. It is unclear at this time if any of the children were exposed. Public health officials advise anyone who may have handled this bat to receive immediate medical treatment. Rabies is a serious disease affecting the nervous system and is fatal if left untreated, but treatment is effective if potential exposures are discovered early.

This afternoon [15 Aug 2020], officials are working together to make contact with the individuals involved and warn residents of the presence of the rabid bat. Animal management officers are on site assisting in identifying and locating the children involved. Public health officials from Tri-County Health Department are posting flyers warning of the presence of the rabid bat around the apartment complex, and epidemiologists from CDPHE are conducting interviews to determine the extent of exposure.

"Anyone who may have handled a bat or learns their child had contact with a bat, should immediately contact their medical provider and state health department at 303-692-2700," said Dr Jennifer House, state public health veterinarian.

https://conejoscountycitizen.com/article/third-case-of-rabies-confirmed-in-domestic-livestock-in-state


The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed t a 3-month-old ram in El Paso county with neurologic signs tested positive for rabies at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment laboratory. This is the 3rd case of rabies in domestic livestock in Colorado in 2020; a bull in Pueblo county and a goat in Yuma county were diagnosed with rabies earlier this year [2020].

Rabies can spread from wild animals such as skunks, bats, raccoons, and foxes to other mammals, including domestic pets and livestock. Rabies is a deadly disease and vaccination is the single best method to protect pets and livestock. One of the greatest risks of exposure to rabies virus for people is through contact with rabid animals.

Rabies is a viral disease in mammals that infects the brain. Rabies symptoms typically fall into 2 types: "aggressive" and "dumb." Animals with aggressive rabies are combative and have unusually aggressive behavior such as excessive biting. There is also a "dumb" form of the disease in which the animal is lethargic, weak in one or more limbs, and unable to raise its head or make sounds because its throat and neck muscles are paralyzed. However, there have been cases of rabid animals that are not acting abnormally, so suspicion of rabies should not be limited to animals showing classic symptoms.

Animal vaccination regimens vary, so livestock and pet owners are urged to discuss the vaccines with their local veterinarian. Pet vaccination is also required in many counties.

A fox having bitten a man in Ellerbe last week [week of 10 Aug 2020] has tested positive for rabies, the Richmond County Health Department announced Tuesday [18 Aug 2020].

The fox was located on Spruce Street in Ellerbe. The Richmond County Sheriff's Office captured the fox on Friday [14 Aug 2020], after a man reported being bitten by it. The sheriff's office euthanized the animal, according to the Health Department.

DNA samples (usually it is the brain - Mod.TG] were sent off to the North Carolina State Lab, who informed the Health Department Tuesday afternoon [18 Aug 2020] the fox had tested positive for rabies.

Health Director Tommy Jarrell urged those in the area, especially those near Spruce Street in Ellerbe, to be "very cautious" when they encounter a strange animal. Jarrell also advised those in the area to make sure their pets over the age of 4 months old are up-to-date on their rabies vaccine, as required by state law.

One person has been exposed to a rabid raccoon in Hanahan [Berkeley County], Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed Tuesday [1 Sep 2020].

According to officials, the animal was located near Eagle Landing Boulevard and Audubon Drive. It was submitted for testing on 28 Aug 2020 and was confirmed to have rabies on the 31 Aug 2020.

The exposed party was referred to their healthcare provider.

"Keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination is the easiest way to protect you and your family from this deadly virus," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division. "Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to humans or pets. The key to prevention is to stay away from wild and stray animals and keep your pets current on their rabies vaccinations! In South Carolina, rabies is most often found in wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats, but pets are just as susceptible to the virus. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it. Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator. If you believe that you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected or possibly infected animal."

Report any exposures during normal business hours to DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston office at 843-953-0150. To report bites outside of normal business hours, call the DHEC after-hours service number at 888-847-0902.

There are some interesting and noteworthy items here. Item [4] above refers to farm animals. I have long advocated vaccinating farm animals. They are a source of exposure to human beings, and can and should be vaccinated against this disease, especially if they are large pets or show animals.

It is also interesting to note the number of exposures occurring because of a single bat. Bites by a bat may be tiny and may not hurt, therefore going unnoticed by some. Pay attention to where you are and what is flying around you. Remember if you are a spelunker some bats, especially one with rabies may crawl short distances as well.

Sadly, not one of these articles involving small animals advocated for a rabies drive. Clearly, there is an abundance of rabies in some of these areas. Yes, even in the times of COVID-19, rabies drives may be set up allowing for social and animal distancing. Encouraging owners to have their animals vaccinated is important.

Those who have been exposed are reminded to wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention. Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is needed; without it, rabies is almost always a deadly disease.

Livestock, as well as small pets, should be vaccinated against rabies. This disease can affect almost all mammals, including humans, as we encounter the wild as well as the domesticated ones. We can help protect ourselves by vaccinating both large and small animals around us.

We need to build a barrier between this disease and ourselves. One way of building it is to vaccine our animals. Most counties have some type of rabies ordinance requiring pets to be vaccinated. The wise owner will make sure pets and livestock are vaccinated.

Large animals in a rabies frenzy, especially horses and bulls, can transmit rabies but can also trample, maim, and kill people and other animals.

Once exposed, unvaccinated animals, companion animals, or our livestock will be euthanized. Exposed individuals are advised to take post exposure prophylaxis.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html). - Mod.TG]
