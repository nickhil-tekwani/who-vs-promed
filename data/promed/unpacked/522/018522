The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on Tue 7 May 2013 said that foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infections have been confirmed in cattle in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

On 2 May 2013, a village in Awat County in Aksu Prefecture reported that 16 heads of cattle showed suspected symptom of the disease, according to the MOA.

The National FMD Reference Laboratory on Tuesday [7 May 2013] confirmed the cases as type-A FMD virus.

To prevent the disease from spreading, local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where 239 heads of cattle [see comment] have been culled and safely disposed of, according to the MOA.

FMD is a contagious and sometimes fatal virus that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild species within the family Bovidae

[The outbreak above has already been reported to the OIE in follow-up report no 1 submitted today, 7 May 2013. The initial outbreak in this FMDV-A epizootic in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region started on 8 Apr 2013 in Hailipaiquke Village, Luopu, Hetian (see ProMED-mail posting 20130417.1653403).

The animal population in the village currently affected, Akesu (Suokeman, Awati), includes 63 cattle among which 16 clinical cases and 176 sheep without clinical disease. All 239 animals, comprising of 63 cattle and 176 sheep, have been destroyed (and not 239 cattle, as stated in the MOA English report above).

FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, genotype/strain SEA 97 seems to be widely spread throughout China. Since vaccination against this serotype is, reportedly, not applied (why?), the virus strain threatens to continue its spread within the mega state and its penetration into neighbouring countries, as it has already done, at least in Russia (Zabaikalsky kray, 1 Mar 2013; see ProMED-mail 20130429.1679986). - Mod.AS
