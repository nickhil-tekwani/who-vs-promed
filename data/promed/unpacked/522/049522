ANTHRAX - USA (NORTH DAKOTA)

I am informed by Dr Larry Schuler, State Veterinarian, Bismark, ND, that
they have recently confirmed five outbreaks of bovine anthrax with 25
cattle deaths in the counties of Barnes and Griggs. Two further cases are
awaiting confirmation. The initial two outbreaks were on properties
adjoining Bald Hill Creek. The new suspect cases are some four miles upstream.
They normally expect to see only one case each year. The reason for this
sudden increase is as yet unknown.
The affected and adjoining herds have been or are being vaccinated.
