Human Rabies: Indiana and California, 2006
-------------------------------------------------
Rabies is a viral infection that causes acute, progressive
encephalitis and is considered to be universally fatal. However,
during 2004, an unvaccinated Wisconsin patient received a new medical
treatment and became the first documented survivor of rabies who had
not received preexposure vaccination or postexposure prophylaxis
(PEP), suggesting the possibility of successful future interventions
(1). [The patient recovered completely; Medical College of Wisconsin.
Rabies protocol. Available at:

- Mod.CP].
This report describes two recent patients with rabies who were
treated using therapy similar to that used for the Wisconsin patient;
both treatments were unsuccessful. The report also describes the
concomitant epidemiologic investigations by the Indiana State
Department of Health (ISDH), California Department of Health Services
(CDHS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
the local public health responses in Marshall County, Indiana, and
San Joaquin and Alameda counties in California. The findings in this
report underscore the continuing need for enhanced clinical awareness
of possible rabies exposure to ensure prompt PEP and timely diagnosis
of rabies, especially if treatment is attempted.
Indiana: Case report
-------------------
On 30 Sep 2006, a girl aged 10 years had pain in her right arm, and
her parents noticed a skin eruption on her trunk and extremities. On
3 Oct [2006], she began vomiting and had increased arm pain and
occasional arm numbness. During her initial visit to her family's
primary health-care provider on 4 Oct [2006], radiographs of her arm
and clavicle were normal. After a period of 3 to 5 days after her
initial symptoms began, the patient's speech became difficult to
understand, and she had a decreased appetite, sore throat and neck
pain, and temperature of 101 deg F. She became irritable and
agitated. A rapid Group A streptococcal antigen test and slide
heterophil antibody assay were negative on 6 Oct [2006]. The patient
was admitted on 7 Oct [2006] to a community hospital, where she was
found to have difficulty swallowing secretions. Her tongue had a
whitish coating and was protruding from her mouth. Her complete blood
count and electrolytes were normal. She was prescribed
methylprednisolone for possible glossitis and fluconazole for mucosal
candidiasis.
On 8 Oct [2006], neurologic involvement became more evident, and the
attending physician arranged for transfer to a university-affiliated
tertiary-care pediatric hospital. On arrival at the pediatric
hospital, the patient was irritable, with intermittent moments of
alertness, altered mental status, and lethargy. She had slurred
speech and difficulty swallowing secretions and complained of a
drowning sensation. Because of difficulty breathing, low oxygen
saturation, and excess secretions, the patient was intubated and
placed on a mechanical ventilator. A lumbar puncture was performed,
indicating a white blood cell (WBC) count of 26 cells c/mm (normal:
0-7 cells/cmm), a red blood cell (RBC) count of 1 cell/cm (normal: 0
cells/cmm), a protein level of 28 mg/dL (normal: 15-45 mg/dL), and a
glucose level of 89 mg/dL (normal: 40-70 mg/dL). Vancomycin,
cefotaxime, and acyclovir were administered for the presumptive
diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. On the 2nd day of hospitalization,
the patient experienced episodes of lethargy, somnolence, generalized
skin flushing (associated with vancomycin administration), and hypersalivation.
Initial interviews of family members indicated that the patient
frequently was exposed to healthy-appearing household cats and dogs
but to no other animals. On the 3rd day of hospitalization, the
patient's primary-care physician told staff members at the pediatric
hospital that a babysitter suggested the patient might have sustained
an animal scratch or bite during June 2006. Family members did not
know what type of animal might have scratched her. However, in spite
of her endotracheal intubation, the patient was able to indicate that
a bat had scratched or bit her. On the same day, serum, saliva,
cerebrospinal fluid, and a skin biopsy from the nape of the neck
(nuchal sample) were sent to CDC for rabies virologic testing, and a
serum rabies virus-specific antibody test was positive. Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on saliva
and skin samples also were positive for rabies virus amplicons, and
direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of the skin biopsy was
positive for detection of rabies virus antigens. The patient had not
received a rabies vaccine or rabies PEP.
After rabies was confirmed, the Wisconsin rabies treatment protocol
(1) was initiated, including antiexcitatory and antiviral therapy
with phenobarbital, midazolam, ketamine, and amantadine with
aggressive supportive care. On the 6th day of hospitalization,
ribavirin was administered intravenously, under a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) emergency use investigational new drug protocol.
Coenzyme Q10, l-arginine, tetrahydrobiopterin, and vitamin C also
were administered in an attempt to replenish neurotransmitter
substrates. During hospitalization, the patient experienced multiple
complications, including increased intracranial pressure, bouts of
diabetes insipidus, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), reversible pancreatitis secondary to
ribavirin, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, and cerebral and
cerebellar herniation. In spite of a reduction in sedation drugs, the
patient never regained consciousness. Because of a deteriorating
clinical condition and poor prognosis, life support was withdrawn.
The patient died on 2 Nov 2006, on the 26th day of hospitalization.
Rabies virus antigen was detected in brain tissue collected postmortem.
Public health investigation.
-----------------------
The patient's mother reported that in mid-June, the girl had awakened
her during the night and said that a bird or bat had flown into her
bedroom window and bitten her. The mother saw a small mark on the
girl's arm, which the mother washed and treated with an
over-the-counter first aid treatment. The mother then went to the
girl's bedroom to see whether an animal was present. Finding none,
she assumed that the incident was a nightmare, not uncommon for the
girl. Approximately 2 to 3 days later, an older sibling took a dead
bat away from the family cat; however, the mother did not associate
this event with the previous incident and did not seek rabies PEP for
the girl. The mother later reported that at the time of the incident,
a bedroom window was probably open without a screen in place.
After genetic sequencing of amplicons obtained from the patient's
skin and saliva, on 14 Oct [2006], CDC characterized the infecting
agent as a rabies virus variant associated with the silver-haired
bat, _Lasionycteris noctivagans_. ISDH recommended rabies PEP for
persons who had been exposed to the patient's saliva, from 7 days
before onset of initial symptoms through the time of her death. A
total of 66 persons received PEP, including 7 members of the
patient's immediate family, a health-care worker at the patient's
primary-care site, 9 staff members at the 1st hospital in which she
was treated, an ambulance service worker, 17 staff members at the
pediatric hospital, and 31 persons from the patient's school and community.
California: Case report
-----------------------
On 15 Nov 2006, a boy aged 11 years had sore throat, fatigue, and
fever (101 deg F.). He was taken to his pediatrician's office on 16
Nov [2006] for a previously scheduled childhood vaccination related
to his recent immigration from the Philippines on 2 Oct 2006. He
received a diagnosis of pharyngitis and was prescribed amoxicillin;
the vaccinations were deferred. That evening, the boy was taken to a
hospital emergency department (ED) with chest tightness, dysphagia,
and insomnia. He had tachycardia (128 beats/min) and hypertension
(148/99 mmHg) but no fever; his respiratory rate and oxygen
saturation level were normal.
During the next several hours in the ED, the boy experienced
irregular lip and mouth movements, hallucinations, and agitation.
Rabies-associated signs such as aerophobia, hydrophobia, profuse
salivation, and copious oral secretions were noted, and he was
transported to a tertiary-care pediatric hospital. Because the
possibility of rabies was raised by providers at the referring
hospital, infection-control measures were initiated at the pediatric
hospital, including contact and droplet precautions.
The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
He had profuse salivation and required tracheal intubation, and he
experienced intermittent altered mental status. In the ED and
subsequently in the PICU, the patient experienced hemodynamic
instability associated with sedative administration, and he required
cardiac resuscitation. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia
with diffuse ST-T wave changes, and an echocardiogram indicated high
systemic vascular resistance and secondary cardiomyopathy. A lumbar
puncture indicated a WBC count of 8 cells/cmm, RBC count of 0
cells/cmm, a protein level of 25 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 128
mg/dL. On the basis of the patient's history, clinical signs, and
symptoms, he received ketamine and midazolam infusions on the 1st
hospital day for control of dysautonomia, as described in the
Wisconsin rabies treatment protocol (1).
Overnight, after consultation with the California Department of
Health Services (CDHS), samples were obtained for rabies diagnosis,
including corneal impressions, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and
saliva. On the 2nd hospital day, the samples were sent to CDC and the
CDHS Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory. Rabies virus antigens
were detected in the corneal impressions by DFA on 18 Nov [2006].
After receiving this result, physicians from the hospital consulted
with CDHS, CDC, and the physicians who developed the Wisconsin
protocol therapy, and intravenous ribavirin and enteral amantidine,
tetrahydrobiopterin, and coenzyme Q10 were administered.
The patient's family was asked about possible animal exposures.
Although the parents were unaware of any specific incidents, 2
siblings recalled that the patient had been bitten by a dog
approximately 2 years previously, when he was living in the
Philippines. He did not receive rabies PEP at that time.
At CDC, rabies virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in patient saliva
samples obtained on the 3rd hospital day. The gene sequences were
similar to those of a canine rabies virus variant from the
Philippines. Rabies virus antigen was detected by DFA in a nuchal
biopsy that was obtained on the 4th hospital day. Serology for
detection of rabies virus antibodies was performed daily by an
indirect immunofluorescent assay and was negative until the 12th
hospital day, when an immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:128 was
detected. The following day, the serum IgG titer increased to 1:256,
and the immunoglobulin M (IgM) titer was 1:10. Rabies virus IgG was
first detected in the cerebrospinal fluid on the 14th hospital day,
with a titer of 1:8. A repeat nuchal biopsy was performed on the 20th
hospital day to assess viral clearing; rabies virus antigen was
detected, but the staining intensity was less prominent and had a
less organized pattern than the previous biopsy.
The patient experienced multiple complications while hospitalized,
including autonomic lability, SIADH, renal insufficiency, superficial
thrombophlebitis of the left lower extremity, cerebral artery spasm,
subclinical seizures, mild pancreatic enzyme elevation attributed to
ribavirin, and progressive heart block requiring transvenous pacing.
Cerebral perfusion was monitored daily via transcranial Doppler.
Additional anticonvulsant therapy was initiated on the 18th hospital
day because of seizures. A continuous electroencephalogram (EEG)
indicated bursts of electrical brain activity followed by little
brain activity (i.e., burst-suppression pattern), and by the 21st
hospital day indicated that almost no brain activity remained.
Transcranial Doppler sonography results remained within normal limits.
On the 24th hospital day, the patient had diabetes insipidus, and the
EEG indicated almost no electrical brain activity. A cranial computed
tomography scan on the same day indicated loss of differentiation of
the grey-white boundary of the brain and diffuse cerebral edema.
Transcranial Doppler sonography indicated a high resistive index with
no diastolic flow. Midazolam infusion was discontinued. After
discussions between the family and the care team, life support was
withdrawn on 13 Dec [2006], the 27th hospital day, and the patient
died. Rabies virus antigen was detected in brain tissue collected postmortem.
Public health investigation.
-----------------------
To identify exposures to the patient and the need for rabies PEP
among identified contacts, CDHS distributed rabies assessment tools
(which vary according to exposure scenario) to the public health
department in San Joaquin County, where the patient first became ill,
and in Alameda County, the location of the pediatric hospital. All 13
members of the patient's family were identified as potentially
exposed because they had shared food and drink with the patient and
reported contact with the patient's saliva; all received PEP. None of
the 3 staff members at the primary-care physician's office or 2
emergency-transport personnel were determined to require PEP.
Health-care workers at the hospital in San Joaquin County were
interviewed, and 8 of 22 elected to begin PEP because of potential
contact with saliva. No additional interventions were deemed
necessary in San Joaquin County. At total of 24 health-care workers
were interviewed at the pediatric hospital in Alameda County. Of
those, 3 received PEP for potential exposure to saliva through mucous
membranes or uncovered breaks in the skin.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
During the period 2000 to 2006, a total of 19 of the 24 human rabies
cases reported in the United States were acquired indigenously (2).
The history of exposure to a bat given by the patient in Indiana
described in this report and the identification of a specific bat
rabies virus variant support the explanation of indigenous rabies
acquisition via bat bite. In contrast, the history of a dog bite in
the patient from California described in this report, even though the
bite occurred years before his immigration to the United States,
suggests acquisition of rabies in the Philippines; this is supported
by isolation and identification of a specific canine-associated
rabies virus variant found in the Philippines. Typical rabies
incubation periods vary from 1 to 3 months after exposure, but longer
intervals have been documented (3).
Human rabies is preventable with proper wound care and timely,
appropriate administration of human rabies immune globulin and rabies
vaccine before onset of clinical symptoms (4). PEP is recommended for
all persons who have been bitten or scratched by an animal suspected
to have rabies virus and for all persons whose mucous membranes have
been exposed to the virus.
A total of 27 health-care workers received PEP as part of the
investigations in Indiana and California. Previous reports have
described administration of PEP to contacts of humans with rabies
(5). The indications for PEP among health-care workers who care for
patients with rabies include exposure of mucous membranes or open
wounds to infectious body fluids or tissue (e.g., saliva, tears,
cerebrospinal fluid, or neurologic tissue) from the patient.
Adherence to standard infection-control precautions minimizes the
risk for health-care workers' exposure to rabies (4).
During 2004, the first documented survival of a patient who had not
received preexposure vaccination or rabies PEP occurred in a patient
from Wisconsin. Treatment for this patient included an intensive
protocol that included drug-induced coma and administration of
antiviral drugs (1). However, the benefits of any particular
experimental regimen have not been determined, and no single specific
course of therapy for rabies in humans has been demonstrated
effective after clinical signs manifest (6).
Rabies is usually a fatal illness in humans. To consider use of the
Wisconsin rabies treatment protocol, the disease must be diagnosed as
early in the course as possible, which requires enhanced clinical
awareness of the disease among health-care providers. Rabies should
be included in the differential diagnosis of any unexplained acute,
rapidly progressive viral encephalitis. Although initial signs and
symptoms of rabies are nonspecific, a history of an animal bite or
travel to a rabies-indigenous country, combined with clinical signs
such as paresthesia, hypersalivation, dysphagia, hydrophobia or
aerophobia, behavioral changes, or sudden autonomic instability,
should lead to a strong suspicion of rabies. Rapid diagnosis of
rabies virus infection can be beneficial to the treatment of the
patient and can facilitate appropriate prophylaxis for exposed
persons. In addition to current measures, other national and
international interventions are needed to raise awareness, improve
health education, expand diagnostic testing, and improve rabies
prevention, control, and treatment.

[A significant outcome of these investigations is that the Wisconsin
protocol for late treatment of rabies is not universally applicable.
Human rabies remains preventable only with proper wound care and
timely, appropriate administration of human rabies immune globulin
and rabies vaccine before onset of clinical symptoms. Furthermore in
the USA human rabies is often transmitted by species of bats, and it
is important to be aware that the incubation period following the
bite of a rabid animal may exceptionally extend for months or years. - Mod.CP]
