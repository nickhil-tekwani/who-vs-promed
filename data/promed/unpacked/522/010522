Colombia: Leishmania in urban areas
-----------------------------------
Several foci of the mosquito that transmits leishmaniasis have been
detected in major urban centers of the country: Medellin (Antioquia),
Bucaramanga , Neiva, and Sincelejo, said Ivan Dario Velez, director of the
Programa de Estudio y Control de Enfermedades Tropicales (PECET) of the
University of Antioquia. He also said that the real incidence is probably
10 times higher, as many cases are not registered.
Dr Velez pointed to the internal armed conflict as the most important
factor in the persistence of the disease. He described the prevalence of
leishmaniasis in rural communities as "alarming". Statistics from the
Colombian national health services estimate that 8500 people, of whom 2000
are soldiers, are affected each year.

[It is not clear whether the report refers to cutaneous or visceral
leishmaniasis, but most cases are probably cutaneous. It is not surprising
that the internal conflict, with the resulting breakdown of the health
infrastructure, has led to an increase in cases of leishmaniasis. Soldiers
from non-endemic areas are at high risk. - Mod.EP
