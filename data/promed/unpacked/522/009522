Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: On [1 Dec 2017], one dead black-faced spoonbill was found in Taijiang National Park (Republic of China) by the staff of the National Park and was sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) by the local Livestock Disease Control Center (LDCC). H5N6 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected and confirmed by the AHRI in the evening of [4 Dec 2017]. The LDCC disinfected the neighboring areas of the spot where the dead black-faced spoonbill was found and has completed clinical examination and sampling of all poultry farms (4 chicken farms) within 5 km [approx. 3 mi] radius of the spot. All chicken in the 4 farms are clinically healthy. They are under intensified surveillance for 3 months to detect, if any, spreading of the virus. In addition, to be further well-prepared for the increased risk of HPAI epidemics, the government have launched active surveillance over 3 categories of higher risk poultry farms: 1 poultry farms located within 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] radius around wetlands nationwide; 2 outdoor feeding duck farms; and 3 native chicken farms. According to preliminary analysis by the AHRI, the current H5N6 virus is different (identity 92.4 percent) from the H5N6 virus that was detected in February 2017, but is closely related to the one found in wild birds in Japan last November [2017]. The HA genomic sequences share about 99 percent identity with the H5N8 virus which has caused major outbreaks in Europe from late 2016 to early 2017. The NA genome is similar to the HxN6 which is widespread in wild birds in Eurasia.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses; by-products and waste; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Black-faced spoonbill / gene sequencing / 4 Dec 2017 / Positive
Black-faced spoonbill / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 3 Dec 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The H5N6 found in the current event is a new reassortant and not the same virus that was reported in February (see postings, 20170206.4820215 and 20170213.4836200).

As highlighted in the epidemiological comments, according to preliminary analysis by the AHRI, the current H5N6 virus is different (identity 92.4 percent) from the H5N6 virus that was detected in February 2017, but is closely related to the one found in wild birds in Japan last November [2017]. The HA genomic sequences share about 99 percent identity with the H5N8 virus which has caused major outbreaks in Europe from late 2016 to early 2017. The NA genome is similar to the HxN6 which is widespread in wild birds in Eurasia.

By the end of November [2017] the same situation was described by South Korea, government officials announced tests on the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu virus found in a recent outbreak in North Jeolla province is a new reassortant and not the version that has sparked earlier outbreaks in Asian countries and in some instances sickened humans. South Korea's Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA) said H5N6 genetic findings were part of an investigation into the source of an outbreak in Gochang County in North Jeolla province. Scientists analyzed viruses from 852 bird corpses and droppings from wild birds. The genomic study revealed a new H5N6 strain that resulted from a reassortment between highly pathogenic H5N8 that hit Europe especially hard last winter and a low-pathogenic H3N6 virus found occasionally in European wild birds. http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/11/h5n6-avian-flu-reassortant-found-recent-korean-outbreak. - Mod.CRD
