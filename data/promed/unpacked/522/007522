During the 1st 9 months [January-September 2015], the province of Ghardaia recorded some 363 brucellosis, across various municipalities and districts. This is the current situation of these 2 diseases, while health services are working to strengthen disease preventive measures through the promotion of hygiene and disinfection procedures, in order to eliminate disease-carrying insects, mosquito hotbeds, and the extermination of vector stray animals, such as dogs and cats.

The number of brucellosis cases contracted through direct contact with infected livestock or consumption of fresh milk and milk products, especially traditional cheese, has reached about 363 cases during the current year, compared to 277 in 2014 and 116 cases in 2013.

The increasing incidence of brucellosis is the result of the reluctance of livestock owners and consumers to adhere to basic hygienic rules, and some breeders even refuse to vaccinate their livestock, arguing that vaccination causes abortion in pregnant females, and continue to use repeatedly potentially infected males for breeding.

According to specialists, the spread of this disease is due to the sale of raw milk from cows, goats, and camels in mineral water plastic bottles. On the basis of false beliefs, [raw] milk is considered as a healthy product, naturally sterile, and can be consumed without having to boil it. This contributes to the high incidence of brucellosis as does the consumption of a traditional cheese known as "Alkmara", very much appreciated by residents of the Mzab valley.

The situation induced the population to point out the responsibility of consumer associations, municipal health control services, and local trade services, and their failure to deal with the problem. It must be recalled that each case requires at least 6 months to heal, using a treatment that costs the general treasury over 120 000 Algerian Dinar [ca. USD 1000].

[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. _B. canis_ has a disease course that is indistinguishable from _B. abortus_ infection. - Mod.LL
