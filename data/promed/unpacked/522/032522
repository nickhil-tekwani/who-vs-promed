The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has released
its final report on a 2008 salmonellosis outbreak in Alamosa that may
have sickened 1300 people and caused 1 death. The state Health
Department said the most likely cause was animal contamination to an
in-ground water storage tank. The report also noted that Alamosa does
not chlorinate its water and said that contributed to the spread of
salmonellosis. There were 442 reported cases of illness, typically
involving vomiting and diarrhea and including one death. State health
experts estimated that as many as 1300 people may have become ill in
the southern Colorado town of 8900.

The outbreak lasted 3 weeks. The 18-month investigation involved a
detailed review of the water system; historical records; and
interviews with city of Alamosa personnel, local health officials,
and responders to the outbreak. "We believe the people in Alamosa
deserve to know what happened, what was done about it, and why it
happened," said Ron Falco, Safe Drinking Water program manager in the
Water Quality Control Division at the department.

The 65-page report concluded that animal waste most likely
contaminated a concrete, in-ground water storage tank that had
several holes and cracks. A water sample collected during the
outbreak indicated that water in the tank contained bacteria.
Additional site visits conducted in 2009 found animal footprints in
the snow around the tank, and a photograph in July 2009 captured bird
feces on a corner of the tank that was repaired at the time of the
outbreak. While these observations were made in 2009, they likely are
representative of the animal activity that could have contaminated
the water supply in the tank in 2008.

"We cannot say with absolute certainty where the bacteria came from
because the actual contamination event was not directly observed, and
probably occurred at least 7 to 10 days before the outbreak was
reported," Falco acknowledged. "But after weighing all the evidence,
we believe that the most likely scenario is that contamination
entered this in-ground storage tank."

The city commissioned an inspection of the in-ground storage tank in
July 1997 by a professional tank inspection company. That inspection
report noted cracking and problems with the corners of the tank, and
recommended routine inspections for the future. It appears that the
tank continued to deteriorate into 2008. The state did not know of
the city's 1997 inspection findings, and its own inspections did not
focus on storage tanks and distribution piping.

Alamosa was granted a waiver from state requirements to disinfect its
drinking water in 1974, so water being served to the public in
Alamosa at the time of the outbreak was not chlorinated. The
investigation showed that only a small quantity of bird or animal
feces contamination may have led to the salmonella outbreak. "This
kind of outbreak may have been very difficult to prevent in a system
that did not chlorinate its water," the Health Department said in a
news release.

The state has continued its review of all public drinking water
systems with disinfection waivers, and has withdrawn 72 of them since
the Alamosa outbreak. "This incident further underscores the
long-accepted public health benefits associated with disinfecting
drinking water," said Falco.
