Dillingham -- A rabies epidemic in northern Alaska may have spread south. A
fox from New Stuyahok and another from Koliganek sent recently to a state
lab for rabies testing tested positive, said Ward Jones, a Bristol Bay Area
Health Corp. injury prevention specialist. No foxes have been picked up
with suspected rabies in Dillingham, but an aggressive fox chased children
in a city subdivision a couple of weeks ago.
Rabies is always in the population, but when the population of foxes is
large, as it is now, it can become an epidemic, Jones said. Since 1 Oct
2001, the state virology laboratory in Fairbanks has tested 166 animal
carcasses from rural villages, of which 66 have tested positive.
Microbiologists found rabies in 44 arctic foxes, 18 red foxes, and 4 dogs.
Most were from the North Slope, but animals from western and southwest
Alaska also tested positive.
So far, 15 people, mostly in villages near Barrow, have been exposed to
rabies. Humans who are exposed require 5 doses of vaccine given through
shots in the arm over 4 weeks, plus a shot of human rabies immune globulin.
Humans usually contract the disease from a bite or from saliva entering the
skin through a scratch or cut. The disease infects the central nervous
system and eventually causes death.
According to Jones, rabies in Alaska tends to spread from the north to the
south. He believes this is because rabies typically is a late-winter
disease and the onset of winter is earlier up north. Arctic foxes may also
spread more virus than other fox species. "Foxes are a concern if they're
either aggressive or absolutely too tame or obviously sick," Jones said. In
villages, suspicious foxes or dogs should be shot in the body so the head
can be sent in for testing. The carcass should be burned or heated to a
very high temperature.
In Dillingham, residents should call the police if a suspicious animal is
seen. The environmental health department at BBAHC can be reached for
questions at 888-792-2242.
