Taiwan has reported that they have are 51 confirmed imported cases of
dengue fever so far this year, more than twice the number from the same
period last year.
Officials said the 51st patient was a 46-year-old woman who became ill
after traveling to Burma and was diagnosed on Monday as having dengue fever.
Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, said compared to the 22 imported cases of dengue fever last year,
this year's number is obviously too high.
Hsu also confirmed that the patients all contracted the disease from
Southeast Asia. Thailand topped the list with 15 cases, followed by 10
cases contracted from the Philippines, and nine and seven cases from
Indonesia and Burma respectively.
