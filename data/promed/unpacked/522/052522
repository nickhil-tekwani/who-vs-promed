Following the discovery of _Brucella canis_ in purchased purebred puppies, the ministries of agriculture and health announced today [Thu 10 Oct 2019] that they call upon any person who purchased, during the last 6 months, puppies of purebred breeds to immediately bring the dog to a veterinarian.

Brucella is a type of obligate aerobic bacterium that causes brucellosis in mammals, also known, in humans, as Malta fever. The strain _Brucella canis_ infects, predominantly, dogs.

The alert announcement comes following the results of laboratory tests indicating infection in a pure-bred Pomeranian bitch, while 2 other dogs were found suspected of infection. This has led to suspecting possible additional infections in pure-bred dogs.

_Brucella canis_ has not been recorded in Israel before. In dogs, this disease is manifested by inappetence, depression and muscle pain; bitches may abort. In extremely rare cases, _B. canis_ may cause human infection, causing fever and complications.

The spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms. Dafna Yurista, informed KanIsrael that about 3 weeks ago [prior to 10 Oct 2019, namely during the 3rd week of September 2019], the owner of the aborting bitch approached a veterinary clinic in the city Kiryat Shmona.

The bitch was one of 6 kept by him, and was the 2nd to abort. Consequently, the animal was tested, and suspicion for _B. canis_ infection was raised. Consequently, and as instructed by the Regional Office of the VSAH (Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health), the owner was asked to return urgently to the clinic with all his dogs for examination. When failing to do so, the Galilee-Golan regional VSAH office, accompanied by inspectors of the Ministry's Investigation/enforcement unit (Pitzuach), entered the owner's premises with a court order. They discovered, in a rear warehouse, 6 Pomeranian dogs in good condition and without suspicion of abuse. The 6 dogs were confiscated and taken for testing for ab antibodies (serology) and for the antigen.

It was found that one bitch was infected with the bacterium and 2 others suspected; the remaining 3 were found negative. The bitches are currently being kept under quarantine pending a decision on further handling of the matter. The suspect owner was detained for interrogation on suspicion of spreading diseases in animals. His investigation revealed that the dogs had been brought to Israel several months ago. When he discovered that they were ill, his intention was to return them to the seller.

In view of the said history, the Ministries of Agriculture and Health have published an advisory that anyone who has purchased a purebred puppy of any breed during the past 6 months should bring the dog to a veterinarian for examination to exclude _B. canis_ infection.

[There are several points to be clarified in relation to the above report. In particular, the origin of the infected batch of Pomeranians, the route of their introduction into Israel, and -- in case legally introduced -- was testing for _B. canis_ in the place (country) of origin required. In addition, details of the laboratory tests establishing the identity of the pathogen and excluding the brucella species widely spread in Israel (_B. melitensis_), would be helpful.

It is not clear whether the case described above can be considered as autochthonous or, rather, an imported _B. canis_ case.

_Brucella canis_ is a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). Other _Brucella_ species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_.

_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult. One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.

Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B. canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.

_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central and South America, parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. New Zealand and Australia appear to be free of _B. canis_; however, Australia has reported some _B. suis_ infections in dogs, mainly in animals used to hunt feral pigs. The Netherlands has reported recently its 1st officially autochthonous confirmed case (20190509.6462102).
