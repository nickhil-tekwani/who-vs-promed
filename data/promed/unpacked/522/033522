[3] RAAS (Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition) and COVID-19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Few could have imagined that hypertension and its treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) would become a hot topic during the global COVID-19 pandemic. 2 factors have contributed to this: First, the observation that hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities associated with severe cases of COVID-19 in patients who have been admitted to hospital and their risk of death; /1 and second, that like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via specific binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is ubiquitously expressed in the lung and other tissues. /2 These factors have fuelled speculation that use of RAAS inhibitors, particularly ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, could lead to increased expression of ACE2 in the respiratory tract, thereby increasing the risk of both becoming infected and developing severe life-threatening complications due to COVID-19. The fact that no evidence supports any aspect of this speculation mattered little as the hypothesis gained traction, initially via social media and subsequently via the medical press. / 3 Anxiety among patients and physicians has been profound because ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are the foundation of drug treatment for hypertension, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease, and are among the most widely prescribed drugs globally. Patients have subsequently been withdrawing and substituting these treatments, prompting international cardiovascular and hypertension specialist societies to issue statements of reassurance, while acknowledging the lack of high-quality data to refute the increasing alarm.

This debate, fuelled by speculation, has at last become enriched by data, with the publication of several observational cohort studies. /4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In The Lancet, Francisco de Abajo and colleagues /4 present data from a case-population pharmacoepidemiological study of 1139 adult patients (cases) who had been admitted to hospital in Madrid, Spain, due to COVID-19 during March 2020, who were each carefully matched with 10 population controls with data from 2018, to give a total of 11 390 matched controls. 444 (39%) cases were female and the mean age was 69.1 years (SD 15.4). The main outcome measure was admission to hospital of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, comparing the current use of RAAS inhibitors with other antihypertensive drugs. The RAAS inhibitors were predominantly ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, with few individuals currently using aldosterone antagonists or renin inhibitors. Compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs, current use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.77-1.15, adjusted for potential confounding factors), or increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19 needing intensive care or leading to a fatal outcome (1.08, 0.80-1.47). These findings were uninfluenced by age, sex, or background cardiovascular risk. Moreover, excluding aldosterone antagonists and renin inhibitors and focusing only on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers made no difference to these conclusions.

Potential differences exist between ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in the context of risk associated with COVID-19. In the study by de Abajo and colleagues, no difference was found between ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers for the main outcome, which was most notable when comparing monotherapy with these drugs (adjusted OR for ACE inhibitor monotherapy was 0.83 [95% CI 0.62-1.12] and for angiotensin-receptor blocker monotherapy was 0.87 [0.60-1.28]). /4 This finding is also consistent with most other recent observational studies. /5, 6, 7 The exception among these studies was one study /8 using observational data from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America that reported possible enhanced benefit of ACE inhibitors compared with angiotensin-receptor blockers on mortality, but the authors rightly cautioned against overinterpretation of these data because of potential unmeasured confounding.

Diabetes is a common comorbidity associated with poorer outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and these patients often have hypertension and are prescribed RAAS inhibitors. Thus, an interesting and potentially clinically important finding in the study by de Abajo and colleagues is that the use of RAAS inhibitors compared with other antihypertensive drugs almost halved the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who had diabetes (adjusted OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.80). /4 Other studies have also suggested that use of RAAS inhibitors might confer protective effects against complications and death in patients with COVID-19 versus other antihypertensive drugs, although these studies were not restricted to patients with diabetes. /9,10

A notable feature of the emerging data is the excess risk of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care units, and fatal outcomes in patients who are given any kind of antihypertensive drug versus non-users. /4 Although this potential association of antihypertensive treatment and increased risk of severe COVID-19 has caused alarm, generally people are accepting that it most likely reflects the use of these drugs for patients who are older and who invariably have multiple comorbidities, and despite rigorous attempts to adjust for comorbidities in observational studies, fully adjusting for confounding by indication is not possible.

The limitations of the study by de Abajo and colleagues /4 apply to all of the observational studies we have discussed here, which are not randomised controlled trials, and despite multiple statistical adjustments are invariably subject to confounding, either unmeasured or unknown. Controlling for whether patients were compliant with their RAAS inhibitor treatment, either before or after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, is also not possible. Nevertheless, the aforementioned studies, /4,5.6,7,8,9,10 each with its own important nuances, all reached similar overarching conclusions from which a reasonable interpretation is that no evidence exists to support the speculation that RAAS inhibitors increase the risk of COVID-19. Nor does evidence exist to suggest that, once infected, the risk of admission to hospital due to COVID-19, progression to more severe complications, or death is increased with RAAS inhibitor use compared with treatment with other antihypertensive drugs. Findings from some studies even suggest that treatment with RAAS inhibitors might reduce risk of severe complications or death due to COVID-19, /9,10 but this potentially important finding needs confirmation in randomised controlled trials.

For the moment, we should applaud the remarkable achievement of investigators globally, in the face of considerable adversity, for rapidly generating scientific data that should diminish the speculation about the safety of RAAS inhibitors during this global COVID-19 pandemic and provide a degree of reassurance to patients and their doctors.

Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital: a case-population study. Lancet. 2020; doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31030-8

"Summary
"Background
"Concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19; however, epidemiological evidence is lacking. We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19.

"Methods
"In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between [1 Mar 2020] and [24 Mar 2020]. As a reference group, we randomly sampled 10 patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (that is, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigacion Farmacoepidemiologica en Atencion Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (that is, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437.

"Findings
"We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39.0%) were female and the mean age was 69.1 years (SD 15.4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.62-2.41) and risk factors (1.46, 1.23-1.73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0.94 (95% CI 0.77-1.15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0.80, 0.64-1.00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1.10, 0.88-1.37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.

"Interpretation
"RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19."

[The commentary above does a good review of the increasing literature on the use of RAAS's, showing in each of the studies the end point of predisposing to more serious disease is not the outcome. The question that remains to be answered is why hypertension is the leading co-morbidity seen among ICU admitted cases of severe COVID-19 disease and the leading co-morbidity seen in fatal cases. Is it a confounding variable? Are there other medications (antihypertensives) which may predispose for more severe disease, now that the RAAS pharmacopeia has been "cleared"? - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 14 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Lesotho reported its 1st case of COVID-19

- WHO has published an interim guidance document on Laboratory biosafety for testing of clinical specimens of patients that meet the case definition of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-biosafety-guidance-related-to-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)).

- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros in his media briefing yesterday [13 May 2020] (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-05-2020-people-living-longer-and-healthier-lives-but-covid-19-threatens-to-throw-progress-off-track), highlighted the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary healthcare, as the best defense against outbreaks like COVID-19. The World Health Statistics published by WHO, show that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives overall with the biggest gains in low-income countries. However, the report also shows that the rate of progress is too slow to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and will be further thrown off track by COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2020/en/).

- WHO announced the launch of the WHO Academy and the WHO info mobile applications. The WHO Academy app is designed to support health workers during COVID-19 while the WHO Info app will provide the general public with real-time mobile access to the latest news and developments (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-05-2020-launch-of-the-who-academy-and-the-who-info-mobile-applications).

- In the light of overcrowding in many places of detention, which undermines hygiene, health, safety, and human dignity, UNODC, WHO, UNAIDS, and OHCHR released a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons and other closed settings to urgently draw the attention of political leaders to the heightened vulnerability of prisoners and other people deprived of liberty due to COVID-19 pandemic. (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/13-05-2020-unodc-who-unaids-and-ohchr-joint-statement-on-covid-19-in-prisons-and-other-closed-settings).

Subject in focus: cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Like other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus with an outer lipid envelope, which makes it more susceptible to disinfectants compared to nonenveloped viruses such as rotavirus, norovirus, and poliovirus. /1 The virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through close contact and respiratory droplets, with possible airborne transmission in settings where procedures that can generate aerosol are performed. /2 Although fomites and contaminated surfaces have yet to be conclusively linked to transmission of SARS-CoV-2, demonstration of surface contamination in healthcare settings /3 and experiences with surface contamination linked to subsequent infection transmission in other coronaviruses, have informed the development of cleaning and disinfection recommendations to mitigate the potential of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare /3 and non-healthcare settings. /4

In healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include the surfaces of furniture and other fixed items (such as tables, chairs, walls, light switches, computer peripherals) as well as the surfaces of non-critical medical equipment (equipment that only comes into contact with intact skin, such as blood pressure cuffs, wheelchairs, incubators). /6 These surfaces should be frequently cleaned with water and detergent and followed by application of a disinfectant. Among the most common disinfectants used which have been demonstrated to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 are: ethanol 70-90%; chlorine-based products (such as hypochlorite) at 0.1% (1000 ppm) for general environmental disinfection or 0.5% (5000 ppm) for blood and body fluids large spills; or hydrogen peroxide greater than 0.5%. /5- 6 The minimal time recommended of exposition to the surface for these disinfectants is one minute1 or according to the manufacturer instructions.

In non-healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include furniture and other fixed items, such as counter tops, stairway rails, as well as floors and walls. Disinfectants should be applied to high touch surfaces to reduce potential SARS-CoV-2 virus contamination in community settings where the risk of contamination is unknown (such as gyms, offices, restaurants, accommodation sector) as well as in households and non-traditional facilities where individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease are accommodated.

In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to environmental surfaces via spraying or fogging (also known as fumigation or misting) is not recommended. Spraying environmental surfaces in both health care and non-healthcare settings (such as patient households) with disinfectants will not be effective and may pose harm to individuals. /7-10 If disinfectants are to be applied, manual surface cleaning with detergent and water using applied friction (such as brushing, scrubbing) must be performed first to ensure physical removal of organic materials, followed by use of a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant.

Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces (such as streets, sidewalks, walkways, or marketplaces), is not recommended to remove or inactivate SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens. Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Moreover, disinfectants are inactivated by dirt and debris, and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces. Even in the absence of organic matter, chemical spraying is unlikely to adequately cover all surfaces for the duration of the required contact time to inactivate pathogens.

Spraying individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person's ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. /9, 11

The role of fomites as a mode of transmission of COVID-19 in general, and the necessity of disinfection practices to mitigate transmission of the virus outside of healthcare environments is currently unknown. However, infection prevention and control principles designed to mitigate the spread of pathogens in health settings, including cleaning and disinfection practices, have been widely adapted in current guidance to be applied in non-healthcare setting environments. /12-21 In all settings, including settings where resource limitations may not permit cleaning and disinfection to be performed regularly, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching of the face should be considered the primary prevention approach to mitigate the suspected mode of transmission associated with surface contamination. /22

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO is now 215 with the addition of Lesotho. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 37 989 new cases (48.7% of the global newly reported cases), and 2617 deaths (39.4%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 47.5% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 24.4%, Chile 7.0%, Peru 8.5%, Chile 7.0%, and Mexico 5.3%. Noteworthy is that effective today (14 May 2020), the Americas region has reported the highest number of cumulative cases (1 819 553), moving the European Region (1 801 688) to 2nd highest cumulative cases.

The European region reported 21 352 new cases (27.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 3614 deaths (54.4%). Russia reported 46.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 15.2%, Turkey 7.7%, Italy 4.2%, Germany 4.4%, and Spain 3.1%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9535 new cases (12.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 130 deaths (2.0%). Iran reported 20.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 20.0%, Qatar 14.6%, Pakistan 10.9%, Kuwait 7.9%, and the United Arab Emirates 7.7%.

The African region reported 2323 new cases (3.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 67 deaths (1.0%). South Africa reported 31.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 12.1%, Algeria 8.0%, Nigeria 7.9%, Gabon 6.1%, Cameroon 4.8%, and Senegal 4.7%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1081 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 44 deaths (0.7%). Singapore reported 62.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 24.8% and Japan 5.1%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 66.0%, Japan 13.5%, Malaysia at 9.1, South Korea at 7.1%, and Australia at 2.7%.

The South East Asia region reported 5685 new cases (7.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 175 deaths (2.6%). India reported 65.5% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 20.4% and Indonesia 12.1%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 59.2% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 35.1%, the Maldives 2.6%, Nepal 1.5%, and Sri Lanka 1.3%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 14 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
