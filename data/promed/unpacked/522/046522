[With the addition of these 15 newly confirmed cases including 5 deaths, the number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected cases in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is 511 including 157 deaths. Four of the 15 newly confirmed cases had been admitted to a hospital for underlying co-morbidities prior to the onset of MERS-CoV consistent symptoms suggesting transmission of the MERS-CoV had occurred in the hospital setting. Three of the newly confirmed infections are reported as asymptomatic. Of note, one of the newly confirmed cases in Madina had been in home isolation, presumably as a MERS-CoV negative contact of a known MERS-CoV infected individual who then tested positive for the MERS-CoV. Of note: 7 of the 15 newly reported MERS-CoV infected individuals were in between 25 and 44 years of age; one wonders how many of these individuals might be healthcare workers in the hospital system.

On 13 May [2014], the RIVM and the Erasmus MC [identified] the 1st infection with the MERS coronavirus in a Dutch patient. He became infected during a visit to Saudi Arabia and is currently hospitalized in the Medical Center Haaglanden Westeinde. The patient is being cared for in strict isolation. His health condition is stable. All the people who have had contact with the patient are identified and are being [traced]. These people's health condition is being monitored.

MERS infections can cause severe respiratory symptoms, especially in people with other health problems. Diarrhea symptoms may also occur. Human-to-human transmission of the MERS coronavirus is rare, except in close contact with patients and through unprotected care of seriously ill people.

Since 2012, there has been an outbreak of a new MERS coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome) in the Middle East. Meanwhile, more than 500 patients in the Middle East have been reported to the World Health Organization. In April and May 2014, there has been a sharp increase in the number of reports in the Middle East. The vast majority of reports come from this region (especially Saudi Arabia, as well as Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Yemen and United Arab Emirates). Since last year [2013], there have also been some patients diagnosed in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Greece, Philippines, Malaysia, Kuwait, Tunisia, Egypt, Germany and the United States. These were travelers who were [infected] in the Middle East. It is not unexpected that there is now a patient in the Netherlands. MERS coronavirus is, therefore, a notifiable infectious disease.

[As mentioned above, this is the 1st imported case of MERS-CoV infection identified in the Netherlands. Details on this case are still pending, including age, location visited within Saudi Arabia, possible exposures in Saudi Arabia (healthcare contact, animal/camel contact, animal product contact, contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals), and the purpose of the trip (worked in Saudi Arabia, visited family or friends). More information addressing the epidemiology of this case would be greatly appreciated.

Two staff members at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital have tested negative for the MERS virus after caring for a man with a confirmed case of the virus, Orlando Health officials said Wednesday [14 May 2014].

The 2 negative tests include one staff member who was hospitalized Monday [12 May 2014] after developing flu-like symptoms that are also attributed to the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, which was confirmed on Monday [12 May 2014] in a health care worker from Saudi Arabia who was visiting Orlando.

Health officials are still awaiting test results on 18 other health care workers from Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and Orlando Regional Medical Center who were in contact with the patient. Those staff members were given a 14-day paid leave from work as a precaution.

The patient who tested positive for the MERS virus remains in isolation at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. Doctors said he has been fever-free for 24 hours and is doing well.

"If we actually identify that some of the close contacts have tested positive for the MERS virus, we would go to the next phase for the community contact, and we would actually test them, even if they aren't running any symptoms," said Dr. Kevin Sherin from the Florida Department of Health.

The MERS patient is a health care worker from Saudi Arabia and was visiting relatives in Orlando.

Officials said he began to experience symptoms of muscle aches on his initial flight on [30 Apr 2014] from Saudi Arabia to London and began to experience a fever and chills on subsequent flights to Boston, then to Atlanta, and finally into Orlando on [1 May 2014].

After accompanying another person for an unrelated appointment to Orlando Regional Medical Center [5 May 2014], the man then went to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital 3 days later. The MERS virus was confirmed on Monday, [12 May 2014].

15 staff members at Dr. Phillips and 5 at ORMC were tested and sent home for 14 days as a precaution. Officials have not said where the 2 complaining of flu-like symptoms worked.

At a news conference on Tuesday [13 May 2014], Dr. Antonio Crespo said the patient was doing "very well." He was experiencing a low-grade fever of 102 F and has a minimal cough.

Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be posting fliers at 20 U.S. airports warning travelers about MERS.

The CDC isn't recommending any changes for travel plans. However, officials are informing travelers heading to the Arabian Peninsula to avoid sick people and wash their hands often.

Medical experts said there isn't a threat to the public at this time, but residents need to remain cautious.

1st Confirmed Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection in the United States, Updated Information on the Epidemiology of MERS-CoV Infection, and Guidance for the Public, Clinicians, and Public Health Authorities - May 2014

[For the full list of 66 authors, see source URL.]

Since mid-March 2014, the frequency with which cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported has increased, with the majority of recent cases reported from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition, the frequency with which travel-associated MERS cases have been reported and the number of countries that have reported them to the World Health Organization (WHO) have also increased. The 1st case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler recently returned from Saudi Arabia, was reported to CDC by the Indiana State Department of Health on [1 May 2014] and confirmed by CDC on [2 May 2014]. A 2nd imported case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler from Saudi Arabia having no connection with the 1st case, was reported to CDC by the Florida Department of Health on [11 May 2014]. The purpose of this report is to alert clinicians, health officials, and others to increase awareness of the need to consider MERS-CoV infection in persons who have recently traveled from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula*. This report summarizes recent epidemiologic information, provides preliminary descriptions of the cases reported from Indiana and Florida, and updates CDC guidance about patient evaluation, home care and isolation, specimen collection, and travel as of [13 May 2014].

MERS-CoV was 1st reported to cause human infection in September 2012. Since mid-March 2014, the frequency with which cases have been reported has increased**. As of 12 May 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed*** cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by WHO [see Figure 1: Number of confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (145 fatal and 391 nonfatal) reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of 12 May 2014 by month of illness onset worldwide, 2012-2014, available at source URL]. This includes 145 deaths. All reported cases have been directly or indirectly linked through travel or residence to 7 countries: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, and Yemen [see Figure 2: Confirmed cases (and deaths) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection (N=536) reported by the World Health Organization as of [12 May 2014], and history of travel from, in, or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days of illness onset worldwide, 2012-2014, available at source URL]. Public health investigations are ongoing to determine the reason for the increase in cases.

The median age of persons with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection is 49 years (range=less than 1-94 years); 346 (65 percent) cases are in males, and 104 (19 percent) occurred in health-care workers. Although 62 percent of cases involved severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, 32 (5 percent) occurred in persons who had mild symptoms or illness not requiring hospitalization, and 110 (21 percent) were asymptomatic, generally as a result of contact investigations.

Countries outside the Arabian Peninsula with travel-associated MERS cases reported by WHO include the United Kingdom (UK), France, Tunisia, and Italy, where cases were reported in 2013(1-4), and Malaysia, Greece, Egypt, and the United States, where cases have been reported in 2014 (Figure 2) [available at source URL]. The travel-associated MERS cases reported by countries outside the Arabian Peninsula in 2014 occurred in persons with residence in or travel to Saudi Arabia. In addition, cases have occurred among travelers from Saudi Arabia to UAE and Jordan. Malaysia reported a case on [17 Apr 2014] in a man aged 54 years with underlying health problems. He had traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, visited a camel farm and consumed camel milk during his trip. He sought treatment in Malaysia on [7 Apr 2014] and died on [13 Apr 2014]. Greece reported a case on [18 Apr 2014], in a male Greek citizen aged 69 years residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who traveled to Greece on [17 Apr 2014]. His source of infection remains unclear. During the 14 days before onset of illness, he had extensive contact with a family member who was hospitalized in Jeddah but not with MERS-CoV infection. Egypt reported a case in a male aged 27 years who had been living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the past 4 years and returned to Egypt on [25 Apr 2014]. He had contact with 2 persons with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. The UAE Ministry of Health reported a case on [30 Mar 2014] in a male aged 64 years who had traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he visited a camel farm. A case of MERS was reported by Jordan on [22 Apr 2014] in a male aged 25 years from Saudi Arabia. He had a family member in Saudi Arabia who was previously reported by WHO as having MERS.

The 1st case of MERS in the United States was reported to CDC by the Indiana State Department of Health on [1 May 2014] and confirmed by CDC on [2 May 2014]. The case involved a male U.S. citizen aged 60 years or older who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia in a hospital in which patients with MERS had received care. He began feeling unwell on or around [18 Apr 2014] with a low-grade fever and myalgia without any respiratory symptoms. He traveled by commercial airlines from Saudi Arabia to Chicago, Illinois on [24 Apr 2014], and then traveled by bus from Chicago to his destination in Indiana. On [27 Apr 2014], he developed shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, increasing fever, and rhinorrhea. On [28 Apr 2014], he was evaluated at and admitted to a hospital in Indiana. A chest radiograph revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate; chest computed tomography scan revealed bilateral lung infiltrates. The patient required supplemental oxygen,but did not require mechanical ventilation. On [9 May 2014], the patient was no longer symptomatic, and health officials verified that the patient had tested negative for MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 2 sets of sputum, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, and serum specimens collected on different days; the patient was considered to be fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital.

Before implementation of contact and airborne infection control precautions at the hospital in Indiana, 53 health-care personnel (HCP) had contact with the patient. Household contacts (who were assumed to be exposed), a community contact (a business associate in Cook County, Illinois, with whom the patient had extended face-to-face contact on [25 Apr 2014]), and exposed HCP were asked to monitor themselves twice daily for symptoms and fever for 14 days after exposure, the period in which symptoms of MERS would be expected to appear. Household contacts and exposed HCP were recommended to wear a mask when outside of the house or in contact with other household members while on voluntary home quarantine**** for 14 days after contact. HCP who had unprotected close contact with the patient and were asymptomatic returned to work 14 days after the last exposure and confirmed negative laboratory results for MERS-CoV. Nasopharyngeal and serum specimens collected from all household, community, and HCP contacts have tested negative by PCR for MERS-CoV.

The Indiana case involved a person who traveled on commercial flights between Saudi Arabia and the UK and between the UK and Chicago while he was symptomatic and potentially contagious. He then traveled for 70 minutes by bus from Chicago to his final destination in Indiana. For the 2 flights, the UK has jurisdiction for the flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK, and the United States has jurisdiction for the flight from the UK to Chicago. Because little is known about the modes of transmission of MERS-CoV, CDC included all passengers and crew aboard the flight from the UK to Chicago and the bus in a contact investigation. 80 airline passengers (including 2 who were also on the Saudi Arabia to UK flight) and 12 crew members were identified for follow-up from the flight between the UK and Chicago. As of [12 May 2014], a total of 58 airline passengers on the flight from the UK to Chicago have been contacted by CDC or state and local health departments; health authorities in other countries were notified about the other 22 passengers. Eight passengers on the Saudi Arabia to UK flight who later traveled to the United States have also been contacted. Four airline passengers on the flight from the UK to Chicago reported mild respiratory symptoms. Although these symptoms did not meet the case definition for a patient under investigation for MERS, to be especially cautious given the limited data on transmission of MERS-CoV, CDC and state health departments closely monitored the status of these 4 passengers for the duration of the 14-day incubation period. All airline crew were contacted and reported no symptoms. Nine passengers and a driver were on the bus that the affected person traveled on from Chicago to his final destination in Indiana. Five bus passengers and the bus driver were contacted and reported no illness. All airline and bus contacts were asked to monitor their body temperature twice daily and to report any fever (temperature of 100 F [37.8 C] or higher) or respiratory symptoms to their state or local health department until 14 days after the flight or bus trip.

A 2nd imported case of MERS in the United States, identified in a traveler, was reported to CDC by the Florida Department of Health on [11 May 2014] and confirmed by CDC on [11 May 2014]. The traveler, a health-care provider 40 years or older who resides and works in Saudi Arabia, is not linked to the case confirmed in Indiana. On [1 May 2014], the patient traveled by commercial airline from Saudi Arabia to the UK; the UK to Boston, Massachusetts; then Boston to Atlanta, Georgia; and then Atlanta to Orlando, Florida. The patient began feeling unwell during the flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK and continued to feel unwell on subsequent flights, with symptoms including myalgia, fever, chills, and a slight cough. He continued to have intermittent fevers, nausea, and severe myalgia during his time in Orlando, and on [9 May 2014], he went to a hospital emergency department. He was admitted to that hospital the same day to be evaluated for an acute viral syndrome. At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile. Public health and hospital officials have implemented infection control precautions (standard, contact, and airborne) at the hospital and are interviewing HCP who had close contact***** with the patient as well as household contacts to obtain detailed information on their exposures and monitor their health. CDC and state and local health departments are conducting airline contact tracing to identify and notify U.S. travelers who might have been exposed to this infected traveler.

CDC used BioMosaic****** to analyze International Air Transport Association travel volume data for May and June 2014 from Saudi Arabia and UAE to North America for 2010-2012. This analysis showed that Cook County, which includes Chicago O'Hare airport, historically has the 4th highest volume of arriving travelers from Saudi Arabia and UAE for the months of May and June [see Figure 3: Points of entry and volume of travelers on flights to the United States and Canada from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - May-June 2014, available at source URL]. Five cities in the United States accounted for 75 percent of arrivals from Saudi Arabia and UAE; approximately 100 000 travelers are estimated to arrive in these 5 cities from Saudi Arabia and UAE in May and June 2014.

MMWR Discussion
This report describes the 1st 2 cases of MERS identified in the United States. These cases highlight the critical role that health-care providers play in considering a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in persons who develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Recent travelers might seek medical care distant from cities served by international air connections, and all HCP need to be vigilant, including those outside of cities with the highest number of arriving travelers from the Arabian Peninsula. Health-care providers and health departments throughout the United States should be prepared to consider, detect, and manage cases of MERS.

Recommendations might change as additional data become available. Guidance on evaluation of patients for MERS, infection control, interim home care and isolation, and collection and testing of clinical specimens for MERS-CoV infection is summarized below and is available on CDC's MERS website (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html). No specific treatment for MERS-CoV infection is currently available. WHO has posted guidance for clinical management of MERS patients at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimGuidance_ClinicalManagement_NovelCoronavirus_11Feb13u.pdf?ua=1.

Evaluating patients
CDC's Interim Guidance for Health Professionals was updated on [9 May 2014] to include additional guidance on evaluation of patients and close contacts. Health-care professionals should evaluate for MERS-CoV infection in patients in the United States who meet the following criteria: A) fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiologic evidence) and either 1) a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset or 2) close contact with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, or 3) is a member of a cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) of unknown etiology in which MERS is being evaluated in consultation with a state or local health department; or B) close contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS while the affected person was ill. Additional guidance for health-care providers is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html. Health-care providers should immediately report any person being evaluated for MERS-CoV infection who meets the criteria of a patient under investigation to their state or local health department. States will then notify CDC. Case definitions are available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html. Health-care providers should contact their state or local health department if they have any questions.

Infection control
HCP should adhere to recommended infection-control measures, including standard, contact, and airborne precautions (including eye protection), while managing symptomatic contacts and patients who are patients under investigation or who have probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infections. Additional CDC guidance on MERS-CoV infection control in health-care settings is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/infection-prevention-control.html.

Interim home care and isolation
Ill persons who are being evaluated for MERS and do not require hospitalization for medical reasons may be cared for and isolated in their home. Health-care providers should contact their state or local health department to determine whether home isolation or additional measures are indicated because recommendations might be modified as more data become available. Isolation is defined as the separation or restriction of activities of an ill person with a contagious disease from those who are well. Additional information on home care and isolation guidance is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/hcp/home-care.html.

Collecting and testing clinical specimens for MERS-CoV infection
To increase the likelihood of detecting MERS-CoV infection, CDC recommends collecting multiple specimens from different sites at different times after symptom onset. For suspected MERS cases, health-care providers should collect the following specimens for submission to CDC or the appropriate public health laboratory: nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab (which can be placed in the same tube of viral transport medium as nasopharyngeal swabs), sputum, serum, and stool/rectal swab. In addition to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, collection of lower respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) is recommended because MERS-CoV infection has been confirmed in sputum of patients who tested negative by PCR for MERS-CoV in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens. Personnel collecting specimens should wear recommended personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, gowns, eye protection, and respiratory protection), and recommended infection control precautions should be used when collecting specimens. Health-care providers should notify their state or local health departments if they suspect MERS-CoV infection in a person. State or local health departments should notify CDC of patients under investigation and any positive MERS-CoV test. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html.

Travel guidance
In response to the recent increase in cases of MERS in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula, CDC updated its advice for travelers. CDC's travel notice has been upgraded to a Level 2 Alert*******, which includes enhanced precautions for travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula who plan to work in health-care settings. These travelers should review CDC's recommendations for infection control for confirmed or suspected MERS patients before they depart, practice these precautions while in the area, and monitor their health closely during and after their travel.

CDC continues to recommend that all U.S. travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including MERS, by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. If travelers to the region have onset of fever with cough or shortness of breath during their trip or within 14 days of returning to the United States, they should seek medical care. They should call ahead to their health-care provider and mention their recent travel so that appropriate isolation measures can be taken in the health-care setting.

More detailed travel recommendations related to MERS are available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/coronavirus-arabian-peninsula-uk. In addition to the Travelers' Health website, CDC is using partner distribution lists, e-mail subscription channels, social media, and airport messages to alert U.S. travelers and clinicians about precautions for MERS.

[The above MMWR article is a good review of the state of knowledge of MERS-CoV to date. The numbers of reported confirmed cases and deaths vary from source to source (WHO, FluTrackers, this moderator) so that it is unclear what the actual global count is. This moderator highly recommends viewing the Figures mentioned in the report at the source URL. It is notable that 21 percent of the confirmed cases were in asymptomatic individuals (presumably identified through contact tracing of other clinically symptomatic MERS-CoV cases). Figures that are not readily available include the number (and proportion) of confirmed cases in healthcare workers. One suspects this number and proportion may be increasing, especially observing the age distribution of recently reported cases and the fact that both of the USA imported cases, and the cluster of cases in the UAE, were in healthcare workers.

The economic impact of this outbreak continues to grow within the Arabian Peninsula in terms of cost of patient management, contact tracing, and loss of revenues from decreased travel to the region. Outside of the region, costs are incurred through contact tracing of each imported case and loss of person-power in the healthcare environment when healthcare workers are put on home isolation for the incubation period following unprotected exposure to cases. The descriptions of the efforts in each of the involved countries highlight these as yet uncalculated costs. - Mod.MPP]

[5] MERS-CoV NOT PHEIC - WHO statement
Date: 14 May 2014

WHO statement on the 5th Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV - 14 May 2014
-------------------------------
The 5th meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) concerning Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was held by teleconference on Tue 13 May 2014 from 12:07 to 17:12 Geneva time (CEST).

In addition to Members of the Emergency Committee, 3 expert advisors participated in the informational session only (1). These advisors did not participate in the formulation of advice to the Director-General.

13 affected States Parties reporting cases of MERS-CoV or evidence of infection since December 2013 were also on the 1st part of the teleconference: Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, and Yemen.

The WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of epidemiological and scientific developments, including a description of the recent increase in cases in communities and in hospitals, transmission patterns, and the main observations of a WHO mission to Saudi Arabia, conducted from 28 Apr-5 May 2014.

Affected countries gave information about recent events in their countries, including measures taken and their concerns about the current situation.

The Members of the Committee discussed the information provided. Based on current information, the Committee indicated that the seriousness of the situation had increased in terms of public health impact but that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. As a result of their deliberations, the Committee concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not yet been met.

However, the Committee emphasized that its concern about the situation had significantly increased. Their concerns centred on the recent sharp rise in cases; systemic weaknesses in infection prevention and control, as well as gaps in critical information; and possible exportation of cases to especially vulnerable countries. The Committee strongly urged WHO and Member States to take immediate steps to:

- improve national policies for infection prevention and control, and implement them in health-care facilities in all countries; this is most urgent for affected countries;
- initiate and accelerate critical investigations, including case-control, serological, environmental, and animal studies, to better understand the epidemiology, especially risk factors and assess the effectiveness of control measures;
- support countries that are particularly vulnerable, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, taking into account the regional challenges;
- strengthen case and contact identification and management;
- greatly enhance awareness and effective risk communication concerning MERS-CoV to the general public, health professionals, at-risk groups, and policy makers;
- strengthen intersectoral collaboration and information sharing across ministries and with relevant international organizations, especially with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);
- develop and disseminate advice regarding mass gatherings to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV;
- share information in a timely manner with WHO in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005).

Based on the Committee's advice, and information currently available, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment. She thanked the Committee for its work.

The WHO Secretariat will continue to provide regular updates to the Committee Members and Advisors. In view of the Committee's concerns, the Emergency Committee will be reconvened in June 2014 or earlier if circumstances require.

[6] PHEIC discussion - media report
Date: 14 May 2014
Source: Science Insider [edited]
http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/05/mers-situation-more-serious-not-emergency-yet-who-panel-says


An international committee advising the World Health Organization (WHO) today [14 May 2014] called on countries in the Arabian Peninsula to improve their hospital hygiene and help in carrying out much-needed studies on how the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus spreads. But the panel stopped short of declaring the deadly new disease, which emerged 2 years ago, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

There has been a dramatic rise in reported MERS cases recently, and calling the outbreak a PHEIC would have given WHO the power to issue travel advisories and other recommendations under the International Health Regulations. It would also increase political pressure on the affected countries.

But after a 5-hour telephone conference yesterday [13 May 2014], the panel decided that the criteria for a PHEIC haven't been met, Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general for health security and environment, announced at a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland, today. "They believe the situation had increased in terms of its seriousness and urgency but did not at this point constitute a PHEIC," Fukuda said.

Preben Aavitsland, a Norwegian epidemiologist who helped draft the International Health Regulations, criticizes the decision. "I personally think from the information that is publicly available that the event should be declared a PHEIC," Aavitsland tells ScienceInsider in an e-mail. "MERS is an international concern; it spreads to other countries, and there is a need for an international response." But to David Heymann, a former executive director of communicable diseases at WHO and now head of the Centre on Global Health Security at Chatham House, it seems "a sound decision. We have to trust the international bodies," Heymann says.

The emergency panel was established in July last year [2013], and it has met 4 times before, most recently in December [2013]. After each of those meetings, it expressed concern but concluded it was too soon to call an emergency. The group will be asked to make a new assessment in a couple of weeks, Fukuda said.

In its most recent update, WHO puts the number of MERS infections at 536, including 145 deaths. But that official count lags behind the numbers announced by country governments; Saudi Arabia alone has so far announced 157 deaths. Travelers have also exported the virus to more than a dozen countries where MERS is not endemic. The United States announced a 2nd imported case on Monday [12 May 2014], and the Netherlands reported its 1st today [14 May 2014].

"Suboptimal infection control practices" in hospitals and overcrowding in emergency rooms have contributed to the rise, Fukuda said. The number of infections acquired outside the hospital has also increased, he added; reasons for that were still unclear. But he stressed that there is "no convincing evidence right now for an increase in the transmissibility of this virus," which was one of the main reasons the emergency committee did not declare a PHEIC. The committee evaluated genetic information available from 5 recent infections, 3 in Jeddah, one in Greece, and the 1st U.S. case. "The genetic sequences of these more recent viruses looked very much like the sequences of older viruses," Fukuda said.

Aavitsland says the escalating case numbers could lead some countries to unilaterally introduce restrictions for travelers from the Middle East. "By declaring a PHEIC, WHO could put itself in the driver's seat and give recommendations against such measures, which are very unlikely to be beneficial," Aavitsland writes. "If someone [issues] travel restrictions against Saudi Arabia now, then Oman or Lebanon may not declare if they have new cases tomorrow."

Declaring a PHEIC could also put increased political pressure on Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region to fully confront the crisis. The world is still waiting for critical research, such as a case-control study, to find out how the virus makes its way from the animal reservoir, likely camels to humans, Heymann says. "That is the real issue: The study has not been done to show whether this can be prevented by simple efforts."

But declaring a PHEIC just to facilitate such studies would have been irresponsible, Fukuda says. "I hope the increased sense of urgency pushes aside any barriers," he writes in an e-mail.

People should not interpret the panel's decision to mean everything is under control, says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. "It's not." There is clear evidence that some individuals, called supershedders, have infected a large number of other people on the Arabian Peninsula, Osterholm says. "If that emerges elsewhere, the world will take a very different view on this."

[This moderator is concerned about what may happen in the coming months with the increase in pilgrims to Saudi Arabia if the increased transmission of the MERS-CoV continues in the Arabian Peninsula. In the past 2 months, there has been an increase in imported cases reported, some within the region (Jordan, Egypt) and others outside of the region (Greece, Malaysia, USA and the Netherlands). As the pilgrimage peak seasons are coming up, there will be an increase in travel to and from Saudi Arabia, with individuals returning to their home countries, many of which are resource poor and may not have the ability to identify early importations or implement infection control measures. In addition, not all of these individuals reside in major cities in their home countries, so they will be returning to areas with even lesser infrastructures available to address possible cases. Concerns are that the potential for both community and nosocomial spread in these areas is significant. And remembering the evolution of the SARS outbreak, there was a significant increase in transmission associated with the appearance of "super spreaders."

While full details are not presently available, it appears as though there may have been a "super spreader" (in the UAE last month (April 2014). In addition, there is already evidence to demonstrate that the requested "self exclusion" of high risk individuals has not been successful, as a number of the recent importations were in individuals who should have self excluded. Also, while the genomic studies on the virus have not shown major changes from earlier viruses identified, is there certainty that this rules out the possibility of the virus having made changes that impact on its transmissibility? Until there is sound scientific data on the routes of transmission (especially studying the events of April and May 2014) that confirm there is minimal risk of increased spread outside of the Arabian peninsula, this moderator remains concerned about the upcoming major human migration to and from the Arabian Peninsula.

Please note that the above mentioned concerns re: the PHEIC decision today (14 May 2014) are those of this moderator and do not reflect a consensus of the ProMED editors and moderators. - Mod.MPP]
