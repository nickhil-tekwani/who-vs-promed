[The OIE immediate notification above reports India's 1st (3) LSD outbreaks in cattle, located in the state Odisha (Orissa), of which 2 are in the district Mayurbhanj and one in the district Bhadrak. The morbidity rate in the 3 outbreaks combined was 8.5%; no mortality reported. The event started 12 Aug 2019 and was confirmed on 16 Nov 2019. Reportedly, they started almost simultaneously (12, 17, 20 Aug 2019), which may be indicative of a common source.

Odisha state is administratively divided into 3 main divisions: Northern, Central and Southern. The above 3 outbreaks were located in the Central division (map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha#/media/File:Orissa_State_map.svg).

Media reports from India, starting in August 2019, addressed numerous additional LSD outbreaks. In the Cuttack district, Central division, over 2000 cattle were reportedly affected in August 2019 (20190822.6635505). On 3 Nov 2019, the disease was reported from Ganjam district, which is located in the Southern division; 2356 cases were reported, including 3 mortalities (20191103.6760103).

According to the above OIE report, vaccination against LSD is prohibited in India. Vaccination has become known to be the most effective measure to control LSD. The disease is vector-borne, with a seasonal pattern.

Note the outbreaks in Bangladesh; reportedly, they started on 28 Jul 2019. The route of LSD penetration into India remains to be clarified; introduction of infected animals is one of the routes to be considered. - Mod.AS
