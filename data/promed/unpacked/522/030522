A lethal form of meningitis is growing rapidly in Britain and is poised to
strike scores more victims as the flu outbreak peaks, doctors warned
yesterday.
Meningococcal septicaemia, a form of blood poisoning caused by the same
bacterium as meningitis, is up 21 per cent on a year ago according to
figures obtained by The Independent, and is claiming over 150 new victims
each month.
Septicaemia is the most lethal complication of meningitis and spreads
through the bloodstream. Cases have risen threefold in five years and in
the worst cases the infection causes rapid organ failure and death,
sometimes in hours.
Experts say some of the increase is due to improved testing but consultant
paediatricians are reporting a sharp rise in cases of children with
septicaemia.
Meningitis tends to surge in the weeks after a flu outbreak because more
people have inflamed throats as a result of their illness, providing a
ready route for entry of the bacterium.
Latest flu figures published yesterday show the rate has risen to 203 cases
per 100 000 population, above the normal winter level of 50 to 200 cases
per 100 000.
Cases of [meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia, collectively known as
meningococcal disease, reached their highest levels since the Second World
War in 1998 but are continuing to soar. Provisional figures for 1999 from
the Government's Public Health Laboratory Service show there were 2973
notifications of the disease, up 12 per cent on 1998. Cases of septicaemia
rose to 1828, up by 319 cases (21 per cent) on 1998. In 1994 there were 430
cases of septicaemia.
Specialists in infectious disease say meningitis, which strikes the young
and fit with unnerving speed and ferocity, has changed and become more
virulent. The group C strain of the disease which is more common in older
children and teenagers has been growing since the mid 1990s and has a
higher death rate. Figures for deaths in 1999 are not available but in 1998
the group C strain claimed 210 lives.
A new vaccine against [group C meningococcal disease was introduced on 1
Nov 1999 and it is planned to cover all 14 million of the population aged
up to 18 by the end
of 2000. Cases for this winter are already lower than last although experts
are uncertain whether that is the effect of the vaccine or the natural
cycle of the disease.
The Meningitis Research Foundation said the rise in cases of septicaemia
was the most worrying development. A spokeswoman said: "If you ask any
consultant who treats children in hospital the number of cases referred to
them is hugely increased with a much greater frequency of septicaemia.
There is better reporting but there is also a change in the disease."
Dr Mary Ramsay, consultant at the Public Health laboratory Service said:
"There has been a nastier bug around for the last few years and there is no
doubt there is more meningococcal disease. We keep waiting for it to peak
and go away but it hasn't yet."
Professor Robert Booy, professor of child health at the Royal London
Hospital, said: "We have had more patients with meningitis and septicaemia
referred in the last two weeks than in the previous two months. It is part
of the seasonal surge but flu will have contributed to that."
The UK has the second highest rate of meningococcal disease in the western
world after the Republic of Ireland, but the reasons are not understood.
The total cases in the UK are approximately equal to those in the US, a
country with ten times the population.
The Meningitis Research Foundation, in Thornbury, Bristol, has received a
donation of BPS250 000 from Dyson makers of the vacuum cleaner, to fund
research but is lacking worthwhile proposals from scientists to spend it
on. A spokeswoman said: "We have never received a donation as large as
this. There must be scientists desperate for funding whom we could help."

[Vaccines covering Group C meningococcal disease have been available for
some time. I am unfamiliar with the new vaccine reported in this article
to be available since November, 1999. This problem is not restricted to
the UK, although the incidence may be higher there. The Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices of the US Centers for Disease Control has
reportedly recommended that college students housed in dormitories should
be immunized (1). Adolescent smoking has been cited as a risk factor (2).
