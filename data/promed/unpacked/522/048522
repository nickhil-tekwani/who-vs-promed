SBV in Estonia?
---------------
2 weblogs from sheepfarmers in Estonia have stories and pictures on malformed lambs [http://www.maavillane.ee/?7 and http://lambadkitsed.blogspot.nl/].

It seems SBV has reached Estonia.

Skipping other counties seems highly improbable. All countries between Estonia and Germany could have widespread SBV.

The story mentions cases from other farms, from different regions in Estonia, so SBV seems to be all over Estonia.

[The pictures of malformed lambs, included in the above weblogs, are rather convincing. But since no official or professional confirmations have been provided, the described cases have to remain "suspected."

Since end May 2012, SBV has been declared "endemic" in the EU countries hitherto affected while no reporting on SBV was officially required anymore from newly-infected countries and subsequently not become publicly available. In the absence of publicly, readily available epidemiological information on SBV from official international sources, any efforts to methodically scan media/bloggers, such as the effort commendably exercised by flutrackers, has become essential -- particularly for ex-European ("third") countries, and is much appreciated.

Confirmation on SBV recordings from science-based sources on the current situation in Estonia and in other Baltic territories, as well as on the recently suspected cases in the Czech Republic and Hungary, will enhance transparency and be welcomed. - Mod.AS
