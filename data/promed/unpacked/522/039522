During 2008, Genesee County [Michigan], including the city of Flint,
has been experiencing a significant syphilis outbreak. The number of
reported cases has surpassed 100, representing the largest number of
syphilis cases in the county's history in the last 30 years.

The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), STD [sexually
transmitted disease] Program, has been working closely with Genesee
County officials to intervene in the spread of infection. Efforts to
conduct rapid surveillance and case investigation, along with
targeted screening and education, have resulted in effective
management of newly reported cases. Genesee County has a unique
Communicable Disease Investigation Response Team (C-DIRT), which has
effectively initiated, monitored, and evaluated control efforts.

Recently, 5 cases of congenital syphilis have been identified, and
are being closely managed. This occurs when a woman is infected
during pregnancy and is not adequately treated. As a result, local
officials immediately distributed enhanced CDC [US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention] and MDCH guidelines for syphilis
screening during pregnancy and at delivery.

Although county and state public health officials have seen a
decrease in the number of new case reports, indicating the outbreak
is slowing, efforts still need to be sustained in order to end the
outbreak successfully. It is imperative that medical providers of
Genesee and surrounding counties remain diligent in their efforts to
identify, diagnose, and treat cases of syphilis and that area
residents continue to be screened if they are at risk of infection.

Syphilis in Alberta is no longer confined to high-risk groups such as
sex trade workers and their customers. It now infects teens as young
as 15 and seniors as old as 86, as well as college students, married
couples, and members of Calgary's gay community.

The data comes from an internal 2007 report prepared by Alberta's
former chief medical officer of health, Karen Grimsrud, in which she
warned the province that syphilis had spread into the general population.

The internal Alberta Health documents, obtained by The Edmonton
Journal through Freedom of Information applications, stand in stark
contrast to recent comments by Alberta's Health Minister, Ron
Liepert, who has repeatedly depicted syphilis as a disease primarily
linked to prostitution and transient oilfield workers.

That was how Liepert justified his decision this summer [2008] to
cancel a [CAD] 2-million (USD 1.63 million) province-wide syphilis
awareness campaign, aimed at the general public, in favour of a
narrower campaign aimed at high-risk groups. Although promised for
this fall [2008], the smaller campaign has yet to be launched. It
will involve sending notices to doctor's offices. Only 3 health
regions, Edmonton's Capital Health, Calgary, and Northern Lights, are
running their own syphilis public awareness programs.

The number of reported cases of syphilis province-wide has continued
to grow. In 2006, there were 197 confirmed cases reported. In 2007,
according to Alberta Health, there were 250. Between January and June
2008, there were another 92 confirmed cases. In 2002, by contrast,
there were only 17 cases reported for the whole year. Meanwhile,
between 2005 and 2007, 14 babies in Alberta were born with congenital
syphilis and 5 of them died.

As early as February 2007, Grimsrud was sounding the alarm about the
spread of syphilis into the general population. "Cases have ranged
from the ages of 15 to 81, all sexual preferences and ethnicities
(though aboriginal persons are disproportionately affected) and all
socio-economic statuses, including 2 young college students
considered to have low-risk behaviour," she wrote. In the Capital
Region, she noted, only about 25 per cent of cases could be linked to
the sex trade. "Married people," she added, "represent approximately
20 per cent of cases reported." In Calgary, Grimsrud reported,
syphilis was found primarily among men who had sex with men.

Now, Alberta's syphilis problem appears to be spreading. Last
Thursday [6 Nov 2008], the chief medical officer for the Northwest
Territories [NWT] held a press conference to announce an outbreak
there. In August [2008], the NWT found 6 cases of syphilis, the 1st
reported cases in the territory in at least 5 years. Now, the NWT has
33 reported cases, and health officials believe their outbreak has
yet to peak. "It didn't come from nowhere," said Dr Andre Corriveau,
the Territories' top public health doctor. "We really feel we are
part of the Alberta outbreak." Corriveau said some of the 1st
syphilis patients in his jurisdiction had lived in Alberta. While he
didn't want to alarm people, he did want the get the word out about
the syphilis outbreak as quickly and widely as possible.

[In the USA, as the rate of primary and secondary (infectious)
syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely
because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike in the
rate of infectious syphilis occurred in the late 1980s among
heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was
attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for
drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000,
the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was
2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in
1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate
increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in
cases among men who have sex with men
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm>.

Prior ProMED-mail posts reported an upsurge in syphilis cases in New
York City (Syphilis - USA (NY) 20070814.2650) and Indianapolis
(Syphilis - USA: (IN) 20080826.2668) that centered among gay men. In
New York City, the syphilis outbreak was associated with an increase
in cases among women, who may have been having sex with bisexual men.
Infectious syphilis in women can be followed by an increase in
neonatal syphilis. Although the current news release from Michigan
does not give demographic data for syphilis other than saying 5
neonates were involved, perhaps gay and bisexual men may also have
been involved in this recent resurgence in Michigan, with crossover
into the general population, as has occurred elsewhere in the USA. A
similar situation was reported from Canada this past summer
(<http://www.thestar.com/article/245612>) and again from Canada in
the news release above.
