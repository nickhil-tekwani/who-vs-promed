*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC
site [URL above] for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was
not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to ArboNet
by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.

weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary
cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing county-level wild birds,
sentinel chicken flocks, human cases, veterinary cases, and mosquito
surveillance data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC

Maps for other arthropod-borne viruses in the USA are covered at this site
also, including St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis,
western equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, and Powassan. The URL

[5] Mexico, Central and South America - Request for Information
Date: 5 Oct 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

[There has been a notable increase in WN cases, as well as virus
transmission to sentinel and equine animals and WNV isolation from
mosquitoes in states bordering Mexico, suggesting that WN virus
transmission is probably going on south of the USA. ProMED requests
information on West Nile virus surveillance from Mexico and Central and
South America. Any information from this area similar to that provided in
previous years would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TY]
