The National Agrarian Health Service (Senasa) in Lambayeque reported that
the outbreak of classical swine fever in Morrope district, where some 17
pigs were reported dead, has been controlled.

Felix Bobadilla Morales, Senasa's head of animal health in Lambayeque,
stated that slaughter is recommended if it is detected that the animal
acquired the disease. To this end, owners are followed up upon to ensure
that they are complying with the measures and to prevent the informal
street sale of meat of sick animals.

Bobadilla indicated that the disease affects pigs exclusively. "It presents
with fever, and the animal stops eating. It is an endemic disease in some
departments [equivalent of state or province] in the country." He reported
that over the past 10 days, they have been working to determine how many
farmers in Morrope district have been affected by the death of their
animals. "The zone is controlled, and we are carrying out vaccination and
re-vaccination of the animals," he added. Bobadilla emphasized that control
and prevention measures are being strengthened through the vaccination and
re-vaccination of pigs as well as through educational campaigns to prevent
panic, and control measures regarding the movement of animals.

Finally, he urged the public to not be alarmed by this disease, which is
reported sporadically in some endemic locations in the country, and to
redouble their efforts and attention to the hygiene with which animals are
reared.

[Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious and economically
significant viral disease of pigs. The severity of this disease varies with
the strain of the virus, the age of the pig, and the immune status of the
herd. Acute infections, which are caused by highly virulent isolates and
have a high mortality rate, are likely to be diagnosed rapidly. However,
infections with less virulent isolates can be more difficult to recognize,
particularly in older pigs. These infections may be relatively mild and can
resemble septicemias caused by other agents, as well as other diseases. In
some herds, the only symptom may be poor reproductive performance or the
failure of some pigs to thrive. The wide range of clinical signs and
similarity to other diseases can make classical swine fever challenging to
diagnose.

Classical swine fever (hog cholera) results from infection by classical
swine fever virus (CSFV), a member of the genus _Pestivirus_ and family
_Flaviviridae_. Only one CSFV serotype has been found, but minor antigenic
variability has been demonstrated between viral strains. This virus is
closely related to the ruminant pestiviruses that cause bovine virus
diarrhea and border disease. Other pestiviruses have also been described
recently.

The incubation period can range from 2 to 15 days, depending on the
virulence of the strain, the route of inoculation, and the dose. Under
field conditions, disease may not become evident in a herd for 2 to 4 weeks
or longer.

CSFV can survive for several months in refrigerated meat and years in
frozen meat. In this proteinaceous environment, the virus is not
inactivated by smoking or salt curing. However, it can be destroyed by
cooking. Techniques reported to be effective include heating the meat to
65.5 C (150 F) or greater for 30 minutes, or 71 C (160 F) for one minute.
The virus can also be inactivated in swill by heat treatment. Many
countries have completely banned the practice of feeding swill to pigs.
