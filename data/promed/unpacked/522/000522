Slovenia: Three Soldiers Admitted to Hospital with Hantavirus Infection
---------------------------------------------------------------
Two soldiers with symptoms of hantavirus infection have been
admitted to Maribor hospital. Another soldier with the same symptoms is
currently undergoing treatment in Brezice hospital, where he was admitted
during May Day festivities. The measures necessary to establish the source
of the virus are already in place in the Ptuj and Maribor barracks
[northeastern Slovenia, close to the border with Croatia].
According to experts for infectious diseases, this is a virus which can be
transmitted to humans from infected rodents, and people spending a lot of
time outdoors stand a greater chance of contracting it. The virus causes
liver damage which may lead to liver failure. The disease can be fatal in
about 3 per cent of the cases.

[Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses. Unlike all other viruses in the
Family _Bunyaviridae_ hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropod vectors
but predominantly by inhalation of virus-contaminated aerosols of rodent
excreta. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) comprises a group of
clinically similar illnesses that occur throughout the Eurasian landmass,
which are associated with several distinct hantaviruses present in different
rodent reservoir hosts. It is presumed that the 3 soldiers are victims of
HFRS. The hantavirus species _Dobrava-Belgrade virus_ (i.e. member of the
genus _Hantavirus_) is present in the Balkans and is the probable
etiological agent in this outbreak among military personnel in Slovenia. The
principal reservoir host of this virus is the yellow-neck mouse _Apodemus
flavicollis_. - Mod.CP]
[Invited comment:
HFRS in soldiers in this area may be the results of close contact with
rodent burrows. Dobrava-Belgrade virus is not the only recognized hantavirus
in that part of the world. There is also Puumala virus, which usually
causes a milder form of HFRS with a lower case-fatality rate. As the report
does not mention the severity of the soldiers' illnesses, one cannot guess
as to which is the etiologic agent. However, D-B virus is more than likely.
We would appreciate more information from local authorities. - Mod.Emeritus
