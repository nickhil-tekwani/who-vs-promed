The report of skin lesions, conjunctival swelling, and headaches in the affected fishermen could be caused by exposure to _Pfiesteria_ toxin. _Pfiesteria_ is a genus of heterotrophic dinoflagellates that has been associated with harmful algal blooms and fish kills. _Pfiesteria_ has a worldwide distribution.

_Pfiesteria_-human illness syndrome is characterized by skin lesions, headache, myalgias, conjunctival irritation, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, secretory diarrhea, recent memory loss, and difficulties with number sequencing.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Valerie Shearn-Bochsler for submitting this interesting comment.

Since _Pfiesteria_ is a marine organism, and its toxins can be found in water, that could account for fishermen being affected but never with any mention of people developing illness other than the fishermen. The symptoms mentioned in the previous reports were skin lesions (non-generalized vesicular rash), swelling of the face, dry lips, redness of the eyes, headaches, and slightly elevated fever.

If ProMED-mail has any dermatologists amongst the readership, it would be of interest if they would comment on the similarity or dissimilarity of the skin lesions in the photograph of the original report (see: https://www.afrik.com/senegal-maladie-des-pecheurs-a-thiaroye-le-mystere-perce) and those from _Pfiesteria_ toxin. - Mod.TY
