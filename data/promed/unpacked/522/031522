In the 1st 7 months of the year [2007] Brazil registered a total of 438 949
dengue cases, 45 per cent more than in the same period in 2006 (302 461
[dengue cases]), the Ministry of Health announced today [9 Sep 2007].
The number of deaths caused by this disease rose from 77 in the 1st 7
months of 2006 to 98 between January and July of this year [2007].
The numbers up to July indicate that Brazil could register in 2007 the
greatest numbers of [dengue] cases and deaths in the country's history.
This [projection] is due [to the fact that] last year [2006] 345 922
[dengue] cases with 67 deaths were registered; these numbers have already
been surpassed this year [2007] and are lower only than those of 2002, when
the country suffered a serious epidemiological crisis from this disease,
with 794 000 registered [dengue] cases and 150 deaths.
The secretary of Health Surveillance of the Ministry, Gerson Penna,
indicated that the [dengue] cases this year [2007] are focal, and that [the
disease's] expansion is limited to 3 states.
Almost one third of the cases registered between January and July [2007]
were concentrated in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul (along the border
with Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which also suffered a serious [dengue]
epidemic this year [2007]), Parana, and Rio de Janeiro.
72 183 cases have been registered in Mato Grosso do Sul, 46 857 in Rio de
Janeiro, and 43 691 in Parana. Penna indicated that, "in these 3 states the
rains came before what was anticipated [normal] and lasted longer than the
usual time. This multiplied the number of [breeding sites] of the vector
mosquito."
In addition, dengue cases in Brazil are concentrated between the months of
January and May, during the southern hemisphere summer, when rains are more
frequent.

Haemorrhagic dengue cases have increased 20-fold in Honduras this year
[2007], compared with 2006, admitted the country's health authorities on
Wednesday [12 Sep 2007].
The Health Ministry reported 895 cases of this most deadly variant of
dengue [DHF] just between January and August [2007], with only 46 cases
last year [2006].
Honduras health minister, Jenny Meza, recognized that her country appears
among the Central American nations with the highest rate of hemorrhagic
dengue, which has thus far killed 10 people.
Data also reveals that 18 000 Hondurans [this year (2007) have] suffered
classic dengue, about 5 times more than in 2006.
Meza highlighted the government efforts to raise the people's consciousness
of the danger and of the measures to avoid its propagation.

Costa Rican authorities confirmed on Saturday [15 Sep 2007] that
hemorrhagic dengue has become an epidemic in the country, killing 2
children and affecting 180 people.
The Health Ministry reported that the number [of dengue cases] is 150 per
cent greater than the one reported in 2006, when 72 people were infected
and 1533 per cent higher than in 2004, with 11 cases only.
The 2 children died because of the fatal dengue hemorrhagic variant
transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, confirmed health minister
Maria Luisa Avila on Saturday [15 Sep 2007].
Nevertheless, the ministry [is] investigating 9 other suspicious deaths of
dengue, most of them young adults.

Health officials in Martinique have declared a dengue epidemic after more
than 1000 suspected cases were reported in the last month [August 2007].
Since August, about 1300 people have been treated for symptoms and 40 of
them have been hospitalized, some for hemorrhaging, according to a
statement released by Martinique's health department. No deaths have been
reported, according to local media.
Heavy rains contributed to an increase in cases, according to government
officials, who urged residents to properly discard of garbage including
tires, coconuts, and old refrigerators.
Fumigation efforts were ordered in the northern and southern parts of the
island, which have been the most affected. Roughly 430 000 people live in
Martinique, a French overseas department.

Puerto Rico is experiencing a dengue epidemic, which has caused 913
confirmed cases since January [2007]. The government will have access to
emergency funds to intensify fumigation against the mosquito vector.
"We are in a dengue epidemic and it is important that everyone knows that,
not to be alarmed, but to be concerned," the epidemiologist of the
commonwealth, Enid Garcia Rivera said on Friday [14 Sep 2007].
The official announced that the Health Department reinforced its plans to
control the epidemic, which since January [2007], has caused 3651 suspected
cases of the disease, of which about 25 per cent, (913 cases), have been
laboratory confirmed positives [for dengue virus infection].
Due to the increasing numbers of suspected cases, the Health Department
will have access to USD 2.9 million from an emergency fund of USD 5
million. These funds will be used to intensify fumigation and other
preventive strategies to avoid the continued increase of the epidemic.
Garcia Rivera explained that the epidemic surveillance system always uses
the initial suspected case statistics because the [laboratory] tests to
confirm dengue virus [infection] takes 2 weeks, which would delay
activation of the [control] system too much. "Using suspected case
[numbers] can provide a good estimation of what is occurring in the
population," explained Garcia Rivera.
The Health Department noted an increase in the number of dengue cases
during the last 2 weeks of June [2007], and in July, declared that there
was an epidemic.

[It would be of interest to know which dengue virus type is circulating in
the Caribbean islands currently. Perhaps the US CDC Laboratory in Puerto
Rico can provide that information.

On Monday [10 Sep 2007], 11 new cases of dengue were reported, 4 more than
Sunday [9 Sep 2007]. Of these new cases, 3 are from Bukit Batok -- one each
at Bukit Batok Central, Bukit Batok Street 11, and Street 34. This brings
the total number of cases from Bukit Batok so far this year [2007] to 114.
According to the National Environment Agency (NEA), the area continues to
be the number one hotspot, with the highest number of infections reported
in Bukit Batok Streets 31, 32, and 34. An NEA spokesperson said the recent
intermittent heavy rain may not help ease the situation much as most
breeding grounds have been found to be indoors.
Hong Kah Town Council, which oversees the common areas in Bukit Batok, said
it is continuing with its stepped up efforts to ensure that the affected
places do not remain a hotspot. These include increasing the frequency of
inspections at potential breeding grounds around the estate, and deploying
staff from other estates to help out.

The [Cebu] City Health Department will recommend that 2 southern barangays
[districts] in Cebu City be placed under a state of calamity after dengue
claimed the lives of 7 children in less than 2 months.
City health officer Fe Cabugao will endorse to the City Council to declare
Bulacao and Pardo in a state of calamity due to dengue outbreak in the 2
villages, said Dr Raymond Ogan, Cebu City coordinator on dengue control.
"This is the request of the barangay officials in Pardo and Bulacao so they
can avail [themselves] of the emergency funds and use these to clean the
areas and help the victims," said Ogan.
The health department recorded deaths of 3 children aged 5 years in sitio
Tabacunal, barangay Pardo -- one in August [2007], one on 5 Sep [2007], and
the 3rd the next day [6 Sep 2007], and 4 children also died of dengue in
sitios Villabulsita and Charlieville in Bulacao.
Ogan said health officials were also alarmed by the 13 to 15 new cases each
in Pardo and Bulacao, which health personnel were monitoring.
Pardo's dengue cases from January to 10 Sep this year [2007] reached 33 and
34 in Bulacao.
A total of 697 dengue cases with 18 deaths were reported in Cebu City over
the same period. The figure was 10 per cent higher than the 528 dengue
cases with 15 deaths reported from January to 10 Sep last year [2006].
