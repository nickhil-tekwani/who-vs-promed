Epidemic of Malaria in Region of Bajo Aguan
-------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities have reported more than 7000 cases of malaria in the
region of Bajo Aguan alone, a number that represents 50% of the total
cases for the country and makes the situation an alarming one given the
drastic increase in incidence, stated Henry Andrade, Director of
Population Risks.
Central authorities of the Health Ministry and 27 mayors of the
Atlantida, Colon, and Yoro states will convene on Thursday to address
the situation. The problem has reached alarming proportions in these
states, particularly in Colon and Olanchito, where cases of malaria are
appearing indiscriminately.
According to the official, the greatest danger lies in the increase of
cases of the type of _Plasmodium falciparum_ that causes cerebral
malaria, a well-known complication of the infection, which affects
children and non-immune individuals, and is characterized by high
mortality.
Andrade stated that health authorities are aiming to define strategies for
vector control and the manner in which the disease will be handled.
The Director of Population Risks added that the problem not only
concerns the Health Department, but consideration must be given to the
fact that in the region of Bajo Aguan there are African oil palm and
banana tree plantations, among other crops that favor the infection. The
official emphasized that this region has the greatest number of cases in
the country; that the number of cases has been increasing year after
year; and that at the national level a serious change in the epidemio-
logical pattern of the disease, which now has greater frequency of
association with the cerebral complication, has been registered.

[According to PAHO, Honduras reported 46 740 cases of malaria in
1999, of which 1220 were _P. falciparum_. There is therefore the
possibility of an emergence of _P. falciparum_ infections if control
activities fail and environmental factors change in favor of increased
mosquito breeding. - Mod.EP]
