The incidence of dengue fever in the country dropped drastically by 62.3%
[63.7%, from 27,381 cases in 1998 to 9,947 last year, after 10 years of
escalating numbers. The Health Ministry attributed the drop mainly to the
success of its year-long nationwide Anti-Mosquito and Cleanliness Campaign,
which was launched on April 20 last year.
Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the [number of cases of dengue fever had
consistently risen annually since 1994 from 3,133 cases and 13 deaths that
year to 27,318 [27,381? cases and 58 deaths in 1998. Last year, the number
of deaths dropped to 27 he said. As a result of the positive impact of the
campaign, Chua said, the Cabinet had decided to continue with the campaign,
which is necessary "because the public's apathy towards cleanliness in
their residential area is the cause of the spread of vector diseases".
Chua said the drop in dengue fever cases should not lead to complacency,
adding that the second phase of the campaign would intensify efforts to
educate people and involve more checks on areas identified as breeding
grounds for _Aedes_ mosquitoes. He said checks conducted during the initial
campaign identified rubbish dumpsites as the biggest problem area, followed
by factory sites, construction sites, vacant land, cemeteries, recreation
parks, houses and shops. "The agencies and parties responsible for these
areas are required to take immediate action to overcome this problem."
Chua said the dengue virus [see comment below, if left unchecked, would
pose a big health problem to the country. "Dengue fever has become a global
prevalence with a drastic increase in cases since the last decade,
particularly with industrial development," he said.
Chua said all states except Sabah showed a reduction in cases last year.
The states which showed the most significant reduction of cases were the
Federal Territory (82%), Terengganu (79%), Pahang (72.2%), Ngeri Sembilan
(71.2%) and Kedah (62.3%).
He also said the reduction could be because people, especially those in the
rural areas, had developed an immunity against the dengue strain [see
comment below.

[It is impossible that a reduced number of infections is due to "immunity
against the dengue strain" because there are four distinct viruses that
cause dengue fever; dengue 1, dengue 2, dengue 3, and dengue 4. It would
have been better had they been given names and not numbered but what's done
is done. The apparent reduction in the numbers of cases may be due to
reduced numbers of cases or to reduced reporting last year, particularly in
the face of the frightening Nipah epidemic and other infectious disease
problems in Malaysia.
Rather than decrease the number of dengue infections, what herd immunity
might do is prime the pump for dengue hemorrhagic fever. Still, DHF is not
an illness that often is overlooked, so it may be that fewer cases have
occurred. Official reports are needed and welcome. - Mod. CHC
